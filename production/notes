Changes made:
- Evening Standard: lines 73, 76, 79, 87 and 126, also no more filtering of headlines (lines 64, 65)
- Independent: updated div class line 62, added filter in line 73ff
- scrape_and_recommend: lines 119 (entertainment&arts category), 137 (world)
- Guardian: I think the max the API allows is 200 not 100 - or am I wrong here?
- BBC: lines 55 and 56 - ignore twitter content; line 88 to whitelist The BBC

Special charachters to work on (also for headlines and teasers):
- Evening Standard: ‘,£
- Independent: –, £, é (in Pokémon)
- BBC: ‘,’ (only saw this in twitter content but still)
- Sky news: … (they have differently formatted dots in subsequent paragraphs - madness), £ in header turns to &#163;
