Pic: Ken McKay/Talkback Thames/Shutterstock\n        \n\n\n\nThe hearing was called after Schofield, 61, resigned from ITV and admitted to the \"unwise but not illegal\" affair which started when Person X was 20. The presenter was subsequently dropped by his talent agency, YMU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn told MPs that the \"imbalance of power, the imbalance of dynamics\" made the relationship \"deeply inappropriate\".ITV bosses deny NDAs and gagging ordersThe hearing was told the matter was looked into at around the time when Schofield came out as gay on This Morning in February 2020, supported by his then co-presenter Holly Willoughby.Read more:Phillip Schofield: Timeline of ITV departureKey extracts from ITV chief executive's letter on Schofield departureDame Carolyn confirmed Schofield has been \"receiving counselling\" since his exit from the show and that she is \"very concerned\" about his welfare.She also confirmed there is \"no gagging order or NDA\" to stop Person X from speaking out about the situation, and denied he was given a \"pay-off\" when he left ITV.

MPs heard he applied for work experience and listed Schofield as a family friend, but this was not that unusual and the application did not ring \"alarm bells\".Person X carried out work experience at This Morning for about two weeks when he was 19, and \"impressed people\" before he was later offered a longer-term fixed contract, the politicians were told. \n\n\nITV boss is no stranger to drama - but is she aware of everything happening behind the scenes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Spencer\n\nArts and entertainment correspondent\n@SkyKatieSpencer\n\n\n\nBeing the big boss Dame Carolyn McCall has had to steer ITV through a sizeable chunk of off-screen drama - from Piers Morgan quitting and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host Jeremy Clarkson's controversial columns, to the axing of Jeremy Kyle and Love Island's post-show care.\nShe is no stranger to helping the channel ride out the headlines, and - subject to more than two hours of questioning from MPs - she claimed she welcomed the opportunity to \"set out some of the facts\" of what's been happening at ITV.\nShe has needed to. ITV bosses tried persistently, she claimed, to find out what was going on between former This Morning star Phillip Schofield and a young runner.\nThe broadcaster's argument about why no action was taken effectively boiled down to: how can you properly investigate with no concrete evidence?\nSchofield's fragile mental state surrounding his coming out as gay was also cited as a reason they felt they had to tread carefully. There was a focus on welfare, which is no doubt a key concern, and particularly in recent years after the death of Love Island presenter Caroline Flack.\nAccusations that the runner in question had been made to sign a non-disclosure agreement were dismissed, while a \"pay-off\" that has been speculated about was explained as a standard redundancy payment after the COVID pandemic.\nIs there a toxic working environment at This Morning? The bosses insisted no, and presented a rosy picture of how staff, when surveyed, gave glowing assessments of their employer. Whistleblowing numbers were widely displayed in staff toilets, they said, and in lifts, and every effort is made to make sure staff feel comfortable enough to express their concerns.\nProfessional boundaries were crossed, the power balance was \"inappropriate\",  Dame Carolyn admitted.\nBut her shocked reaction to claims brought up that viewers, on occasion, were referred to as \"Tower Block Traceys\" in production meetings was indicative of the fact that while she is across policy on a corporate level, management are unlikely to be aware of what's being said further down the food chain.\nClearly, there is a disconnect there.\n\n\nIs there a 'toxic' culture at This Morning?Later in the session, MPs asked about allegations of a toxic culture at This Morning, and Dame Carolyn described these as \"deeply\" disappointing.She confirmed the show has received two complaints about bullying or harassment in five years, and said these were \"both taken very seriously\". One of these was from the show's former resident doctor Dr Ranj Singh, who raised concerns about \"bullying and discrimination\" and afterwards said he felt like he was \"managed out\" for whistleblowing.\"It deeply disappoints me but we do not recognise that at This Morning, we have tangible evidence to tell you where the vast majority of people at daytime at This Morning are extremely engaged and very motivated,\" Dame Carolyn said.Read more:Holly Willoughby's full statement in This Morning returnAlison Hammond breaks down on This MorningSchofield apologises over affair - and says he has 'lost everything' \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP John Nicholson told the panel he had received many messages from employees past and present at ITV talking about the bullying culture at the broadcaster, with one describing daytime TV as \"particularly toxic\".Dame Carolyn replied: \"They're very disappointing to hear. Deeply distressing. I've said we've had two official complaints, both of them investigated - it does not fill me with anything but sorrow.\"She also described comments from This Morning editor Martin Frizell as \"foolish\", after he referred to aubergines when asked by Sky News about allegations of a \"toxic\" work environment on the programme. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Morning boss: 'Do you like aubergine?' \n\n\n\n\"I think Martin has made a mistake, I think he knows he made a mistake, I don't think he intended to say that. It was a foolish comment; an ill-advised comment, I absolutely agree,\" she said.An independent review into the facts by a barrister, commissioned by ITV, was also discussed during the hearing, with Dame Carolyn saying: \"There will be things to learn.\"The barrister will review complaints made since 1 January 2016, and consider whether steps taken to deal with them were \"appropriate and adequate\".The review is expected to be completed by the end of September. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nThe session ended with chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage saying the committee wants to be confident that \"ITV isn't letting star power and favouritism damage the lives or careers of those working there\".Dame Carolyn responded by saying that ITV takes \"every allegation about our culture seriously, but I think it would be very wrong to depict ITV as having an issue\".\n"}, {"_id": "648a1ed351ac332f7f4f53de", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/nadine-dorries-insists-its-still-my-intention-to-resign-after-being-accused-of-dragging-out-process-12902592", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nadine Dorries 'still intends to resign' after being accused of 'dragging out' process", "lead": "Nadine Dorries has said she will not formally resign until after she gets answers from Downing Street about why she did not get her peerage.", "author": "\nFaye Brown\n", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 22:10:59.419807", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-nadine-dorries-honours-list_6182400.jpg?20230609103232", "body": "\nNadine Dorries has said she will not formally resign until after she gets answers from Downing Street about why she did not get her peerage.\nIn a Twitter thread, the former culture secretary responded to the \"speculation\" as to why she is yet to formally quit the Commons, after announcing her intention to do so on Friday.\n\n\n\nShe insisted it is \"absolutely my intention to resign\" following suggestions she is dragging out the process to cause political pain for Rishi Sunak.

Pic: Ken McKay/Talkback Thames/Shutterstock\n        \n\n\n\nThe hearing was called after Schofield, 61, resigned from ITV and admitted to the \"unwise but not illegal\" affair which started when Person X was 20. The presenter was subsequently dropped by his talent agency, YMU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn told MPs that the \"imbalance of power, the imbalance of dynamics\" made the relationship \"deeply inappropriate\".ITV bosses deny NDAs and gagging ordersThe hearing was told the matter was looked into at around the time when Schofield came out as gay on This Morning in February 2020, supported by his then co-presenter Holly Willoughby.Read more:Phillip Schofield: Timeline of ITV departureKey extracts from ITV chief executive's letter on Schofield departureDame Carolyn confirmed Schofield has been \"receiving counselling\" since his exit from the show and that she is \"very concerned\" about his welfare.She also confirmed there is \"no gagging order or NDA\" to stop Person X from speaking out about the situation, and denied he was given a \"pay-off\" when he left ITV.

MPs heard he applied for work experience and listed Schofield as a family friend, but this was not that unusual and the application did not ring \"alarm bells\".Person X carried out work experience at This Morning for about two weeks when he was 19, and \"impressed people\" before he was later offered a longer-term fixed contract, the politicians were told. \n\n\nITV boss is no stranger to drama - but is she aware of everything happening behind the scenes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Spencer\n\nArts and entertainment correspondent\n@SkyKatieSpencer\n\n\n\nBeing the big boss Dame Carolyn McCall has had to steer ITV through a sizeable chunk of off-screen drama - from Piers Morgan quitting and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host Jeremy Clarkson's controversial columns, to the axing of Jeremy Kyle and Love Island's post-show care.\nShe is no stranger to helping the channel ride out the headlines, and - subject to more than two hours of questioning from MPs - she claimed she welcomed the opportunity to \"set out some of the facts\" of what's been happening at ITV.\nShe has needed to. ITV bosses tried persistently, she claimed, to find out what was going on between former This Morning star Phillip Schofield and a young runner.\nThe broadcaster's argument about why no action was taken effectively boiled down to: how can you properly investigate with no concrete evidence?\nSchofield's fragile mental state surrounding his coming out as gay was also cited as a reason they felt they had to tread carefully. There was a focus on welfare, which is no doubt a key concern, and particularly in recent years after the death of Love Island presenter Caroline Flack.\nAccusations that the runner in question had been made to sign a non-disclosure agreement were dismissed, while a \"pay-off\" that has been speculated about was explained as a standard redundancy payment after the COVID pandemic.\nIs there a toxic working environment at This Morning? The bosses insisted no, and presented a rosy picture of how staff, when surveyed, gave glowing assessments of their employer. Whistleblowing numbers were widely displayed in staff toilets, they said, and in lifts, and every effort is made to make sure staff feel comfortable enough to express their concerns.\nProfessional boundaries were crossed, the power balance was \"inappropriate\",  Dame Carolyn admitted.\nBut her shocked reaction to claims brought up that viewers, on occasion, were referred to as \"Tower Block Traceys\" in production meetings was indicative of the fact that while she is across policy on a corporate level, management are unlikely to be aware of what's being said further down the food chain.\nClearly, there is a disconnect there.\n\n\nIs there a 'toxic' culture at This Morning?Later in the session, MPs asked about allegations of a toxic culture at This Morning, and Dame Carolyn described these as \"deeply\" disappointing.She confirmed the show has received two complaints about bullying or harassment in five years, and said these were \"both taken very seriously\". One of these was from the show's former resident doctor Dr Ranj Singh, who raised concerns about \"bullying and discrimination\" and afterwards said he felt like he was \"managed out\" for whistleblowing.\"It deeply disappoints me but we do not recognise that at This Morning, we have tangible evidence to tell you where the vast majority of people at daytime at This Morning are extremely engaged and very motivated,\" Dame Carolyn said.Read more:Holly Willoughby's full statement in This Morning returnAlison Hammond breaks down on This MorningSchofield apologises over affair - and says he has 'lost everything' \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP John Nicholson told the panel he had received many messages from employees past and present at ITV talking about the bullying culture at the broadcaster, with one describing daytime TV as \"particularly toxic\".Dame Carolyn replied: \"They're very disappointing to hear. Deeply distressing. I've said we've had two official complaints, both of them investigated - it does not fill me with anything but sorrow.\"She also described comments from This Morning editor Martin Frizell as \"foolish\", after he referred to aubergines when asked by Sky News about allegations of a \"toxic\" work environment on the programme. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Morning boss: 'Do you like aubergine?' \n\n\n\n\"I think Martin has made a mistake, I think he knows he made a mistake, I don't think he intended to say that.

or deliberately by denying the rule-breaking parties in Number 10.The former Conservative leader's resignation means he will not serve the lengthy suspension likely to be recommended, but Mr Johnson

He didn't offer voters a boring programme of policies, he offered something far more mercurial - himself.\nUsing his skill as an orator and his media power he created a cult of personality and became an electoral juggernaut.\nOften embroiled in legal battles he railed against elites, portraying himself as an outsider and a victim.\nIn death though - afforded a state funeral and a national day of mourning - he has cemented his place, for better or worse, as a towering figure of the political establishment.\nCertainly he was one of the biggest political figures since Benito Mussolini.\n\n\nThey were joined by former England manager, Fabio Capello; the president of Lazio, Claudio Lotito; and Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis.The outpouring of grief comes as Italians remain split over whether Mr Berlusconi's influence was for the better or worse - and whether he deserved a state funeral.Read more:Many loved him, many hated him - reaction to scandal-hit premier's deathWhat happened when Berlusconi invited the media to the 'bunga bunga'Berlusconi leaves long-term girlfriend for woman 53 years younger \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMr Berlusconi's partner Marta Fascina in February 2022.

They are also promising that data speeds will increase, on average, by up to six-fold by 2034.Those are attractive propositions for a government desperate to boost the UK's lacklustre record on productivity through initiatives like 5G.Yet note also the emphasis on jobs.The pair predicted that the kind of infrastructure investment they are promising \"would be expected to support between 8,000 and 12,000 new jobs in the wider economy\".That point on jobs is particularly important because the unions are already raising concerns about the job losses that may result from a deal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion concernsUnite on Wednesday described the proposed tie-up as a \"reckless merger\" that would \"mean job losses for Vodafone and Three workers\".The union also flagged concerns about a possible hike in bills as a result of the deal - although the pair insist that is less of an issue.They argue that the combined entity will \"be better able to compete for all customers driving further network, retail mobile and fixed broadband competition in the UK, including the ability to make converged offers in competition with the two largest operators BT EE and Virgin Media O2\".Vodafone and Three UK also make the point that this is not just about retail pricing.More competition?They suggest their tie-up would create more competition in the wholesale market and provide better choice for the so-called MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) - those players like Tesco Mobile, Sky Mobile and iD Mobile (part of Carphone Warehouse) which do not own their own mobile networks but piggyback on networks owned by the likes of EE, Vodafone or O2.They pointed out that, at present nine in 10 MVNOs are currently either on the EE or O2 networks. Tesco Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sky Mobile, for example, all use O2's network.These are all points that will have to be weighed up by the Competition & Markets Authority in an investigation widely expected in the industry to drag on for between 12 and 18 months.The CMA blocked a proposed takeover by Three UK of O2 in 2016 on competition grounds, a deal which eventually drove O2 into the arms of Virgin Media, but Vodafone and Three UK will be hoping the regulator accepts that the UK mobile market has changed sufficiently since then.They will be taking hope from the fact that, early last year, Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, indicated it was less concerned by a consolidation in the market per se than it was about competition in that market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Johnson era law to call in acquisitions that may pose a national security threatHowever, the competition landscape has also changed in other ways since 2016, not least the new National Security and Investment Act.This was passed by the Johnson government in 2021 with the specific aim of enabling ministers to \"call in\" mergers and acquisitions that they believe may pose a threat to national security. Vodafone and Three UK acknowledged on Wednesday that their proposed deal would need to win ministerial approval under the act.And, to judge by Unite's comments, the union is hoping this may be one area in which the deal falls down.Gail Cartmail, executive head of operations for Unite, said: \"This deal will give a company with deep ties to the Chinese state an even more prominent place at the heart of the UK's telecommunications infrastructure.\"Vodafone and Three UK are likely to argue, in response, that Three UK already has a prominent role in the UK mobile market and has not to date posed any kind of threat to the country. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo that end, this deal will be an interesting test of the extent to which the new act - brought in partly to emulate the tough approach the United States takes towards foreign takeovers of its companies - is capable of gumming up M&A activity.This deal, should it be waved through, would be a huge and lasting reshaping of the UK telecoms market.Getting it past the regulators will be a hugely costly and time-consuming issue for both Vodafone and CK Hutchison.It tells you a lot about how poorly they regard prospects for their two UK businesses, on a standalone basis, that they are prepared to go through with such hassle.\n"}, {"_id": "648a1edb51ac332f7f4f53ff", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/phillip-schofield-itv-boss-denies-turning-blind-eye-to-former-this-morning-presenters-deeply-inappropriate-affair-12902306", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "ITV boss denies turning 'blind eye' to Phillip Schofield's 'deeply inappropriate' affair", "lead": "ITV bosses have denied turning \"a blind eye\" to Phillip Schofield's \"deeply inappropriate\" affair with a junior colleague, telling MPs they would have taken action had they been presented with evidence and not \"rumours\".", "author": "\nGemma Peplow\n", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 22:11:07.927137", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-phillip-schofield-this-morning_6187205.jpg?20230614131641", "body": "\nITV bosses have denied turning \"a blind eye\" to Phillip Schofield's \"deeply inappropriate\" affair with a junior colleague, telling MPs they would have taken action had they been presented with evidence and not \"rumours\".Dame Carolyn McCall, the broadcaster's chief executive, faced questions on Schofield's departure from This Morning alongside managing director Kevin Lygo and general counsel Kyla Mullins, during a culture, media and sport committee session in parliament.\n\n\n\nThey told the hearing that both Schofield and the younger male colleague, referred to as Person X, \"repeatedly denied\" having a relationship until the presenter's shock admission in May, and pushed back against claims it was an \"open secret\" - as made by people including former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan.ITV bosses questioned by MPs - as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn said bosses \"were repeatedly told nothing was happening\", and both men denied it \"both formally and informally\", with Person X being questioned on 12 occasions over a period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was only hearsay and rumour and speculation,\" ITV's chief executive said. \"Nobody on the board would have turned a blind eye to something as serious as this.\"If evidence had emerged about the relationship, bosses \"would have acted very swiftly\", she said.During the session, the ITV bosses also responded to allegations of a \"toxic\" environment on ITV's daytime shows, and faced questions about other issues such as the suicides of Love Island contestants and presenter Caroline Flack, and allegations about \"abuse\" and \"bullying\" on The X Factor. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSinger Rebecca Ferguson recently hit out over allegations of 'abuse' on The X Factor.

The presenter was subsequently dropped by his talent agency, YMU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn told MPs that the \"imbalance of power, the imbalance of dynamics\" made the relationship \"deeply inappropriate\".ITV bosses deny NDAs and gagging ordersThe hearing was told the matter was looked into at around the time when Schofield came out as gay on This Morning in February 2020, supported by his then co-presenter Holly Willoughby.Read more:Phillip Schofield: Timeline of ITV departureKey extracts from ITV chief executive's letter on Schofield departureDame Carolyn confirmed Schofield has been \"receiving counselling\" since his exit from the show and that she is \"very concerned\" about his welfare.She also confirmed there is \"no gagging order or NDA\" to stop Person X from speaking out about the situation, and denied he was given a \"pay-off\" when he left ITV.

MPs heard he applied for work experience and listed Schofield as a family friend, but this was not that unusual and the application did not ring \"alarm bells\".Person X carried out work experience at This Morning for about two weeks when he was 19, and \"impressed people\" before he was later offered a longer-term fixed contract, the politicians were told. \n\n\nITV boss is no stranger to drama - but is she aware of everything happening behind the scenes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Spencer\n\nArts and entertainment correspondent\n@SkyKatieSpencer\n\n\n\nBeing the big boss Dame Carolyn McCall has had to steer ITV through a sizeable chunk of off-screen drama - from Piers Morgan quitting and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host Jeremy Clarkson's controversial columns, to the axing of Jeremy Kyle and Love Island's post-show care.\nShe is no stranger to helping the channel ride out the headlines, and - subject to more than two hours of questioning from MPs - she claimed she welcomed the opportunity to \"set out some of the facts\" of what's been happening at ITV.\nShe has needed to. ITV bosses tried persistently, she claimed, to find out what was going on between former This Morning star Phillip Schofield and a young runner.\nThe broadcaster's argument about why no action was taken effectively boiled down to: how can you properly investigate with no concrete evidence?\nSchofield's fragile mental state surrounding his coming out as gay was also cited as a reason they felt they had to tread carefully. There was a focus on welfare, which is no doubt a key concern, and particularly in recent years after the death of Love Island presenter Caroline Flack.\nAccusations that the runner in question had been made to sign a non-disclosure agreement were dismissed, while a \"pay-off\" that has been speculated about was explained as a standard redundancy payment after the COVID pandemic.\nIs there a toxic working environment at This Morning? The bosses insisted no, and presented a rosy picture of how staff, when surveyed, gave glowing assessments of their employer. Whistleblowing numbers were widely displayed in staff toilets, they said, and in lifts, and every effort is made to make sure staff feel comfortable enough to express their concerns.\nProfessional boundaries were crossed, the power balance was \"inappropriate\",  Dame Carolyn admitted.\nBut her shocked reaction to claims brought up that viewers, on occasion, were referred to as \"Tower Block Traceys\" in production meetings was indicative of the fact that while she is across policy on a corporate level, management are unlikely to be aware of what's being said further down the food chain.\nClearly, there is a disconnect there.\n\n\nIs there a 'toxic' culture at This Morning?Later in the session, MPs asked about allegations of a toxic culture at This Morning, and Dame Carolyn described these as \"deeply\" disappointing.She confirmed the show has received two complaints about bullying or harassment in five years, and said these were \"both taken very seriously\". One of these was from the show's former resident doctor Dr Ranj Singh, who raised concerns about \"bullying and discrimination\" and afterwards said he felt like he was \"managed out\" for whistleblowing.\"It deeply disappoints me but we do not recognise that at This Morning, we have tangible evidence to tell you where the vast majority of people at daytime at This Morning are extremely engaged and very motivated,\" Dame Carolyn said.Read more:Holly Willoughby's full statement in This Morning returnAlison Hammond breaks down on This MorningSchofield apologises over affair - and says he has 'lost everything' \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP John Nicholson told the panel he had received many messages from employees past and present at ITV talking about the bullying culture at the broadcaster, with one describing daytime TV as \"particularly toxic\".Dame Carolyn replied: \"They're very disappointing to hear. Deeply distressing. I've said we've had two official complaints, both of them investigated - it does not fill me with anything but sorrow.\"She also described comments from This Morning editor Martin Frizell as \"foolish\", after he referred to aubergines when asked by Sky News about allegations of a \"toxic\" work environment on the programme. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Morning boss: 'Do you like aubergine?' \n\n\n\n\"I think Martin has made a mistake, I think he knows he made a mistake, I don't think he intended to say that.

Nigel Adams are due to be announced today, but it is understood the contest in Ms Dorries's seat of Mid Bedfordshire will happen at a later date.\n\n\n\nMs Dorries announced she was standing down as an MP with \"immediate effect\" after it became clear she had been passed over for a peerage in Mr Johnson's controversial resignation honours list.The former culture secretary had been chosen by Mr Johnson for a peerage, along with Mr Adams and former COP26 president Sir Alok Sharma.But when the list was finally revealed, the three names were absent - prompting a fresh war of words between Mr Johnson and his successor.\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior doctors walk out again in pay dispute - politics latestDowning Street has said it is \"entirely untrue\" that Mr Sunak or members of his Number 10 team removed names from Mr Johnson's honours list following accusations from the former prime minister's camp.Mr Sunak's official spokesman said it was up to the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac), which vets appointments, to \"make a decision\" on the final list, which is then given to the prime minister.In his first public comments since the row, Mr Sunak said Mr Johnson wanted him \"to do something I wasn't prepared to do\" - \"to either overrule the Holac committee or make promises to people\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for

they did not interfere with Mr Johnson's honours list.It is claimed that Ms Dorries and others were not informed that they needed to announce their resignations as MPs within six months of being put forward for peerages - allowing Downing Street to \"run down the clock\".The six-month period ended some weeks ago, a source close to Ms Dorries said.Ms Dorries may now wait until just before the summer recess to formally resign, which would leave the prime minister to fight an autumn by-election in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency where her 24,000 majority is under threat from Labour and the Liberal Democrats.Number 10 has said the decision over when to stand down \"is a matter for Nadine\". \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n4:18\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson:

Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Selby and Ainsty, held by Mr Adams, are expected to take place in mid to late July - possibly on the same day.Mr Johnson announced his shock resignation after receiving the draft findings of the privileges committee inquiry into whether he misled MPs with his statements on parties in Downing Street during the pandemic.Read more:Nadine Dorries claims 'sinister forces'

dealing with \"further representations\" made by Mr Johnson's legal team on Monday night as the group met to conclude the inquiry.A committee spokesman said on Tuesday: \"A letter enclosing further representations from Mr Johnson was received by the committee at 11.57pm last night.\"The committee is dealing with these and will report promptly.\"\n"}, {"_id": "648a1ede51ac332f7f4f5408", "url":

we spend multi-millions of dollars on hosting fees and Reddit needs to be fairly paid to continue supporting high-usage third-party apps,\" it said in a statement to Sky News.\"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs.\"The company said developers could make their apps \"more efficient\" to reduce the number of API calls required, adding that access would also remain free for moderator tools and bots.It added: \"We're committed to fostering a safe and responsible developer ecosystem around Reddit - developers and third-party apps can make Reddit better and do so in a sustainable and mutually-beneficial partnership, while also keeping our users and data safe.\"Reddit chief Steve Huffman doubled down on the company's stance in a Q&A on the platform on Saturday, saying it needs to be \"self-sustaining\" and \"can no longer subsidise commercial entities that require large-scale data use\".It comes as the company lays off 90 employees, about 5% of its workforce, to cut costs.\n"}, {"_id": "648a1ee051ac332f7f4f5410", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/lucy-the-worlds-most-famous-human-ancestor-could-walk-just-like-us-new-research-suggests-12902139", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "World's most famous human ancestor 'could walk just like us'", "lead": "The world's most famous early human ancestor could walk upright like a modern-day human thanks to fully bendable knee joints, research suggests.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 22:11:12.941317", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-human-ancestor-museum_6186971.jpg?20230614104042", "body": "\nThe world's most famous early human ancestor could walk upright like a modern-day human thanks to fully bendable knee joints, research suggests.'Lucy' was from an extinct ape-like species that lived in Africa more than three million years ago.\n\n\n\nShe was dug up in Ethiopia in 1974, and at the time was the most complete known early human ancestor.But only now have her lower limb muscles been fully digitally reconstructed, by researchers hoping to put an end to a decades-old debate among scientists regarding how she walked.The results from a team at the University of Cambridge, published in the Royal Society Open Science journal, show Lucy could straighten her knee joints, stand upright, and walk on two legs like we do today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut her legs were also found to be far bigger and more powerful than ours, allowing her to live in trees like apes, meaning she was equally well-equipped to adapt to life in open grasslands and dense forests alike.The Cambridge scientists said the findings may help shed light on how physical movement has evolved in humans, \"including those capabilities we have lost\". \n\nMore from Science & Tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  AI helps discover three drugs which could fight effects of ageing\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  British projects given tens of millions in funding to develop 'safe and trustworthy' AI\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Astronomers make rare Star Wars-style planetary discovery\n                \n\n\n\n\n\nHow Lucy's legs were reconstructedA team led by Dr Ashleigh Wiseman made a 3D model of Lucy's legs and pelvis muscles, with 36 in each leg. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major muscles in her calves and thighs were more than twice as large as those in modern humans - the only remaining animal that can stand upright with straight knees.Dr Wiseman, of Cambridge's McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: \"Lucy's ability to walk upright can only be known by reconstructing the path and space that a muscle occupies within the body.\"She added: \"Lucy's muscles suggest that she was as proficient at bipedalism as we are, while possibly also being at home in the trees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLucy's leg and pelvis muscles were digitally recreated.

as made by people including former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan.ITV bosses questioned by MPs - as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn said bosses \"were repeatedly told nothing was happening\", and both men denied it \"both formally and informally\", with Person X being questioned on 12 occasions over a period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was only hearsay and rumour and speculation,\" ITV's chief executive said. \"Nobody on the board would have turned a blind eye to something as serious as this.\"If evidence had emerged about the relationship, bosses \"would have acted very swiftly\", she said.During the session, the ITV bosses also responded to allegations of a \"toxic\" environment on ITV's daytime shows, and faced questions about other issues such as the suicides of Love Island contestants and presenter Caroline Flack, and allegations about \"abuse\" and \"bullying\" on The X Factor. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSinger Rebecca Ferguson recently hit out over allegations of 'abuse' on The X Factor. Pic: Ken McKay/Talkback Thames/Shutterstock\n        \n\n\n\nThe hearing was called after Schofield, 61, resigned from ITV and admitted to the \"unwise but not illegal\" affair which started when Person X was 20. The presenter was subsequently dropped by his talent agency, YMU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn told MPs that the \"imbalance of power, the imbalance of dynamics\" made the relationship \"deeply inappropriate\".ITV bosses deny NDAs and gagging ordersThe hearing was told the matter was looked into at around the time when Schofield came out as gay on This Morning in February 2020, supported by his then co-presenter Holly Willoughby.Read more:Phillip Schofield: Timeline of ITV departureKey extracts from ITV chief executive's letter on Schofield departureDame Carolyn confirmed Schofield has been \"receiving counselling\" since his exit from the show and that she is \"very concerned\" about his welfare.She also confirmed there is \"no gagging order or NDA\" to stop Person X from speaking out about the situation, and denied he was given a \"pay-off\" when he left ITV.

MPs heard he applied for work experience and listed Schofield as a family friend, but this was not that unusual and the application did not ring \"alarm bells\".Person X carried out work experience at This Morning for about two weeks when he was 19, and \"impressed people\" before he was later offered a longer-term fixed contract, the politicians were told. \n\n\nITV boss is no stranger to drama - but is she aware of everything happening behind the scenes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Spencer\n\nArts and entertainment correspondent\n@SkyKatieSpencer\n\n\n\nBeing the big boss Dame Carolyn McCall has had to steer ITV through a sizeable chunk of off-screen drama - from Piers Morgan quitting and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host Jeremy Clarkson's controversial columns, to the axing of Jeremy Kyle and Love Island's post-show care.\nShe is no stranger to helping the channel ride out the headlines, and - subject to more than two hours of questioning from MPs - she claimed she welcomed the opportunity to \"set out some of the facts\" of what's been happening at ITV.\nShe has needed to. ITV bosses tried persistently, she claimed, to find out what was going on between former This Morning star Phillip Schofield and a young runner.\nThe broadcaster's argument about why no action was taken effectively boiled down to: how can you properly investigate with no concrete evidence?\nSchofield's fragile mental state surrounding his coming out as gay was also cited as a reason they felt they had to tread carefully. There was a focus on welfare, which is no doubt a key concern, and particularly in recent years after the death of Love Island presenter Caroline Flack.\nAccusations that the runner in question had been made to sign a non-disclosure agreement were dismissed, while a \"pay-off\" that has been speculated about was explained as a standard redundancy payment after the COVID pandemic.\nIs there a toxic working environment at This Morning? The bosses insisted no, and presented a rosy picture of how staff, when surveyed, gave glowing assessments of their employer. Whistleblowing numbers were widely displayed in staff toilets, they said, and in lifts, and every effort is made to make sure staff feel comfortable enough to express their concerns.\nProfessional boundaries were crossed, the power balance was \"inappropriate\",  Dame Carolyn admitted.\nBut her shocked reaction to claims brought up that viewers, on occasion, were referred to as \"Tower Block Traceys\" in production meetings was indicative of the fact that while she is across policy on a corporate level, management are unlikely to be aware of what's being said further down the food chain.\nClearly, there is a disconnect there.\n\n\nIs there a 'toxic' culture at This Morning?Later in the session, MPs asked about allegations of a toxic culture at This Morning, and Dame Carolyn described these as \"deeply\" disappointing.She confirmed the show has received two complaints about bullying or harassment in five years, and said these were \"both taken very seriously\". One of these was from the show's former resident doctor Dr Ranj Singh, who raised concerns about \"bullying and discrimination\" and afterwards said he felt like he was \"managed out\" for whistleblowing.\"It deeply disappoints me but we do not recognise that at This Morning, we have tangible evidence to tell you where the vast majority of people at daytime at This Morning are extremely engaged and very motivated,\" Dame Carolyn said.Read more:Holly Willoughby's full statement in This Morning returnAlison Hammond breaks down on This MorningSchofield apologises over affair - and says he has 'lost everything' \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP John Nicholson told the panel he had received many messages from employees past and present at ITV talking about the bullying culture at the broadcaster, with one describing daytime TV as \"particularly toxic\".Dame Carolyn replied: \"They're very disappointing to hear. Deeply distressing. I've said we've had two official complaints, both of them investigated - it does not fill me with anything but sorrow.\"She also described comments from This Morning editor Martin Frizell as \"foolish\", after he referred to aubergines when asked by Sky News about allegations of a \"toxic\" work environment on the programme. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Morning boss: 'Do you like aubergine?' \n\n\n\n\"I think Martin has made a mistake, I think he knows he made a mistake, I don't think he intended to say that. It was a foolish comment; an ill-advised comment, I absolutely agree,\" she said.An independent review into the facts by a barrister, commissioned by ITV, was also discussed during the hearing, with Dame Carolyn saying: \"There will be things to learn.\"The barrister will review complaints made since 1 January 2016, and consider whether steps taken to deal with them were \"appropriate and adequate\".The review is expected to be completed by the end of September. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nThe session ended with chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage saying the committee wants to be confident that \"ITV isn't letting star power and favouritism damage the lives or careers of those working there\".Dame Carolyn responded by saying that ITV takes \"every allegation about our culture seriously, but I think it would be very wrong to depict ITV as having an issue\".\n"}, {"_id": "648a1ee351ac332f7f4f5417", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/loose-women-star-denise-welch-to-star-as-late-queen-in-diana-musical-12902550", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Loose Women star Denise Welch to star as late Queen in Diana musical", "lead": "A new musical about the life of Princess Diana will feature Loose Women panellist Denise Welch, who will star as the late Queen.", "author": "\nReemul Balla\n", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 22:11:15.136532", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-denise-welch-queen_6187568.jpg?20230614193538", "body": "\nA new musical about the life of Princess Diana will feature Loose Women panellist Denise Welch, who will star as the late Queen.

followed closely by Suttree.McCarthy travelled to all the places detailed in the novel and reportedly learned Spanish to help with his research.Read more:Eat, Pray, Love author delays new novel set in Russia after criticism from Ukraine \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it was not until 1992 that he found true acclaim with All The Pretty Horses, the first volume of The Border Trilogy.The book became a New York Times bestseller and sold 190,000 copies in hardback within the first six months of publication, giving McCarthy the wide readership which had eluded him for years. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Country For Old Men, later adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Javier Bardem, was published in 2005.The Road, also adapted into a film starring Viggo Mortensen, was published a year later and went on to win the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Literature.McCarthy gave a rare interview to Oprah Winfrey, who had chosen it for her Book Club. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nAfter McCarthy's death was announced, tributes were paid by many, including renowned US horror author Stephen King, who described him as \"maybe the greatest American novelist of my time\".\"He was full of years and created a fine body of work, but I still mourn his passing,\" he tweeted.\n"}, {"_id": "648a1ee451ac332f7f4f541b", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/playing-explicit-music-in-the-workplace-can-be-treated-as-discrimination-us-court-rules-12902245", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Playing explicit music in the workplace can be discrimination, court rules", "lead": "Vulgar music played in a workplace may be a form of sexual discrimination, a US federal appeals court has ruled.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 22:11:16.060344", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-music-songs-lyrics_6187156.jpg?20230614124123", "body": "\nVulgar music played in a workplace may be a form of sexual discrimination, a US federal appeals court has ruled.Former employees from S&S Activewear in Reno, Nevada, had said in a lawsuit that the company allowed its managers and other employees to play music featuring \"sexually graphic\" and \"violently misogynistic\" lyrics.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that it, therefore, fostered a hostile and abusive work environment at the company's facility.The people who took offence to the music were eight claimants - seven women and one man.They claimed the music allegedly \"denigrated women\" and graphically detailed extreme violence against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, one of the songs in question included an Eminem single about a pregnant woman being put into a car trunk and \"driven into water to be drowned\".The lawsuit also said the music incited abusive behaviour by male employees.The male colleagues have been accused of openly sharing pornographic videos and yelling obscenities.Despite employees raising their concerns, management from S&S defended the music, describing it as motivational. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe claimants found it difficult to avoid the music, as it was blasted from commercial speakers to cover the 700,000-square-foot warehouse.In the lawsuit, the employees alleged the music and related conduct were sexual harassment and in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, this \"prohibits employment discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex and national origin.\"At first, a lower court dismissed the claim and agreed with the defendants that as both men and women were subject to the songs, the conduct did not constitute sex discrimination.The court held that there was no allegation \"that any employee or group of employees were targeted, or that one individual or group was subjected to treatment that another group was not\".The claimants appealed, and last week, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal and remanded the case.This then allowed the lawsuit against S&S to move forward.Read more from Sky News:British projects given tens of millions in funding to develop 'safe and trustworthy' AIMore young people are using TikTok to access news, research findsJudge Mary Margaret McKeown wrote in a court opinion: \"Harassment, whether aural or visual, need not be directly targeted at a particular plaintiff in order to pollute a workplace and give rise to a Title VII claim.\"The challenged conduct's offensiveness to multiple genders is not a certain bar to stating a Title VII claim.\"Mark Mausert, an attorney representing the employees, told NBC News: \"The offence taken by a man doesn't magically cancel out the offence taken by women. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The [lower] court used this semantical misinterpretation to arrive at a result that's not consistent with the purpose of the statute.\"Mr Mausert said music with such sexually graphic lyrics and gender pejoratives could re-traumatise survivors of sexual abuse -
