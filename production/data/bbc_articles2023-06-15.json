Children and women,\" said Dr Manolis Makaris, head of cardiology.<br/>He said two patients had given him estimated figures.<br/>\"One told me about 100 children, the other about 50, so I don't know the truth - but it is many,\" he added.<br/>Dr Makaris said he believed as many as 600 people could have died in the disaster.<br/>\"The exact number of all the people who were on the boat was 750. This is the exact number that everyone told me about this,\" he said.<br/>Families of some Egyptian children who were missing had sent him photographs of their young relatives, he said, in the hope he would recognise them after treating them.<br/>\"It was a tragedy,\" he said. \"Everyone in Europe must not accept this situation. We have to do something. Everyone has to do something so it doesn't happen again.\"<br/>A reporter from Greece's ANT1 channel asked a survivor if there were 100 children on board, to which the survivor replied: \"Yes.\"<br/>The BBC has not been able to independently verify the figure, but it was corroborate by the charity Save the Children, citing testimonies from survivors.<br/>Greek government spokesman Ilias Siakantaris said it was not known how many people were in the hold: \"But we know that several smugglers lock people up to maintain control.\"<br/>Families of some of the missing have arrived in Kalamata in search of their loved ones.<br/>\"My relatives were on the boat,\" said Aftab, who had travelled from the UK and said at least four of his relatives from Pakistan were unaccounted for.<br/>\"We've had confirmation. We found one of the relatives in [the rescue centre]. But the others we haven't got hold of yet,\" he told the BBC.<br/>A Syrian man from the Netherlands broke down as he revealed his wife and brother-in-law were missing.<br/>Activist Nawal Soufi was the first to raise the alarm after being contacted by people on the boat on Tuesday morning. <br/>The coastguard said initial contact was made with the fishing boat at 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday, and no request for help had been made.<br/>It said the Greek shipping ministry had made repeated contact with the boat and was told it simply wanted to sail on to Italy. <br/>Two commercial ships provided water during the evening. In a Facebook post, Ms Soufi said the situation became \"complicated\" when a ship approached the vessel and tied ropes to it while throwing bottles of water on board.<br/>She said some of the people on board had felt in \"extreme danger\" due to fears the rope could cause the boat to flip, and that fights on board over water could result in it capsizing. The boat then moved away.<br/>The coastguard said that in the early hours of Wednesday the boat's engine broke down and that people on board started to move around causing it to capsize. All of the 104 people rescued were male.<br/>Alarm Phone, an emergency helpline for migrants in trouble at sea, complained that the coastguard had been \"aware of the ship being in distress for hours before any help was sent\", adding that authorities \"had been informed by different sources\" that the boat was in trouble.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Survivors winched to safety after Greece boat disaster<br/>However, coastguard spokesperson Nikos Alexiou said they tried to convince the vessel to get help and \"stayed by if they needed us to save people\".<br/>Former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras visited Kalamata on Thursday and spoke to survivors about what they thought had gone wrong.<br/>\"The Greek coastguard asked the vessel to follow them, but they couldn't,\" a translator explained. \"The coastguard then threw a rope but because they didn't know how to pull the rope, the vessel started dangling right and left,\" <br/>\"The coastguard boat was going too fast but the vessel was already dangling to the left, and that's how it sank.\"<br/>Greece is observing three days of mourning. Campaigning has been suspended ahead of the parliamentary election on 25 June and a TV debate due to happen on Thursday has been cancelled.<br/>The country is one of the main routes into the European Union for refugees and migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.<br/>Last month the Greek government came under international criticism over video reportedly showed the forceful expulsion of migrants who were set adrift at sea.<br/>Are you in Greece?

Following their recent reunion, he said: \"It was as wonderful an experience this time as it was 50 years ago. I shall miss her.\"<br/>Other tributes were paid from across the worlds of the arts and politics.<br/>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who now sits in Jackson's former seat, tweeted: \"Devastated to hear that my predecessor Glenda Jackson has died.<br/>\"A formidable politician, an amazing actress and a very supportive mentor to me. Hampstead and Kilburn will miss you Glenda.\"<br/>Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, who worked for Jackson before becoming an MP herself, recalled the \"incredibly kind\" politician's \"cutting humour\" and \"general disdain at most things\".<br/>\"She was the definition of an icon, successfully spanning the world of acting and politics with great aplomb,\" Powell wrote.<br/>Broadcaster and former Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth said she was \"a wonderful actress, a committed politician [and] a remarkable human being\".<br/>\"We became MPs on the same day in 1992 & I treasure our unlikely friendship,\" he wrote. \"She was such a gifted, caring & special person who came into the world to make a difference - and did.\"<br/>A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was \"extremely sad news\", adding: \"His thoughts will be with her friends and family at this time.\"<br/>TV presenter Carol Vorderman said: \"To see this unique woman turn into a firebrand in politics was deeply impressive for young girls like me. May she rest in peace.\"<br/>Jackson began acting after joining an amateur dramatics group as a teen while working in Boots near her tome town of Birkenhead in Merseyside.<br/>She won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) in London, and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1963.<br/>After making her name on stage, she won her first Oscar for playing a headstrong artist in director Ken Russell's film of DH Lawrence's novel Women in Love.<br/>Her second Academy Award came three years later for A Touch of Class, a romantic comedy in which she played a fashion designer caught up in a catastrophic love affair with a US businessman. <br/>She did not attend either ceremony, though, saying she was busy.<br/>\"All awards are very nice to have,\" she told BBC Radio 4's This Cultural Life last year. \"But they don't make you any better.\"<br/>The role in A Touch of Class came about after she famously showed off her comedy skills in a guest appearance as Cleopatra on Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise's hit Saturday night TV show.<br/>\"I've always said, and I mean it, they were the apotheosis of my career, working with them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.<br/>She also played the Egyptian queen - more seriously - on stage in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra for the RSC.<br/>Sir Jonathan, who was also in that production, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Everyone will talk about her tremendous strength and courage and intelligence, [and] her wit.<br/>\"I worked with her twice in the 70s, and she was always direct, always honest. And, like the greatest art, her work was simple and uncluttered.\"<br/>In its tribute, the RSC described her as \"a tour de force in acting and politics, dedicating her life to both\".<br/>The company added: \"We're proud her extraordinary talent was seen on RSC stages early in her career in ground-breaking productions.\"<br/>Jackson played Elizabeth I in BBC drama Elizabeth R - another role she famously revisited - winning Emmys for both Elizabeth R and also playing the queen opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave in 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots.<br/>Further Oscar nominations came her way for portraying a frustrated office worker in a love triangle in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday, and for taking the title role in 1975's Hedda, adapted from Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler.<br/>Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote a biography of Jackson in 1999, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"She had such versatility.<br/>\"It's the quality of the work, and the variety. Her voice could go to gravel to caramel in three seconds.\"<br/>Former Labour MP Baronness Hoey told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When she came into Parliament, she was so modest. She never wanted to be reminded that she was an actress.\"<br/>Other credits included playing English poet Stevie Smith in Stevie, and as Hollywood icon Patricia Neal in The Patricia Neal Story.<br/>A staunch Labour supporter, she was approached to stand for Parliament - and said she agreed because she disliked former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the \"destruction that her policies has had on human beings\".<br/>There was a link between acting and politics, she said.<br/>\"The best theatre is about trying to find and tell the truth,\" she told Desert Island Discs. \"It's not about covering up. It's not about playing games. It's not about hiding. It's not about pretending you're something you're not.<br/>\"It's trying to find what it is to be a human being and why we behave towards each other in the ways that we do.

Sounds a bit naff and likely very cheesy, one strictly for the fans. <br/>\"Dismiss Greatest Days though and you'll be missing out on one of 2023's biggest movie surprises... It's a wholesome celebration of friendship, tinged with heartbreak, that ultimately proves to be a crowdpleaser.\"<br/>Greatest Days is directed by Coky Giedroyc and written by Tim Firth, who has adapted his own stage musical, originally titled The Band.<br/>Bea plays Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who was a huge fan of Take That in her teens, along with her four best friends from school.<br/>When she wins tickets to see the group on their reunion tour in Athens, she reunites her old group, some of whom have not seen each other for 25 years. <br/>The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said: \"A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad.<br/>\"But it's a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it's at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies.\"<br/>The film features many of Take That's biggest hits, including Shine, Never Forget, Patience, Back For Good and Rule the World.<br/>However, the group are only referred to as \"The Boys\" in the film, rather than their real-life name.<br/>In a three-star review, Terry Staunton of the Radio Times said: \"At its root, director Coky Giedroyc's feel-good fare is a tale of everyday, ordinary women taking stock of their lives and pondering what the future holds.<br/>\"This being a film with the music of Take That at its foundation, viewers are guaranteed a succession of bangers; familiar and enduring hits whose anthemic qualities made them shoo-ins for a fresh lease of life on the West End stage in the first place.\"<br/>Total Film's Tom Dawson wrote: \"Giedroyc doesn't ignore life's inevitable sadnesses - along the way there are unexpected bereavements, family rifts, unfulfilled youthful dreams\u2026 It's the uplift that sticks, though.\"<br/>There was praise for the cast from Smooth Radio's Tom Eames, who said: \"Aisling Bea proves she can lead a film with charm and relatability, while there are standout 'watch this space' performances from up-and-comers Eliza Dobson and Jessie Mae Alonzo.\"<br/>Greatest Days is released in the UK on Friday, following its London premiere on Thursday evening. It received its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival last month.<br/>\"It may be fuelled by the schmaltzy lyrics of a boy band, but this is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of female friendship,\" said Screen Daily's Nikki Baughan.<br/>\"Aisling Bea brings a sharp wit (and essential levity) to the central character of Rachel; now a mid-40s no-nonsense children's ward nurse but, back in 1993, a 16-year-old school girl (played, in excellent casting, by Bea lookalike Lara McDonnell) and diehard fan of a boyband only ever referred to as 'The Boys'.<br/>\"Underneath the '90s vibes, colourful production design and occasionally cringey boyband lyrics, that's a deep-rooted sentiment that we can all take to heart.\"<br/>Yahoo's Roxy Simons said: \"As far as musicals go, Greatest Days is an enjoyable caper thanks to its fun reinterpretations of Take That's songs, like the airport-based rendition of Shine that features stylish choreography and elaborate costumes <br/>\"Some songs feel perfectly suited for the scene they're used in, but there are others that feel as if they were added on just as a way to make sure fan favourites weren't missed off the list. When this happens it can be quite jarring: the placement of Patience is a prime example of this.\"<br/>She concluded: \"It might not have the longevity of musicals like Mamma Mia! in the long run, but Greatest Days is sure to delight fans of Take That in a new and inventive way.\"<br/>Take That launch The Band with Lulu<br/>Take That musical to become a movie<br/>Mark Owen on the Take That songs he avoids playing<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

an extremely long ban by the standards of recent years. <br/>And it says he should not get a parliamentary pass, which former MPs would normally be able to apply for. <br/>Perhaps the greatest punishment in the report, ultimately, will be the damage it does to his reputation among Conservative MPs -

He had just been elected mayor of London, a job that would launch him on the path to Downing Street.<br/>Now he is heading for the exit with all guns blazing, with a scathing attack on the MPs who sought to punish him for misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking.<br/>His reaction to the Privileges Committee report is vintage Johnson - colourful, amusing in parts - the references to \"Mystic Meg\" and nudist colonies - but with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness and anger. <br/>Whether it turns out to be the final raging testament of a man destined for the political wilderness remains to be seen.<br/>He has bounced back from many, mainly self-inflicted, disasters before.<br/>And he is clearly in no mood to settle for comfortable semi-retirement. <br/>He has already earned more than \u00a35m for giving speeches around the world since he quit as prime minister.<br/>He is also about to become a father again, at 58, with wife Carrie expecting their third child. The family have just moved into a \u00a33.8m Grade II listed manor house in Oxfordshire, complete with its own moat.<br/>There are books to write - his memoir of his time in Downing Street is well under way apparently, and talk of business opportunities.<br/>But this may be thin gruel for someone with Boris Johnson's outsize personality.<br/>From his earliest childhood days, when he famously declared he wanted to be \"world king\", Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has had his eyes on life's big prizes.<br/>He came into the world in 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in New York, where his father, Stanley, was studying economics. <br/>One of four children, he spent his early years on the family farm in Somerset, before moving to north London and then Brussels, where Stanley was working for the European Commission.<br/>The Johnson siblings were close and highly competitive with one another. Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs.<br/>He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates.<br/>In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: \"Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. <br/>\"I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\"<br/>Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: \"Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,\" <br/>At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron.<br/>After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. <br/>It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings.<br/>As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. <br/>In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.<br/>Things did not go smoothly.<br/>He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard.<br/>He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. <br/>An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city.<br/>He survived \"Operation Scouse Grovel\", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.<br/>Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered.<br/>He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way.<br/>He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre.<br/>In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021.<br/>It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. <br/>Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician.<br/>His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party.<br/>His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. <br/>In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.<br/>Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a \"career psychopath\".<br/>When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. <br/>However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. <br/>Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.<br/>He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into \"the status of a colony\". <br/>When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job.<br/>He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May.<br/>In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.<br/>After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to \"Get Brexit Done\", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide.<br/>The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall.<br/>His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. <br/>It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted \"it could have gone either way\".<br/>As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic.<br/>He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world.<br/>But his political problems were mounting up.<br/>In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street.<br/>Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. <br/>Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.<br/>Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.<br/>Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.<br/>The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. <br/>He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.<br/>The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.<br/>A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to \"get on with the job\" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.<br/>He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership.<br/>He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. <br/>But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party.<br/>He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards.<br/>But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict.<br/>Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills.<br/>But the road back looks like a long and steep one.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Three days after that, he died.<br/>\"It really is our nation's great shame that Boris Johnson was our prime minister.

I will always be traumatised by not being able to be there for him.\"<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group said the committee's verdict was \"another grim reminder\" of how the former prime minister broke his own rules \"so he could have a party and a laugh\" as families \"were saying goodbye to loved ones over Zoom\".<br/>David Garfinkel lost his 76-year-old father Ivor to the virus.<br/>Now a spokesman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, he told the BBC the report's findings came as no surprise.<br/> \"Johnson has shown no remorse,\" he said. <br/>\"It's an utter tragedy that Johnson was in charge when the pandemic struck and he should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again.\"<br/>He added: \"His justification was that he had to be at a leaving event. Why was that so important when people were dying of Covid and burying their loved ones?<br/>\"He was in a leaving event for 25 minutes. It took less than three minutes for them to switch off the ventilator for my dad when he died.\"<br/>He added: \"I think for bereaved families... we all followed the rules. We had to live through the consequences of not being with our loved ones at the end, when they passed away, and we'll have to live with that for the rest of our lives.\"<br/>Nicky Campbell's phone-in on BBC Radio 5 Live heard from Liz in Harrogate. She said the report had restored her faith in Parliament.<br/>When her father died of Covid, the family could only have six people at his funeral.<br/>\"My mother couldn't even put a carnation on his coffin. We couldn't hug her. It was barbaric.\"<br/>She thinks Mr Johnson's response was \"typical Boris\". <br/>\"He's just so full of himself and his own self importance, it's beyond a joke.\"<br/>Former cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke, who was given a knighthood in Boris Johnson's resignation honours list, said he was \"amazed at the harshness of today's report\".<br/>He tweeted: \"I believed Boris before and I believe him today. This punishment is absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness.\"<br/>Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he was \"appalled\", adding, \"I'm backing fairness and justice - not kangaroo courts.\"<br/>Meanwhile, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg - also given a knighthood in the resignation honours last week - described the report as \"fundamentally flawed\". <br/>Nadine Dorries, who has said she plans to stand down as a Conservative MP, tweeted that the report had \"overreached\".<br/>Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said Mr Johnson had \"made his decision, he made the decision to resign\" after he saw the report last week, and added: \"Boris has achieved an awful lot.\"<br/>But senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said he hoped the report would allow MPs to move on from the \"public pantomime\".<br/>Former attorney-general and Conservative MP Dominic Grieve dismissed any suggestions the committee \"had it in\" for the former primer minister.<br/>The sanctions recommended by the committee were \"a result of his own actions,\" he said, adding: \"The history of his lying is just epic.\"<br/>Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Boris Johnson was \"not only a lawbreaker, but a liar\". <br/>\"He's not fit for public office.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one. All MPs will vote on the suggested sanction next week. <br/>He will also remain a member of the Privy Council, the body that meets around once a month to get the monarch's formal approval for government orders approved by ministers.<br/>There are several hundred privy councillors, although only current members of the government are involved in day-to-day business.<br/>All cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, are appointed for life.<br/>The only prime minister to have been removed from the list of privy councillors was short-lived premier William Cavendish, who was struck off by King George III when he suspected him of plotting against him. <br/>What happens for Boris Johnson now he's resigned?<br/>Calls for Truss not to take yearly \u00a3115,000 as ex-PM<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

One is an ordinary North Korean citizen who has agreed to risk all to be interviewed by the BBC. The other is a source, working for an organisation in South Korea to leak information out of the country.  <br/>At a secure location that cannot be bugged, the source relays one of our questions to the citizen and notes down the answer. Later, when it is safe, they will send it back to us, in multiple instalments. Sending even one full answer at a time is too risky. <br/>This is the start of a painstaking process that will take us many months, as we investigate the consequences of the North Korean government's decision to seal the country's border more than three years ago. <br/>North Koreans are forbidden from talking to anyone outside the country, especially journalists, and if the government finds out they have done so, they could be killed. <br/>But when the border was shut in January 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a country that was already difficult to report on became virtually impenetrable.  <br/>All the sources that journalists would ordinarily rely on to relay what was happening on the ground dried up, as foreign diplomats and aid workers left the country. It also became nearly impossible for North Koreans to escape and share their experiences.  <br/>At the same time, there was good reason to suspect the border closure was causing people significant suffering, based on our knowledge of how people in North Korea make their living and acquire their food. Then, last year, we started to get unconfirmed reports of severe food shortages and possible starvation.  <br/>This is why we decided to take such extraordinary measures, to interview three ordinary North Koreans inside the country. <br/>First, we sought advice from those who work closely with North Koreans and understand the risks. Sokeel Park, from the organisation Liberty in North Korea, who has been working with escapees for more than a decade, was of the view this was an important and worthwhile undertaking, in spite of the risks. <br/>\"There is not a single North Korean who won't understand the danger, and if people want to do this, I think we should respect that,\" he told us. \"Every conversation with people inside North Korea, every titbit of information, is so valuable, because we know so little,\" he said.  <br/>But to do this, we could not work alone. We teamed up with a news organisation in South Korea, Daily NK, that has a network of sources inside the country. These sources found us people who wanted to be interviewed. Aware we would only be getting a snapshot of life inside the country, we chose to speak to people of varying ages from different areas.  <br/>We explained what the BBC was, and how far and wide their interviews would be seen and heard, and they gave their consent. <br/>\"They are looking forward to telling the world how bad the situation is in North Korea,\" said Daily NK's editor-in-chief Lee Sang-yong. \"They hope the international community will take notice.\"  <br/>Mr Lee has been working with his sources for 13 years to smuggle information out of North Korea. He assured us that his methods of communication were robust. He was confident he could keep people safe but warned that the process would take time.  <br/>As we waited, there were moments we worried we might not get enough information. What if we received one-line answers - perhaps not even enough to report? This was the gamble.  <br/>But when we finally collated the messages, we were blown away by the level of detail. People revealed far more than we had expected, and the situation was worse than we had imagined. It pointed to a dire humanitarian and human rights situation unfolding in the country, and chronic food shortages. <br/>We then set about verifying as much as we could. Helpfully, our three interviewees corroborated each other. They all cited the same quarantine rules and the same new laws which frightened them. They all spoke about the scarcity of food and medicine, and had experienced increasingly severe crackdowns and punishments. They even shared many of the same hopes and fears. <br/>But there were also illuminating differences. It appeared there was more government support in the capital Pyongyang than in the border towns, but also more control, surveillance and fear there - which was in line with what we had expected.  <br/>Our next step was to take our interviews to NK Pro, a news service in Seoul which monitors North Korea. One of the only remaining sources of information on North Korea is the country's own state-run newspaper and TV channel. While much of the content is propaganda, NK Pro's state media expert Chung Seung-yeon monitors this daily, combing it for clues as to what is really happening in the country.  <br/>\"We think of North Korea as a very secret state. Certainly, they never speak loudly about their problems, but they drop hints,\" she said. And when they actually mention a problem, as they have done with the food crisis, this means it's \"a really big deal\", she explained.  <br/>She showed us one news report from February in which North Korean party members were praised for donating rice to the government. \"That the state is receiving grain from its people, shows us how desperate the food situation is,\" she pointed out.  <br/>With Ms Chung's help we were also able to confirm many of the quarantine and lockdown rules our interviewees had cited, and the new laws and punishments that had been introduced. <br/>To corroborate other details, we analysed the available data on food prices and trade, and viewed satellite images of the border. We combed the texts of new laws that had been smuggled out the country, while cross-referencing our interviews with reports from the South Korean government, the UN, and other sources, until we were confident that our interviews - while not comprehensive - provided reliable snapshots of life in North Korea.  <br/>As much as we have published, there are many details we have held back, to protect our interviewees. But through their bravery, we know so much more about the situation in North Korea than we did before.  <br/>\"The world has not realised how bad things are for the North Korean people right now,\" said Sokeel Park. \"These interviewees are not the full picture. In future years, we'll probably learn in depth just how difficult this period has been,\" he said.  <br/>When we last checked in with our interviewees, through Daily NK, they were all safe. <br/>In depth: Read the full BBC investigation<br/>North Korean experts on what BBC testimony tells us<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But Jackson was not easily flattered.<br/>Famously prickly, her view of Tinseltown often bordered on contempt. \"If I'm too strong for some people,\" she said, \"that's their problem\".<br/>And, at the height of her acting power, she gave it all up for a career in politics.<br/>Glenda May Jackson was born on 9 May 1936 in Birkenhead, in Wirral, the daughter of a bricklayer. <br/>She attended the local grammar school, leaving at 16 to work at Boots.<br/>Bored, she joined a YMCA drama group. \"I had no real ambition about acting,\" she later recalled.  \"But I knew there had to be something better than the bloody chemist's shop.\"<br/>Two years later, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).<br/>It was, according to one reviewer, her \"intense, sexually-charged talent\" that won her a place at the prestigious academy.<br/>She made an impression while still at RADA, when she appeared in a production of Terence Rattigan's Separate Tables. <br/>She followed this up with the traditional actor's apprenticeship, doing six years in rep.  She also had a small role in the 1963 film, This Sporting Life.<br/>By this time she had married actor and art dealer Roy Hodges. The couple had a son, Dan, who is a noted political commentator. <br/>She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1964. A year later, her big breakthrough came in Peter Brook's stage production of Marat/Sade.<br/>Jackson played the lunatic asylum inmate who finds herself acting the role of Charlotte Corday, the assassin of the French revolutionary, Jean Marat.<br/>David Edgar described her performance as that of a \"waif-like narcoleptic unable to control her behaviour, but also - completely believably - the differently-mad person playing Corday\".<br/>Jackson transferred with the production to Broadway and, in 1967, appeared in a film version - also directed by Brook.<br/>In 1969, she won her first Oscar, for best actress, in Ken Russell's adaptation of the DH Lawrence novel, Women in Love.<br/>The beautifully shot film became notorious for its nude scenes which, Jackson later recalled, she played with \"a prevailing sense of coldness\".  <br/>Her co-star Oliver Reed - hardly a shrinking violet himself - memorably described acting alongside her as like \"being run over by a Bedford truck\".<br/>The movie sparked Jackson's admiration for director Russell. Russell reciprocated, casting her in The Music Lovers, his biopic of Tchaikovsky.<br/>The film, which revolved around the relationship between the homosexual composer and his nymphomaniac wife - played by Jackson - was not a commercial success. <br/>But, according to one critic, the film was worth watching \"thanks largely to a powerhouse performance by Glenda Jackson, one actress who can hold her own against Russell's excess\".<br/>In 1971, having appeared as Elizabeth I in the historically dubious film, Mary, Queen of Scots, she reprised the role in BBC TV's Elizabeth R.<br/>The six-part series saw her play the Virgin Queen from princess to ailing old woman.  <br/>Jackson played the part with her customary intensity, even shaving her hair to accommodate the make-up required as her character aged.<br/>She was now firmly established as one of the world's foremost dramatic actresses.  She responded by sending herself up.<br/>One interviewer described her as \"so defiantly charmless that there is something oddly engaging about her, even vulnerable\".<br/>\"As for her sense of humour,\" they went on, \"it's by no means non-existent, but you often need long tweezers to find it.\"  But that did not mean she lacked comic timing.<br/>In 1971, she made her first appearance on the Morecambe and Wise Show - playing a comedy Cleopatra.  <br/>\"All men are fools,\" she declared with a flourish, \"and what makes them so is not having beauty like what I have got.\"  The audience loved it, and Hollywood took note.<br/>Soon she found herself cast opposite George Segal in a romantic comedy, A Touch of Class.  <br/>Jackson plays a British divorcee who has an affair with a married American, and falls in love. Her classy, understated performance won her a second Oscar.<br/>\"Stick with us,\" cabled Morecambe, \"and we will get you another one\". But - as with her previous Academy Award - she refused to go to Hollywood to pick up the statuette.  <br/>\"You don't do a play to compete for an award, \"she explained. \"I didn't win them. They were given to me.\"<br/>Jackson's marriage ended in 1976, after Jackson's husband sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery.  <br/>She did not deny it, but later noted that she had never been involved in a non-violent relationship.<br/>\"When I have to cry,\" she later said, \"I think about my love life. And when I have to laugh, I think about my love life.\"<br/>She returned to the RSC in the title role of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, directed by Trevor Nunn.  She was Oscar-nominated for the subsequent film version, which Nunn also directed.<br/>She also received plaudits for her role in Howard Barker's play, Scenes from an Execution, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1984 - which subsequently transferred to the stage.<br/>Jackson wowed the critics on Broadway when she appeared in Eugene O'Neill's melodrama, Strange Interlude.  It required her to be on stage for four hours, as her character aged from a naive teenager to embittered mother. <br/>The New York Times was ecstatic: \"She's equally mesmerizing as a Zelda Fitzgerald-esque neurotic, a rotting and spiteful middle-aged matron and, finally, a spent, sphinx-like widow happily embracing extinction.\"<br/>She joined forces with Russell again in 1989, with an appearance in The Rainbow.<br/>At the age of 56, Jackson announced she was quitting acting - to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate in the 1992 general election.<br/>\"The best theatre is trying to tell the truth,\" she said. \"And the best politics is trying to tell the truth.\"<br/>In an otherwise miserable election for her party, she won a notable victory in Hampstead and Highgate, which had been a Conservative seat for two decades.<br/>When Labour came to power in 1997, Jackson became a junior minister with responsibility for London Transport.<br/>She resigned two years later, to make a bid to become Labour's candidate for the London mayor, but was defeated by Frank Dobson.<br/>A left-winger by inclination, she became a fierce critic of Tony Blair's New Labour project and spoke out against the invasion of Iraq.<br/>In 2005, she threatened to stand against Blair for the party leadership unless he announced his intention to stand down.<br/>With boundary changes, Jackson clung on to her seat in the 2010 general election with a wafer-thin majority of 42.<br/>But the most controversial moment in her political career came in April 2013, when Parliament was recalled to pay tribute to the former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.<br/>Lady Thatcher had just died. But Jackson saw no reason to rein in her criticism of a woman she believed \"had inflicted heinous social, economic and spiritual damage upon the country\".<br/>Conservative MPs were furious when the Speaker refused to rule her remarks out of order. One political commentator accused the Labour left of being \"petty\", \"childish\" and \"self-indulgent\" with its ungracious attacks on the Iron Lady's memory. The writer was Jackson's son, Dan Hodges.<br/>Jackson decided not to defend her seat at the 2015 general election. And - at the age of 79 - she returned to acting.<br/>She played the 104-year-old Adelaide Fouque in a BBC Radio 4 production entitled Emile Zola: Blood Sex and Money.  <br/>And, in 2016 - a full quarter of a century after last treading the boards - took on the role of King Lear at the Old Vic.  <br/>\"My fear,\" she said, \"was that I would not have the physical or vocal strength\" to play one of Shakespeare's most challenging parts.  <br/>But the Daily Telegraph described her performance as \"one of those 11th-hour feats of human endeavour that will surely be talked about for years to come\".<br/>Two years later, she won a Tony Award on Broadway in a revival of Edward Albee's Three Tall Women.<br/>Chain-smoking and often barbed, she tolerated no fools. \"No-one does scorn like Jackson,\" said one shell-shocked interviewer.  <br/>But the writer Marilyn Stasio best summed up the experience of watching her act:  \"It is like looking straight into the sun,\" she wrote in Variety magazine.  <br/>\"Her expressive face registers her thoughts while guarding her feelings. But it's the voice that really thrills. <br/>\"Deeply pitched and clarion clear, it's the commanding voice of stern authority.  Don't mess with this household god or she'll turn you to stone.\"<br/>Jackson was winning accolades for her acting work as recently as 2020, when she won a Bafta TV Award for best leading actress for her performance in Elizabeth is Missing, about a woman suffering from dementia.<br/>Shortly before her death, Jackson completed filming The Great Escaper, in which she co-starred with Michael Caine.<br/>Sir Michael Caine leads tributes to Glenda Jackson<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory. <br/>\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.<br/>She has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart. <br/>Meanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed. <br/>The synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.<br/>Prof Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos. <br/>\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\" <br/>Most countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.<br/>However, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.  <br/>Dr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development. <br/>\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\" <br/>Legal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.  <br/>Researchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.<br/>Prof Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.<br/>\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\" <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Rupert Murdoch shut down the 168-year-old paper.<br/>In 2012, the Leveson Inquiry looked into the culture, practices and ethics of the press and published its recommendations.<br/>But that was more than a decade ago. Done and dusted, you might have imagined.<br/>Prince Harry has dragged the issue back into the spotlight. Perhaps only he has the celebrity, the drive - and the funds - to take on the tabloids.<br/>A new BBC documentary, Scandalous: Phone Hacking on Trial, offers up some context to his quest. And it suggests there are still some uncomfortable - and unanswered - questions for the British media.<br/>Actress Sienna Miller has spoken for the first time in depth and on camera about her experiences as part of the documentary.<br/>She settled a case with the Sun over phone hacking in 2021. News Group paid her a significant sum of money but made no admission of liability regarding what she alleged took place at the newspaper.<br/>At the time, she stood outside the Rolls Building of the High Court - the same court in which Prince Harry has been pursuing his case against Mirror Group in recent weeks - and said she had wanted to go to trial but didn't have \"countless millions\".<br/>People old enough to remember the early 2000s may have a hazy memory of the reports in question - an up-and-coming actress who was endlessly in the papers. Perhaps the least charitable will have viewed her as a wannabe who used a romantic relationship with a famous star to court fame.<br/>Her descriptions force us to question those assumptions.<br/>In a powerful and emotional interview, Miller tells the BBC: \"It was completely crazy, the number of stories that were coming out. And the number of accurate stories that were appearing in the press was baffling.\"<br/>Catapulted on to the front pages by a relationship with actor Jude Law, when he cheated on her with his children's nanny - who sold her story - it was all over the papers. Miller then discovered she was pregnant. That too was reported in the UK, having appeared first in a US publication. It made her decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy horrendously public.  <br/>\"I remember one photographer saying, 'Have you had your tits done to keep him?' And obviously I was pregnant\u2026 it was just awful,\" she said.<br/>\"I felt somebody must be selling stories. And I sat down the five people in our lives who knew and interrogated them violently. I was under such intense pressure.<br/>\"I remember my doctor's office phoning me and saying, 'We've sent the records that you'd asked for'. And me saying, 'I didn't ask for any records'.\"<br/>Miller's court case brought to light payments by the Sun to private investigators, such as \u00a3250 on 21 July 2005 for \"Sienna phone inquiries\". Or \u00a3950 on 3 August 2005 for \"Sienn's [sic] Miller pregnant research\".<br/>Dan Waddell, a paralegal involved in pursuing cases against News Group, tells the BBC he believes these are indicative of phone hacking and other unlawful information gathering, including blagging private information to discover her pregnancy.<br/>News Group also told the BBC it does not accept Miller's version of events, which it says is not borne out by evidence. It says it is limited in the response it can give while litigation is ongoing.<br/>The private investigator that allegedly accessed Miller's medical records denies \"blagging\" the doctor's office.<br/>News Group Newspapers, which owned the News of the World, has reportedly paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in costs and damages to settle phone hacking cases in recent years.<br/>The vast majority relate to the News of the World. News Group has never admitted that phone hacking ever took place at its daily tabloid, the Sun. But can we be sure it didn't?<br/>It has settled Sun-only claims - without admissions of liability - with Miller and at least five others. Former Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes and former footballer Paul Gascoigne were among the first.  <br/>Neil Wallis, who's worked in senior editorial positions at the Sun and News of the World, as well as its rival the Sunday People, says claims for civil damages are \"an industry\".<br/>He tells the programme: \"The main newspaper groups are caught between a rock and a hard place. If you spend \u00a31m on fighting that case, if you can settle it for \u00a3100,000 I'm afraid it's a no-brainer. It's cheaper to settle than to fight for the truth.\"<br/>He calls it a \"legal scandal\".<br/>Within the last year, News Group has also reached Sun-only settlements, again without any admission of liability, with jockey Kieren Fallon and two people who aren't celebrities: London 7/7 bombing survivor John Tulloch, and Patricia Bernal.  <br/>Bernal's daughter Clare was shot dead in 2005 by a man with whom she had had a three-week relationship. Five years after the murder, the police told Bernal the News of the World had hacked her phone and Clare's.<br/>Bernal tells the programme: \"It's quite unbelievable that individuals could go to such lengths at a time when a family is so grief stricken.\"<br/>There's also an interview with Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who went to prison in 2007 for phone hacking at the News of the World.<br/>Mulcaire tells the BBC that the interview has been a \"long time coming\". Some will view the statements of a convicted hacker as tainted. For the first time on camera, Mulcaire admits he also hacked for the Sun. <br/>He says: \"I listened to Heather Mills' voicemails for The Sun. I hacked not only the target, which in this case would be Heather Mills, but also friends and family and associates, so they could get access to material from voice messages left by Heather.\"<br/>News Group has told the BBC it denies it asked Mulcaire to hack for the Sun. It paid Mills a significant sum in 2019 to settle her claim ahead of a trial, admitting Mulcaire hacked for the News of the World.  <br/>It made no admissions over hacking for the Sun. <br/>We learned from Prince Harry's recent case against Mirror Group that it has paid out \u00a3100m in costs and damages to settle 600 claims of phone hacking since 2015.<br/>That was after a judge in a previous civil case ruled that interception of voicemails was widespread at its papers for a decade.<br/>MGN says: \"Where historical wrongdoing has taken place, we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.<br/>\"MGN is now part of a very different company. We are committed to acting with integrity and our objective in this trial is to allow both the business and our journalists to move forward from events that took place many years ago.\"<br/>Actress Shobna Gulati, best known for Dinnerladies and Coronation Street, was one of those who sued MGN in 2015.<br/>When you watch her interview for the new programme, you realise the impact of what happened to her - even now.<br/>A single mum, she describes how she could \"never figure out\" how the paparazzi knew where she was going to be. It led to rows with boyfriends as her relationships \"became fodder\" and fears those closest to her were selling stories.<br/>Gulati says she had hoped to find a partner and have some more children.  <br/>\"That hasn't happened because I've missed those years. I've missed those years because it was all very tumultuous, filled with paranoia and anxiety and mistrust, and you can't form relationships like that.\"<br/>It took many months to persuade people whose phones had been hacked to take part in the programme. As Miller puts it: \"The whole point of fighting these newspapers is because I was so keen to have my privacy. I feel a sense of duty to expose them as they have exposed us.\"<br/>It was a dark chapter in media history. It was also a very different time - when the tabloids were all powerful, when the right to some privacy was an afterthought, when the prejudices expressed in many newspapers were commonplace.  <br/>One of the most shocking things to watch out for are the headlines used when Simon Hughes was outed as bisexual. \"Limp Dem confesses.\" \"Another one bites the pillow.\" Terms that would never be used these days.<br/>Some argue that campaigners, many of them previously involved in Hacked Off, are using the legal system to have a go at the tabloids. They say there are conflicts of interest, not least that some stand to gain financially every time a case is successfully put through the courts. Other witnesses, they point out, are themselves convicted criminals.<br/>Wallis spent four years on bail as part of Operation Weeting, the Metropolitan Police investigation into phone hacking, before the charges were dropped.  <br/>He says what's happening is a \"campaign against journalism\", which could force parts of the British media out of business.<br/>\"You have just about anybody who's ever appeared in a tabloid newspaper saying, 'Give me large wodges of cash please'.\"<br/>Others believe the final reckoning is still unfolding.  <br/>In an alternative reality, perhaps Prince Harry would have married Chelsy Davy years ago and got on with royal life.<br/>Instead, he's leading the charge to bring about reform of the press.

He also resigned, saying he was sorry for some of his conduct. Meanwhile her inbox filled up with messages from other women relaying their own complaints about him.<br/>A local TV drama has been credited with sparking the first wave of allegations. In late April, Wave Makers, a show about Taiwanese political staffers working on an election, debuted on Netflix.<br/>In a now iconic scene, a young female aide finds herself alone with her mentor - a party spokeswoman and the show's main character.<br/>Does she dare confide the harassment she had endured from a male colleague, knowing that a public report would harm the party's standing and likely her own career?<br/>She decides to tell her. The older woman listens, and chooses to help.<br/>\"Let's not just let this go, ok,\" she says, brushing away her staffer's concerns. \"We can't let things go this easily. Otherwise we'll wither away and die.\"<br/>This scene has been credited as the clarion call for the MeToo moment now sweeping Taiwan.<br/>On 31 May, an ex-DPP staffer wrote an essay on Facebook, echoing the show.<br/>\"Let's not just let this go,\" Chen Chiemn-jou wrote before describing her experience of being sexually harassed at a work event. <br/>When she reported her complaint, she said her female supervisor - in charge of the party's women's affairs - had asked her \"Why didn't you say anything?\", before advising her to bury the claim.<br/>Chen's post has since electrified Taiwan, and been shared thousands of times. It appears to have motivated others in politics and beyond to report their experiences of harassment and how authorities responded.<br/>After Chen's report, another ex-DPP female staffer said her male supervisor had verbally abused her and stymied her complaint about another male colleague's harassment.<br/>Several senior DPP officials have resigned including Hsu Chia-tien, the supervisor in Chen's case, who was suspended by the party, and Yen Chih-fa, an adviser to the president who has denied accusations of sexual harassment by a campaigner. Neither Yen nor Hsu have responded to the BBC's requests for comment on the accusations.<br/>The opposition KMT party has also been hit with allegations. Last week a journalist said KMT lawmaker Fu Kun-chi had forcibly kissed her at a press event in 2014, allegations denied by Fu. He reiterated his public denial to the BBC, saying he had never engaged in any sexual harassment towards women or subordinates.<br/>A KMT councillor has also alleged harassment by a famous media personality, who then apologised for his behaviour, saying he'd been drunk and had no recollection of events on the night in question.<br/>More than 90 cases have now been documented in a crowd-sourced online database. Some of the most high-profile men accused include:<br/>Gender equality had been considered a source of pride in Taiwan - especially compared with neighbouring China where Beijing has promoted traditional gender roles and pressured women to have more children.<br/>There are no women in senior political leadership in China, while Taiwan has been led by a woman for nearly a decade. Female representation in Taiwan's parliament is at 43%, far higher than the global average of 29% cited by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.<br/>President Tsai has responded swiftly to the allegations, apologising twice for her party's failures.<br/>She stated last week that those who had spoken out about sexual harassment were victims, not trouble-makers and she thanked them for revealing their experiences. \"Our society as a whole must educate ourselves again,\" she said.<br/>The MeToo moment has come at a critical period in Taiwanese politics. Like on the TV show, the island is gearing up for a presidential election next January.<br/>A day after the first staffer's Facebook post, the DPP's chairman and candidate for January's elections William Lai apologised and ordered an overhaul of how the party handles sexual assault allegations.<br/>\"We won't just let it go like this,\" he said, echoing the Wave Makers TV show's phrase. He has proposed an official inquiry into the allegations and reforms to strengthen sexual harassment laws.<br/>The show's screenwriters have said they never expected a public reaction like this. They told the BBC they hoped that \"through idealised depictions of addressing workplace harassment in drama, people can find a shared language to express their expectations of how such issues should be handled\".<br/>There is no doubt a reckoning is in motion, observers say, adding that it is a significant time in Taiwan for addressing gender and sexual abuse.<br/>But it is also a raw period for many survivors, plunged headlong into a traumatic public conversation. Many are sceptical of promises for lasting change.<br/>For Ms Tseng, the woman who received an apology last week, she's grateful the TV show opened up the conversation.<br/>But that pivotal scene of support and validation - and not suppression - still seems like a fantasy, she says.<br/>\"While watching the show, I felt a strong connection but I don't have a supportive supervisor like the ones portrayed on television who fight for justice,\" she said.<br/>\"In the dramas, the female party leader eventually apologises and tells the victims to wait for her to catch up with their pursuit of justice.

The hotter they get, the harder they have to work and the more energy they use,\" she says.<br/>Which means the battery life gets drained more quickly, especially as it's harder to cool.<br/>Dr Roz says we often turn up screen brightness when outside in the sunshine, which can also have an impact.<br/>\"They also use energy to monitor their own state, and basically have to do more work.\"<br/>If you've noticed a slight change in your screen, the heat might have had an impact.<br/>\"If it's an older phone, if there's a slight defect in it, the heat will magnify it,\" says Dr Roz.<br/>She adds that screen protectors can often hold more heat inside, which isn't good in hot conditions. <br/>Don't stick it on charge<br/>\"If it's really hot, when you are charging your battery, you are generating heat. When your device has been on charge, it ends up being hotter,\" Dr Roz says.<br/>Position it smartly<br/>\"Keeping it out of direct sunlight helps. Don't leave it in your car, keep in the shade as much as possible. Put it in front of a fan if you can.\"<br/>Keep it light<br/>That applies to both the inside and outside of the phone. Take it out of a case and turn off all the functions you do not need.<br/>\"If you're not using the GPS, if you're not using stuff, turn it off. Because the less stuff you actually use, the less energy you're going to use, the less heat it's going to generate,\" she says.<br/>Low power mode<br/>The less power you use, the better off your phone will be.<br/>\"Sometimes just simply, if your phone's really struggling, turn it off for a few minutes, just let it all cool down, and then turn it back on again.\"<br/>But do not use a fridge or freezer...<br/>\"Don't stick it in a bag of ice, because that doesn't help it.\" <br/>Rapid temperature changes can be really bad for phones, and the ice can lead to water becoming trapped in it.<br/>Dr Roz says phones have overheat mechanisms built into them to stop them from \"destroying themselves, which can happen in really bad heat\".<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Yes, it's been officially hot!

But it's still not clear which countries will be willing to provide the jets, how many, or even when.<br/>Supplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets will \"not be a silver bullet\" or a \"quick fix\", says the head of Norway's Air Force. Maj Gen Rolf Folland says it'll take time for Ukraine to develop the ability to operate Western jets with complex weapons. <br/>We meet at a large allied air exercise taking place over Norway, Finland and Sweden. It involves 150 fighter planes - many more than the entire Ukrainian Air Force. <br/>Gen Folland says the training is about dominating the skies - to avoid what he calls the type of \"old fashioned\" conflict now taking place in Ukraine. <br/>To gain supremacy of the air requires a level of scale and sophistication that Ukraine will not be able to replicate. Even providing a small fleet of F-16s could prove a major challenge.<br/>It took Pulse, a Belgian pilot, three years to master his F-16 fighter. We've been asked to use his call sign, not his real name. <br/>He shows us round his F-16, originally designed in the late 1970s, long before he was born.<br/>\"It flies like a dream\", he says. \"But flying is the easiest part. The rest is more difficult.\" <br/>That includes learning to operate the F-16's radar, sensors and weapons. Ukraine, which currently has more pilots than aircraft, is hoping to compress that training into months.<br/>Pulse sees the logic of providing Western jets to Ukraine. He points to his F-16's weapons: air-to-air missiles to destroy enemy aircraft, and bombs to hit targets on the ground. \"That's important,\" says Pulse, \"because you can use any weapons from Nato stocks with this jet.\"<br/>But then there's the question of maintaining the jets. <br/>The Norwegian Air Force, like others in Europe, has transitioned to the more modern F-35. So in theory there should be F-16s available for Ukraine. <br/>At Orland air base they use two of their old F-16s to train aircraft engineers. That can take a year - even longer for a senior aircraft technician. <br/>\"You can't just hand over a fighter aircraft and say off you go!\" Col Martin Tesli, the base commander and a former F-16 pilot, says. <br/>He says there's a large logistical tail - spare parts, software and weapons. But he too understands the need to modernise Ukraine's fleet of old Soviet-era jets. <br/>\"At a certain point, if they're not provided with another aircraft, they won't have an air force to defend themselves.\"<br/>Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine would probably need the help of Western contractors to keep any F-16s flying. The obvious question, is what country is willing to accept the obvious risks of putting their own people on the ground? <br/>Professor Bronk adds that Russia is only more likely to target Ukraine's air bases if it's supplied with Western jets. That's a danger for the single engine F-16, which has a large intake that can suck up debris from the runway.<br/>These are good reasons why the US has, for so long, resisted pressure from Ukraine to provide F-16s. It's less about fears of escalation, and more about the practicalities of operating and maintaining the jets. The Pentagon has warned it'll be both complex and costly.<br/>Nor is providing Ukraine with Western fighters likely to significantly alter the battle on the ground. <br/>Lt Col Neils Van Hussen, a former F-16 pilot of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, says \"not a single weapons system will change a big war\". F-16s, he believes, would simply give Ukraine \"the ability to sustain what they're doing now\". <br/>The reality of this war is that even Russia, with its sizeable air force, has not been able to dominate the skies. Ground-based air defence systems are helping to prevent that from happening.<br/>Providing Ukraine with more air defences will continue to be the immediate priority for the West. Rebuilding its air force is a longer term goal.<br/>Duelling with Russian jets in the skies over Ukraine<br/>What will it take for Ukraine's offensive to succeed?<br/>Crucial questions as US supports fighter jets to Ukraine<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Two of those who went to the south London venue that night never came home, and their families are still waiting for answers about what happened.<br/>Social media footage showed long queues of people, many thought to be ticketless, trying to gain entry to the sold-out gig by Afrobeats artist Asake on 15 December.<br/>Nursing graduate Rebecca Ikumelo, 33, from Newham in east London, and security dog-handler Gaby Hutchinson, 23, from Gravesend in Kent, both died from the injuries they sustained in the crush. A third person, a 21-year-old woman, remains in a serious condition in hospital.<br/>\"She was stunning, so, so beautiful,\" says Rebecca's aunt Mary Ikumelo. \"Such a beautiful individual, not only on the outside but also inside.\"<br/>\"Rebecca was a bubbly person,\" says her mother Yetunde Olodo, 59. \"She was very outgoing, caring, loving. She was an amazing mother.\"<br/>Her children, aged seven and five, face growing up without her. \"She's got two young kids, they're missing their mom,\" says Yetunde.<br/>\"They don't really know what actually happened to their mom. We really want justice.\" <br/>Speaking to Rebecca's family, their pride at the work she did to support parents of autistic children shines through.<br/>\"A lot of women that reached out said the most amazing things about her, how she selflessly always had time for them,\" Mary adds.<br/>\"She would give them routines, she would just give them little gems on how to help their children with the autism. <br/>\"That's strangers reaching out to say how amazing an individual was so you can imagine how blessed the people to have her in their lives constantly were.\"<br/>Like Rebecca's family, Gaby's relatives have photographs and memories on social media to help remember Gaby.<br/>\"I feel that if you ever met Gaby while she was alive, you would never forget her,\" her mum Christine told the BBC. \"She would make a really big impression on you, hopefully a good one.<br/>\"My heart feels like it's broken. It's never going to mend again. I wish it had been me rather than her because she had a life to live and at least I've lived 60 years.\"<br/>Gaby's sister Nina described her sibling as \"a great soul\". The 32-year-old said: \"She had a lot of passion in there. She was a real laugh. She was just so loving and caring.\"<br/>Half a year on, Christine and Nina say it still does not \"feel real\". They both paid tribute to Gaby's selflessness.<br/>\"She never would have walked out there knowing someone else was in danger or needed help,\" Nina adds. \"She would have stayed and that's what she did. She's a hero, she really is. <br/>\"Maybe a stupid one, but she's our hero and we're grateful that we did get the time that we had with her.\"<br/>Both families want anyone with any information or footage to share it with police, who say they have spoken to hundreds of people who were there.<br/>\"We're angry that there are things that haven't gone right that has led to people dying or being seriously injured and we just want those people to have justice,\" Nina says.<br/>\"We want to know how it happened, we want to know why it happened,\" adds Mary, \"and then we just want to know how are we moving forward going to prevent this from happening to somebody else's daughter, mum, sister, niece.<br/>\"All we want is justice, for people to come forward and help us. Whatever they know, they should come and tell the police.<br/>\"It's really, really important for all of us as a community to stand together and to just make sure that this type of thing doesn't happen again.\"<br/>Brixton Academy's operator the Academy Music Group, which hopes the venue can reopen despite the Met's opposition, previously said it was \"devastated\" about the deaths and that it had \"engaged collaboratively\" with both Lambeth Council and the Metropolitan Police since the crush.<br/>Det Ch Insp Nigel Penney, the senior investigating officer, said a criminal investigation is being conducted involving a range of potential offences such as \"corporate manslaughter, criminal negligence manslaughter, unlawful act manslaughter and health and safety at work offences, along with violent disorder and offences against the person or assaults\".<br/>He said he was \"extremely confident\" police would get to the bottom of what happened - but explained that he needed more witnesses to \"help me piece together the puzzle as to how that crush ever happened in the first place\".<br/>He told the BBC hundreds of statements had already been taken but \"there were thousands of people there, so there's still a lot to do\".<br/>The detective said his message was a simple one: \"Come forward with anything you know, even if it's something you've heard.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It said this was \"slightly higher than last winter\" and \"broadly in line with those of recent winters\".<br/>However, its \"base case\" scenario assumes normal energy market conditions with no disruptions to supplies.<br/>National Grid said it is taking steps to \"minimise the potential impact to electricity customers\" in the UK if supplies were disrupted again.<br/>Alongside maintaining its energy-saving scheme for households to get discounts on bills, it said it was holding discussions about having two coal power stations on standby. The amount available to the grid if required has fallen from five in 2022 to two, with two now closed down and one other unable to be called upon.<br/>The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. <br/>The UK also imports electricity from continental Europe.<br/>The squeeze on supplies led to household energy bills soaring as gas prices rocketed.<br/>The government stepped in late last year to limit bills to \u00a32,500 a year for a typical household. But, despite gas prices falling back, energy bills remain elevated.<br/>A typical property will pay \u00a32,074 a year for gas and electricity from July, far above winter 2021 when bills were around \u00a31,277.<br/>The Demand Flexibility Service offered people the chance to be paid to use less electricity during peak times when capacity on the grid was tight, but only homes with smart meters were able to take part.<br/>Only 14 million households in England, Scotland and Wales, where the scheme was on offer, have a smart electricity meter installed.<br/>National Grid said 1.6 million households and businesses who were customers of 31 energy suppliers participated in the scheme across 22 \"events\" last winter.<br/>People were asked to avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines for a one-hour period.<br/>It said the amount of energy saved was enough to power almost 10 million homes, but it is not yet known how much money, on average, each household earned. <br/>Individual suppliers decided how much customers received and whether the money was taken off bills, credited to accounts, or if it could be withdrawn as cash.<br/>National Grid said consumers in the south, east and east midlands of England reduced their demand the most.<br/>The operator is consulting energy suppliers to improve the service ahead of the winter.<br/>What is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?<br/>Government rules out more help on energy bills<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

going from the primary school - do we get our youngest in the same school as his siblings - then in a couple of years' time when oldest Rory is going to high school, is there going to be space in that school, is the quality of education going to be there because of its size.<br/>\"We've got friends who are already talking about moving away, purely from an education perspective.<br/>\"It is a difficult task for them [the council] in terms of being able to predict the future but I think the fact they were being advised by the parent council that their calculations are incorrect, and the fact they didn't listen to that is very disappointing.<br/>\"And now the cost to the taxpayer is going to be significant too to rectify that.\"<br/>A recent report by Renfrewshire Council at options to address the problem said the cost of a new primary school in Dargavel, capable of accommodating 800 pupils, would be up to \u00a345m. <br/>In addition, an expansion of Park Mains High School in Erskine, to accommodate 400 extra pupils, would also be required with an estimated cost of up to \u00a330m.<br/>Alan Kelly, chairman of the Dargavel Primary Parent Council, said many parents were now worried that Park Mains will not have enough capacity and said the situation is \"causing people a lot of stress and anguish\".<br/>He added: \"There is not suitable school provision for all the children who are going to be here - the council has massively let the community down.<br/>\"Going back to at least 2018 there were community groups voicing strong concerns that the school is not big enough, the number of houses significantly increased from about 2,500 to 4,000 and Renfrewshire Council kept the plans the same - that is where it has gone wrong.\"<br/>An independent review into the circumstances of how that roll-projection error was made is due to be published later. <br/>A spokesman for Renfrewshire Council said: \"We apologise sincerely to the Dargavel community and fully acknowledge their frustration over the issues with school capacity in the area, due to significant errors previously made when calculating projected pupil numbers.<br/>\"Our focus is on working with the community to put in place the best possible solutions for primary and secondary school provision.\"<br/>Council faces \u00a375m bill after school built too small<br/>Apology after primary school built too small<br/>dargavel study<br/>Wildfire risk is now 'extreme' in Helensburgh and Lomond as heatwave goes on<br/>Millions secured for people living with cancer or long-term health condition<br/>Community garden in east end of Greenock offers disabled access to allotments<br/>For sale: Inside the half-finished Scottish HQ of the Orange Order in Motherwell listed for \u00a3300k<br/>Dedicated Gourock nurse who met Queen Elizabeth II celebrates reaching century<br/>Serial robber told victims 'have a nice day' after knife threat<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We made this effort knowing we were not going to win.\"<br/>Following the two churches' expulsion, a constitutional amendment was also passed at SBC's annual convention stating that SBC-affiliated churches should employ \"only men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by Scripture\" - though that is subject to approval at next year's convention.<br/>Mike Law, a pastor at Arlington Baptist Church in Texas, said the amendment \"puts us all on the same page about what a pastor is, and who a pastor is: a biblically qualified man.\"<br/>But Bob Bender, a pastor at Bross Fellowship Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, opposed the motion. \"Should not title and function be synonymous?\" he asked in quotes cited by the Baptist Press. <br/>\"Let's not give women responsibilities to shepherd other women, children or youth and not have their title line up with their responsibilities.\"<br/>In recent years the SBC has come under increasingly scrutiny from officials. <br/>In 2022, it was found to have covered up decades of abuse within the church.<br/>A report found that survivors who reported child and sexual abuse within the SBC were met with \"resistance, stonewalling, and even outright hostility from some within\" the church. <br/>Southern Baptists vow 'healing' after abuse claims<br/>US probes Southern Baptist sex abuse claims<br/>First woman pastor in Holy Land ordained<br/>Pope backs women's roles in Catholic services<br/>Church approves women bishops<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is unclear what will happen to those investments. Mr Odey also has around $600m of his own money invested in the firm.<br/>One of those funds, the Odey Swan Fund, is already being liquidated after investors began to withdraw money.<br/>The financier is well known in the City for having made large sums of money betting against the UK pound and British government bonds in recent years. <br/>In 2020, Mr Odey was accused of assaulting a female investment banker at his London home in 1998, but was cleared of indecent assault after a trial. <br/>Following the case, his company reportedly undertook an internal investigation into the financier's behaviour and handed its findings to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog.<br/>OAM told the regulator at the time that it had decided to keep Mr Odey on as chief executive after giving him a \"final written warning\" for inappropriate behaviour.<br/>However, on Wednesday, MPs on the Treasury Committee wrote to the FCA asking whether it had been proactive enough in its oversight of the fund. <br/>It followed reports that the watchdog had been investigating the company since 2021.<br/>The FCA has been asked to reveal what it knew about the claims against Mr Odey and what action it took, going back five years. <br/>The MPs have given it until 5 July to respond. <br/>A spokesperson for the FCA said: \"We understand the Treasury Committee's interest in this and we'll of course reply shortly.\" <br/>MPs grill financial watchdog over Odey probe<br/>City boss ousted after sexual misconduct claims<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

when they were running around to correct their mistakes, which they have done. <br/>\"So it was really something which has upset me so much.\"<br/>Ms Pattison, who worked for CPFT as a health care assistant at the time, made a formal complaint to the trust.<br/>The BBC has separately spoken to consultant nurse and psychotherapist Des McVey, who was asked by the trust to investigate a complaint in July 2021, understood to be the one from Ms Pattison.<br/>Mr McVey said: \"I noticed that the deceased did have care plans, but they were written the day after his death and they were also evaluated the day after his death and I was concerned that this wasn't picked up by the SUI.\"<br/>He said this \"really alarmed me\", adding: \"Surprisingly, there was no care plan to address his suicidal ideation and he had... an extensive history of trying to kill himself.\"<br/>He was also concerned about the methodology used to investigate possible racism by comparing the death to two Caucasian suicides, which he said \"demonstrated a poor understanding of the complexities of institutional racism\".<br/>Mr McVey said he told a manager he believed the SUI \"was not credible\" and said he could not complete the complaint investigation.<br/>He said he made them aware of his view \"that the risk assessment was so remarkably wrong, that they hadn't answered to why they'd taken him off the [community treatment order] against the advice of his current team\".<br/>He said they \"had made so many speculative conclusions without any evidence, in fact sometimes evidence to the contrary\".<br/>But Mr McVey said no-one contacted him for six or seven weeks, before finding out the investigation had been given to someone else.<br/>Mr McVey left the trust in early 2022 but said in June he contacted the new chief executive, Anna Hills, to raise his concerns \"that there was possibly criminal activity going on, falsification of documentation and that the SUI was un-credible\".<br/>Ms Hills said an investigation would be completed but he has not heard back, he claimed.<br/>Mr Ndhlovu's mother, from Newmarket, Suffolk, said: \"I believe that if everything worked well Charles' death was going to be preventable, because there were so many things... to avoid his death.\"<br/>CPFT has previously been criticised by a coroner over a serious untoward incident concerning the death of James Nowshadi, that it was \"not credible\" and had taken matters on \"face value\".<br/>The co-author told the inquest that a reference to the method of Mr Nowshadi's suicide was removed after the review was \"touched up\" by others.<br/>Mr McVey said CPFT needed have an external audit into their serious untoward incidents, stating: \"How many un-credible SUIs have been done by the trust?\"<br/>In response to the allegations, a spokesman for CPFT said: \"The death of Mr Ndhlovu was tragic, and our continued condolences are extended to his family.<br/>\"Patient safety and the learnings from all deaths are vital to us to enable improvements in care.<br/>\"While there was a delay in investigating a complaint made by Mr Ndhlovu's mother - for which we sincerely apologised - those concerns were rigorously investigated in 2022, and a further review was conducted by our director of nursing following concerns raised to the new CEO.<br/>\"Over the past year, we have strengthened our processes around complaints and incidents, and the learnings from the review have played an important role in that.<br/>\"While there was no evidence of any racial discrimination towards Mr Ndhlovu during his treatment, we take any accusation of prejudice in our practices extremely seriously and will always fully investigate concerns raised.\"<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

He also played hockey and rugby. <br/>His family said: \"Complete devastation is not enough to describe our pain and loss at the senseless murder of our son.<br/>\"Barnaby Philip John Webber was a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to.\"<br/>The family of Ms O'Malley-Kumar - a first-year medical student who excelled in hockey and cricket - issued a statement saying: \"Grace was an adored daughter and sister; she was truly wonderful and a beautiful young lady.<br/>\"We were so incredibly proud of Grace's achievements and what a truly lovely person she was.\"<br/>Mr Coates, who police had previously said was in his 50s, was described by LEAD Academy Trust as a \"much-loved colleague who always went the extra mile\".<br/>Visiting the scene where Mr Coates was found fatally stabbed, his sons Lee and James Coates said their dad was due to retire in four months.<br/>\"We know as much as everybody else,\" Lee said. \"He was a die-hard [Nottingham] Forest fan and an avid fisherman.<br/>\"He used to take under-privileged kids fishing just to get away from crime.

This incident took place just under two miles (3.2km) away from the scene of the first two killings.<br/>The suspect then attempted to run over a man in the Milton Street area - he was left in a critical condition, but a Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust spokesman said he was now stable. <br/>He then attempted to run over two other pedestrians in the Sherwood Street area, who are believed to have suffered minor injuries. <br/>In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, police said they have reported this part of the incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IPOC), because a marked police car followed behind the suspect's van for a short distance before it hit the two pedestrians. <br/>Police said they then stopped the van in Maples Street where a 31-year-old man was Tasered and arrested at about 05:30 BST.<br/>The two 19-year-olds killed in Ilkeston Road were students at the University of Nottingham who had just finished their exams at the end of their first year.<br/>They have been formally identified as Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar.<br/>Mr Webber, from Taunton in Somerset, was studying history at Nottingham and was a talented amateur cricketer.<br/>His parents, David and Emma Webber, and younger brother Charlie, said he was \"a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to.\"<br/>Speaking to thousands of students gathered at a vigil at the university on Wednesday, his father said: \"I'm lost for words, I've lost my baby boy.\"<br/>\"I know Barney would be super touched by everyone here,\" he said.<br/>In a statement, Taunton School, where he attended from nursery through to sixth form, said: \"In his long association with the school, he touched the lives of many staff, pupils and parents and his loss will be very difficult to come to terms with.\"<br/>Ms O'Malley-Kumar was a medical student who had undertaken work placements in a GP surgery and volunteered for the nationwide vaccination programme in the Covid pandemic. <br/>She was also said to have been a talented hockey player, having been a member of England Hockey's under-16 and under-18 squads.<br/>Her parents and brother James said she was \"truly a wonderful and beautiful young lady.

They have said that they were keeping an \"open mind\" and working alongside counter-terrorism police, as would normally be the case for an incident like this.<br/>A statement released on Thursday said: \"A team of dedicated detectives is continuing to question the suspect and building up a strong picture of what happened that morning.<br/>\"This has included CCTV gathering, forensics, eye-witness accounts and searching a number of properties in the city.\"<br/>They said that the families of all victims are being supported by specially trained officers. <br/>The police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the attacks.<br/>Officers searched a number of addresses across the city throughout Tuesday.<br/>Around lunchtime on Tuesday, armed officers raided a property in Ilkeston Road, the street where Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar were earlier found dead.<br/>Forensic officers were also looking at a dented white Vauxhall van in Bentinck Road near the scene of the arrest.<br/>A dedicated police phone line has been set up and anyone concerned about family or friends can call 0800 096 1011.<br/>Lynn Haggitt witnessed the van being driven into two people in Milton Street. <br/>She said she saw the driver look in his mirror and see a police car behind him. At that point, he \"quickened up\" before going \"straight into\" them, she said.<br/>\"The woman went on the kerb and the man went up in the air,\" she said. \"It was such a bang - I wish I never saw it - it's really shaken me up.<br/>\"I went over.

Everyone seemed to either be in tears or on the verge of them.<br/>The most affecting moment was an unplanned one: David Webber and Sanjoy Kumar, the fathers of the two students who were killed just the day before, took to the podium at the end to address the huge crowd of mourning students.<br/>The university was not expecting them to speak. Despite being stricken with grief, they both talked about their children with eloquence and empathy, in a moment that those who witnessed it are unlikely to forget.<br/>Flowers were laid for the students, who were killed as they walked home after a night out.<br/>Mr Webber read history at the university and Ms O'Malley-Kumar studied medicine.<br/>In a moving speech, student union community officer Daisy Forster told the families the city's students would support them, adding \"we will always be here when you need us\".<br/>The Reverend Grant Walton, from the university chaplaincy, described the deaths as \"one of those moments which we hoped we'd never encounter\" while the university's vice-chancellor, Professor Shearer West, said the lives of the victims had been \"curtailed\" by a \"seemingly random\" act of violence.<br/>Both students were keen and talented sportspeople and their university team-mates, wearing sports kit, were among the crowd assembled to remember them.<br/>Mr Webber, of Taunton, Somerset, played hockey, rugby and cricket and Ms O'Malley-Kumar played hockey and cricket.<br/>Prof Shearer West told the crowd: \"What should have been a time of celebration and relaxation following the exam period has become a time to mourn tragic loss in the most unimaginable of circumstances.\"<br/>She said the university was supporting both students' families, adding support was available to any students or colleagues affected by the tragedy.<br/>The university and communities across Nottingham had come together in \"grief and remembrance of two much-loved students\", she added.<br/>Mr Coates, whose sons had earlier left tributes at the scene of his death, was also remembered at the event.<br/>While visiting the scene where Mr Coates was found fatally stabbed, Lee and James Coates said their dad was due to retire in four months.<br/>\"He used to take under-privileged kids fishing just to get away from crime.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death.<br/>The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered.<br/>At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the 'Alpha' variant by the WHO.<br/>The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus.<br/>Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to \"excess deaths\". <br/>As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK.<br/>The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus.<br/>But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid.<br/>More than 44 million people in the UK were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known.<br/>The ONS ran a regular survey through the pandemic: testing randomly chosen people in order to estimate the number of people who had the virus.<br/>Based on the survey, the estimated peak of the pandemic, in cases if not in deaths, was in late March 2022, where at one point about 4.9 million people were thought to have the virus. However, the survey did not capture the first wave of the pandemic, with trials only beginning in England in April 2020.<br/>Figures are still regularly published on the number of recorded coronavirus cases across the UK, from PCR and lateral flow tests. However, recorded cases are not considered to present the most accurate picture for a variety of reasons, including the availability and reach of testing.<br/>Patients were admitted to hospital with coronavirus more than 1.1 million times between March 2020 and 5 May 2023 across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br/>These were people who tested positive up to two weeks before arriving at hospital, or while being treated. <br/>In Wales the figures were counted differently, with about 43,000 admissions of those who either had, or were suspected to have, the virus.<br/>The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus peaked in the week to 20 January 2021, at more than 38,000 people.<br/>When a new national lockdown was announced on 5 January 2021, across hospitals in England about one in four general admission beds were occupied by patients with coronavirus.<br/>This period was the first time the health service had to cope with both normal winter pressures, and the additional strain from Covid, which was spreading among an unvaccinated population with little immunity.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>'Little thought' about lockdown impact pre-pandemic, inquiry hears<br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They lost loved ones and the ability to mourn properly.\"<br/>Lady Hallett said she would do \"everything in her power\" to explore what happened and what lessons needed to be learned, saying the inquiry would be \"thorough and fair\".<br/>\"Those who have suffered will be at the heart of the inquiry,\" she added.<br/>During the session in London it was also announced which individuals and organisations will be core participants for the first module - this entitles them to access documents and make submissions.<br/>Groups representing bereaved relatives, government departments, the health secretary, the UK Health Security Agency and NHS England have all been appointed core participant status, alongside public health officials and ministers in the devolved nations.<br/>Lawyers have also been setting out how the inquiry will proceed. Members of the public and other groups not awarded core participant status will still get to submit evidence, and there will be more informal listening events around the country which people can attend.<br/>The public hearings where people are called to give evidence do not start until the spring. But the start of the first preliminary hearing is still being seen as an important milestone for the families who lost loved ones.<br/>However, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign said the listening exercise was flawed.<br/>Group co-founder Matt Fowler said he was concerned families would be marginalised, since the listening exercise was being run by a third-party, including PR firms that had won government contracts during the pandemic.<br/>\"This clearly risks a conflict of interest, and it's hard to see how we can have confidence that our experiences will be listened to accurately and fairly,\" he said.<br/>Lindsay Jackson's mother, Sylvia, 87, died from Covid during the first lockdown, after contracting it at a care home.<br/>Ms Jackson, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said it was essential lessons were learned.<br/>She was \"really pleased\" the inquiry was finally starting, but said it had taken too long to reach this stage. <br/>\"It's two-and-a-half years since the pandemic started. We lost so many people. If people have done things wrong, they need to be held accountable.<br/>\"For me, my family and the others who lost loved ones, it's important that answers are found to the questions that we have.\"<br/>Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic at the start, under the spotlight.<br/>Last year, a report by MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures.<br/>It said the government approach - backed by its scientists - to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection had delayed the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives.<br/>And a report by spending watchdog the National Audit Office, published in late 2021, found ministers had not been properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job-support schemes and school disruption.<br/>One issue likely to come under scrutiny in module one is how much was learned from Exercise Cygnus, a 2016 government exercise simulating a flu pandemic. <br/>Meanwhile, Lady Poole, the judge appointed in December, to lead the inquiry into the Scottish government's Covid response has resigned from the role for personal reasons.<br/>UK Covid infections continuing to rise<br/>Covid Inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers<br/>Covid inquiry's public hearings to begin in 2023<br/>UK Covid inquiry draft terms of reference set out<br/>Ex-judge to chair Covid pandemic inquiry<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It calls for ethnic minority communities to be \"placed firmly at the centre\" of the inquiry.<br/>It has been signed by 26 other organisations - a mix of equality campaigners, such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the Ubele initiative, and health bodies, including the NHS BME Network and London-based Guys and St Thomas's Foundation.<br/>The letter was sent ahead of a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, which is looking at the role of the healthcare system in the pandemic. <br/>The inquiry will begin hearing evidence in June. Before then, preliminary sessions are being held to agree which issues should be examined in each section of the inquiry.<br/>The Covid inquiry told BBC News that it is committed to looking at inequalities, and that their impact on the pandemic will be at the forefront of its investigations.<br/>For those who've lost family members, this promise to look at inequalities generally doesn't go far enough. They believe ethnicity should be examined separately.<br/>Lobby Akinnola, whose father, Femi, died with Covid in April 2020 at the age of 60, said \"there's no way [race] couldn't have\" played a role in his dad's death.<br/>His father was a regular gym-goer, with no underlying health conditions, he said.<br/>\"He was a black man in England,\" Lobby, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, said. <br/>\"Racism is pervasive in every aspect of life. My dad really highlights why it's so important to look at this as a systemic and structural problem, because he did everything right.\"<br/>As a carer, Femi was a \"key worker\". At the time, people from minority ethnic communities were statistically more likely to be classified as key workers - particularly in people-facing jobs that left them more exposed to the virus.<br/>\"He was going to work with his winter gloves and scarves as makeshift PPE. There's nothing more this man could have done to try and stay alive,\" Lobby said.<br/>At a hearing on 14 February, the inquiry's barrister said looking at racism in the first part of the inquiry - which will examine how prepared the UK was for a pandemic - would be \"an impossible task\". <br/>The Covid inquiry told BBC News it had instructed \"two world-leading inequalities experts\" to contribute to the first module.<br/>Lobby wants stories like his father's to be heard in the inquiry \"because we've seen first-hand the consequences\" of racial inequality. <br/>\"As a black man from a black family, it feels like race and the impact that race had in the pandemic has also... just been sidelined, too.

In a Facebook post, Ms Soufi said the situation became \"complicated\" when a ship approached the vessel and tied ropes to it while throwing bottles of water on board.<br/>She said some of the people on board had felt in \"extreme danger\" due to fears the rope could cause the boat to flip, and that fights on board over water could result in it capsizing. The boat then moved away.<br/>The coastguard said that in the early hours of Wednesday the boat's engine broke down and that people on board started to move around causing it to capsize. All of the 104 people rescued were male.<br/>Alarm Phone, an emergency helpline for migrants in trouble at sea, complained that the coastguard had been \"aware of the ship being in distress for hours before any help was sent\", adding that authorities \"had been informed by different sources\" that the boat was in trouble.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Survivors winched to safety after Greece boat disaster<br/>However, coastguard spokesperson Nikos Alexiou said they tried to convince the vessel to get help and \"stayed by if they needed us to save people\".<br/>Former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras visited Kalamata on Thursday and spoke to survivors about what they thought had gone wrong.<br/>\"The Greek coastguard asked the vessel to follow them, but they couldn't,\" a translator explained. \"The coastguard then threw a rope but because they didn't know how to pull the rope, the vessel started dangling right and left,\" <br/>\"The coastguard boat was going too fast but the vessel was already dangling to the left, and that's how it sank.\"<br/>Greece is observing three days of mourning.

In the case of the minor, police had invoked the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. <br/>Mr Singh, who has denied all the allegations, accuses the wrestlers of being \"politically motivated\" and recently said he would \"hang himself even if a single allegation is proved\" against him.<br/>On Thursday, Delhi police submitted two separate sets of documents in two different courts - a 1,000-page charge sheet detailing their investigation into the overall allegations and a second shorter one in the case of the minor complainant.<br/>In the past few days, reports said the minor had withdrawn her allegations amid reports that she had been \"pressurised into withdrawing the charges\". Mr Singh had refused to comment on the allegations, saying \"let law take its course\".<br/>Legal experts say now it's up to the judge to decide whether to accept the recommendation and close the case or not. The case will be heard on 4 July.<br/>On Thursday, as details of charges against Mr Singh began to be revealed, legal experts and analysts said most of them were bailable offences - which means Mr Singh is unlikely to be arrested soon.<br/>The wrestlers held their first protest in January but called it off after Mr Singh was stripped of his administrative powers by the sports ministry and the government promised to investigate their complaints. After the government did not reveal the findings of the oversight panel that investigated their allegations, the wrestlers resumed their protest in April, also calling for his arrest.<br/>Last month, they threatened to throw their medals into the Ganges - India's holiest river. But leaders of an influential farming group, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), persuaded them not to do so just yet, saying they would launch nationwide protests if Mr Singh was not arrested.<br/>The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for not acting strongly or swiftly enough against Mr Singh as he's a member of the governing party.

But not Mr Alhassan - he was returning from a market. <br/>He shows no emotion as he returns to the bank of the river where he had managed to swim to safety.<br/>It is low tide when I meet him. The river is still and his gaze is fixed on the horizon.<br/>But as he remembers the parents who drowned with their children, including his sister and her eight-year-old son, the tears come flooding down his face.<br/>\"The women remained behind trying to carry their children - some of them had three or four children.<br/>\"There were also fathers who died the same way trying to save their kids,\" he says.<br/>Had he tried to help save them too, he would have drowned, he says.<br/>So he swam to safety, but as he did so, he saw the horrifying scene as mothers and fathers sank along with their children as they tried to save them.<br/>He is thankful he survived but still traumatised from seeing all those people die, especially the children.<br/>Close to 300 people were travelling in the wooden boat when it capsized on Monday, authorities said.<br/>Travelling across the Niger, Nigeria's longest river, can be perilous in some areas. The wooden boats are often overcrowded, there are not enough life jackets and some of the journey is made in the dark, so accidents are not uncommon especially during the rainy season between April and October.<br/>Most of the incidents happen in the central Niger state and neighbouring areas. Three years ago in Kebbi state at least 50 people died after their boat capsized. <br/>There have also been other deadly boats accidents recently in Kano in the north, and the southern states of Lagos and Anambra, where 76 people died in October last year. <br/>Despite the dangers, for many communities that live on the banks of the River Niger, it is the only form of travel they know.<br/>Most of them, like Mr Alhassan have made the journey countless times in the past.<br/>He was sitting at the head of the boat this time, he recalls. <br/>The boat had left in darkness just before 03:00GMT, some of the children had dozed off in their parents' arms and were carried on board. <br/>But five minutes after they took off, he heard a loud crack that split the boat in two, he says.<br/>The police say the boat capsized after part of the vessel collapsed, causing it to flood. But the Emir of Patigi - the local traditional ruler - told journalists that river waves overtook the boat and forced it to crash into a tree that had washed into the river.<br/>In Ebo, a community in Kwara state which lost 61 people in the tragedy, many of the young survivors have gathered under the biggest tree in the middle of the village.<br/>On another day, they might have been discussing a football match or joking with each other, but they are in mourning.<br/>Some of them were on the boat and managed to swim to safety but the horrors of seeing friends, relatives and strangers they had met at the loading dock drown, is one they will never forget.<br/>Aisha Mohammed, who lives close to the tree, was not on the boat but her three daughters were.<br/>She had bid them farewell as they travelled to the wedding, looking forward to the day when guests would come to her house for wedding ceremonies. All three daughters were set to get married this year, she says in the local Nupe language.<br/>\"We are all grieving from this sad incident and only pray Allah to ease our pains,\" says the local chief Liman Umar.<br/>\"In our community we do things together. When we rejoice, we do as one and now that this has befallen us, we are all not sleeping,\" he says.<br/>He was coordinating the rescue efforts, relaying information from the divers to the emir but that has now been abandoned.<br/>Local people say they have faced heavy rains in the last couple of days and received no help from the government to find survivors.<br/>They are now waiting for missing bodies to float to the river surface so they can collect them, their leaders say.<br/>Some of the boats that ply the Niger travel at night to evade authorities and passengers are often indifferent about the life jackets, many tell me.<br/>But this has to change says Abdul Gana, a local leader in the nearby town of Kpada which lost four people in the tragedy.<br/>\"We want  government to wade in and provide protective gear for the people whenever they make use of the boats.\"<br/>\"The governor should look into road infrastructure - the reason our people prefer travelling on the Niger is because there are no access roads to link up with other communities,\" he says.<br/>It is a sentiment shared by state governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq, who visited the community to offer condolences.<br/>He talked about providing 1,000 life jackets to the community to enhance their safety during travels.<br/>There was also talk of stronger laws to punish those who refuse to abide by safety regulations.<br/>But as he left, the banks of the Niger were already teeming with the wooden boats and their passengers, hardly any of whom were wearing life jackets.<br/>There is a feeling the life jackets will take some time to arrive, but like the flow of the tide on the Niger, life must continue.<br/>Over 100 dead after Nigeria wedding boat capsizes<br/>At least 76 killed in Nigeria boat accident<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This person harassed me, sexually assaulted me,\" Ms Thorpe said. <br/>Mr Van immediately dismissed the allegations. \"It is simply not true,\" he told the chamber. <br/>Ms Thorpe later withdrew the claims in order to comply with parliamentary standing orders - which are a series of rules that govern conduct within the Senate - before announcing she would address the issue further.<br/>On Thursday, Ms Thorpe said she would not name her perpetrator to comply with Senate rules, before then alleging she was \"cornered in a stairwell\" by a male colleague. <br/>\"As all women that have walked the corridors of this building know, it is not a safe place,\" she said.<br/>Ms Thorpe also alleged she had \"experienced sexual comments and was inappropriately propositioned by powerful men\" when she first became a senator. <br/>\"Let me say this in the clearest possible terms, Senator Thorpe's allegations are concocted from beginning to end.

He then saw a \"suspicious vehicle and fired several times into the air in violation of orders\".   <br/>This prompted a soldier stationed at the guard post who heard the shots to open fire on the Tamimis' car outside their home, according to the report. He believed the gunmen were using it to flee and had received permission from his commander. <br/>A military helicopter was used to transport Mohammed Tamimi to an Israeli hospital, but he died of his injuries four days later.<br/>His father was treated for a gunshot injury to the shoulder in Ramallah but was discharged just in time to visit his son before his death. <br/>Mohammed Tamimi was the youngest child killed as a result of the Israel-Palestinian conflict this year. <br/>The Israeli military investigation found fault with commanders for miscommunication and \"incorrect decision-making\", and said that the officer who fired in the air would be reprimanded for violating orders. <br/>\"We do everything that we can so as not to harm uninvolved civilians. I express my sorrow for the harm that was caused to civilians and the death of the toddler,\" the Commanding Officer of Israeli Central Command, Major General Yehuda Fox, stated. <br/>The Palestinian foreign ministry, in a statement, deplored the findings as \"the clearest and ugliest form of disregard for, and legalisation of, the shedding of Palestinian blood\". <br/>It has called for an international investigation into Israeli military actions against Palestinian children. <br/>\"Without accountability, Israel's crimes against our people/children will continue unabated,\" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh wrote in a tweet last week.

Belgorod has been targeted in recent weeks by a series of cross-border raids from Ukraine.<br/>His whereabouts on Wednesday, however, were a mystery.<br/>Russia's official military TV channel Zvezda reported that he was \"alive but wounded\", citing information from the lower house of the Russian parliament.<br/>Zvezda said the report rebuffed some social media reports that he had been killed. Ukrainian sources have referred to an unconfirmed attack on the Chechen Akhmat paramilitary in the coastal city of Prymorsk, a long way from the front line in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.<br/>Ramzan Kadyrov then offered a big reward for help in finding his \"dear brother\", even going so far as to call for help from Ukrainian intelligence.<br/>However, Russian officials have since sought to quell reports of such a high-ranking commander being wounded. <br/>Fellow MP Dmitry Kuznetsov quoted Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin as saying that he had just talked to Adam Delimkhanov and that he was \"alive and well\".<br/>Hours later, the Chechen leader backtracked on his earlier comments, claiming that his close ally was \"not even wounded\" and accusing Ukrainians of lying.<br/>\"I knew this from the very beginning of the injection of fake news, but I decided to show everyone, primarily Ukrainians, to what degree their media have sunk,\" he said.<br/>He published a video along with his comments that showed the two men with several aides in front of map, but BBC Verify has found a number of inconsistencies in the clip that indicate it may have been manipulated.<br/>Some of the audio of the Chechen leader was out of sync with his lip movements and some military analysts have suggested the map dates back to last year.<br/>Delimkhanov put out a message debunking rumours surrounding his health to his half-a-million followers on social media, and then on Thursday he reposted the Chechen leader's video. <br/>Nevertheless, the MP's reported injuries did prompt Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to say it was following events with great concern and awaiting clarification of what had happened.<br/>The Kremlin has so far refrained from commenting on the fate of another leading military figure, Maj Gen Sergei Goryachev, who was reportedly killed in a missile strike on Monday.<br/>The incident was widely reported in Russian media, citing popular military blogger Yuri Kotenok, but with no official confirmation.<br/>Russian-installed official Vladimir Rogov appeared to validate the report by offering his condolences to the general's family and friends.<br/>A number of Russian generals have been killed since the start of the full-scale invasion, but if confirmed, Goryachev is thought to be the first such fatality for a year.<br/>Additional reporting by Olga Robinson.<br/>'Extremely fierce battles' as Kyiv seeks to advance<br/>The man behind Ukraine\u2019s long-awaited counter-offensive<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But it's still not clear which countries will be willing to provide the jets, how many, or even when.<br/>Supplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets will \"not be a silver bullet\" or a \"quick fix\", says the head of Norway's Air Force. Maj Gen Rolf Folland says it'll take time for Ukraine to develop the ability to operate Western jets with complex weapons. <br/>We meet at a large allied air exercise taking place over Norway, Finland and Sweden. It involves 150 fighter planes - many more than the entire Ukrainian Air Force. <br/>Gen Folland says the training is about dominating the skies - to avoid what he calls the type of \"old fashioned\" conflict now taking place in Ukraine. <br/>To gain supremacy of the air requires a level of scale and sophistication that Ukraine will not be able to replicate. Even providing a small fleet of F-16s could prove a major challenge.<br/>It took Pulse, a Belgian pilot, three years to master his F-16 fighter. We've been asked to use his call sign, not his real name. <br/>He shows us round his F-16, originally designed in the late 1970s, long before he was born.<br/>\"It flies like a dream\", he says. \"But flying is the easiest part. The rest is more difficult.\" <br/>That includes learning to operate the F-16's radar, sensors and weapons. Ukraine, which currently has more pilots than aircraft, is hoping to compress that training into months.<br/>Pulse sees the logic of providing Western jets to Ukraine. He points to his F-16's weapons: air-to-air missiles to destroy enemy aircraft, and bombs to hit targets on the ground. \"That's important,\" says Pulse, \"because you can use any weapons from Nato stocks with this jet.\"<br/>But then there's the question of maintaining the jets. <br/>The Norwegian Air Force, like others in Europe, has transitioned to the more modern F-35. So in theory there should be F-16s available for Ukraine. <br/>At Orland air base they use two of their old F-16s to train aircraft engineers. That can take a year - even longer for a senior aircraft technician. <br/>\"You can't just hand over a fighter aircraft and say off you go!\" Col Martin Tesli, the base commander and a former F-16 pilot, says. <br/>He says there's a large logistical tail - spare parts, software and weapons. But he too understands the need to modernise Ukraine's fleet of old Soviet-era jets. <br/>\"At a certain point, if they're not provided with another aircraft, they won't have an air force to defend themselves.\"<br/>Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine would probably need the help of Western contractors to keep any F-16s flying. The obvious question, is what country is willing to accept the obvious risks of putting their own people on the ground? <br/>Professor Bronk adds that Russia is only more likely to target Ukraine's air bases if it's supplied with Western jets. That's a danger for the single engine F-16, which has a large intake that can suck up debris from the runway.<br/>These are good reasons why the US has, for so long, resisted pressure from Ukraine to provide F-16s. It's less about fears of escalation, and more about the practicalities of operating and maintaining the jets. The Pentagon has warned it'll be both complex and costly.<br/>Nor is providing Ukraine with Western fighters likely to significantly alter the battle on the ground. <br/>Lt Col Neils Van Hussen, a former F-16 pilot of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, says \"not a single weapons system will change a big war\". F-16s, he believes, would simply give Ukraine \"the ability to sustain what they're doing now\". <br/>The reality of this war is that even Russia, with its sizeable air force, has not been able to dominate the skies. Ground-based air defence systems are helping to prevent that from happening.<br/>Providing Ukraine with more air defences will continue to be the immediate priority for the West.

In that role, he passed the largest tax cut in state history, and signed bills to restrict abortion and protect religious freedom. <br/>Mr Pence, 64, is a born-again evangelical Christian and his addition to the 2016 presidential ticket is credited with helping mobilise the crucial voting bloc on behalf of Mr Trump.<br/>Calm and soft-spoken, he was seen as an effective surrogate to the bombastic president. But Mr Trump turned on him for lacking \"courage\" after he refused to help overturn the 2020 election results.<br/>Pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021 and were heard chanting \"Hang Mike Pence!\". At one point, they were reportedly within 40ft (12m) of the vice-president.<br/>The former New Jersey governor announced his candidacy on 6 June at a town hall event in New Hampshire, where the first Republican primary election will be held.<br/>After his own 2016 presidential bid failed, Mr Christie allied himself with Mr Trump, leading the incoming president's transition team and preparing him for debates against Mr Biden in 2020.<br/>But he has become a vociferous critic of Mr Trump since the US Capitol riots. <br/>The sharp-tongued Mr Christie previewed an attack line on Mr Trump at a New Hampshire town hall in April, saying: \"Donald Trump is a TV star, nothing more, nothing less. Let me suggest to you that in putting him back in the White House, the re-runs will be worse than the original show.\"<br/>Mr Christie served two terms as New Jersey governor from 2010-18. His time in office was overshadowed by a political scandal involving bridge lane closures - part of an alleged political vendetta against a Democratic mayor. <br/>Before being elected as governor, Mr Christie served as New Jersey's top prosecutor under President George W Bush from 2002-08.<br/>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has worked hard to emulate Mr Trump, and is viewed as the candidate most capable of defeating him in a head-to-head race.<br/>Boosted to the governorship by Mr Trump's endorsement, he romped to re-election in last year's midterms by more than 1.5 million votes, the largest margin in the state in more than four decades. Under his tenure, Republican voters outnumber Democrats in the state for the first time.<br/>At 44 years old, the Harvard and Yale-educated lawyer is still a relative newcomer in US politics.<br/>He once served in the US Navy, including a tour in Iraq. He was also a little-known member of the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018.<br/>But Mr DeSantis has seen his star rise considerably since he became governor in 2019, a role in which he has positioned himself as an enthusiastic culture warrior.<br/>He has backed legislation to defund diversity and inclusion programmes, to ban teaching on gender identity in public schools, ban drag shows and gender-affirming care for minors, and restrict abortions and loosen gun laws.

I'm angry,\" Cheryl's brother Ricki told the BBC's Jon Kay at the time, for the podcast Fairy Meadow.<br/>But Australian police continued to investigate, and in 2020 the NSW government increased its reward for information to A$1m (\u00a3540,000; $680,000).<br/>Now the Grimmer family have sent a letter to Mr Speakman's successor, Michael Daley, asking him to look again at the judge's decision. The BBC has approached Mr Daley's office for comment. <br/>The Grimmer family had only just moved to Australia from the UK when Cheryl disappeared. She was last seen in showers near the beach, where she had spent the afternoon with her mother and three older brothers.<br/>Witnesses at the time reported seeing an unknown male carrying a child wrapped in a towel towards the beach car park.<br/>Cheryl Grimmer's family are determined to get her case back into court. <br/>Fifty-three years after she disappeared, her brother Ricki still devotes hours every day to what he calls his campaign for justice. Researching, emailing, cold-calling anyone who he thinks might be able to help. <br/>Ricki has told me with heart-breaking honesty that he remains \"haunted\" by what happened to his sister. He says he will not rest until he feels he has achieved justice for her.<br/>Cheryl vanished from the changing rooms at Fairy Meadow when Ricki was looking after her. He was only seven at the time. <br/>The family believes that the recent change in state government in New South Wales - and the appointment of a new attorney general - might create an opportunity for the case to be examined and reviewed with fresh eyes. <br/>In dismissing the 2019 case, Justice Robert Allan Hulme said the teenage suspect had no guardian or lawyer present during the 1971 police interview. <br/>He described the boy as of \"low average intelligence\" and \"more vulnerable than the average 17-year-old as a result of his disturbed upbringing\".<br/>But the Grimmer family say that decision gave no consideration to \"the victim of the crime\", and describe the omission of Cheryl's name from the judgement as \"something that sickens the family\". <br/>\"I would suggest that this sits very awkwardly against Australia's obligations under human rights instruments,\" says the letter signed by Michael Grimmer, Cheryl's cousin.<br/>The family says details in the confession were \"corroborated during a 2016-17 reinvestigation\".<br/>The letter calls on Attorney General Daley to allow an application to the NSW Supreme Court for a fresh inquest, and to lift media restrictions preventing the previous suspect's name being published to prompt other possible witnesses to come forward. <br/>You can stream or download the Fairy Meadow podcast on BBC Sounds.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Little known until recently, his popularity now rivals that of President Volodymyr Zelensky.<br/>Gen Zaluzhny, or \"our Valera\" as friends and old classmates like to call him, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military in July 2021. <br/>Those who know him well say the appointment, pushed through personally by President Zelensky, came as a surprise to the general and many others too as his  promotion involved climbing several steps on the career ladder. <br/>Zaluzhny was already known as an ambitious and modern commander, but also an unpretentious man who liked to joke with his subordinates and didn't put on airs. <br/>Within seven months he was leading Ukraine's defence against full-scale invasion. <br/>By 26 February 2022 it was clear that Russian troops were failing to \"take Kyiv in three days\", which had initially seemed a likely outcome. <br/>But the reality remained grim and Ukrainian authorities were calling on the public not to panic. Russian troops were advancing in the north, east and south of Ukraine and posed a considerable threat to the capital.<br/>One idea floating among Ukraine's top officials was to start blowing up bridges near Kyiv over the vast Dnipro river, to prevent the Russians crossing from the eastern left bank to the western right bank, where, among other strategic objects, the government quarter was situated. <br/>They phoned Gen Zaluzhny for his view. \"Under no circumstances are we to do that,\" he is reported to have replied, at the time sitting in a smoke-filled bunker with other top brass. <br/>\"This will be a betrayal of both civilians and the military remaining on the eastern bank.\" <br/>The BBC has heard matching accounts from two sources involved in the episode that indicate this is what happened.<br/>Many other crucial decisions followed and by early April 2022 Ukrainian troops pushed the Russian army back to the north and east of Kyiv.<br/>Born into the family of a Soviet serviceman, Valery Zaluzhny once said he was always committed to distancing himself from the excessive hierarchy of the Soviet Army. <br/>By the time he went to military school in the mid-1990s Ukraine was already an independent state. <br/>While his textbooks at military college may have dated back to the Soviet era, he learnt about the reality of war first-hand. In 2014 he was appointed a deputy commander in an area of eastern Ukraine where the conflict with separatists, backed by the Russian army, was getting under way.<br/>Colleagues we spoke to say that from the onset of his career he was keen on building relationships of trust with his subordinates as well as delegating command decisions.<br/>Zaluzhny's former aide who was by his side in the first days of the Russian invasion, Lyudmyla Dolhonovska, told the BBC he barely slept and kept in touch with military staff on the frontline. <br/>\"He spoke on the phone to his generals a lot, but the conversations were always focused and calm,\" she said.<br/>Analysts say the flexibility shown by Ukrainian units with junior officers able to make decisions on the battlefield gave them a considerable advantage over the top-heavy decision-making structures of the Russian army. <br/>Some sources in the Ukrainian military even go as far as to say that it is the decisive commanders on the ground who are collectively responsible for Ukraine's successes, while Gen Zaluzhny should only be credited with leaving them with the freedom to operate.<br/>As the war ground on, President Zelensky played a key role in maintaining the morale of the Ukrainian public through his nightly addresses. <br/>He pushed an image of strong governance while exerting pressure on foreign partners for financial and military support. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny's focus was on getting military strategy right.<br/>After successful advances in late summer and early autumn, Ukrainian troops liberated large swathes of the Ukrainian territory in the east and south.<br/>The commander-in-chief became a national hero, despite being rarely seen in public and even more rarely agreeing to interviews.<br/>His name became synonymous with bravery and determination, and his reputation spawned anecdotes and turns of phrase.<br/>\"When Zaluzhny walks into an unlit room, he doesn't switch on the light, he switches off the darkness,\" one such phrase went.<br/>His popularity ratings drew level with Zelensky's, and conspiracy theorists began speculating on a possible rift between them.<br/>There was talk of Zelensky replacing Zaluzhny as military chief or even of Zaluzhny challenging the president's political leadership.<br/> So far, neither has happened.<br/>A source in the presidential administration told the BBC that \"President Zelensky simply has no time for such jealousy as he is 102% preoccupied with getting military support for Ukraine from its partners\".<br/>The two men appear quite happy to let each other get with their jobs. <br/>Gen Zaluzhny told Time magazine last June that he did not bother to explain to Mr Zelensky all the minute details of military strategy.<br/>\"He doesn't need to understand military affairs any more than he needs to know about medicine or bridge-building.\" <br/>Political analysts and sociologists have told the BBC that Zaluzhny's popularity is natural in the current situation where Ukrainians need ways to boost morale. They also highlight his human touch. <br/>Once he turned up at a wedding of a soldier forced to delay the ceremony because he had been sent to the front line at Bakhmut. Eventually the soldier was given a short period of leave to get the chance to marry his fianc\u00e9e.<br/>As talk of a forthcoming Ukrainian offensive intensified, Russian military bloggers began circulating rumours in mid-May that Gen Zaluzhny had been critically wounded or even killed. <br/>This was picked up by Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin who said: \"Naturally, we have all information about the state of health of the commander of the Ukrainian Army but we will not disclose it.\"<br/>Col Anatoly Shtefan, who is close to Gen Zaluzhny, said that while Ukraine's top brass poked fun at the rumours -  which they described as the \"height of Russian propaganda madness\" - it was clear that Ukrainians were starting to worry too. <br/>At the beginning of June, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence published several photos of Gen Zaluzhny attending a military ceremony in Kyiv. <br/>For now Valery Zaluzhny's hero status among Ukrainians is secure, but with so many pinning their hopes on the commander-in-chief the future is likely to be complicated. <br/>Even if the defence of Ukraine ultimately succeeds, Ukraine will face a harsh reality, warns sociologist Oleksiy Antypovych, and Zaluzhny may choose to steer clear of politics.<br/>\"It is highly likely that after the war Ukraine will face a severe economic crisis, if not a complete collapse. It will be a completely different ball game.\"<br/>Political analyst Mykola Davydiuk believes that if the military chief were to move into politics, he might succeed. <br/>\"While Zelensky is a leader who didn't abandon Ukrainians, Zaluzhny was the one who defended them. It's an organic narrative for him and there is a demand for it in our society.\"<br/>The BBC asked Gen Zaluzhny for an interview.

For several months, he's been at the centre of India's biggest sporting row.<br/>The allegations against him are grave. Some of India's top wrestlers, including Olympic medallists and world champions, accuse him of sexually harassing female athletes and have held months of protests demanding his arrest. <br/>Mr Singh, who until recently had been the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) for the past 12 years, has denied the allegations. He accuses the wrestlers of being \"politically motivated\" and recently said he would \"hang himself even if a single allegation is proved\" against him. <br/>After months of headline-making protests by wrestlers - and a nudge from the Supreme Court - police in the capital Delhi registered two cases against him in April. Seven female wrestlers told the police that he had molested and groped them at training camps and tournaments. <br/>As one of them is a minor, police invoked the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. In the past few days, reports say the minor has withdrawn her allegations. Wrestler Sakshi Malik told the BBC she believed \"the player was pressurised into withdrawing the charges\". Mr Singh refused to comment on the allegation, saying \"let law take its course\".<br/>Lawyer Akshat Bajpai says most people charged under Pocso are immediately arrested - but six weeks later, police are yet to act against Mr Singh. <br/>Although the government denies shielding him, the protesters and opposition politicians allege that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving him a long rope because of political expediency. <br/>Born on 8 January 1957 in Gonda district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, the six-term MP claims substantial support in a number of parliamentary constituencies and analysts say with general elections due next year, he is expected to play a pivotal role. <br/>But Sharat Pradhan, senior journalist in the state capital Lucknow, says Mr Singh is never far from controversy and the 66-year-old is often in the news for the wrong reasons.<br/>A 2021 video that has resurfaced on social media in recent months shows him hitting a young under-15 wrestler on stage for \"misbehaving\". And last year, he bragged on camera that he had murdered a man who had killed his friend Ravinder Singh. \"Whatever people say, let me tell you that I have committed one murder,\" he told the reporter. \"I put a rifle to [his] back and shot him. He died.\" <br/>Mr Singh was neither censured for his violent outburst against the young athlete nor was he arrested or charged for murder despite his confession.<br/>Also, these were not the only times Mr Singh fell foul of the law - although he has never been convicted, he was named in more than three dozen cases amid accusations of theft, rioting, attempt to murder and kidnapping. <br/>Mr Singh, who studied law in college and participated in wrestling competitions in his youth, became politically active while a student and joined the BJP in 1988. He was elected to parliament in 1991.<br/>He first came into prominence for aggressively participating in the BJP's movement for the construction of a temple in the town of Ayodhya. Along with several party leaders and workers, he was named as an accused in the December 1992 demolition of the 16th-Century Babri Mosque. Years later, they were all absolved. <br/>But a few months before the 1996 elections, Mr Singh was arrested on charges of sheltering some associates of Dawood Ibrahim, India's \"most wanted man\" who was charged with masterminding the 1993 deadly Mumbai bombings. <br/>According to court documents, Mr Singh had accommodated the criminals in his official Delhi home and had even lent them his phone to speak to the underworld don. He spent nearly three months in jail under TADA, the stringent Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act, although he was finally cleared for a lack of evidence. <br/>In the 2004 parliamentary elections, when the BJP candidate from Gonda, Ghanshyam Shukla, died in a road crash on the day of voting, many called it a murder and blamed it on Mr Singh. A decade later, in an interview with news website Scroll, Mr Singh confirmed that even Atal Bihari Vajpayee - BJP leader and then prime minister - had accused him of murder, but added that the rumour was started by his opponents.<br/>In 2008 when the BJP expelled him for not following the party whip in a key vote in parliament, he cosied up to the regional Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, and won a seat for the party in the 2009 elections. But before the next elections in 2014, he was back with the BJP - badmouthing Mr Yadav. He won, and was re-elected in 2019.<br/>Despite the controversy surrounding him at present, Mr Singh insists that he will contest next year's elections.<br/>Last Sunday, he addressed a rally - his first since the allegations - in his home town where he arrived in a huge convoy, leading a 25km-roadshow that was seen as a show of strength by analysts.<br/>As local party leaders fawned over him, a female party colleague called him \"the pride of the region\" and an \"inspiration for the youth\".<br/>In Gonda and some of the adjoining districts, where Mr Singh and his family own and run more than 50 schools and colleges, he enjoys tremendous popularity. <br/>When BBC Hindi's Anant Zhanane recently visited one of the colleges to ask the students about allegations against Mr Singh, they started shouting slogans hailing him.<br/>\"He's our guardian, a messiah for the poor. We will be with him for life,\" said Sonu Tiwari. Another student Vishwajeet Kumar Singh said the MP \"lives in my heart, he's my god\".<br/>Mr Pradhan says, \"Singh is cast in the same mould as mafia don-turned-politicians Atiq Ahmad [who was recently killed on live TV] or Mukhtar Ansari. He wields influence among those he helps and tries intimidation to control others.\" <br/>But, he believes, that his influence may be over-rated.<br/>\"The talk of him being able to deliver four-five seats for the BJP in the next elections is exaggerated. He's formidable at present because he has the BJP's backing. The moment the BJP cuts him off, his power would begin to wane.\" <br/>And that, he says, would very likely happen soon. The wrestlers' protests have made global headlines and after a number of medal-winners were dragged through the streets last month when they tried to march on parliament, even the International Olympic Committee weighed in, calling on India to ensure the safety of athletes and carry out a fair investigation.<br/>\"Dropping Mr Singh may not help the BJP in undoing the damage already done to India's reputation,\" Mr Pradhan says, \"but it may contain it from getting worse.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

I am convinced there were tourists who would have probably arrived faster by train, but for fun they took bus route 666.\"<br/>\"What is Hel without 666,\" quipped Dawid Jastrzebski, while Kamil Galczynski argued that this was \"a perfect example of how NOT to do marketing\".<br/>Another social media user, Robert Eryk Wozniak, wrote: \"I think that the next step should be to change the name of the town of Hel to something else because it is against our Christian Polish roots!\"<br/>Poland is a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, where the Church has traditionally been influential.<br/>Over the past few years, religious conservatives from one Polish group have complained that bus company PKS Gdynia is \"spreading Satanism\".<br/>Route 666 usually runs in the summer along the Baltic Sea coast.

Ukraine lost six soldiers in the process.<br/>Its name means \"not boring\" in Ukrainian.<br/>An obvious irony for a village that was occupied by Russia in spring last year - a few weeks after President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.<br/>It was at the most northern point of a protruding Russian front line. <br/>As our army escort, Anatoliy, speeds along scarred roads in his camouflaged truck towards Neskuchne, it's clear this is a different kind of liberation to what we saw last year.<br/>Firstly there are no civilians here. The only remnants of civilisation come in the form of a blown out pharmacy and food store. <br/>There isn't a complex network of trenches either. A makeshift wooden bridge over a river is all it takes to take us into territory Russia has held for so long. <br/>Buildings are also riddled with bullet holes from smaller calibre weapons. There's been a lot of close quarter fighting here.<br/>Anatoliy doesn't like to hang around for long. <br/>Mortars are periodically fired from Ukrainian troops hidden in thick tree lines or abandoned gardens. He explains the Russians are just on the brow of hill in three directions. <br/>The sudden rising of three plumes of smoke is a cue to keep moving. The Russians are responding with Grad missiles.<br/>The situation here is far more fluid than the triumphant claims of liberation which had come from from Kyiv this week. <br/>Russian forces have been pushing back as recently as last night, which Ukrainian officials have now acknowledged.<br/>Ukraine's counteroffensive is in its early stages with modest gains. <br/>If Neskuchne is anything to go by, any liberation will be far from immediate, and won't necessarily bring freedom straight away.<br/>Former residents of Neskuchne told the BBC that the village was also briefly occupied in 2014 - when Russia-backed fighters seized large swathes of land in the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions. This followed the illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.<br/>The small village then went back into Ukrainian hands only to be seized by Russian troops soon after last year's invasion.<br/>Earlier this week, a video emerged purportedly showing two Ukrainian soldiers raising the country's blue-and-yellow national flag on destroyed buildings in Neskuchne.<br/>The loud booming sound of nearby shelling can also be heard.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: A video on social media purports to show a Ukrainian flag being raised in Neskuchne, Donetsk Oblast<br/>What will it take for Ukraine's offensive to succeed?<br/>Russia moves to take direct control of Wagner Group<br/>Three dead as Russia shells flood evacuation boat<br/>Ukraine counter-offensive has begun, Zelensky says<br/>What attacks have there been on dams in Ukraine?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

How do their cases differ?<br/>Mr Trump is in the deepest trouble. He has been indicted on 37 charges related to files found at his Florida home. <br/>His supporters are pointing to the examples of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton as a double standard applied to Democratic politicians.<br/>This is how all these cases compare.<br/>More than 325 classified files - including some marked with Secret and Top Secret designations - were discovered over the course of last year at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.<br/>Aides to Joe Biden discovered classified documents in Washington and at his Delaware home.<br/>Former Vice-President Mike Pence also made headlines when documents were found unsecured at his home in Indiana. The US Department of Justice told him recently they are not pursuing charges.<br/>Those three discoveries were within a few months of each but the classified material saga concerning Hillary Clinton goes back a few years.<br/>She used a personal email address while working as secretary of state from 2009-13 under President Barack Obama. This meant some classified material was shared on her server at home, which was unsecured.<br/>The National Archives initiated contact with Mr Trump's office after determining that it did not have possession of some notable records from his presidential term.<br/>The former president's team provided some material but the archivists did not believe they had been fully co-operative. <br/>That set in motion the FBI inquiry that led to a surprise search of the Mar-a-Lago estate and the discovery of more than 100 additional documents.<br/>Mr Biden's personal lawyers discovered his classified documents as they were moving his stuff out of an office he used at a think tank in Washington. <br/>The following day, they turned what they found over to the National Archives and the FBI conducted their own search and found more. A second trove was found a few weeks later at his Delaware home. <br/>Mrs Clinton's use of a private email first came to light in March 2016 after she had quit her job as secretary of state to run for president.<br/>Her team handed over nearly 60,000 pages of emails but also deleted more than 30,000 emails they said were deemed to be personal in nature.<br/>Mr Trump and Mr Biden both have a special counsel looking deeper into what they did wrong.<br/>Under the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration ends. Regulations require such files to be stored securely.<br/>Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor, has brought an indictment against the former president, who faces dozens of counts of unauthorised possession of classified material, obstruction of justice, concealing documents and making false statements to law enforcement<br/>A Trump-appointed prosecutor Robert Hur is looking into the Biden case, which is still ongoing.<br/>The FBI described Mrs Clinton's actions as careless but said there was no case for a \"reasonable prosecutor\" to bring.<br/>Mr Pence was told last week by the US justice department that they are not pursuing charges.<br/>According to the indictment, the documents found at Mr Trump's Florida home were highly sensitive.<br/>They include details of US nuclear weapons programmes, the potential vulnerabilities of the US and its allies, and US plans for retaliatory military attacks.<br/>They were found in boxes in various rooms in Mar-a-Lago, including a storage room, two ballrooms and a bathroom, tucked between a shower and a toilet.<br/>The documents discovered in Mr Biden's office were marked \"sensitive compartmented information\", according to CNN, indicating the material could involve intelligence-gathering methods and sources. <br/>They reportedly included information about Ukraine, Iran and the UK and dated from his time as vice-president and, before that, senator.<br/>The FBI said there were 113 Clinton emails which contained classified information but they did not reveal the nature of them.<br/>There are 31 counts against the former president of \"wilful retention of national defence information\".<br/>This means prosecutors believe he knew that what he was doing was unlawful, and they have recordings of him apparently speaking about that and the testimony of witnesses.<br/>It also alleges that he showed some of this material to people without the required security clearances.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: How much do you know about classified documents?<br/>In the Clinton case, FBI Director James Comey decided after an investigation that she had been careless in using a private server but it was not intentional.<br/>Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing the investigation. But he says Mrs Clinton destroyed evidence and points to the deleted emails. At one press conference, he even urged Russia to find them.<br/>In Mr Comey's view there was no cover-up, even though an FBI investigation found many of the deleted emails were work-related.<br/>Not enough is yet known about the investigation into President Biden to make a comparison.<br/>Mr Trump has accused the FBI and the justice department of pursuing a politically motivated investigation in an effort to prevent him from running for the White House again.<br/>Mrs Clinton testified to Congress about her email server as part of the Benghazi hearings, and it came up regularly during the 2016 election campaign.<br/>She said she fully complied with the investigation and handed over all work-related emails after her team had gone through a \"thorough process\".<br/>Mr Biden, for his part, said Mr Trump's handling was \"totally irresponsible\" after the news first emerged, opening himself up to accusations of hypocrisy weeks later.<br/>The president has said he was \"surprised\" there were sensitive documents at his former office and that he is co-operating fully with the review. <br/>Mr Pence always maintained the documents had ended up at his home \"inadvertently\" but he had taken full responsibility for the mistake.<br/>Biden 'surprised' about classified files discovery<br/>Could Donald Trump go to prison over secret files?<br/>Donald Trump took US nuclear secrets, charges say<br/>Is this indictment a threat to Trump's 2024 campaign?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He was arraigned in April in New York on charges that he falsified business records for a 2016 hush-money payment to a porn star. But that is a state-level case and much less serious than the one he is now facing.<br/>Florida officials are bracing for protests from supporters and opponents. <br/>The former president spent Monday night at the Trump National Doral, a hotel and resort in the Miami area.<br/>Accompanied by Secret Service officers, he is expected to travel in a motorcade from the hotel to the Wilkie D Ferguson court, where his arraignment is scheduled for around 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT). The court is about 11 miles (18km) from the hotel. <br/>The entire hearing is set to last about an hour, after which Trump will fly back to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on board his plane, Trump Force One.<br/>He is scheduled to give remarks there at 20:15 (00:15 GMT), shortly after landing.  <br/>Mr Trump will have the charges read to him, and he is expected to enter a plea of not guilty. <br/>One of his lawyers, Alina Habba - who is not representing him in this case - told Fox News the former president will \"never admit guilt\".<br/>The judge is expected to release the former president \"on his own recognizance\", meaning he will be freed without having to pay a bail bond, to return to court at a later date. <br/>Various procedural issues are likely to be addressed, although it is thought unlikely that a trial date will be set. <br/>Mr Trump will not be subjected to the humiliation of a booking photo. <br/>But fingerprints and a DNA swab are expected to be taken from him, a requirement of all defendants in the federal court system, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. <br/>At his earlier court appearance to face state charges in New York in April, Mr Trump was only fingerprinted. <br/>The US public is unlikely to see Mr Trump during the court appearance, as cameras are not permitted in federal courts. <br/>The initial stages of this case have been assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, whom Mr Trump appointed in 2020 while he was president.<br/>Last summer Judge Cannon granted a request by Mr Trump's legal team to grant a review of the files at the centre of this case. An appeals court later overturned her decision. <br/>The 42-year-old, who was born in Colombia and now resides in Florida, is a graduate of Duke University and The University of Michigan Law School, where she was an articles editor for the school's Journal of Law Reform publication.<br/>Dozens of his supporters gathered outside his hotel on Monday, to greet his arrival and express their support. The BBC's Nomia Iqbal, who was also there, said some carried huge flags and there were cars and motorbikes bearing Trump slogans.<br/>Security will be extremely tight in and around the court. Miami Police Chief Manuel Morales said on Monday they would deploy enough resources to handle a crowd of up to 50,000 people if necessary and ensure Miami is kept \"safe and secure\". <br/>Mr Trump is expected to enter the building through an underground tunnel, avoiding both the anticipated crowds of supporters and counter-demonstrators and the media outside.<br/>In an interview on WABC radio after the indictment, Mr Trump urged supporters to demonstrate. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Trump's court appearance explained in 90 seconds<br/>\"Look, our country has to protest,\" he said. \"We have plenty of protest to protest. We've lost everything.\" <br/>A number of other Trump supporters have also called for demonstrations. Former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake vowed that prosecutors would have to \"go through me, and 75 million Americans just like me\".<br/>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on Monday that the city would facilitate any protests. <br/>\"But we also believe in law and order,\" he added, \"and we know that and we hope that tomorrow will be peaceful.\" <br/>Has Trump put US national security at risk?<br/>Trump arrives in Florida ahead of court appearance<br/>Trump aide indicted in classified documents case<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He later vowed to continue his campaign for president even if he is convicted.<br/>The indictment accuses him of keeping hundreds of classified documents, including some about US nuclear secrets and military plans, at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago after he left office.<br/>It alleged that he lied to investigators and tried to obstruct their investigation into his handling of the documents.<br/>Under the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration ends.

He was released alongside Mr Trump without having to post bond and was ordered not to talk to other witnesses.<br/>According to the indictment, Mr Trump directed his aide to move boxes that were a focus of the investigation from a storage room at the Mar-a-Lago resort. He was allegedly told to conceal them from Mr Trump's attorney and the FBI.<br/>Prosecutors have said Mr Nauta can be seen on surveillance video removing the boxes from the storage room ahead of an imminent search of the Palm Beach property, and later moving some of them back - one of at least five times he moved boxes in and out of the room.<br/>They further allege that, in a May 2022 interview with the FBI, Mr Nauta lied that he did not know how the boxes had arrived on site, where they were being stored or whether Mr Trump had intentionally kept any.<br/>On his Truth Social platform on Friday, the former president defended Mr Nauta and accused officials at the US Department of Justice of \"trying to destroy his life\" and \"hoping that he will say bad things about 'Trump'\". <br/>Born in Agat, in the US territory of Guam, Waltine Torre Nauta enlisted in the US Navy in 2001.<br/>Navy records show he ascended through the ranks to become a Senior Chief Culinary Specialist, in 2021.<br/>By then, he had been serving in the military-staffed cafeteria for the Trump White House.<br/>The president later elevated him to a role as his military aide, a position similar to a personal valet and sometimes referred to as a \"body-man\".<br/>Mr Nauta retired from the Navy when Mr Trump left the White House. According to the indictment, he became an executive assistant to Mr Trump in August 2021.<br/>Unlike other aides, who sought to remain in Washington DC after Mr Trump lost the 2020 election, Mr Nauta relocated to Florida and continued to serve as an aide to the former president at Mar-a-Lago. <br/>He has been described as a low-key but constant presence in the Trump White House, and a trusted, well-liked aide in Mr Trump's post-presidential orbit.<br/>The New York Times reported that Mr Nauta is viewed as a Trump loyalist and does not appear to be playing a \"side game\" in exchange for prosecutorial leniency.<br/>When the BBC contacted some of Mr Nauta's relatives in Guam about the charges, they seemed stunned by the news. <br/>Reached by social media on Monday, his cousin, Lani Nauta, said the family had only just regained electricity after the typhoon that struck the island two weeks ago. <br/>She ended the conversation to call other members of her family and inform them of the indictment. <br/>In an interview with the Washington Post before Mr Nauta was charged, relatives in Guam described him as a \"good boy\" who moved to the United States \"to enjoy his life, not to cause problems\".  <br/>Pauline Torre, his mother, said the fact that her son had been selected to serve the president \"says it all\".  <br/>But his aunt said he did everything \"at the direction of the former president\". <br/>\"All he was instructed was to put the boxes where they were supposed to go,\" Elly Nauta told the Post.<br/>Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty in this case to all the charges against him.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is unclear what will happen to those investments. Mr Odey also has around $600m of his own money invested in the firm.<br/>One of those funds, the Odey Swan Fund, is already being liquidated after investors began to withdraw money.<br/>The financier is well known in the City for having made large sums of money betting against the UK pound and British government bonds in recent years. <br/>In 2020, Mr Odey was accused of assaulting a female investment banker at his London home in 1998, but was cleared of indecent assault after a trial. <br/>Following the case, his company reportedly undertook an internal investigation into the financier's behaviour and handed its findings to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog.<br/>OAM told the regulator at the time that it had decided to keep Mr Odey on as chief executive after giving him a \"final written warning\" for inappropriate behaviour.<br/>However, on Wednesday, MPs on the Treasury Committee wrote to the FCA asking whether it had been proactive enough in its oversight of the fund. <br/>It followed reports that the watchdog had been investigating the company since 2021.<br/>The FCA has been asked to reveal what it knew about the claims against Mr Odey and what action it took, going back five years. <br/>The MPs have given it until 5 July to respond. <br/>A spokesperson for the FCA said: \"We understand the Treasury Committee's interest in this and we'll of course reply shortly.\" <br/>MPs grill financial watchdog over Odey probe<br/>City boss ousted after sexual misconduct claims<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It said this was \"slightly higher than last winter\" and \"broadly in line with those of recent winters\".<br/>However, its \"base case\" scenario assumes normal energy market conditions with no disruptions to supplies.<br/>National Grid said it is taking steps to \"minimise the potential impact to electricity customers\" in the UK if supplies were disrupted again.<br/>Alongside maintaining its energy-saving scheme for households to get discounts on bills, it said it was holding discussions about having two coal power stations on standby. The amount available to the grid if required has fallen from five in 2022 to two, with two now closed down and one other unable to be called upon.<br/>The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. <br/>The UK also imports electricity from continental Europe.<br/>The squeeze on supplies led to household energy bills soaring as gas prices rocketed.<br/>The government stepped in late last year to limit bills to \u00a32,500 a year for a typical household.

Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work \"in a safe and secure environment\".<br/>\"We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,\" Mr Hughes added.<br/>The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.<br/>The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment. <br/>The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport. <br/>They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues. <br/>As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions. <br/>The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.<br/>It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.<br/>Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.<br/>A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found \"extremely concerning\" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.<br/>Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from \"banter\" to \"uncomfortable advances from male trainers\".<br/>Pilot, 15, wants to inspire more women into gliding<br/>Heathrow workers call off first summer strikes<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But he said that We Soda would look to grow in North America, adding: \"So perhaps when we reconsider coming back to the market, that will be a credible alternative.\"<br/>He said: \"It's all going to depend on initial public offering market conditions across Europe, the state of our business where we sit in terms of the balance between Europe and North America, and we'll have to evaluate it at the time.\"<br/>Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges.<br/>But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here.<br/>Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate.<br/>The exodus has not gone unnoticed by the government.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\".

Prices for many items beyond food and energy continue to rise steadily.<br/>The Fed has already lifted its benchmark rate to the highest levels since 2007 to try to rein in the increases.<br/>Further rises, after a pause, would follow a path carved out by central banks in countries such as Australia and Canada, which recently announced rate hikes following a break, citing stubborn inflation pressures. The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates at its meeting this week.  <br/>In the US, Mr Powell said officials wanted time to assess how the economy was adjusting to the shift to higher rates, as the change ripples out to the public in the form of higher costs for mortgages, business loans, credit cards and other borrowing. <br/>\"Given how far we've come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace,\" he said. <br/>In theory, higher borrowing costs should reduce demand for loans for homes, business expansions and other activity, eventually cooling the economy and easing pressures pushing up prices. <br/>But despite pockets of pain, such as a sharp slide in home sales, the economy has held up better than many expected so far.<br/>Fed policymakers now expect the economy to grow 1% this year - stronger growth than anticipated in March, according to projections that accompanied the rate announcement. The unemployment rate is also forecast to be 4.1%, lower than previously estimated.<br/>The estimates also show they see less progress controlling inflation than in March. <br/>Mr Powell said what the Fed will do at its next meeting remains a \"live\" question. He added that he saw no chance that rates would come down this year.<br/>The three major US indexes fell following the announcement, which suggested rates would end the year higher than markets had expected.<br/>\"The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risked a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. <br/>Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, said the pause was a recognition of the risk that the Fed's jump in rates to more than 5% in less than 18 months could trigger an economic slowdown that would lead to millions of job losses.<br/>The bank is also trying to account for the impact of a string of recent bank failures, which could reduce lending further. <br/>\"Five percentage points is just absolutely enormous .... So this is a big impact,\" said Mr Lieberman, who previously worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \"It doesn't mean they're necessarily done.\"<br/>Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG in the US, said the public should not expect a return to lower rates anytime soon. <br/>She said the economy generally has become \"much more inflation prone\" due to factors such as increased geo-political tensions, a move to more regional supply chains, and extreme weather events upsetting food supplies and prices more frequently.<br/>\"You're going to see a much more activist central bank policy with higher bouts of inflation and bouts of rate hikes than we saw from the world we left,\" she said. <br/>\"A pause is not an end,\" she added. \"They don't want to let their guards down yet with regard to inflation.\"<br/>How worried should I be about the US economy?<br/>US inflation at lowest since 2021 as fuel costs fall<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

She may also have been the force behind the unexpectedly strong uptick in recreation and culture prices, he said.<br/>\"I wouldn't ... blame Beyonc\u00e9 for [the] high inflation print, but her performance and global demand to see her perform in Sweden apparently added a little to it,\" he wrote in an email to the BBC.<br/>There is little doubt that the singer's first solo tour in seven years marks a big economic moment. At least one estimate suggests the run could gross almost \u00a32bn by the time it ends in September.<br/>Searches for accommodations in cities on the tour shot up after it was announced, Airbnb reported.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn. The IMF, the international commentators, think the British economy is on the right track.\"<br/>But the New Economics Foundation, a think tank promoting social and economic justice, said the Bank should hold off on raising rates further and wait to see the impact of its previous increases.<br/>Its economist Lukasz Krebel said that while UK wages were rising, they were still not keeping up with inflation, meaning people were poorer in real terms. <br/>He added that rising prices were mainly due to supply side issues, such as worker shortages and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending energy prices soaring.<br/>\"The UK government and the Bank should look to address underlying weaknesses that expose the UK to such inflation shocks - notably by supporting investment in clean energy and building retrofits to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil gas,\" he said.<br/>Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figures represented \"another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government\".<br/>\"The facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we're lagging behind on the global stage.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Raphael Sheridan<br/>How worried should we be about rising mortgage rates?<br/>Warning rising mortgage costs to hit renters<br/>Warning prices to be higher for longer as rates rise<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated [against], they will not be seen as who they are.<br/>\"If it's a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it's social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you're not being discriminated [against] because of your gender or your colour or your postal code,\" she said. <br/>On Tuesday, Ireland's data protection authority said it had put Google's planned EU roll-out of its AI chatbot Bard on hold. <br/>It said it had been informed by Google that its ChatGPT competitor would be introduced in the EU this week, but was yet to receive details or information showing how the firm had identified and minimised data protection risks to prospective users.<br/>Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said the DPC was seeking the information \"as a matter of urgency\" and had raised further data protection enquiries about it with Google.<br/>Ms Vestager, who is the European Commission's executive vice president, said AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\".<br/>She insisted a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries should be prioritised before getting more jurisdictions, such as China, on board.<br/>\"Let's start working on a UN approach. But we shouldn't hold our breath,\" she said. <br/>\"We should do what we can here and now.\"<br/>Ms Vestager is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>The current draft of the AI Act seeks to categorise applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>High-risk AI systems include those that are used to evaluate credit scores or access to loans and housing. This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it. No-one can make sure that everyone is on board,\" she said, pointing out that a pause could be used by some as an opportunity to get ahead of competitors. <br/>\"What I think is important is that every developer knows that everyone has signed up for the same guardrails so that no-one takes excessive risks.\"<br/>The European Parliament's proposals for the AI Act seek to restrict the use of biometric identification systems and indiscriminate collection of user data from social media or CCTV footage for purposes such as facial recognition systems.<br/>However, Ms Vestager said: \"We want to put in strict guardrails so that it's not used in real-time, but only in specific circumstances where you're looking for a missing child or there's a terrorist fleeing.<br/>Before the AI Act can become finalised as the world's first rulebook on the use and development of AI systems, the EU's three branches of power: the Commission, Parliament and Council will all have to agree on its final version.<br/>It is not expected to come into effect before 2025. <br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Get in touch.<br/>The rise in the minimum wage had had a \"significant\" impact on the April pay figures, said Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the job search engine Adzuna.<br/>The minimum wage - known as the National Living Wage - rose to \u00a310.42 an hour in April for those aged 23 and over.<br/>\"Nearly two million workers in the UK saw an almost 10% increase in pay this spring,\" Mr Hunter told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>Workers in multiple industries have held strikes since last summer as pay rates fail to keep pace with inflation. But the gap is narrowing as inflation starts to fall. <br/>The Bank of England has warned sharp pay rises are likely to prolong the UK's still-high rates of inflation. The cost of living rose by 8.7% in the year to April, more than four times the Bank's 2% target. <br/>Mr Hunter said: \"Your average worker will be delighted that their pay on average is going up, but that's not necessarily a good thing for inflation.\"<br/>The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, told the House of Lords economic affairs committee that the latest figures on jobs showed the the labour market was \"very tight\".<br/>\"We've had a fall in the supply of labour, which is showing signs of recovering, but very slowly, frankly,\" he said.<br/>\"One of things firms pretty much universally say to me and have been saying to me for a little while, is that they find it so hard to recruit labour in the current market, they are not going to release labour.\"<br/>The market interest rate for the UK government to borrow money over two years is now effectively higher than it reached in the aftermath of Liz Truss's mini-budget. It is also the highest level for a decade and a half and now clearly higher than seen for the US government.<br/>The fact that this is not the same market panic as last autumn will come as little respite to many people renewing their mortgages.<br/>All this reflects market expectations that the UK has a specific problem with stubborn and sticky inflation that will require higher interest rates for longer. Some market bets now see a half percentage point rate rise next week, and rates settling closer to 6% than 5% at the end of the year.<br/>There is an important difference to the mini-budget aftermath. The moves are being seen mainly in short-term rates. The real problem last autumn was for longer term 10- and 30-year borrowing, which saw significant moves in yields, the result of a loss of market confidence in the then-government's tax and spend plans. Current rates for such long-term borrowing are still well below that market panic.<br/>Today's move is more like a steady squeeze as the markets come to terms with the idea of the Bank of England keeping rates higher for longer had been expected, and above rates seen in similar economies.<br/>Read more<br/>Figures from the ONS also showed that:<br/>The UK economy is currently struggling to grow as the soaring cost of living and rising interest rates squeeze households. But the jobs market remains resilient.<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"Rising prices are continuing to eat into people's pay cheques - so we must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year to boost living standards.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Family finances are being squeezed to breaking point by a further fall in real wages, and record numbers of people are out of work due to long-term sickness.\"<br/>1.

Get in touch and share your experiences.<br/>Savills said data from the first three months of the year showed buy-to-let investors had already been squeezed, with net profits falling below 4% - the lowest since 2007. That compares with profits of as much as 23% when rates were at ultra-low levels during the last decade.<br/>It said that larger landlords could be the most likely to stay in the sector.<br/>Savills research suggests 1.9 million properties are owned by 620,000 landlords aged over 65, with a further 1.9 million owned by landlords aged between 55 and 64.<br/>They could choose to leave, meaning tenants would have less choice, Mr Cook said. Better-paid renters in more secure employment could go to the front of the queue for those remaining properties, he added.<br/>There's more on your renting rights and where to go for help here.<br/>Newly-published figures from the Bank of England show that the proportion of mortgages advanced to buy-to-let investors is at its lowest level since 2011.<br/>The data also showed how total mortgage lending dived during the first three months of the year.<br/>Total mortgage borrowing stood at \u00a358.8bn, down 23.6% in a year.

Gasoline prices are down nearly 20%.<br/>Overall, at 4%, inflation is the lowest it has been since March 2021, the Labor Department said. <br/>But the update also showed that prices in many parts of the economy are still rising steadily - and far faster than the 2% rate the Fed considers healthy.<br/>In particular, measures of housing costs, including rents, continue to climb sharply. <br/>There have also been steep price rises for beer, women's clothing, and services from car maintenance to school fees.<br/>\"Don't be fooled by the sharp fall in headline inflation, which is nearly all explained by falls in gasoline prices. These numbers show underlying inflationary pressures are still stubbornly high,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch. <br/>Inflation in the US hit a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, as the war in Ukraine led to spikes in energy and food prices. That was the fastest rate since November 1981. <br/>Though the problem has since subsided, some analysts say the Fed will have to do more to get inflation under control.<br/>So-called core inflation, which is seen as a better gauge of underlying pressures because it does not include changeable food and energy products, rose 0.4% from April to May. <br/>That pace has held steady for three months in a row, the Labor Department said. <br/>Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said she did not expect the Fed to raise rates this week, but said the bank was likely to return to the question when they meet in July. <br/>\"Today's... number was a relief for the market, as the data met expectations, confirmed the dis-inflationary trend, and re-affirmed current market pricing of a Fed pause tomorrow,\" she said. \"However, the rate of dis-inflation remains incompatible with the Fed's 2% target.\" <br/>She noted similar that authorities in Australia and Canada recently increased rates after pausing, citing stubborn inflationary pressures.<br/>In Europe, the European Central Bank is widely expected to raise rates at its meeting this week. <br/>How worried should I be about the US economy?<br/>Strong job gains in US add to economic puzzle<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

HMRC have said this change will free up 350 advisers to take urgent calls on other lines and answer customer correspondence. <br/>Jonathan Eida, of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be furious to learn that HMRC's self-assessment phone will be off the hook for months this year. <br/>\"Workers trying to do the right thing require assistance all year around, and for many people going online presents a number of challenges. <br/>\"HMRC should reverse this decision and pick up the phone this summer.\"   <br/>You must fill in a self-assessment tax return if in the last tax year you were self-employed as a \"sole trader\" and earned more than \u00a31,000, if you in a business partnership or if you earned \u00a3100,000 or more. <br/>Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said: \"Given the potentially significant impact closing the self-assessment helpline may have on taxpayers, we're looking for clarification that HMRC has fully considered the costs and benefits of this decision. <br/>\"There are also concerns around the short notice with which this was announced. HMRC must be open, upfront and transparent when making decisions which could impact so many individuals.\" <br/>Ms Baldwin has written to HMRC to ask about the impact the closure will have on taxpayers and whether an analysis and consultation has taken place. <br/>She also wants to know if the helpline will be reopened earlier than planned if the negative impact on taxpayers is greater than expected. <br/>Ms Baldwin also asks if the closure of the helpline is related to HMRC's homeworking policy or staffing issues, as well as for information on the procedures in place to assist vulnerable taxpayers and those unable to use digital services. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"We continually review our services and a seasonal [self-assessment] helpline will make more of our expert advisers available to respond to the most urgent queries over the summer.\"<br/>The self-assessment helpline receives far fewer calls over the summer, with calls around 50% higher between January and April compared with June to August according to HMRC.<br/>HMRC also previously announced a decision to close its VAT registration helpline from Monday 22 May. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>In December last year, the FTC had asked an in-house administrative judge to block the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.<br/>William Kovacic, former FTC chair and non-executive director at the UK's CMA, said the FTC had expressed concerns that Microsoft and Activision might close their deal despite UK opposition, and so asked a judge to halt it.<br/>\"The EU's decision to take a settlement was a bit of a surprise,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme<br/>Mr Kovacic said there was still a chance the takeover could be completed, but added \"the chance is diminished\".<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to play catch-up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases -

Because if that is happening around us, it's difficult for us to be competitive,\" he said.<br/>Cheaper steel imports, particularly from China, have proved difficult for companies like Tata Steel.<br/>The mission to decarbonise is a common one across the steel industry, according to the independent think tank Green Alliance.<br/>\"The Port Talbot site in south Wales is one of the largest individual sites in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, so there really is a significant impact from the steel industry,\" Roz Bulleid from Green Alliance said.<br/>New technologies had emerged which could bring down emissions, she said, adding the steel industry was taking the issue seriously.<br/>\"Demand from customers for cleaner steel is encouraging investment,\" she said, but she called on steelmakers to commit more money and to hasten their decarbonisation process.<br/>\"Having said that, there are governments around the world investing tens, and sometimes hundreds of millions in lower carbon steelmaking in their own countries,\" she said.<br/>\"So I can also see why steelmakers here are turning to the government and wondering if they could also get a more direct subsidy as well.\"<br/>Green Alliance estimated turning off two of the UK's four blast furnaces would have the equivalent impact on emissions of removing 2.4 million petrol cars from the roads.<br/>Asked if the long-term transformation of Port Talbot would result in fewer steel industry jobs, Mr Adam said: \"I think it's too early to say it's a job cutter, the jobs will change in the profile, there will be new jobs, other jobs.\"<br/>Tata Steel warns of uncertainty over UK business<br/>The race across Europe to build green steel plants<br/>Steel industry needs money soon, union boss warns<br/>Truss promises talks on future of steelworks<br/>Crunch-time warning for steelworks' greener future<br/>Steelworks could close down without subsidy deal<br/>UK steel industry- statistics and policyUK Parliamenthttps---commonslibrary.parliament.uk \u203a cbp-7317<br/>UK Steel - Make UK<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe?

These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways.

That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe. <br/>Amazon to pay $25m over child privacy violations<br/>New rules ban subscription traps and fake reviews<br/>Amazon to cut another 9,000 jobs<br/>Amazon to axe 18,000 jobs as it cuts costs<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government.

We're back to that phase of you can't hang around if you are looking at a fixed rate.\" <br/>He said lenders were being forced to reprice deals as the market shifted around them and those with cheaper deals faced a \"tidal wave\" of business.<br/>\"Unfortunately I think this week we may still have to see more of that happening. <br/>\"But hopefully those rates will just start to find a level and we'll see things start to calm down in the near future.\"<br/>According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage deal is 5.86%, while a five-year deal has hit 5.51%.<br/>Last May they were 3.03% and 3.17% respectively, meaning many households have seen sharp rises in their borrowing costs. <br/>When a fixed term comes to an end then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). But brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill. <br/>Ian Stuart, boss of HSBC in the UK, admitted it was a \"deeply concerning\" time for a lot of customers.<br/>\"If you've got an old rate, as many will have, let's say 1.5%, and you're going to come off that rate and go onto something like 5%, that is a big impact on your monthly budget.\" <br/>He said the bank had been forced to pause sales of new deals last week as it was struggling to meet \"unprecedented\" demand.<br/>He also said HSBC expected UK interest rates to rise further, putting more pressure on the market. <br/>\"So not the news mortgagees would be looking for, but I don't think inflation is going to fall quite as fast as we had hoped.\" <br/>Rising mortgage rates are also putting pressure on landlords, pushing some to consider selling up, surveyors say.<br/>In turn, that could further squeeze the availability of rental properties and raise costs for tenants, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.<br/>Five reasons why mortgages are getting us down<br/>HSBC reopens mortgage offers after criticism<br/>Mortgage squeeze as rates rise and deals are pulled<br/>'Mortgage costs right now are terrifying'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

However campaigners in favour of the strategy argue that tax revenues could be used to promote healthier eating patterns.<br/>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government had taken \"firm action\" to tackle unhealthy foods, and would continue to work closely with industry.<br/>\"Our sugar reduction programme has delivered dramatic reductions in the amount of sugar in foods eaten by children - including a 14.9% decrease in the sugar content of breakfast cereals and a 13.5% reduction in the sugar content of yogurts and fromage frais,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.<br/>The government introduced restrictions late last year on where unhealthy foods can be displayed in shops, but delayed new limits on \"volume\" offers such as buy-one-get-one-free, until autumn this year.<br/>A ban on TV advertising of junk food before 21:00 has been pushed back to October 2025 to give the industry more time to prepare for the restrictions.<br/>Henry Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon fast-food chain, appointed as the government's healthy eating \"tsar\", resigned earlier this year, criticising the lack of progress. <br/>His report last year, which recommended measures including taxes on salt and sugar used in processed food, with the revenues used to provide fresh fruit and vegetables to low-income families, was not taken up by the government.<br/>Industry body the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said manufacturers were committed to improving the \"nutritional profile\" of their products, in part by offering a range of portion sizes. As a result, the average shopping basket contained 13% fewer calories, 15% fewer sugars and 24% less salt than in 2018, the FDF said.<br/>\"Companies will continue to innovate, but this often takes time, requires significant investment and can be technically challenging depending on the food,\" an FDF spokesperson said.<br/>Additional taxes would make the task harder by adding to the \"financial burden\" of rising costs that manufacturers were already facing, the FDF said.<br/>Mr Mayer said Danone UK & Ireland had committed to keep 90% of its range of products below the threshold that counts as high in fat, salt and sugar, and would not launch any new products marketed at children that were in that category.<br/>Could ultra-processed foods be harmful for us?<br/>Greggs to open 150 shops and extend opening hours<br/>Nestle urged to cut sales of unhealthy foods<br/>Tesco Clubcard pricing could be breaking law - Which?<br/>Tory obesity strategy makes no sense - ex-adviser<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Dozens of other UK companies are thought to be using MOVEit. <br/>The criminals responsible for the hack are linked to the notorious Clop ransomware group, thought to be based in Russia. <br/>They have threatened to begin publishing data of companies that do not email them to begin the negotiations by Wednesday. <br/>BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy said the group is well-known for carrying out its threats and it is likely that organisations will have private data published on the gang's darknet website in the coming weeks.  <br/>He said it is usually the case that if a victim does not appear on Clop's website, they may have secretly paid the group a ransom which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.<br/>Victims are always encouraged not to pay though as it fuels the growth of this criminal enterprise and there is no guarantee that the hackers will not use the data for secondary attacks. <br/>What action can those caught up in mass hacks take?<br/>BBC, BA and Boots among victims of mass payroll hack<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"<br/>The settlement follows weeks of embarrassing revelations about the extent of JP Morgan's relationship with the late financier.<br/>Late last month, long-time chief executive Jamie Dimon provided a formal statement under oath for the case, in what turned out to be a day-long deposition from the bank's headquarters in New York.<br/>Lawyers representing the unnamed accuser who filed the suit - identified only as Jane Doe 1 - asked a federal judge on Friday to allow them to take new testimony from Mr Dimon.<br/>They also asked to reopen depositions for three other key witnesses in the case.<br/>Another lawsuit filed against the bank late last year in federal court is still pending. That case was brought on behalf of the government of the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned a private island with a mansion.<br/>The financier kept hundreds of millions of dollars in more than 50 accounts at JP Morgan between 1998 and 2013, five years after he pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. <br/>He was found dead at the age of 66 in a prison cell in 2019. New York City's medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.<br/>The Jane Doe 1 lawsuit said that JP Morgan \"knowingly facilitated, sustained and concealed\" the frequent cash withdrawals Epstein made to pay the young women he trafficked, while profiting from the deals and clients that the financier brought in.<br/>The bank, which earlier failed to dismiss the dual suits, has countered that any civil liability should rest with Jes Staley, a former top executive who befriended Epstein.<br/>Mr Staley has said his former employer is trying to \"deflect blame\" for its own failures and sought to dismiss the claims, but the complaint against him remains active.<br/>Last month, Deutsche Bank, where Epstein was a client after he left JP Morgan in 2013, settled for $75m with Epstein accusers.<br/>To date, the Epstein estate has paid out more than $150m to more than 100 of his victims.<br/>Bank to pay $75m in Epstein sex-trafficking lawsuit<br/>JP Morgan chief deposed over bank's Epstein ties<br/>Staley says JPMorgan wants Epstein case \u2018shield\u2019<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is not only anxious homeowners - tenants are worried their landlords, facing higher rates of their own, will put up their rent.<br/>Here are five reasons for the current commotion.<br/>If forecasts were to be believed, we should be seeing a significant slowdown in price rises. The rate of inflation shows the pace at which prices are going up, and so charts the rising cost of living.<br/>The latest official data spooked markets and lenders though, as it suggested inflation was going to stay higher for longer than anticipated. It also pointed to a theory that higher prices were becoming more embedded in the UK economy.<br/>The premier, if rather blunt, tool to tackle high inflation is for the Bank of England to put up interest rates. With the benchmark rate now expected to peak at 5.5%, rather than the current 4.5%, the cost to lenders would be greater, and so - in turn - they have put up the interest rate they charge for mortgages.<br/>Mohamed El-Erian, former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and president of Queens' College at Cambridge University, says the blame lies with central banks who suggested high inflation would only be temporary. <br/>\"It turned out inflation was persistent and therefore central banks were late and society as a whole was late to adjust to higher inflation,\" he told the BBC.<br/>Two years ago there was a rush from property buyers as tax concessions from ministers to keep the housing market moving during Covid were wound down.<br/>Lower or zero rates on stamp duty, and the equivalent tax in Scotland and Wales, made \"a hot market even hotter\", according to analysts. The pandemic led many people to reconsider where they lived, and stamp duty cuts made them move more quickly.<br/>Many of those buyers got two-year fixed mortgages, which are now due to expire.<br/>The peak for homeowners rolling off fixed mortgage deals is July to October this year, with more than 400,000 expected to do so, according to figures from the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. <br/>The timing isn't great. The rates being offered for a new deal now are considerably higher than back then. That could add hundreds of pounds to a monthly mortgage repayment.<br/>Anil and Jessica Jhamat, from Solihull, are having to find an extra \u00a3550 a month. They bought their home during the stamp duty holiday, which allowed them to purchase \"a house we wouldn't otherwise have been able to afford\".  <br/>\"We assumed interest rates would stay low, otherwise we'd have taken out a five-year fix,\" Mr Jhamat said. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\"<br/>The pharmacist and his wife, a digital manager, also have to find \u00a31,000 a month in childcare fees for their one-year-old son. \"Where we are now, we've lost what we saved [in stamp duty]. Essentially we're back to square one,\" he said.<br/>A mortgage repayment is the highest monthly outgoing for many people, so decisions over which product to choose are made with lots of thought and advice.<br/>The trouble is lenders are currently withdrawing their mortgage products with hardly any notice. That makes for a frenzied situation.<br/>On Thursday, HSBC gave notice to brokers that it was going to pull its deals four hours later. After being inundated with applications, it withdrew them within three hours, only to then temporarily reopen the channel for applications on Friday. <br/>At times like this, big lenders do not want their deals to be significantly cheaper than their rivals, and they only want as many applications as they can cope with.<br/>Justin Moy, founder at Chelmsford-based mortgage broker EHF Mortgages, said: \"These last-minute communications just add to the stress of the situation. Decisions on rate changes and repricing must give everyone the opportunity to react in a controlled manner, especially when the increases are hefty and make a real difference to a borrower.\"<br/>Homeowners who decide the best thing to do is sit on their hands and wait for things to settle down could face a nasty shock.<br/>When a fixed term comes to an end - usually after two or five years - then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). That rate is higher, which is why most people go on to another fixed deal instead, although not everyone has that option as, for example, they may have missed payments in the past.<br/>Brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.<br/>Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.<br/>\"Some lenders have a much higher SVR than others. We tell our clients how important it is to choose a lender that treats its customers fairly when their rates come to an end,\" says Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.<br/>Many people have been shocked by the rise in mortgage rates since December 2021, because they had grown so accustomed to ultra-low interest rates for the previous decade or more.<br/>A variety of economic, and pandemic, reasons kept interest rates down - at times at historic lows.<br/>Anyone who has bought a first home during that time would never have faced such a situation as now. Rates have been much higher in previous decades, but people are now borrowing more as house prices have soared.<br/>Lenders tested applicants' finances for their ability to cope with higher rates. That is now more reality than theory, and will lead some people to question whether they stretched themselves too far. Analysts say the availability of jobs, and a relative lack of unemployment, has saved many from having to sell up.<br/>The impact is felt by tenants too. Higher costs for landlords will push up rental prices, and would lead to fewer homes being available to rent if they decide to leave the sector.<br/>Read more here<br/>Additional reporting by Jemma Dempsey<br/>Mortgage calculator: Will my payments rise?<br/>Rent prices: Have they gone up in your area?<br/>More pain for renters as landlords look to sell up<br/>How the interest rate rise affects you<br/>HSBC reopens mortgage offers after criticism<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And she sells her own Isabella Vrana label.<br/>Over her eight years in the business, Ms Vrana says she has seen huge changes in demand for second-hand clothes. <br/>\"It wasn't such a normal thing when I started so I've definitely seen an increase in people buying second hand to try and be more sustainable,\" she says.<br/>Plus there's the quality of well-made vintage clothes. \"These items are lasting decades and they're being worn as well. Take a vintage pair of jeans - I've got jeans with dry cleaning labels from the 1990s and they're still going so strong,\" she says.<br/>\"I think people are realising that you might be investing a bit more of an upfront cost, but then it is really paying off long-term.\"<br/>Adam Jay, marketplace chief executive at the clothing resell app Vinted, says the growth in demand for second-hand clothing as been \"phenomenal\".<br/>Vinted now has over eight million registered members in the UK, up from 1.2 million in 2021.<br/>There are the obvious reasons why people are attracted to second-hand clothing. <br/>Buying new clothes and footwear can be expensive at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living. <br/>The rate at which prices are rising for clothing and shoes hit 6.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.   <br/>Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for generating between 8-10% of global emissions, according to the United Nations, from growing cotton to using oil to create synthetic materials such as polyester.<br/>But for fashion and sustainability vlogger Rosie Okotcha \"thrifted fashion is very cool now because its my personal style, no-one else can get it\".<br/>She credits TikTok and Instagram with driving the trend for second-hand clothing, in particular with \"Gen Z\" shoppers - that's people who were born in between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.<br/>That is reflected in the sort of styles people are buying. <br/>According to Depop, \"Y2K\" is a popular trend on its app including oversized denim, colourful crochet and vintage t-shirts. There's also demand for one-of-a-kind and customised items, as well as clothing that is handmade or reworked from existing pieces.  <br/>But while the internet might be fuelling the trend, there is vintage fashion to be found in the High Street charity shop.<br/>Ms Okotcha says that part of her mission is to try to \"break down the stigma that there is something wrong with shopping second hand because it is actually really fantastic fun and great for the planet\".<br/>While it might seem inevitable that the popularity of apps might have ended up re-routing clothing donations away from the High Street, the Charity Retail Association (CRA) says that's not the case.<br/>Charity shop sales rose by 15.1% between January and March compared with the same three months last year.  <br/>\"There is plenty of second-hand clothing to go around, so we see the growth of online selling platforms as complementary to the work of charity shops,\" says the CRA.<br/>Ms Vrana agrees that there is plenty of room for competition, and she plans to continue.  <br/>\"There's definitely money to be made,\" she says. <br/>\"You can definitely support yourself through doing this full-time, which I'm really grateful for because sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because I enjoy it so much.\" <br/>Shein faces US calls for probe into Uyghur claims<br/>Making prom affordable during cost of living crisis<br/>The apps getting your wardrobe back under control<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Savita Patel, a California-based independent journalist, speaks to those supporting and opposing the bill becoming a law.<br/>Sukhjinder Kaur*, a nurse at a hospital in California, works long and tiring hours serving patients. But whenever it's break time, things become oppressive. <br/>She is a Dalit (a community that is placed at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste hierarchy) and says she often faces casteist insults from her South Asian colleagues.<br/>Dalit rights activists say scores of caste-oppressed Californians face housing, educational, professional, and social discrimination. <br/>In March, Senator Aisha Wahab, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, authored and introduced the SB-403 bill -  legislation that seeks to add caste as a protected category in the state's anti-discrimination laws alongside gender, race, religion and disability.<br/>The bill was passed by the state's senate in May with a 34-1 vote. If it goes through in the state assembly, California will become the first US state to ban caste discrimination.<br/>\"Nurses from upper castes pass slurs about chamars [a pejorative term for Dalits] being dirty and polluting,\" says Ms Kaur, who is among those who are in favour of the law. <br/>In February, Seattle became the first city in the US - and outside South Asia - to outlaw caste discrimination, generating momentum for the legislation in California. It is being propelled by the same broad multi-faith, inter-caste, multi-racial coalition of over 40 American and international Dalit and human rights activists and organisations, led by California-based Equality Labs.<br/>California has a large South Asian diaspora and is home to some of the world's biggest tech companies.<br/>The state is home to more than half of the 500,000-plus Sikh population in the US and gurudwaras (Sikh temples) in California have been mobilising momentum to outlaw caste discrimination. <br/>Two of the community's largest advocacy groups - The Sikh Coalition and Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund - support the bill. Among Sikhs, it is the Ravidasia community - the largest Dalit community in the state with approximately 15,000-20,000 members - which is advocating for the bill at grassroots level.<br/>Renu Singh, who follows the Ravidasia tradition and is also a women's rights activist, has been urging women to speak about their own experiences of caste discrimination and those they see around them so that lawmakers understand the gravity of the issue.<br/>Data from an Equality Lab study shows that one in four caste-oppressed people from the South Asian American diaspora have faced physical and verbal violence; one in three has faced discrimination in education, and two out of three have experienced workplace discrimination.<br/>It was the first extensive study of caste distribution and its effects in the US and had over 1,500 respondents. The findings, published in 2018, say that those from \"lower castes\" fear retaliation and worry about being \"outed\" and hence \"hide their caste\".<br/>However, a significant section of the Indian diaspora rejects caste discrimination claims.<br/>Deepak Aldrin, a San Francisco-based Dalit activist is not in favour of the bill. \"I've lived here for 35 years. No Hindu has ever asked me what caste I belong to,\" he says.<br/>The bill is meeting strong opposition from many Indian-American individuals, religious and professional groups, who argue that even though it does not specifically name their religion, it will \"discriminate against Hindus, their places of worship and even make them less hiring worthy\". <br/>They say the existing laws in California are sufficient to address any discrimination and are mobilising the community to urge their lawmakers to disallow the legislation to proceed.<br/>Many businesses and Hindu temples under HinduPACT - an American Hindu grassroots advocacy initiative - have appealed to California lawmakers to reject the bill. Its convenor Ajay Shah says that the legislation is \"deeply flawed, ill-intentioned and targets children and youth from the Indian subcontinent and those who follow the Hindu dharma [Hinduism].\"<br/>Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, says this bill is already creating an \"undesirable\" awareness about caste. She says she has been \"hearing inappropriate queries from workers, especially in tech, who are being asked about their caste by non-South Asians\". She says if this becomes a pattern, it can be grounds for ethnicity-based harassment.<br/>The foundation has sued the state in a federal court for an \"unconstitutional definition of caste\" and has also challenged the addition of caste to its non-discrimination policy, saying that it \"singles out one community for ethnic profiling and additional policing\".<br/>Those opposing the bill say they are also perplexed as to how the state plans to identify an individual's caste since it's a very complex issue, .<br/>The bill, Ms Wahab explains, does not include details for identifying caste, similar to other protected categories.<br/>\"There is no language on how caste will be determined. This is simply an anti-discrimination bill. When somebody takes a matter up to the courts, that is usually when subject matter experts are engaged, the type of discrimination potentially that has taken place [is investigated].\"<br/>Ms Wahab says she has received \"death threats\" after proposing the bill. She now faces a recall campaign and a possible re-election. She adds that the \"visceral reaction\" to the bill is \"disheartening\" and has urged Californians to read the bill.<br/>\"Whether you're upper caste or lower caste, it does not matter, it will protect you as well,\" she says.<br/>*Some names have been changed to protect identity.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

It was made in a laboratory on an industrial estate just a few miles down the road.<br/>I'm in Huber's Butchery and Bistro in Singapore, which is the only restaurant in world to have so-called cultivated meat on the menu.<br/>Feedback from customers has been \"phenomenal\", according to the restaurant's owner.<br/>The meat's creator - California-based Eat Just - says it is ethical, clean and green - with no compromise on taste. Billions of dollars are being poured into the industry, but huge question marks hang over its viability as anything beyond a novelty.<br/>Ever since the first lab-grown burger - which cost a mere $330,000 (\u00a3263,400) to create - was unveiled in London in 2013, dozens of companies around the world have joined the race to bring affordable cultivated meat to the market.<br/>So far, only Eat Just has managed to get its product approved for public sale after regulators in Singapore - the only country in the world to allow lab-grown meat to be sold - gave its chicken the green light in December 2020.<br/>But it is still nowhere near being widely available. Cultivated chicken nuggets were briefly on the menu at a private members' club in 2021. <br/>That partnership lasted a few months and this year Huber's has started offering a chicken sandwich and a chicken pasta dish to the general public - albeit only once a week with limited dining slots available.<br/>\"Cultivated meat is real meat, but you don't have to slaughter an animal,\" says Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Eat Just, who spoke to the BBC from San Francisco. \"This way of eating makes sense for the future,\" he says.<br/>Unlike plant-based substitutes, cultivated meat is literally meat. The process involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats.<br/>The cells are allowed to divide and grow, before being placed in a large steel bioreactor, which acts like a fermentation tank.<br/>After four to six weeks, the material is 'harvested' from the bioreactor. Some vegetable protein is added, then it is moulded, cooked and 3-D printed to give it the necessary shape and texture.<br/>The resulting strips of deep fried chicken on my plate of orecchiette pasta certainly tasted like the real deal, if a bit processed. Perhaps the sort of chicken you would eat in a fast-food restaurant.<br/>\"It's meat - it's perfect!\" says Caterina, an Italian student who came here especially to try the cultivated chicken. Normally, for sustainability reasons, she would not eat meat but Caterina says she would eat this.<br/>Her only quibble? Serving the chicken with pasta, which typically does not happen in Italy.<br/>Another diner from Singapore says he was surprised by how much it resembled real meat.<br/>\"It's legit\", he says. \"I wouldn't know where it came from. My only concern would be the cost.\"<br/>The chicken pasta dish I ordered was S$18.50 ($13.70; \u00a311), but that is vastly discounted relative to the current cost of producing the meat. <br/>Eat Just will not say exactly how much it spends on making its cultivated chicken, but at the moment the company's production capacity only yields 2kg (4.4lb) or 3kg per week in Singapore.<br/>When you compare that to the 4,000kg - 5,000kg of conventional chicken sold weekly - at Huber's alone - it gives you a sense of the scale of the task ahead. Put simply, they will need to increase production enormously to avoid making a loss on each piece of chicken.<br/>Eat Just says it has already achieved a 90% reduction in costs since 2018 and the company offered me a tour of its new multi-million dollar production facility in Singapore, which it hopes will open next year.<br/>The pair of shiny steel 1,320 gallon (6,000 litres) bioreactors certainly represent a sign of intent, but in reality they are a tiny fraction of the millions of tonnes of chicken that would need to be produced to match the price of slaughtered chicken.<br/>The industry is urging for patience, but many scientists have already seen enough.<br/>\"The narrative presented by these companies is very strong\", says Ricardo San Martin, co-director of the Alt: Meat Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.<br/>\"But that narrative must be contrasted with the science\", he says. \"Run the numbers, look at every scientific paper written by people who have no skin in the game, and you'll see the answer is clear.\"<br/>\"Can you do this, at scale, at a reasonable cost? No. Can you talk about saving the world with this? Again, no. These companies have to be honest - it's wishful thinking\", he says.<br/>Not only are there doubts about scaling up production, there is also uncertainty over the industry's green credentials, which have been questioned by scientists.<br/>In theory, reducing the world's reliance on land and livestock for meat production should reduce carbon emissions, but at the moment the advanced technology needed to create cultivated meat is so energy intensive that it cancels out any benefits. <br/>One study by the University of California, Davis even estimated that the process produces between 4 and 25 times as much carbon dioxide as regular beef. However, East Just has called the study \"flawed\".<br/>When asked by the BBC whether the whole project might end in failure, Josh Tetrick from Eat Just replied: \"For sure\".<br/>But he remains undeterred: \"Making meat in this way is both necessary and highly uncertain,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not straightforward. It's complicated. It's not guaranteed and it might not work out. But the other option for us is not to do anything. So we decided to take a bet and go for it.\"<br/>Plenty of investors have decided to make that same bet. As of this year, an estimated $2.8bn has been spent on developing cultivated meat.<br/>However, if cultivated meat is to become anything more than a niche alternative for the well-off in the developed world, then relying on investments from private businesses may not be enough.<br/>Governments, Mr Tetrick says, are going to need to put \"significant public money\" into cultivated meat for it to rival conventionally slaughtered meat. <br/>\"This is like the transition to renewable energy... It's a lifetime project - maybe a multiple lifetimes project,\" he says.<br/>At the moment though no country outside Singapore has authorised the sale of cultivated meat, let alone committed to serious investment.<br/>According to Ricardo San Martin from UC Berkeley, both private and public funding for cultivated meat companies will dry up if they do not \"look in the mirror\" soon and present realistic forecasts to investors.<br/>\"Unless there is a clear path to success at some point in the future, investors and governments will not want to spend money on something that is not scientifically proven\".<br/>Italy to ban lab-grown meat to protect heritage<br/>Lab-grown chicken safe to eat, say US regulators<br/>Singapore approves lab-grown 'chicken' meat<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks.

varying in size from under 20 employees to 200 - have already signed the pledge, which is divided into five \"pillars\".<br/>They include creating a maternity leave and return to work plan for employees and helping them \"maintain an emotional connection with the workplace so they do not feel anxious about being on maternity leave and their subsequent return to work\".<br/>Susannah believes current maternity leave practices often fall short of where they should be.<br/>She says: \"Although there are laws in place, the statistics and stories show that the measures currently in place to protect jobs and provide financial support are not working as well as they could as they're not reflective of the society we live in, what mothers want and the profound experience of motherhood.<br/>\"Our aim with the Maternity Pledge is to help keep mothers in the workplace if they want to be and through that we hope to see more women in leadership roles.\"<br/>Pregnant employees of firms that sign up are also given a \"matrescence pack\", which Susannah says covers \"the parts of motherhood which tend to be glossed over in pregnancy but can affect mental health\". <br/>It addresses issues such as breastfeeding problems and the affect of matrescence on relationships with partners.<br/>Companies already signed up to the pledge seem to be fully on board with its goals.<br/>Colchester-based PR company founder Megan Dorian says she is glad to be part of the project.<br/>\"When I launched Orange PR and Marketing when my first-born daughter was just over a year, I knew a priority for the business was to create an inclusive culture that not only supported but embraced parents in their journey,\" she says. <br/>\"There is still a stigma around women taking a career 'break' - it's certainly not a break - to have a baby and then return to work, and I am a big advocate for breaking this down.\"<br/>Another supporter is London-based Jenny Jones, chief operating officer of advisory, legal and accountancy firm Dragon Argent.<br/>\"Becoming a mother was the hardest transition I've ever had to make,\" she says. <br/>\"Going from being confident in your job and your life in general to being at home looking after a very small, fragile person 24/7 was tricky to say the least.  <br/>\"Supporting all our present and future parents through the often unspoken challenges of balancing parenthood and careers matters to us, which is why we signed The Maternity Pledge.\"<br/>Susannah says everyone benefits if companies support new mothers' return to work with as much flexibility and care for their wellbeing as possible.<br/>\"Maternity leave can work better for businesses and mothers if communication, support and empathy is improved,\" she says.<br/>\"Most women want to work - and with the cost of living, nearly all women need to work - so it's really important to keep women in a workplace where they feel valued and fulfilled.\"<br/>Tory MP: I'm dismayed by abuse for maternity leave<br/>'Maternity leave is hard and lonely'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

If I have to give up being a blacksmith, then I will,\" the 39-year-old says.<br/>The craftsman is not alone. Many are facing similar financial dilemmas as they contemplate rising mortgage costs. <br/>The Bank of England has been steadily raising interest rates for the last year and a half, as it tries to tackle soaring prices. <br/>After figures last week showed inflation not coming down as quickly as expected, many now predict the central bank will continue to raise rates from their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.<br/>That in turn had an immediate impact on the mortgage market. Lenders began raising their rates. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.49% and the average five-year fixed is currently 5.17%.<br/>And within a week hundreds of mortgage deals were removed from the market as lenders reassessed their offers.<br/>\"Carnage\" is how Craig Fish from Lodestone brokers in London described the situation. <br/>\"I'm currently on hold to NatWest - 30 minutes and counting - to discuss a possible new mortgage as they have just announced they are withdrawing rates at 10.30pm tonight. Do the lenders think the future is this uncertain?\" he said earlier this week.<br/>Jo Wilder, 28, works for Cardiff Council and pays \u00a3700 a month for a studio apartment she has been renting for the past 18 months. She now wants to buy her own home - a process that is taking longer than she hopes, as she watches rates rise. <br/>Despite having a healthy 20% deposit and a mortgage in principle, she says there are \"not really any properties on the market\".<br/>Repayments on a three-year fixed-rate deal at 4.5% would be between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 but she is worried about interest rates going up.<br/>\"It's not ideal. I'm just going to have to wait it out and hope rates come down. It really is very stressful,\" she says.<br/>Jo had hoped getting her own place would mean a drop in monthly outgoings but with rising food prices she no longer thinks that will be the case.<br/>\"It is disheartening,\" she adds. \"The way things are going I think it is actually going to be the same price, which is pretty daunting to be honest.\"<br/>In Bedfordshire, Anthony Jones and his wife have a 14-month-old daughter - they want to upsize and have been trying to sell since last August. <br/>The couple's five-year fixed deal has ended and they are now on a tracker mortgage, leaving them \u00a3200 worse off a month, at a little over \u00a31,200.<br/>\"It's a bit of a nightmare,\" says Anthony. \"We're looking at upsizing and all of a sudden are having to question the affordability of it.\"<br/>The 33-year-old says when they first put their house on the market there had been \"a lot of interest initially, then all of a sudden we had people saying 'our mortgage offer has been pulled' and 'we can't afford it anymore'.\"<br/>The couple have reduced the asking price from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3275,000, but say they cannot accept less because otherwise they will not have the deposit for their second home.<br/>\"Our daughter has grown so quickly, we need a garden and bigger bedrooms and more storage. The lack of space is even causing arguments between me and my partner,\" says Anthony.<br/>Read more here<br/>The upheaval for people going through the application process comes as Bank of England figures this week showed a decline in the number of mortgages being approved. <br/>The number of net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 48,700 in April from 51,500 in March.<br/>Mortgage broker London & Country is now seeing a trend for people fixing for one or two years, rather than the previous most popular five-year term, on the basis that interest rates will have fallen by the time they come to look for their next deal.<br/>Spokesman David Hollingworth says people who are refinancing should start searching for a new product six months before the end of their current deal.<br/>Some may want to consider taking out new mortgages over a longer term - something a lot of first-time buyers do to \"give themselves breathing space\", he says.<br/>If it is a struggle to meet payments on an existing mortgage there is also the option of extending the term, but Mr Hollingworth says this is \"not a move to be taken lightly because it will significantly increase the overall interest bill, by tens of thousands of pounds\".<br/>Are you struggling to get a mortgage or one that's affordable?

He had booked a train on Friday to get to Carlisle ahead of a 600km cycle event. <br/>The train he booked was cancelled, because of the strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which is expected to put a halt to half of Friday's scheduled trains. <br/>He can't depend on getting space for his bike on the trains that are running. So he'll be getting up at 07:00 to drive 300 miles instead.<br/>The leisure industry has protested the loudest about the impact of train strikes. <br/>\"We've seen time and time again that rail strikes put a significant dampener on any sales as visitors are deterred from booking visits or eating and drinking out,\" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said in a statement. <br/>The industry group reckons strikes this week, during the half-term school holiday, will cost the sector \u00a3132m, bringing the total impact on the sector to an \"eye-watering\" \u00a33.25bn.<br/>Having to cancel leisure activities was by far the most frequently mentioned impact of the strikes, according to the most recent study from the Office for National Statistics.  <br/>Businesses that are in stations obviously suffer particularly. The ONS tracks weekly sales from 400 Pret a Manger sandwich shops around the country, and the branches in stations see a noticeable dip in sales on strike weeks.<br/>And retailers were acutely affected by the wave of strikes in the key shopping days ahead of Christmas last year.<br/>But the impact of strikes on people getting to work is relatively limited, the ONS's work suggests. <br/>Only one in 10 people actually travel to work by train, according to a different ONS survey. <br/>And of those who do travel by train, 70% said they could work from home. <br/>The rest could get to work by other means - though not necessarily a 50-mile bike ride - and very few respondents said they couldn't work at all because of the train strike.<br/>Speaking to the BBC, the RMT's assistant general secretary John Leach said: \"We regret the inconvenience caused by industrial action. <br/>\"We would much rather be doing what we do every other day of the year, which is keeping Britain moving, our members coming to work to do that. It's an obvious regret but it's also our responsibility to represent our people, our members, and we will never apologise for doing that.\"<br/>Rail strikes have had much less impact since the signallers and other Network Rail staff agreed a pay deal to end their campaign. When the signallers joined the strikes, up to 90% of trains would be cancelled. <br/>The sector most hurt by the strikes may in fact be the railway industry itself.<br/>Mr Bezant says the strikes, and cancellations caused by engineering works, have shaken his faith in the rail network. <br/>\"I expect that any events I book in the future, I will consider driving. There's not much point trusting the trains. It will change the way I travel,\" he says.<br/>Even if the strikes were resolved tomorrow, he would still be uncertain. \"It has been going on for so long. It will affect me for quite some time I think.\"<br/>He estimates the train journeys he has not made because of strikes add up to around \u00a3700 - lost revenue for an industry that is already in a serious financial condition.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies, reckons the dispute has cost the rail industry around \u00a3580m so far, a sum which increases with every new day of strike action. The bill is ultimately met by the government, which now picks up the tab for any shortfall in ticket sales.  <br/>And Mr Bezant is unlikely to be the only one who will take some time to regain his faith in the railways, even when the disputes are over.<br/>How are you affected by the latest train strikes?

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\"<br/>Inside the routine at Elizabeth Holmes' prison<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\"<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

She would jump at the chance, he says, \"to step in... and say, 'I can fix this'\".<br/>Which begs the question: can she?<br/>Even before billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, the social network had problems.<br/>It has been fiercely criticised, by the left and right, for how it polices misinformation and hate speech, and the business has struggled to break even - making an annual profit just twice since its launch in 2006.<br/>Growth, whether measured by users or the money it brings in, has been bumpy.<br/>Since Mr Musk took over the platform last year, the issues have only gotten worse.<br/>He has cut 75% of its former staff, including teams charged with tracking abuse; changed how the company verifies authentic accounts; and sparked debate with his own tweets spreading conspiracy theories.<br/>Advertisers have left in large numbers and users also appear sceptical. A recent poll by Pew found that six in 10 adults in the US, Twitter's largest base, were taking a break and a quarter said they did not expect to be using the app in a year.<br/>Even Mr Musk has seemed daunted by the challenges, going through with his $44bn purchase last year only under threat of a lawsuit. He has joked that only someone \"foolish\" would want the chief executive title from him.<br/>Ms Yaccarino appears undaunted. <br/>Raised in an Italian-American family, the daughter of a police officer has risen through the ranks of some of the biggest media companies in the US, forging a reputation as a high-heeled and hard-charging executive, who has helped steer entertainment giant NBCUniversal through the upheaval wrought by the growth of the tech giants.<br/>At NBCU, home to brands such as NBC News, Focus Features and Bravo, Ms Yaccarino overhauled the ad sales business, pushed the 2020 launch of its ad-supported streaming platform Peacock, and drove industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrated online. <br/>The mother-of-two, who met her husband Claude Madrazo on a blind date and became a grandmother last year, was known to want some kind of promotion after a decade at NBCU where she was chairman of global advertising and partnerships. <br/>There was widespread speculation about her interest in Twitter, especially after she defended Mr Musk at a conference last year, urging critical advertisers to \"give the guy a minute\". <br/>\"I've long been inspired by your vision to create a brighter future,\" she tweeted after her new post was announced. \"I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\"<br/>By hiring Ms Yaccarino, Mr Musk has \"purchased trust\" from advertisers, says Mr Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory.<br/>Indeed, industry giant GroupM, who represents brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle, has already said it sees the platform as less risky.<br/>But repairing Twitter's business will be no small task. <br/>Though big ad buyers are eager to have choices beyond the tech giants, the platform remains too small to be a must-buy, says long-time media analyst Brian Wieser, now principal at consultancy Madison and Wall. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>New Twitter CEO tells Musk: \u2018I\u2019ve met my match\u2019<br/>Beyond advertising, she will also face a host of pressing issues: regulatory scrutiny of Twitter's hate speech and privacy controls; lawsuits from landlords, vendors and former staff over unpaid bills; not to mention user complaints and basic tech glitches, like the malfunctions that plagued the high-profile interview with Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis hosted on the platform. <br/>The biggest wild card of all, of course, is Mr Musk, who has said he intends to remain involved at the site, overseeing products and technology. <br/>\"Anybody taking this job has been set up to fail - it's not specific to her,\" Mr Wieser says. \"The question is whether or not the odds are more likely to be in her favour than any alternative. And yeah, actually the odds are more favourable.\"<br/>Friends and former colleagues say they expect Ms Yaccarino to use her background in television to improve the platform's ad business and expand the use of video across the site. <br/>She has called Mr Musk's vision of Twitter as a starting point for an \"the everything app\", offering messages, payments and other functions a \"great opportunity\" for advertisers.<br/>\"[She has] the guts and the courage to take big swings,\" says Jacqueline Corbelli, founder and chief executive of Brightline, a tech company focused on streaming adverts, which has partnered with NBCU. <br/>\"If Twitter gives her the space to do it, she will bring the ability to integrate what's been successful in the past and blend that with what advertisers are going to be looking for to regain trust in Twitter.\"<br/>Whether Ms Yaccarino will have room to run remains a big if.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

which is the maximum price suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity - a typical household will pay \u00a32,074 a year for gas and electricity from July.<br/>That is \u00a3426 a year less than what they pay now, although still far higher than what we saw before the energy crisis.<br/>So far, most big suppliers have said they will bring their tariffs in line with the new cap but none have set out cheaper fixed deals for customers.<br/>Such deals have effectively been off the table since the government stepped in to subsidise bills with its Energy Price Guarantee in October, holding them at \u00a32,500 a year for the average household. <br/>Suppliers have claimed they are not able to offer more competitive pricing plans, and so consumers have not been able to shop around.<br/>However, Natalie Mathie, an energy expert at the switching site Uswitch.com, believes the fall in the price cap will be \"a watershed moment\" for suppliers, \"who can now look to start offering fixed deals again given the market conditions\".<br/>\"The majority of homes are on standard variable tariffs and now subject to the volatility of price cap changes every three months,\" she says. <br/>\"But customers should have the choice of whether to lock in the benefits of lower wholesale prices for 12 months, just as they do in the mortgage market. <br/>\"We see no reason why energy suppliers cannot offer competitive fixed deals around the \u00a32,000 level.\"<br/>Emily Seymour, of consumer group Which?, thinks we could start seeing such deals some time this year. <br/>\"We hope to see consumers back able to make some choices,\" she said. <br/>\"It will be worth doing a bit of research to see if there's a deal out there that could be cost effective while also offering good customer service and low exit fees.\"<br/>However, she says it will depend on where energy prices go next, with fixed deals less likely if the cap has to go up again. <br/>Others meanwhile warn that fixed deals may not be best for everyone given the uncertainty over future prices. <br/>For example, energy supplier Ovo launched a fixed deal for existing customers in March that was cheaper than the government's limit on household bills. <br/>It offered a fixed 12-month tariff of \u00a32,275 for existing customers, but anyone who signed up is now locked into that rate, meaning they will miss out when the new cap comes into effect.<br/>Martin Lewis, from personal finance website Money Saving Expert, has also questioned just how much choice consumers will get when fixed deals finally return. <br/>\"I am expecting to see existing customer offers - where you will get a bespoke offer from your firm rather than deals offered across the market,\" he told BBC Radio 4.<br/>This could stifle competition, he warned, as the rules say companies do not have to publish the details of their existing customer offers. <br/>\"It makes it very hard for people like me to assess,\" he said. <br/>In any event, the energy analysts Cornwall Insight have suggested consumers should not expect to see huge savings from deals that do emerge. <br/>That is because further substantial falls in energy prices will be unlikely, particularly if there is a cold winter in Europe, with the UK competing to buy gas and electricity with other countries.<br/>\"Our forecasts suggest until the end of this decade, higher and more volatile prices are going to be seen, and that includes the impact they're going to have on domestic bills unfortunately,\" Cornwall analyst Kate Mulvany told the BBC.<br/>Energy suppliers should be in touch in the coming weeks to let customers know what their bill will look like under the new cap.<br/>However, Ms Seymour says it is always worth having a conversation with your supplier about any bespoke deals they can offer you. <br/>If you find yourself struggling to pay bills, consumer experts suggest speaking to your energy supplier about a payment plan that is manageable.<br/>By paying what you can - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears will grow more slowly and your supplier is likely to be less worried about your debt.<br/>Your supplier could also check if you qualify for any government schemes. <br/>It's also important to check the amount you pay each month if you use a direct debit. <br/>Your monthly payment is based on your estimated usage through the year not what you actually use so keep a close eye and update your supplier with your meter readings.<br/>Listen to The Martin Lewis Podcast for more on the new energy price cap<br/>Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips.<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?<br/>What is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?<br/>Energy bills to stay high this year despite drop<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging.

As a new documentary series follows union leaders up close, the BBC's economics editor asks whether this surge in strikes is likely to persist.<br/>\"Listen, don't fall out with each other. Don't fall out with each other. It's really important everybody sticks together,\" says Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, as tensions flare on a bus drivers' picket line. <br/>The Abellio drivers in two south London depots had been offered a 12% pay rise and a \u00a3500 bonus - splitting opinion among drivers, who had been striking without full pay for 10 days. <br/>One driver later says: \"The union rep, they're selling us out\u2026 there's a lot of traitors around.\" <br/>Others say: \"We got screwed\" and \"we've been here for two months freezing and we're dying\". They would eventually win an 18% rise. <br/>Settlements such as this one have been occurring in so-called shortage sectors, such as driving buses, lorries, and rubbish trucks, since the beginning of last year. Many of those settlements went under the radar, in very local disputes or even, as here, in individual depots. <br/>The past year across industry and public services has seen hundreds of ballots, hundreds of thousands on picket lines, dozens of negotiations, double-digit pay claims and awards, and major legal battles between the government and public sector unions. <br/>Only 15 months ago, No 10 were slapping down the governor of the Bank of England for saying that people should not ask for excessive pay rises. Four months before that, the then-prime minister was celebrating the prospect of a high-wage Britain for all. <br/>And this time last year Ms Graham, the general secretary of the biggest private sector union, had never done a broadcast interview in that role. She and her colleagues are now household names after promising a \"summer, autumn, spring and winter of discontent\". <br/>Strike: Inside the Unions<br/>With access to top union leaders, the two-part documentary follows internal machinations at Unite, RMT and the RCN, as well as the GMB's campaign to win recognition at Amazon in Coventry. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). The first episode will be on BBC Two at 21:00 on 25 May, with the second a week later.<br/>Part of Boris Johnson's survival strategy had involved squaring up to the unions over their pay claims and seeking to direct blame towards the Labour Party. <br/>But the unions calculated that the old pattern of mutually dismissive relations between organised labour and government had altered since the pandemic and in the shared pain of a common cost of living crisis. The last year raises questions not just about that relationship, but whether something has changed in the water in the way the UK thinks about industrial relations. <br/>Looming over all of this are the restrictions on ballots in the government's anti-union laws. The documentary shows how unions have got around restrictions requiring postal ballots and high thresholds on turnout. <br/>The pattern over the past year has been unions breaking down national disputes into a series of far smaller local and sectoral ones, for which it is easier to win ballot mandates. Action is then co-ordinated across localities on the same day, giving the impression of massive national or regional walkouts, as with bus drivers across London. <br/>The other pattern is that of the private sector settling high wage claims in areas of labour shortages. <br/>Unite has a unit of forensic accountants assessing the profits and available cash flow of the parent companies, often foreign-owned, of the employers involved in disputes. In this case the owner was effectively the Dutch state (though it has now sold its stake), a fact routinely used by the union in online campaigning. <br/>The experience in the public sector has been different. This time last year, there was no negotiation. The Pay Review Body process had recommended a settlement of around 3% across public services. This was often before the spike in inflation to double digits following the Ukraine war. <br/>Prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss dug in on the issue. At first, so too did the Sunak administration, fearful of the fiscal cost and inflationary potential of significant rises in the wage costs of state employees. <br/>The cameras were with Royal College of Nursing (RCN) General Secretary Pat Cullen ahead of the first strikes in its history.<br/>The RCN itself had been asking for a 19% rise for nurses. The government said at that time it could not shift from the recommendation of the Pay Review Body and was not negotiating. <br/>\"It's never, ever going to get a resolution to this dispute,\" Cullen said later. \"The last meeting that I had with the secretary of state, he arrived accompanied by five men and it was not a pleasant meeting. It was quite a bullyish conversation.\" Cullen said nurses had concluded that they were being treated differently because \"we are 90% female\". <br/>And she said a government minister had told her in a meeting that they were surprised nurses needed to live off their salaries: \"And you know, ministers coming into the room saying to me that they're shocked that nursing staff may be the main breadwinner in the family. Because they believe that it's a second salary that we don't depend on. They are totally out of touch.\" <br/>The Department of Health said it did not recognise the claim and had \"utmost respect\" for all staff. <br/>Nurses in the RCN in the end rejected the deal recommended by their own union - a sign of how strongly a large swathe of public sector workers felt about the squeeze in their real wages. <br/>The film shows how nurses felt emboldened by large-scale public sympathy, especially since the pandemic. <br/>This perception of support, even in less popular professions than the NHS, has helped underpin double-digit pay claims. The successful tactics in the private sector of balloting first for strike action in order to gain negotiating leverage in pay disputes has also spread to the public sector. <br/>Some union bosses also acknowledge that in an era where more workers can work from home, the strikes may not have disrupted the public as much. While the overall number of strikes has not been seen for a generation, the total number of days lost to strike action is nowhere near the highs of the 1970s. <br/>Nonetheless, some in the union movement are trying to push into new territory too, such as the GMB at Amazon. <br/>Outside the company's Coventry warehouse, Stuart Richards, a senior GMB organiser, is attempting to recruit new members.<br/>A US training video cartoon for Amazon managers leaked in 2018 certainly made clear that \"we do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders, or most importantly, our associates\" - its term for workers.<br/>But the staff arriving by car have been squeezed hard by the cost of living crisis - one tells of having to pawn a wedding ring - and some were willing to U-turn near the entrance to their workplace and sign up to Richards' campaign. <br/>Eventually the GMB get more than half the Coventry workforce, which the union estimates at 1,300 in total, and serve a letter demanding recognition from the Amazon bosses - it is the first site in the UK to do so, after a decade of trying.<br/>So the question really is whether the current spike in strike activity is entirely a reaction to rampant inflation or whether this is something that might have a longer-lasting impact. <br/>The full data is not yet available, but it is difficult to escape a pattern of unionised workplaces, especially in shortage occupations, getting double-digit pay settlements. <br/>They have responded to existing strike restrictions by moving to immediate localised ballots, even before starting negotiations. On the other hand, insiders say that membership spikes during pay disputes, but then falls back when pay deals are done. Union subs are another expense during a cost of living crisis. Official figures will come next year. <br/>There are some concerns, though, about the persistence and stickiness of inflation. Even the Bank of England, which began last year warning about excessive pay rises, now couples that message with concerns about corporate pricing and profits, a similar message to that pushed by some union leaders. <br/>And the political economy of all this does appear to be changing. <br/>Bashing the unions has proven tricky for the government over the past year. David Cameron's union tsar Lord Richard Balfe argues that PMs Johnson and Truss should have sued for peace with public sector workers much earlier. The opposition felt confident enough to announce it would repeal the new \"minimum service level\" laws as well as older restrictions on ballots, if it wins power. <br/>This current wave of industrial action appears to be calming, but is not yet over. The government is trying to settle pay deals it had previously left to Pay Review Bodies. Inflation may also now be falling sustainably. But the shadow of this year of industrial action may linger for some time.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated [against], they will not be seen as who they are.<br/>\"If it's a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it's social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you're not being discriminated [against] because of your gender or your colour or your postal code,\" she said. <br/>On Tuesday, Ireland's data protection authority said it had put Google's planned EU roll-out of its AI chatbot Bard on hold. <br/>It said it had been informed by Google that its ChatGPT competitor would be introduced in the EU this week, but was yet to receive details or information showing how the firm had identified and minimised data protection risks to prospective users.<br/>Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said the DPC was seeking the information \"as a matter of urgency\" and had raised further data protection enquiries about it with Google.<br/>Ms Vestager, who is the European Commission's executive vice president, said AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\".<br/>She insisted a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries should be prioritised before getting more jurisdictions, such as China, on board.<br/>\"Let's start working on a UN approach. But we shouldn't hold our breath,\" she said. <br/>\"We should do what we can here and now.\"<br/>Ms Vestager is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>The current draft of the AI Act seeks to categorise applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>High-risk AI systems include those that are used to evaluate credit scores or access to loans and housing. This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it. No-one can make sure that everyone is on board,\" she said, pointing out that a pause could be used by some as an opportunity to get ahead of competitors. <br/>\"What I think is important is that every developer knows that everyone has signed up for the same guardrails so that no-one takes excessive risks.\"<br/>The European Parliament's proposals for the AI Act seek to restrict the use of biometric identification systems and indiscriminate collection of user data from social media or CCTV footage for purposes such as facial recognition systems.<br/>However, Ms Vestager said: \"We want to put in strict guardrails so that it's not used in real-time, but only in specific circumstances where you're looking for a missing child or there's a terrorist fleeing.<br/>Before the AI Act can become finalised as the world's first rulebook on the use and development of AI systems, the EU's three branches of power: the Commission, Parliament and Council will all have to agree on its final version.<br/>It is not expected to come into effect before 2025. <br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It lets Spotify, YouTube and BBC iPlayer suggest what you might want to play next, and helps Facebook and Twitter decide which social media posts to show users.<br/>AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm is also using the technology to crack down on fake reviews. <br/>Two powerful AI-driven applications or apps which have become very high profile in recent months are ChatGPT and Snapchat My AI. <br/>They are examples of what is called \"generative\" AI. <br/>This uses the patterns and structures it identifies in vast quantities of source data to generate new and original content which feels like it has been created by a human. <br/>The AI is coupled with a computer programme known as a chatbot, which \"talks\" to human users via text. <br/>The apps can answer questions, tell stories and write computer code. <br/>But both programmes sometimes generate incorrect answers for users, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.<br/>With few rules currently in place governing how AI is used, experts have warned that its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted. <br/>In May, Geoffrey Hinton, widely considered to be one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, quit his job at Google, warning that AI chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.<br/>Later that month, the US-based Center for AI Safety published a statement supported by dozens of leading tech specialists. <br/>They argue AI could be used to generate misinformation that could destabilise society. In the worst-case scenario, they say machines might become so intelligent that they take over, leading to the extinction of humanity.<br/>However, the EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern. <br/>In particular she is concerned about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications, adding there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence elections.<br/>Others, including tech pioneer Martha Lane Fox, say we shouldn't get what she calls \"too hysterical\" about AI, urging a more sensible conversation about its capabilities.<br/>Governments around the world are wrestling with how to regulate AI. <br/>Members of the European Parliament have just voted in favour of the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which will put in place a strict legal framework for AI, which companies would need to follow. <br/>Margrethe Vestager says \"guardrails\" are needed to counter the biggest risks posed by AI. <br/>The legislation - which is expected to come into effect in 2025 - categorises applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>Higher-risk systems like those used to evaluate credit scores or decide access to housing would face the strictest controls. <br/>These rules will not apply in the UK, where the government set out its vision for the future of AI in March. <br/>It ruled out setting up a dedicated AI regulator, and said instead that existing bodies would be responsible for its oversight.<br/>But Ms Vestager says that AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\", and wants to build a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries. <br/>US lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the existing voluntary codes are up to the job.  <br/>Meanwhile, China intends to make companies notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>AI has the potential to revolutionise the world of work, but this raises questions about which roles it might displace. <br/>A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe, as certain tasks and job functions become automated. That equates to a quarter of all the work humans currently do in the US and Europe. <br/>The report highlighted a number of industries and roles that could be affected, including administrative jobs, legal work, architecture, and management.<br/>But it also identified huge potential benefits for many sectors, and predicted that AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP. <br/>Some areas of medicine and science are already taking advantage of AI, with doctors using the technology to help spot breast cancers, and scientists using it to develop new antibiotics. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.<br/>The European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\". <br/>This week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.  <br/>Former UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders. <br/>\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe. <br/>Amazon to pay $25m over child privacy violations<br/>New rules ban subscription traps and fake reviews<br/>Amazon to cut another 9,000 jobs<br/>Amazon to axe 18,000 jobs as it cuts costs<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>In December last year, the FTC had asked an in-house administrative judge to block the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.<br/>William Kovacic, former FTC chair and non-executive director at the UK's CMA, said the FTC had expressed concerns that Microsoft and Activision might close their deal despite UK opposition, and so asked a judge to halt it.<br/>\"The EU's decision to take a settlement was a bit of a surprise,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme<br/>Mr Kovacic said there was still a chance the takeover could be completed, but added \"the chance is diminished\".<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to play catch-up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases -

effectively a community of people who gather to discuss a particular interest. <br/>Reddit users - or Redditors - will typically join a variety of subreddits, rather than following individual users on other platforms, and see posts from these communities in their feed.<br/>As well as a few paid administrators, the website uses tens of thousands of unpaid moderators - known as mods - to keep the website functional.<br/>These mods may spend one or two hours per day ensuring that their subreddit does not get filled with off-topic comments, content that is banned, or even content which is illegal.<br/>But the flipside of this is that Reddit does not charge any hosting fees for people who want to set up their own community based on an interest they have.<br/>In a post to the website on Friday, Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman said it \"needs to be a self-sustaining business\" and addressed the blackout. <br/>\"We respect when you and your communities take action to highlight the things you need, including, at times, going private,\" he said.<br/>\"We are all responsible for ensuring Reddit provides an open accessible place for people to find community and belonging.\"<br/>He also confirmed that explicit content would remain on the site, but Reddit would limit how it can be accessed from third-party apps.<br/>The blackout includes 3,489 subreddits in total, including five of the 10 most popular communities on the site - r/gaming, r/aww, r/Music, r/todayilearned and r/pics - which each have memberships of more than 30 million people.<br/>A moderator for one of these subreddits told the BBC the protest was about \"strength in numbers\".<br/>\"If it was a single subreddit going private, Reddit may intervene,\" they said. <br/>\"But if it's half the entire website, then you feel a lot more pressured. <br/>\"This is a completely volunteer position, we don't receive any financial compensation, and despite that, we do like to take it quite seriously.\"<br/>They said they wanted Reddit admins to realise that they rely on moderators to operate the site and felt that the only way to send a message was by harming Reddit's traffic.<br/>\"Our entire community is supporting us against this change,\" they said.<br/>\"It feels good to be able to have the power to say: 'We will not continue to moderate our communities if you push these changes through'.<br/>\"If it's almost the entire website, would they destroy what they've built up in all these communities, just to push through this highly unpopular change that both the mods and users of Reddit are overwhelmingly against?\"<br/>Reddit, which describes itself as \"the front page of the internet\", has an official app but it was developed in 2016, many years after the website was founded.<br/>Because of this, third-party apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Sync and ReddPlanet were set up as a way for people to access the platform on their mobile devices. <br/>Reddit has introduced a series of charges to the developers who wish to continue using its Application Programming Interface (API) - the behind-the-scenes code which allows third-party apps to find and show the content on Reddit.<br/>All four of these apps have said they will be shutting down as a result of Reddit's new API pricing. <br/>These charges have been heavily criticised as extortionate - with Apollo developer Christian Selig claiming it would end up costing him $20m (\u00a315.9m) to continue operating the app.<br/>But a Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that Apollo was \"notably less efficient\" than other third-party apps.<br/>They said the social media platform spends \"multi-millions of dollars on hosting fees\" and \"needs to be fairly paid\" to continue supporting third-party apps. <br/>\"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs,\" they said.<br/>The spokesperson also said that not all third-party apps would require paid access. Previously, Reddit announced it would not charge apps which make the platform more accessible.<br/>But the moderator the BBC spoke to said they believed the blackout could continue until Reddit row back on the changes.<br/>\"The current plan for many communities is... they might keep the blackout going for longer, beyond the original forty-eight hours, or keep their subreddits restricted so that nobody can post,\" they said.<br/>\"Every community operates differently, and different moderators have different views on what's happening right now, so it does vary. <br/>\"But given recent communications between moderators and Reddit admins, I don't believe that they are intending to reverse these changes.\"<br/>And some communities, such as r/Music - which has 32 million members - say their subreddit will be indefinitely inaccessible until Reddit reverses its policy.<br/>Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave<br/>Inside the secret world of trading nudes<br/>Social media platform Reddit files to go public<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

the Triple-A RPG from Elder Scrolls studio Bethesda that got its very own one-hour showcase.<br/>Regarded as Microsoft's biggest release in quite some time, the planet-hopping RPG promises players a whole galaxy to explore.<br/>Bethesda showed off various mechanics, such as the game's different playstyles and ship crafting system.<br/>People were impressed by Starfield's sheer size - The Guardian said it was a \"supermassive black hole of a game\" - though some fans worried they wouldn't get time to play it.<br/>Director Todd Howard said the level of detail in the game meant it would be locked at 30 frames per second on both versions of the Xbox.<br/>And some will have mixed feelings about the news that the Elder Scrolls developer's resurrected one of its \"most annoying\" characters for its space odyssey.<br/>It would be unreasonable to expect any showcase to be filled with back-to-back big reveals, and quite a few expansions to existing games were announced.<br/>Fallout 76: Atlantic City, Overwatch 2: Invasion and Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom were all shown.<br/>A Monkey Island add-on for popular online pirate-em-up Sea of Thieves was also announced - perhaps the biggest \"didn't know we needed it\" announcement of the night.<br/>And Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty update was introduced in a recorded message from Keanu Reeves.<br/>It wasn't quite as breathtaking as his E3 appearance to promote the original game, but it was met with approval from many.<br/>One of the main complaints - if you can call it that - was that a lot of the games teased on Sunday won't be out until at least next year, as pointed out by Eurogamer.<br/>A couple, Fable included, didn't give a release date. <br/>And there were some grumbles about the Hellblade II trailer - which didn't show any gameplay.<br/>But, if there were a Metacritic page for Microsoft's 2023 showcase, it would probably say the show had \"generally favourable\" reviews.<br/>And even PlayStation fansite Push Square was among those admitting it was \"probably the strongest Xbox Showcase in recent memory\".<br/>Microsoft still has hurdles to clear in its Activision Blizzard buyout, and the PS5 remains the bigger-selling console.<br/>It's clearly got big plans for gaming, though, so it's worth keeping an eye on the big green machine.<br/>Microsoft's collected all of its showcase trailers on its website.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

We also swiftly alerted all affected Ofcom-regulated companies, and we continue to offer support and assistance to our colleagues.\" <br/>It said that none of its own systems were compromised during the attack. <br/>Transport for London (TfL), which operates the capital's public transport, told the BBC it too had been affected. <br/>It said one of its contractors had suffered a data breach.<br/>\"The issue has been fixed and the IT systems have been secured. The data in question did not include banking details and we are writing to all of those involved to make them aware of the incident\".<br/>The breach did not relate to passenger data. TfL said the ICO had been informed. <br/>Accountancy firm Ernst & Young (EY) also told the BBC it was a victim.<br/>As soon as it became aware of the problem with MOVEit the firm \"immediately launched an investigation into our use of the tool and took urgent steps to safeguard any data\".<br/>It said the vast majority of its systems which used the software were unaffected but added: \"We are manually and thoroughly investigating systems where data may have been accessed. <br/>\"Our priority is to first communicate to those impacted, as well as the relevant authorities. Our investigation is ongoing.\"<br/>The hack is known as a \"supply-chain attack\". <br/>It was first disclosed when US company Progress Software said hackers had found a way to break into its MOVEit Transfer tool. <br/>A security flaw was exploited by hackers to gain access to a number of companies.<br/>Some organisations that do not even use MOVEit are affected because of third-party arrangements.<br/>The BBC, for example, has had data from current and past employees stolen because Zellis, a company that the broadcaster uses to process the payroll, used MOVEit and fell victim.<br/>It is understood eight companies that use Zellis are affected, including the airlines British Airways and Aer Lingus, as well the retailer Boots. Dozens of other UK companies are thought to be using MOVEit. <br/>The criminals responsible for the hack are linked to the notorious Clop ransomware group, thought to be based in Russia. <br/>They have threatened to begin publishing data of companies that do not email them to begin the negotiations by Wednesday. <br/>BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy said the group is well-known for carrying out its threats and it is likely that organisations will have private data published on the gang's darknet website in the coming weeks.  <br/>He said it is usually the case that if a victim does not appear on Clop's website, they may have secretly paid the group a ransom which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.<br/>Victims are always encouraged not to pay though as it fuels the growth of this criminal enterprise and there is no guarantee that the hackers will not use the data for secondary attacks. <br/>What action can those caught up in mass hacks take?<br/>BBC, BA and Boots among victims of mass payroll hack<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But at the same time, it's reassuring that it's being caught.\"<br/>A major review of Scotland's breast screening programme published last year suggested a large number of radiology and advance practitioner staff are either nearing or at retirement age.<br/>It said the decline of \"super reader\" radiologists, relied on by the service to review a particularly high number of results, risks leaving the service \"vulnerable\".<br/>The Royal College of Radiologists has also warned the UK is facing \"chronic staff shortages\", with patients waiting too long for vital tests and cancer treatments.<br/>With two radiologists needed to read and report results, the Scottish government's review said replacing one human reader with AI could \"cover half of the screening image reading burden of approximately 1.72 million images read each year\". <br/>But could the technology being tested in Aberdeen some day replace human staff?<br/>\"I think the goal of this evaluation is to see what's the best way we can work with AI, whether it's replacing one of the radiologists, whether it's part reading some of the normal mammograms, or whether it's to improve our cancer detection as a safety net,\" Dr Lip said.<br/>Peter Kecskemethy, co-founder of Kheiron, said the tech will used by more than 30 NHS trusts across the UK for millions to access.<br/>And with trusts in England already exploring how AI can support better, faster outcomes for breast cancer patients, the tech looks to continue playing a large role in helping doctors save lives.<br/>You can see the full report and more ways AI is changing industries on this week's episode of Click.<br/>NHS struggling to provide safe cancer care, say doctors<br/>Health lab examines how innovation can help NHS<br/>Brain implants help paralysed man to walk again<br/>Hopes AI tool could improve breast cancer treatment<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This might eventually help patients with locked-in syndrome, who are conscious but cannot move or speak.<br/>But the report focuses on technologies that might emerge in the future, which it uses as hypothetical examples to explore the issues raised by neurodata.<br/>In four to five years, the ICO suggests, \"as employee tracking expands, the workplace may routinely deploy neurotechnology for safety, productivity and recruitment\".<br/>Helmets or safety equipment might measure the attention and focus of an employee in high risk environments.<br/>And bosses might use it to assess how individuals reacted to workplace stress, Mr Almond said.<br/>In the longer term in education wearable brain monitoring devices might be used to measure students' concentration levels and stress levels. <br/>\"Neuromarketing\" is already in limited use in small, controlled research settings - with consumers' responses to products assessed using medical devices that measure brain activity - although, there is significant debate about its merits<br/>In the future, \"non-invasive devices capable of reading responses may be used at home to tailor consumer preferences\", the ICO says.<br/>In one admittedly far-fetched example the report imagines in the future neurotechnology-enabled headphones might gather data used to target advertising.<br/>It also sees growth in gaming and entertainment - some games and drones are already controlled by devices that take readings of the brain.<br/>But the ICO is worried the technology could cause discrimination, unless developed carefully.<br/>The technology itself could be biased, giving incorrect answers when analysing certain groups, Mr Almond said.<br/>But there was also the risk bosses could use it to discriminate against \"certain types of more neurodivergent characteristics\".<br/>It might reveal conditions of which the subject themselves was unaware.<br/>And it raised tricky questions around consent. Neurodata is subconsciously generated, the report says, and people have no direct control over the specific information which is disclosed.<br/>\"If you don't know what the technology is going to reveal about you, can you really consent in advance to the processing of that personal data about you?\" Mr Almond said. \"Because once it's released into the open, you then have relatively lower control over it.\"<br/>The ICO hopes to complete new neurodata guidance by 2025.<br/>Musk brain chip firm's human study approved<br/>Brain implants help paralysed man to walk again<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Every country in the world - especially our adversaries - cannot afford for us to have this advantage,\" he said.<br/>\"Studying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield is a really bad strategy.\"<br/>Mr Karp's comments strike a very different tone to the recent glut of dire warnings about the potentially existential threat AI poses to humanity - and accompanying calls for its development to be slowed or even halted.<br/>Regulators worldwide are scrambling to devise new rules to contain its risk. <br/>The government says the UK will host a global AI summit this autumn, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying he wanted the UK to lead efforts to ensure the benefits of AI were \"harnessed for the good of humanity\".<br/>It is not yet known who will attend the summit but the government said it would \"bring together key countries, leading tech companies and researchers to agree safety measures to evaluate and monitor the most significant risks from AI\".<br/>Mr Sunak, currently meeting US President Joe Biden in Washington DC, said the UK was the \"natural place\" to lead the conversation on AI.<br/>Downing Street cited the prime minister's recent meetings with the bosses of leading AI firms as evidence of this. It also pointed to the 50,000 people employed in the sector, which it said was worth \u00a33.7bn to the UK.<br/>However, some have questioned the UK's leadership credentials in the field.<br/>Yasmin Afina, research fellow at Chatham House's Digital Society Initiative, said she did not think that the UK \"could realistically be too ambitious\".<br/>She said there were \"stark differences in governance and regulatory approaches\" between the EU and US which the UK would struggle to reconcile, and a number of existing global initiatives, including the UN's Global Digital Compact, which had \"stronger foundational bases already\".<br/>Ms Afina added that none of the world's most pioneering AI firms was based in the UK.<br/>\"Instead of trying to play a role that would be too ambitious for the UK and risks alienating it, the UK should perhaps focus on promoting responsible behaviour in the research, development and deployment of these technologies,\" she told the BBC.<br/>Interest in AI has mushroomed since chatbot ChatGPT burst on to the scene last November, amazing people with its ability to answer complex questions in a human-sounding way.<br/>It can do that because of the incredible computational power AI systems possess, which has caused deep unease. <br/>Two of the three so-called godfathers of AI -  Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to sound warnings about how the technology they have helped create has a huge potential for causing harm.<br/>In May, AI industry leaders - including the heads of OpenAI and Google Deepmind - warned AI could lead to the extinction of humanity.<br/>They gave examples, including AI potentially being used to develop a new generation of chemical weapons.<br/>Those warnings have accelerated demands for effective regulation of AI, although many questions remain over what that would look like and how it would be enforced.<br/>The European Union is formulating an Artificial Intelligence Act, but has acknowledged that even in a best-case scenario it will take two-and-a-half years to come into effect.<br/>EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said last month that would be \"way too late\" and said it was working on a voluntary code for the sector with the US, which they hoped could be drawn up within weeks.<br/>China has also taken a leading role in drawing up AI regulations, including proposals that companies must notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>The UK government set out its thoughts in March in a White Paper, which was criticised for having \"significant gaps.\"<br/>Marc Warner, a member of the government's AI Council, has pointed to a tougher approach, however, telling the BBC some of the most advanced forms of AI may eventually have to be banned.<br/>Matt O'Shaughnessy, visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there was little the UK could do about the fact that others were leading the charge on AI regulation - but said it could still have an important role.<br/>\"The EU and China are both large markets that have proposed consequential regulatory schemes for AI - without either of those factors, the UK will struggle to be as influential,\" he said.<br/>But he added the UK was an \"academic and commercial hub\", with institutions that were \"well-known for their work on responsible AI\".<br/>\"Those all make it a serious player in the global discussion about AI,\" he told the BBC.<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

After that, there were smaller demonstrations by civil rights activists. Much of this visible dissent has disappeared since Beijing cracked down with a draconian national security law after the anti-government 2019 protests.<br/>When contacted by the BBC, a ByteDance spokesperson strongly denied the allegations: \"We plan to vigorously oppose what we believe are baseless claims and allegations in this complaint.\"<br/>They also said that Mr Yu was employed by the company for less than a year and in that time worked worked on a now-discontinued app called Flipagram.<br/>\"It's curious that Mr Yu has never raised these allegations in the five years since his employment for Flipagram was terminated in July 2018. His actions are clearly intended to garner media attention,\" the ByteDance spokesperson added.<br/>Mr Yu's claims come as TikTok is under intense scrutiny around the world.<br/>In March, TikTok's chief executive Shou Zi Chew faced four-and-a-half hours of questioning at a US congressional hearing.<br/>Mr Chew was quizzed by both Democrats and Republicans over the app's data security and privacy practices, and its alleged ties to Beijing.<br/>A spokesperson for TikTok said afterwards that the politicians were \"grandstanding\".<br/>In May, Montana became the first US state to pass a sweeping ban on the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform.<br/>The ban is due to take effect in January 2024. It will make it illegal for app stores to offer TikTok, but does not ban people who already have TikTok from using it.<br/>TikTok has sued to block Montana from imposing the ban, saying it conflicts with US free speech rights. Montana, which has a population of just over one million, banned the app on government devices last December.<br/>TikTok says it has 150 million American users.

Once the headset is on, you see the room around you but you're not seeing it through glass, you're seeing it through the many on-board cameras. This is important for the \"mixed-reality\" experience - digital content projected onto your surroundings.<br/>You physically press a single button on the top right-hand side of glasses, and up pops some familiar app icons you'll recognise if you have used an iPhone - iMessage, photos, Apple TV (there will be more as developers make them). <br/>And from then on it's all about gesture control - the headset tracks where you are looking so when you look at an app and pinch your thumb and forefinger together, it opens.<br/>Apple swept me through a number of demos. A gallery of photos, stretching from floor to ceiling, were impressive to see - although these were clearly very carefully curated, and very beautifully shot. <br/>You can shoot 3D video using the cameras on the headset - I watched a child blow out birthday candles on a cake so close to me that I felt I could almost feel her breath.<br/>I had a live video call with another Apple employee, also wearing a headset - well, a photorealistic avatar of him rather than an actual video. I don't know what he really looked like because I never met him in real life but there was something a bit weird about the smoothness of his skin, and the detail of his eyes, even when he smiled and frowned.<br/>I watched movie clips on a giant virtual screen with the room digitally darkened around me like a cinema theatre. A gigantic 3D T. rex dinosaur sniffed my face. I watched digital flower petals dance around the room during a mindfulness meditation.<br/>You can choose your level of immersion using a physical dial to turn up or down the size of whatever it is that you're looking at. It can fill the entire room or appear like a TV screen superimposed against your wall. <br/>If someone walks in front of you in real life, you can see them no matter how immersed you are.<br/>I had a laborious go at trying to respond to a text message on the digital keyboard that popped up in front of me. \"Remember this is not a finished product!\" was the enthused response every time I said something that was less than glowing.<br/>Unfortunately, I can't show you any of this because everyone there was banned from recording anything. Noticeably, nobody from Apple actually wore a Vision Pro either - not even the boss, Tim Cook, or Disney CEO, Bob Iger, who described the device as \"real-life magic\".<br/>I've tried a lot of virtual-reality (VR) and mixed-reality headsets in my time as a tech journalist and this was one of the better ones. And with a launch price tag of $3,499 (\u00a32,899) you'd hope so. <br/>It will probably still be the most-expensive headset on the market when it goes on sale next year. Bloomberg has reported that Apple hopes to shift 900,000 in the first year of sales.<br/>I think Apple is playing a very clever game here with its marketing - although I'm not sure whether it will work. Traditionally, mixed-reality headsets have been targeted at gamers and promised big, extravagant moments. Kill monsters the size of your house! Be a rock star on stage at Wembley Stadium! <br/>Apple barely mentioned gaming at all. The message here was much more: do everything you do on your phone, only bigger and brighter and against the backdrop of your own home.<br/>There was much speculation that the Apple Vision Pro announcement would be an \"iPhone moment\" - that is, a huge, game-changing product from Apple in the way the iPhone changed the smartphone landscape forever.<br/>But what if the Apple Vision Pro actually is the new iPhone?<br/>By making it a useful bit of every day kit rather than an occasional thrill, Apple is very much aiming this at the mainstream. <br/>I'm not sure whether it will work. Apple has a unique magic and a very loyal customer base. People who like the brand really, really like the brand. But hardware has long been a barrier in VR. <br/>Wearing a headset for long periods of time just does not feel great. Plenty of people experience nausea (I do too, although I didn't on Monday - my demo was only 15 minutes long though, with a couple of minutes on each section). <br/>I can tell you with certainty that while it was a remarkable experience, I'm not sure I want to be sniffed by a virtual dinosaur again any time soon.<br/>Now clearly $3,499 is not a novelty product price. I remember wincing last year when Facebook-owner Meta announced its Quest Pro headset would cost about $1,500, less than half the price (it has since fallen to $999).<br/>You are of course paying for the years of research and development that goes into building the first generation of any product. But what if you use it every day? <br/>A friend of mine who works in the fashion industry says you should spend the most money on the clothes you wear most often. <br/>So if you spend \u00a3100 on a dress and wear it once, that single wear was \u00a3100. But if you wear it 100 times - it's only cost you \u00a31 each time.  <br/>Perhaps Apple is gambling that if it can make the headset useful enough, people are more likely to think about it that way. It needs a lot of content, and a lot of developers to make that work.<br/>But if you like Apple, and you like mixed reality, and you have the cash - you'll probably like this headset. <br/>If in five years time it's replaced your smartphone - well, perhaps our avatars can virtually FaceTime each other and have a chat about it. <br/>Follow Zoe on Twitter.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Student helps virtual reality users experience phantom touch<br/>Apple unveils $3,499 mixed reality headset<br/>VR headset prices high as Apple bides its time<br/>Apple boss to have pay cut by over 40% this year<br/>Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra<br/>Apple sales falter again but iPhone demand persists<br/>PS VR2: Gaming\u2019s virtual reality breakthrough?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

There's also a utopian point of view. Both can be possible\", Mr Scully told the TechUK Tech Policy Leadership Conference in Westminster.<br/>A dystopia is an imaginary place in which everything is as bad as possible.<br/>\"If you're only talking about the end of humanity because of some, rogue, Terminator-style scenario, you're going to miss out on all of the good that AI is already functioning - how it's mapping proteins to help us with medical research, how it's helping us with climate change.<br/>\"All of those things it's already doing and will only get better at doing.\" <br/>The government recently put out a policy document on regulating AI which was criticised for not establishing a dedicated watchdog, and some think additional measures may eventually needed to deal with the most powerful future systems .<br/>Marc Warner, a member of the AI Council, an expert body set up to advise the government, told BBC News last week a ban on the most powerful AI may be necessary.<br/>However, he argued that \"narrow AI\" designed for particular tasks, such as systems that look for cancer in medical images, should be regulated on the same basis as existing tech.<br/>Responding to reports on the possible dangers posed by AI, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We are not complacent about the potential risks of AI, but it also provides significant opportunities. <br/>\"We can not proceed with AI without the guard rails in place.\"<br/>Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell told the BBC that while there was a \"level of hysteria going on and that's certainly dominating the public debate at the moment, there are real opportunities with the development of a technology like AI\".<br/>However, she added: \"But we do have to think really carefully about the risks, make sure we've got good regulation in place.\"<br/>It was also important that everyone benefited from the impact of AI and it \"doesn't just go to the big tech giants in the US as happened in the last technological revolution\".  <br/>Ms Powell earlier told the Guardian she felt AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which had dedicated regulators.<br/>AI company OpenAI recently blogged that a global regulator like the International Atomic Energy Authority might be needed for super-intelligent AI.<br/>At the same event, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the most powerful AIs may need safety licences to operate.<br/>\"Before a model can be deployed it will have to pass some some kind of safety review.\" <br/>Mr Smith argued it would be better if there was international co-operation and a single model of regulation. He said that when it came to cyber and national security, the UK and US were well placed to work together.<br/>He told reporters at the event that Microsoft would not join \"the fear parade\", adding it would be better to reduce some of the rhetoric and focus more on current problems.<br/>A number of other experts have also said focusing on sci-fi-like disaster scenarios is a distraction from current issues with AI, such as the risk of racial or gender biases in algorithms.<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

it is too time consuming and they care about one thing only, getting paid.<br/>And they will probably send ransom demands to the organisations breached, asking for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.<br/>\"The important message to organisations right now is not to panic, to install the security patch and not to pay the criminals,\" former National Cyber Security Centre lead Prof Ciaran Martin says.<br/>But once an organisation has been breached, the hackers have the upper hand.<br/>And the criminals thought to be responsible for the MoveIt hack are notoriously ruthless with their extortion techniques.<br/>The hackers often take time to consider their extortion tactics.<br/>\"Some prior incidents involving these criminals have seen victims not contacted until weeks after data was stolen - so if you don't hear from them in the coming days, you are not in clear,\" Mandiant Intelligence senior manager Kimberly Goody says.<br/>The group, thought to be based in Russia, will then contact a company email address, demanding payment not to publish the stolen data online, Mandiant research suggests.<br/>These demands are usually in the seven- or eight-figure range, Mandiant experts say, but there have been ones over $35m (\u00a328m).<br/>And law enforcement agencies around the world advise organisations not to pay, as it fuels the growth of these criminal gangs.<br/>For individuals, the advice is also not to panic but to be suspicious.<br/>If your organisation refuses to pay the criminals, there is a good chance they will publish the data on the dark web or try to sell it to other hackers.<br/>But there are many steps between that and you losing money.<br/>\"There really is an important message not to panic, as it's very unlikely that organisations have been storing data like full bank details which can lead directly to sort of financial harm,\" Prof Martin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. <br/>And although some organisations, such as British Airways, say some staff bank details have been stolen, this was highly unlikely to lead to individuals' bank accounts being drained.<br/>The risk, experts say, is from secondary attacks, where hackers use the details they have to trick victims into revealing more details.<br/>So the advice is to look out for suspicious emails and phone calls - particularly ones about the hack. <br/>In a typical scam, individual victims might receive a message claiming to be from their organisation, asking them to log in and verify their account because \"fraudulent activity has taken place\". <br/>Things to look out for, experts say, include:<br/>The MoveIt breach is likely to become more serious as other companies discover they have been hacked - but, experts say, data stolen in previous hacks has been published in an obscure corner of the dark web, with little consequence to individuals.<br/>BBC, BA and Boots among victims of mass payroll hack<br/>Capita hack: 90 organisations report data breaches<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Last week Meta announced its Quest 3 - which costs $499.<br/>Apple said little about generative artificial intelligence - the buzzy technology that is the talk of Silicon Valley.<br/>The company's share price fell slightly during the announcement, made at a developer's conference at Apple Park, the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California.<br/>The BBC was among the media outlets at the event, and technology editor Zoe Kleinman was one of the first people in the world to try out the headset.<br/>\"Since current boss Tim Cook took over in 2011, with the possible exception of the Watch, Apple has been unable to come up with the kind of world-changing product of the past,\" she said.<br/>\"Have they done it here?\" <br/>Apple Vision Pro looks different to similar headsets on the market - and is more reminiscent of a pair of ski goggles than a virtual reality headset.<br/>Apple used the phrase \"augmented reality\" to describe what the new device does. <br/>Augmented reality, also known as mixed reality, superimposes virtual objects in the world around us - enabling us to mix reality with virtual reality by looking through a screen.<br/>\"It's like your phone but right in front of you - big, bright and bold, wherever you are,\" Ms Kleinman said.<br/>In letting you do things like watch videos of your family blowing out birthday candles or immerse yourself in your photography by making your panoramic photos life-size, she says it is pitched as a device which is \"very much about being part of your daily life\", unlike many other headsets on the market geared primarily towards immersive gaming.<br/>Users can access apps, watch movies, and write documents in a virtual world. But so far, there is little evidence of a big market for this kind of wearable tech.<br/>\"It's still at the end of the day a VR headset,\" said Ms Kleinman. \"Apple is going to have to have an awful lot of content to throw at this when it ships early next year.<br/>\"And of course the other thing is the price point - $3,499 is a lot of money.\"<br/>Hartley Charlton, senior editor of MacRumors, was unsure how much the headset would appeal to the general public.<br/>\"It won't appeal to mainstream consumers at first on account of its extremely high price point and immediate shortcomings as a first-generation device, such as its separate wired battery pack,\" he said.<br/>But he said Apple has a track record of \"overcoming scepticism\" about new devices, and has historically encouraged people to \"part with their cash to add a new gadget to their repertoire\". <br/>In his sales pitch, Mr Cook said the headset allows users to \"see, hear and interact with digital content just like it's in your physical space\".<br/>It is controlled by using a combination of your hands, eyes and voice - such as tapping your fingers together to select, and flicking them to scroll.<br/>The announcement comes a week after Meta and Lenovo announced new iterations of their pre-existing virtual reality headsets, that do not superimpose objects on to a view of the real world.<br/>Meta has also invested heavily in mixed reality - but right now the sector is struggling. <br/>The headset market saw a 54% drop in global sales last year, according to the International Data Corporation.<br/>Apple's last major hardware release was for the Apple Watch device in 2015.<br/>Thomas Husson, of Forrester Research, told BBC News it may take time for Apple's new headset to take off.<br/>\"The overall AR/VR space has been a bit overhyped over the past few years with the metaverse and that kind of experience,\" he said. \"That's the reason why I think it will take a bit more time. <br/>\"Having said that, if I told you 10 to 15 years ago that people would be ready to pay almost $2,000 for a mobile phone, I don't think many people would have said they would be willing to pay that.\"<br/>Aside from the Vision Pro announcement, Apple also unveiled iOS17, the latest version of its iPhone operating system.<br/>Updates include \"contact posters\" - a picture or image of yourself that will appear on a person's phone when you call them - and \"live voicemail\" - which provides a real-time transcription of an answerphone message being left to you.<br/>This transcription will also apply to audio messages left using Apple Messages.<br/>And Apple has introduced a system called Check-In - which will automatically tell a friend or family member when you have arrived home. <br/>If your journey is substantially delayed, it has the power to tell others that you have not made it home safely yet.<br/>The new operating system will be available this autumn.<br/>Additional reporting by Shiona McCallum, Liv McMahon and Tom Gerken <br/>Apple boss to have pay cut by over 40% this year<br/>Apple reveals iPhone 14 Pro and Watch Ultra<br/>Apple sales falter again but iPhone demand persists<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is now worth less than $12bn.<br/>Shares in the firm sank on news of the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in New York. <br/>They ended the day down 12%, while Nansen, which tracks crypto flows, reported that customers had pulled nearly $1.3bn on net from the platform following the lawsuit. <br/>In March, Coinbase had warned that the SEC might take legal action against the firm. At the time, it called the development disappointing and said it had repeatedly tried to work with authorities to register, but that there was no clear path for crypto firms to do so. It has also threatened to relocate out of the US to London or elsewhere.<br/>On Tuesday, Mr Grewal said: \"The SEC's reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America's economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance.\"   <br/>The chief executive of the Blockchain Association, an industry group, pointed to continuing discussions in Congress as evidence that laws governing the industry remain in flux and that the SEC did not have a case.<br/>The same day that the SEC filed its suit against Coinbase, Mr Grewal was due to testify in Washington at a hearing about crafting laws to oversee certain types of digital assets.  <br/>In prepared remarks for that hearing, Mr Grewal said Coinbase carefully reviewed assets offered on its platform to see if they could be considered securities regulated by the SEC. He said it did not list securities and rejected the \"vast majority\" of proposals. <br/>\"The SEC doesn't make the law - it only makes accusations - and we're confident the courts will prove [SEC chairman Gary] Gensler wrong in due time,\" said Blockchain Association chief executive Kristin Smith. <br/>Crypto giant accused of 'web of deception' by US<br/>Crypto trader Coinbase worth more than oil firm BP<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Information such as full name, email address and date of birth are collected as part of the set up. <br/>Not until after obtaining personal information, such as the child's phone number, did Microsoft ask for a parent to provide permission. <br/>From 2015 to 2020 Microsoft retained data \"sometimes for years\" from the account set up, even when a parent failed to complete the process, the FTC said in a statement. <br/>The company also failed to inform parents about all the data it was collecting, including the user's profile picture and that data was being distributed to third parties.<br/>\"Regrettably, we did not meet customer expectations and are committed to complying with the order to continue improving upon our safety measures,\" Microsoft's Dave McCarthy, CVP of Xbox Player Services, wrote in an Xbox blog post. <br/>\"We believe that we can and should do more, and we'll remain steadfast in our commitment to safety, privacy, and security for our community.\"<br/>As part of the settlement, Microsoft must also institute new safety protections for children. That includes maintaining a system to delete all personal data after two weeks if no parental consent is obtained.<br/>The order must be approved by a federal judge before it can go into effect.<br/>Last week, Amazon agreed to pay $25m after the FTC found that it had retained sensitive data, including voice recordings of children, for years. <br/>Amazon's doorbell camera unit Ring also agreed to pay out $5.8m after giving employees unrestricted access to customers' data.<br/>Amazon to pay $25m over child privacy violations<br/>Amazon sued over Alexa child recordings<br/>Alexa flaw could have revealed voice records<br/>Apps eavesdrop on smart-speaker owners<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The company said the hackers responsible have used similar techniques in the past to steal data and extort victims.<br/>\"This latest round of attacks is another reminder of the importance of supply chain security,\" said John Shier, from cyber security company Sophos.<br/>\"While Cl0p has been linked to this active exploitation it is probable that other threat groups are prepared to use this vulnerability as well,\" he added.<br/>The National Crime Agency told the BBC that it was aware that a number of UK-based organisations had been \"impacted by a cyber incident\", as a result of a previously unknown security flaw relating to MOVEit Transfer.<br/>The NCA added it was \"working with partners to support those organisations and understand the full impact on the UK\".<br/>Capita hack: 90 organisations report data breaches<br/>Watchdog warns pension funds over data after hack<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And Faculty AI was among technology companies whose representatives discussed the risks, opportunities and rules needed to ensure safe and responsible AI with Technology Minister Chloe Smith, at Downing Street, on Thursday.<br/>AI describes the ability of computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.<br/>\"Narrow AI\" - systems used for specific tasks such as translating text or searching for cancers in medical images - could be regulated like existing technology, Mr Warner said.<br/>But AGI systems, a fundamentally novel technology, were much more worrying and would need different rules.<br/>\"These are algorithms that are aimed at being as smart or smarter than a human across a very broad domain of tasks - essentially, every task,\" Mr Warner added.<br/>Humanity was in its position of primacy on this planet primarily because of its intelligence, he said. <br/>\"If we create objects that are as smart or smarter than us, there is nobody in the world that can give a good scientific justification of why that should be safe,\" Mr Warner said.<br/>\"That doesn't mean for certain that it's terrible - but it does mean that there is risk, it does mean that we should approach it with caution.<br/>\"At the very least, there needs to be sort of strong limits on the amount of compute [processing power] that can be arbitrarily thrown at these things. <br/>\"There is a strong argument that at some point, we may decide that enough is enough and we're just going to ban algorithms above a certain complexity or a certain amount of compute. <br/>\"But obviously, that is a decision that needs to be taken by governments and not by technology companies\".<br/>Some say concerns around AGI are distracting from problems with existing technologies - bias in AI recruitment or facial-recognition tools, for example.<br/>But Mr Warner said this was like saying: \"'Do you want cars or aeroplanes to be safe?' I want both.\"<br/>Others say too much regulation might make the UK less attractive to investors and stifle innovation. <br/>But Mr Warner said the UK could find a competitive advantage in encouraging safety.<br/>\"My long-term bet is that actually, to get value out of the technology, you need the safety - in the same way to get value out of the aeroplane, you need the engines to work,\" he said.<br/>The UK's recent White Paper on regulating AI was criticised for failing to set up a dedicated watchdog.<br/>But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has outlined the need for \"guardrails\" and said the UK could play \"a leadership role\".<br/>On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European Union Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said voluntary rules were needed quickly. <br/>The EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which will be among the first to regulate AI, is still going though legislative processes.<br/>And Ms Vestager said it would take two to three years for different pieces of legislation to come into effect - \"and we're talking about a technological acceleration that is beyond belief\". <br/>But industry and others would be invited to contribute to a draft voluntary code of conduct within weeks.<br/>After a meeting of the fourth US-EU Trader and Technology Council, Mr Blinken said it was important to establish voluntary codes of conduct \"open to\" a \"wide universe of countries... all likeminded countries\".<br/>AI could lead to extinction, experts warn<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

When it comes to moderating violent images from wars, however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights violations.<br/>Ihor Zakharenko, a former travel journalist, encountered this in Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion he has been documenting attacks on civilians.<br/>The BBC met him in a suburb of Kyiv where one year ago men, women and children had been shot dead by Russian troops while trying to flee occupation.<br/>He filmed the bodies - at least 17 of them - and burnt-out cars. <br/>He wanted to post the videos online so the world would see what happened and to counter the Kremlin's narrative. But when he uploaded them to Facebook and Instagram they were swiftly taken down.  <br/>\"Russians themselves were saying those were fakes, [that] they didn't touch civilians, they fought only with the Ukrainian army,\" Ihor said.<br/>We uploaded Ihor's footage on to Instagram and YouTube using dummy accounts. <br/>Instagram took down three of the four videos within a minute.<br/>At first, YouTube applied age restrictions to the same three, but 10 minutes later removed them all. <br/>We tried again - but they failed to upload altogether. An appeal to restore the videos on the basis that they included evidence of war crimes was rejected.<br/>Key figures within the industry say there is an urgent need for social media companies to prevent this kind of information from vanishing.<br/>\"You can see why they have developed and train their machines to, the moment they see something that looks difficult or traumatic, to take it down,\" Mr Rusbridger told the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent \"supreme court\" for the company, which owns Facebook and Instagram.<br/>\"I think the next question for them is how do we develop the machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more reasonable decisions,\" Mr Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.<br/>No-one would deny tech firms' right to police content, says US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaak: \"I think where the concern happens is when that information suddenly disappears.\"<br/>War Crimes: Do Not Delete<br/>Atrocities from war are being documented on social media. This material can be used as evidence to help prosecute war crimes. But the BBC has spoken to people affected by violent conflict who have seen the major social media companies take down this content. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)<br/>YouTube and Meta say that under their exemptions for graphic war footage in the public interest, content that would normally be removed can be kept online with viewing restricted to adults. But our experiment with Ihor's videos suggest otherwise.<br/>Meta says it responds \"to valid legal requests from law enforcement agencies around the world\" and \"we continue to explore additional avenues to support international accountability processes\u2026 consistent with our legal and privacy obligations\".<br/>YouTube says that while it has exemptions for graphic content in the public interest, the platform is not an archive. It says, \"Human rights organisations; activists, human rights defenders, researchers, citizen journalists and others documenting human rights abuses (or other potential crimes) should observe best practices for securing and preserving their content.\"<br/>The BBC also spoke to Imad, who owned a pharmacy in Aleppo, Syria, until a Syrian government barrel bomb landed nearby in 2013.<br/>He recalls how the blast filled the room with dust and smoke. Hearing cries for help, he went to the market outside and saw hands, legs and dead bodies covered in blood.<br/>Local TV crews captured these scenes. The footage was posted on YouTube and Facebook but has subsequently been taken down. <br/>In the mayhem of the conflict, Syrian journalists told the BBC their own recordings of the original footage were also destroyed in bombing raids. <br/>Years later, when Imad was applying for asylum in the EU, he was asked to provide documents that proved he was at the scene. <br/>\"I was sure that my pharmacy was captured on camera. But when I went online, it was taking me to a deleted video.\" <br/>In response to this sort of incident, organisations like Mnemonic, a Berlin-based human rights organisation, have stepped in to archive footage before it disappears. <br/>Mnemonic developed a tool to automatically download and save evidence of human rights violations - first in Syria and now in Yemen, Sudan and Ukraine.<br/>They have saved more than 700,000 images from war zones before they were removed from social media, including three videos showing the attack near Imad's pharmacy.<br/>Each image might hold a key clue to uncover what really transpired on the battlefield - the location, the date or the perpetrator.<br/>But organisations like Mnemonic cannot cover every area of conflict around the world. <br/>Proving that war crimes have been committed is incredibly hard - so getting as many sources as possible is vital.<br/>\"Verification is like solving a puzzle - you put together seemingly unrelated pieces of information to build a bigger picture of what happened,\" says BBC Verify's Olga Robinson.<br/>The task of archiving open-source material - available to pretty much anyone on social media - often falls to people with a mission to help their relatives caught up in violent conflict. <br/>Rahwa lives in the United States and has family in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, which has been wracked with violence in recent years, and where the authorities in Ethiopia tightly control the flow of information.<br/>However, social media means there is a visual record of a conflict that might otherwise remain hidden from the outside world.<br/>\"It was our duty,\" says Rahwa. \"I spent hours doing research, and so when you're seeing this content trickle in you're trying to verify using all the open-source intelligence tools you can get your hands on, but you don't know if your family is OK.\"<br/>Human rights campaigners say there is an urgent need for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted content.  This would include preserving metadata to help verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.<br/>Ms Van Schaak, the US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice, says: \"We need to create a mechanism whereby that information can be preserved for potential future accountability exercises.

It has launched a working group to specifically look at how artists are compensated.<br/>Dame Caroline Dinenage, who chairs the Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee investigating the industry, said it was a \"welcome step towards addressing the frustrations of musicians and songwriters whose pay falls far short of a fair level\".<br/>But it should result in concrete change and not be just a \"talking shop\", she added.<br/>In 2020, the government heard from musicians such as guitarist, producer and songwriter Nile Rodgers, who said record labels retain up to 82% of the royalties they receive from streaming services.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Nile Rodgers says that streaming numbers are meaningless when it comes to getting paid<br/>Sophie Jones, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry, said she was concerned it might discourage investment at a time when there was the prospect of increased competition from artificial intelligence.<br/>\"Numerous studies have demonstrated that streaming has benefited consumers and artists alike, with record labels paying more to artists than ever before,\" she told the Press Association.<br/>Will Page, former chief economist at Spotify, said the music business is currently debating the way money is being allocated: \"For artists, if you get 1% of all the streams in Britain... you get 1% of all the cash generated in Britain.\"<br/>This is because artists are not paid a set amount every time a song is played on Spotify. <br/>According to its website: \"Royalty payments that artists receive might vary according to differences in how their music is streamed or the agreements they have with labels or distributors.\"<br/>Mr Page pointed to an alternative model, a user-centric payment system, which some argue may be fairer. He said this would involve \"ring-fencing\" a person's subscription fee to the music they listen to, making it \"my money, my music\".<br/>This would result in a person's subscription fee being divided among the artists to whom they listen.<br/>But he also raised concerns about whether this working group would make a difference: \"We've had a three-year-long DCMS Select Committee inquiry, which had countless verbal hearings, written submissions, PDF reports - and we're doing it again.\"<br/>'Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers'<br/>Spotify cuts jobs in latest round of tech layoffs<br/>Drake and The Weeknd AI song pulled from Spotify<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And on Wednesday, the bloc's technology chief, Margrethe Vestager, said a voluntary code of conduct for AI could be created \"within the next weeks\".<br/>Some fear that advanced computational ability could be used for harmful purposes, such as the development of deadly new chemical weapons.<br/>Prof Bengio told the BBC he was concerned about \"bad actors\" getting hold of AI, especially as it became more sophisticated and powerful.<br/>\"It might be military, it might be terrorists, it might be somebody very angry, psychotic. And so if it's easy to program these AI systems to ask them to do something very bad, this could be very dangerous.<br/>\"If they're smarter than us, then it's hard for us to stop these systems or to prevent damage,\" he added.<br/>Prof Bengio admitted those concerns were taking a personal toll on him, as his life's work, which had given him direction and a sense of identity, was no longer clear to him.<br/>\"It is challenging, emotionally speaking, for people who are inside [the AI sector],\" he said.<br/>\"You could say I feel lost. But you have to keep going and you have to engage, discuss, encourage others to think with you.\" <br/>The Canadian has signed two recent statements urging caution about the future risks of AI. Some academics and industry experts have warned that the pace of development could result in malicious AI being deployed by \"bad actors\" to actively cause harm - or choosing to inflict harm by itself.<br/>Fellow \"godfather\" Dr Geoffrey Hinton has also signed the same warnings as Prof Bengio, and retired from Google recently saying he regretted his work. <br/>The third \"godfather\", Prof Yann LeCun, who along with Prof Bengio and Dr Hinton won a prestigious Turing Award for their pioneering work, has said apocalyptic warnings are overblown.<br/>Twitter and Tesla owner Elon Musk has also voiced his concerns.<br/>\"I don't think AI will try to destroy humanity, but it might put us under strict controls,\" he said recently at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. <br/>\"There's a small likelihood of it annihilating humanity. Close to zero but not impossible.\"<br/>Prof Bengio told the BBC all companies building powerful AI products needed to be registered.<br/>\"Governments need to track what they're doing, they need to be able to audit them, and that's just the minimum thing we do for any other sector like building aeroplanes or cars or pharmaceuticals,\" he said.<br/>\"We also need the people who are close to these systems to have a kind of certification... we need ethical training here. Computer scientists don't usually get that, by the way.\" <br/>But not everybody in the field believes AI will be the downfall of humans - others argue that there are more imminent problems which need addressing.<br/>Dr Sasha Luccioni, research scientist at the AI firm Huggingface, said society should focus on issues like AI bias, predictive policing, and the spread of misinformation by chatbots which she said were \"very concrete harms\". <br/>\"We should focus on that rather than the hypothetical risk that AI will destroy humanity,\" she added.<br/>There are already many examples of AI bringing benefits to society. Last week an AI tool discovered a new antibiotic, and a paralysed man was able to walk again just by thinking about it, thanks to a microchip developed using AI.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: AI 'godfather' Geoffrey Hinton tell the BBC of AI dangers as he quits Google<br/>But this is juxtaposed with fears about the far-reaching impact of AI on countries' economies. Firms are already replacing human staff with AI tools, and it is a factor in the current strike under way by scriptwriters in Hollywood.<br/>\"It's never too late to improve,\" says Prof Bengio of AI's current state. \"It's exactly like climate change. <br/>\"We've put a lot of carbon in the atmosphere.

Her arrival at the facility was confirmed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which declined to give any more details about her confinement, citing privacy concerns. <br/>There, the woman once billed as the world's youngest self-made billionaire might work alongside other inmates for between 12 cents (10p) and $1.15 (93p) an hour - much of which will go towards her court-mandated restitution payments. <br/>Earlier this month a US judge ordered Holmes and her former romantic and business partner, ex-Theranos boss Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, to pay $452m to victims.<br/>Balwani is already serving a 13-year prison sentence in California for his role in the scheme. <br/>Together, the pair are accused of duping some of the world's richest and most prominent investors - including media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and former US Treasury Secretary George Shultz - into backing Theranos. <br/>The firm, once valued at $9bn, promised it had technology that could detect conditions such as diabetes with just a few drops of blood. The tech, however, never worked. The company finally collapsed in 2018. <br/>The Texas prison camp where Holmes will serve time is a sprawling 37-acre facility. Most inmates there have been convicted of non-violent crimes, low-level drug dealing or white-collar offences. <br/>According to the facility's handbook, life largely revolves around work and extracurricular activities that include foreign language, computer literacy or business courses.<br/>Holmes had fought to stay out of prison while her legal appeal works its way through the courts. She argued a delay would allow her to raise \"substantial questions\" about the case that could warrant a new trial. <br/>Her defence team also argued that she should remain free to care for her children, one who is nearly two and the other three months old. <br/>The Wall Street Journal reported the prison has facilities where inmates can host gatherings and where children can play.<br/>Holmes and other mothers are allowed to hold their children in their lap and breastfeed their infants, according to official Bureau of Prison guidelines. <br/>The image of Holmes walking into a federal prison on Tuesday stands as a dire warning to other bosses in Silicon Valley, where observers have long warned of a \"fake it until you make it\" culture. <br/>Still, it is rare to see tech bosses go to prison on fraud charges.<br/>The US government hopes that Holmes's plight will deter executives from making outlandish claims about what their technology can do while hunting for financial backing. <br/>Eileen Lepera, who lost part of her savings investing in Theranos, told the BBC this week that she is \"glad she [Ms Holmes] got 11 years\". <br/>\"Her hubris is beyond belief,\" she added. \"I don't believe she's still taking any responsibility for what has happened.\" <br/>In tearful remarks ahead of her sentencing in November, Holmes said she regrets her failings at Theranos \"with every cell in my body\" but did not admit any criminal wrongdoing.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>Holmes has gone to jail.

As a result, it's distracted attention away from the near-term harms of AI\".<br/>Oxford's Institute for Ethics in AI senior research associate Elizabeth Renieris told BBC News she worried more about risks closer to the present.<br/>\"Advancements in AI will magnify the scale of automated decision-making that is biased, discriminatory, exclusionary or otherwise unfair while also being inscrutable and incontestable,\" she said. They would \"drive an exponential increase in the volume and spread of misinformation, thereby fracturing reality and eroding the public trust, and drive further inequality, particularly for those who remain on the wrong side of the digital divide\". <br/>Many AI tools essentially \"free ride\" on the \"whole of human experience to date\", Ms Renieris said. Many are trained on human-created content, text, art and music they can then imitate - and their creators \"have effectively transferred tremendous wealth and power from the public sphere to a small handful of private entities\". <br/>But Centre for AI Safety director Dan Hendrycks told BBC News future risks and present concerns \"shouldn't be viewed antagonistically\". <br/>\"Addressing some of the issues today can be useful for addressing many of the later risks tomorrow,\" he said.<br/>Media coverage of the supposed \"existential\" threat from AI has snowballed since March 2023 when experts, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a halt to the development of the next generation of AI technology.<br/>That letter asked if we should \"develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us\".<br/>In contrast, the new campaign has a very short statement, designed to \"open up discussion\".<br/>The statement compares the risk to that posed by nuclear war. In a blog post OpenAI recently suggested superintelligence might be regulated in a similar way to nuclear energy: \"We are likely to eventually need something like an IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] for superintelligence efforts\" the firm wrote.<br/>Both Sam Altman and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai are among technology leaders to have discussed AI regulation recently with the prime minister.<br/>Speaking to reporters about the latest warning over AI risk, Rishi Sunak stressed the benefits to the economy and society.<br/> \"You've seen that recently it was helping paralysed people to walk, discovering new antibiotics, but we need to make sure this is done in a way that is safe and secure,\" he said.<br/>\"Now that's why I met last week with CEOs of major AI companies to discuss what are the guardrails that we need to put in place, what's the type of regulation that should be put in place to keep us safe.<br/>\"People will be concerned by the reports that AI poses existential risks, like pandemics or nuclear wars. <br/>\"I want them to be reassured that the government is looking very carefully at this.\"<br/>He had discussed the issue recently with other leaders, at the G7 summit of leading industrialised nations, Mr Sunak said, and would raise it again in the US soon. <br/>The G7 has recently created a working group on AI.<br/>What are your questions about artificial intelligence?<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That's despite Intel reporting more than $63bn in revenue last year, compared with Nvidia's $27bn. <br/>Geir Lode, head of global equities at Federated Hermes, said the magnitude of the recent leap in Nvidia's share price was \"an astonishing surprise even to techno-optimists\". <br/>\"Artificial intelligence is the next super charged growth area, and we expect this is just the beginning,\" Mr Lode said. \"We know growth will be there, but valuations can be hard to justify.\"<br/>Investor Cathie Wood, chief executive of Ark Invest, who is known as a tech booster, sold her stake in Nvidia in January, missing the gains made since then.<br/>She recently tweeted that the firm's shares were \"priced ahead of the curve\". She said markets were making a mistake to think the company was \"the only AI play\".<br/>In the past, investors have not hesitated to sour on former favourites. <br/>Facebook-owner Meta, which joined the $1tn club in 2021, was booted out just a few months later, as its shares lost roughly three quarters of their value. It is valued at about $670bn today.<br/>Communications giant Cisco was also seen as a likely trillion dollar club member during the dotcom tech bubble of the late 1990s. But that bubble burst and the firm is valued at about $200bn today. <br/>Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpower<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We continue to focus on engaging directly with our employees and we continue to offer a really attractive rate of pay and comprehensive benefits,\" Mr Travis said. <br/>But in its submission to the CAC, Amazon could argue that there are more people working in the warehouse than GMB calculates, and this could lead the CAC to deny the GMB recognition.  <br/>The committee could take several weeks to reach a decision.<br/>GMB writes to tribunal for Amazon recognition<br/>Amazon workers on brink of winning union victory<br/>Hundreds of Amazon workers walk out in pay dispute<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This included the review of an audited financial statement \"which showed it to be profitable.\"<br/>As of March 2022, Temasek was worth more than S$403bn ($298.1bn; \u00a3241.3bn), so the money it had put into the cryptocurrency platform accounted for a small percentage of its investments.<br/>However, Singapore's deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong said in December that Temasek's losses in FTX had caused damage to the fund's reputation.<br/>\"The fact that other leading global institutional investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital also invested in FTX does not mitigate this,\" added Mr Wong, who is also the country's finance minister.<br/>Sovereign wealth funds are like a savings account for a country, and they typically invest in shares, currencies, property or other assets.<br/>FTX, which a year ago was valued at $32bn, filed for bankruptcy protection in November. It has been estimated that $8bn of customer's funds was missing.<br/>Mr Bankman-Fried, who co-founded FTX in 2019, was one of the most high-profile figures in the cryptocurrency industry, known for his political ties, celebrity endorsements and bailouts of other struggling firms.<br/>US federal prosecutors have accused Mr Bankman-Fried of stealing billions of dollars from FTX users to pay debts at his other firm, Alameda Research, and to make other investments.<br/>In December, prosecutors announced eight criminal charges against Mr Bankman-Fried, including wire fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations. Another five charges were levied against him in March. Financial regulators have also brought claims against Mr Bankman-Fried.<br/>FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, the former head of Alameda, have also been charged over their alleged roles in the company's collapse.<br/>Mr Bankman-Fried was arrested in December in the Bahamas, where he lived and FTX was based.<br/>In an interview with BBC News just days before his arrest, he said: \"I didn't knowingly commit fraud.

Mr Musk's previous ambitions to begin tests came to nothing.<br/>The FDA said it acknowledged Neuralink's announcement.<br/>An earlier bid by Neuralink to win FDA approval was rejected on safety grounds, according to a report in March by the Reuters news agency that cited multiple current and former employees. <br/>Neuralink hopes to use its microchips to treat conditions such as paralysis and blindness, and to help certain disabled people use computers and mobile technology.<br/>The chips - which have been tested in monkeys - are designed to interpret signals produced in the brain and relay information to devices via Bluetooth.  <br/>Experts have cautioned that Neuralink's brain implants will require extensive testing to overcome technical and ethical challenges if they are to become widely available.<br/>Mr Musk has also previously suggested that the proposed technology could help ease concerns about humans being displaced by AI.<br/>Announcing Thursday's news on Twitter, Neuralink talked of an \"important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people\".<br/>The approval was \"the result of incredible work by the Neuralink team in close collaboration with the FDA\", it said.<br/>The firm promised more information \"soon\" on plans to sign up trial participants.<br/>Its website promises that \"safety, accessibility and reliability\" are all priorities during its engineering process.<br/>The company - which was co-founded by Mr Musk in 2016 - has repeatedly overestimated the speed at which it can execute its plans.<br/>Its initial aim was to start planting chips in human brains in 2020, in order to honour a pledge made the year before.

She would jump at the chance, he says, \"to step in... and say, 'I can fix this'\".<br/>Which begs the question: can she?<br/>Even before billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, the social network had problems.<br/>It has been fiercely criticised, by the left and right, for how it polices misinformation and hate speech, and the business has struggled to break even - making an annual profit just twice since its launch in 2006.<br/>Growth, whether measured by users or the money it brings in, has been bumpy.<br/>Since Mr Musk took over the platform last year, the issues have only gotten worse.<br/>He has cut 75% of its former staff, including teams charged with tracking abuse; changed how the company verifies authentic accounts; and sparked debate with his own tweets spreading conspiracy theories.<br/>Advertisers have left in large numbers and users also appear sceptical. A recent poll by Pew found that six in 10 adults in the US, Twitter's largest base, were taking a break and a quarter said they did not expect to be using the app in a year.<br/>Even Mr Musk has seemed daunted by the challenges, going through with his $44bn purchase last year only under threat of a lawsuit. He has joked that only someone \"foolish\" would want the chief executive title from him.<br/>Ms Yaccarino appears undaunted. <br/>Raised in an Italian-American family, the daughter of a police officer has risen through the ranks of some of the biggest media companies in the US, forging a reputation as a high-heeled and hard-charging executive, who has helped steer entertainment giant NBCUniversal through the upheaval wrought by the growth of the tech giants.<br/>At NBCU, home to brands such as NBC News, Focus Features and Bravo, Ms Yaccarino overhauled the ad sales business, pushed the 2020 launch of its ad-supported streaming platform Peacock, and drove industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrated online. <br/>The mother-of-two, who met her husband Claude Madrazo on a blind date and became a grandmother last year, was known to want some kind of promotion after a decade at NBCU where she was chairman of global advertising and partnerships. <br/>There was widespread speculation about her interest in Twitter, especially after she defended Mr Musk at a conference last year, urging critical advertisers to \"give the guy a minute\". <br/>\"I've long been inspired by your vision to create a brighter future,\" she tweeted after her new post was announced. \"I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\"<br/>By hiring Ms Yaccarino, Mr Musk has \"purchased trust\" from advertisers, says Mr Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory.<br/>Indeed, industry giant GroupM, who represents brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle, has already said it sees the platform as less risky.<br/>But repairing Twitter's business will be no small task. <br/>Though big ad buyers are eager to have choices beyond the tech giants, the platform remains too small to be a must-buy, says long-time media analyst Brian Wieser, now principal at consultancy Madison and Wall. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>New Twitter CEO tells Musk: \u2018I\u2019ve met my match\u2019<br/>Beyond advertising, she will also face a host of pressing issues: regulatory scrutiny of Twitter's hate speech and privacy controls; lawsuits from landlords, vendors and former staff over unpaid bills; not to mention user complaints and basic tech glitches, like the malfunctions that plagued the high-profile interview with Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis hosted on the platform. <br/>The biggest wild card of all, of course, is Mr Musk, who has said he intends to remain involved at the site, overseeing products and technology. <br/>\"Anybody taking this job has been set up to fail - it's not specific to her,\" Mr Wieser says. \"The question is whether or not the odds are more likely to be in her favour than any alternative. And yeah, actually the odds are more favourable.\"<br/>Friends and former colleagues say they expect Ms Yaccarino to use her background in television to improve the platform's ad business and expand the use of video across the site. <br/>She has called Mr Musk's vision of Twitter as a starting point for an \"the everything app\", offering messages, payments and other functions a \"great opportunity\" for advertisers.<br/>\"[She has] the guts and the courage to take big swings,\" says Jacqueline Corbelli, founder and chief executive of Brightline, a tech company focused on streaming adverts, which has partnered with NBCU. <br/>\"If Twitter gives her the space to do it, she will bring the ability to integrate what's been successful in the past and blend that with what advertisers are going to be looking for to regain trust in Twitter.\"<br/>Whether Ms Yaccarino will have room to run remains a big if.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The purpose was to maintain access to critical systems for as long as possible.  <br/>The attack was carried out by China's state-sponsored cyber group \"Volt Typhoon\" and relied on \"living-off-the-land techniques\", said the tech company.<br/>This involves hackers infiltrating local networks to modify their tools and issue commands, while remaining largely undetected. <br/>Responding to queries at a Chinese foreign ministry press briefing, spokeswoman Mao Ning called the US the \"hacker empire\" and dismissed the report as having a \"serious lack of evidence chain\".<br/>While the US and China regularly accuse each other of spying, the joint Five Eyes statement is notable, experts say. <br/>\"The fact that it's a Five Eyes initiative - there's significant concern over what this attack might be a precursor to in terms of the intent behind it, and the sabotage element here,\" said Jamie Norton, a partner at restructuring and advisory firm McGrathNicol.<br/>Mr Norton, a former information security advisor to the Australian government, noted that Microsoft's analysis of the attack found no evidence that the Chinese hackers had used their access to Guam's systems for any offensive attacks. <br/>But, he added, that finding could point to a broader campaign to \"exfiltrate and farm data over the long term\",  in order to conduct sabotage operations in the future.<br/>Spy balloon sent data to China in real time - report<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And the general reaction seemed to be \"underwhelmed\".<br/>There was a lack of genuine first-party exclusives, and many of the PlayStation 5 games on display were already known about.<br/>But there were some highlights, as well as the odd \"huh\" moment.<br/>Save the best until last? Sony seemed to think so - it capped the presentation with 12 minutes of gameplay footage from its sequel to the 2018 PS4 hit.<br/>We saw control switch between Peter Parker in a dark Venom suit - boasting new symbiote powers - and Miles Morales, who got his own PS5 launch game.<br/>The pair were seen swinging through New York in pursuit of Dr Curt Connors, aka the Lizard, while trying to avoid supervillain Kraven's henchmen.<br/>Fans generally seemed impressed, excited by the ability to play as both characters and the promise of a darker story turn thanks to the new black suit.<br/>But the game's existence was already confirmed, and fans had been hoping for news of something new from a Sony studio.<br/>Probably the worst-kept secret of the night - rumours had been swirling that a remake of PlayStation 2 classic Metal Gear Solid 3 was on the cards.<br/>And when the brief trailer ended with a glimpse of hero Solid Snake it was finally confirmed.<br/>The game, which will also be on Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S consoles, doesn't have a release date yet.<br/>Sony also announced that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be released as the Master Collection: Volume 1, later this year.<br/>There was no mention of a Metal Gear Solid 4 re-master - long-wished for by fans, but some suggested it might feature in a volume two.<br/>Some were concerned that series creator Hideo Kojima, who left developer Konami on bad terms, won't be involved in the re-releases.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Although the longed-for FF16 demo didn't appear as hoped.<br/>And the first look at Dragon's Dogma 2 was a welcome surprise, as it showed work on the sequel to the 2013 sleeper hit was well under way.<br/>Fans of indie games were well-served, with follow-ups to Journey and Night in the Woods on show, as well as Devolver Digital's The Plucky Squire.<br/>Resident Evil 4 Remake and Synapse on PSVR2 - as well as a free Beat Saber upgrade that launched as the showcase went out - were also well-received.<br/>One of the biggest complaints was the lack of true exclusive titles on display.<br/>Halo developer Bungie, recently bought by Sony, announced it was reviving its 1994 franchise Marathon.

He can also now stand and climb stairs.<br/>\"It has been a long journey, but now I can stand up and have a beer with my friend. It's a pleasure that many people don't realise.\"<br/>The development, published in the journal Nature, was led by Swiss researchers. Prof Jocelyne Bloch, of Lausanne University, who is the neurosurgeon who carried out the delicate surgery to insert the implants, stressed that the system was still at a basic research stage and was many years away from being available to paralysed patients. <br/>But she told BBC News that it was the team's aim to get it out of the lab and into the clinic as soon as possible.<br/>\"The important thing for us is not just to have a scientific trial, but eventually to give more access to more people with spinal cord injuries who are used to hearing from doctors that they have to get used to the fact that they will never move again.\"<br/>Harvey Sihota is chief executive of the UK charity Spinal Research, which was not involved in the research. He said that although there was a long way to go before the technology would be generally available, he described the development as \"very encouraging\".<br/>\"While there is still much to improve with these technologies this is another exciting step on the roadmap for neurotechnology and its role in restoring function and independence to our spinal cord injury community\".<br/>The operation to restore Gert-Jan's movement was carried out in July 2021. Prof Bloch cut two circular holes on each side of his skull, 5cm in diameter, above the regions of the brain involved in controlling movement. She then inserted two disc-shaped implants which wirelessly transmit brain signals - Gert-Jan's intentions - to two sensors attached to a helmet on his head.<br/>The Swiss team developed an algorithm which translates these signals into instructions to move leg and foot muscles via a second implant inserted around Gert-Jan's spinal cord - which Prof Bloch intricately attached to the nerve endings related to walking.<br/>The researchers found that after a few weeks of training he could stand and walk with the aid of a walker. His movement is slow but smooth, according to Prof Gr\u00e9goire Courtine of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale in Lausanne (EPFL),  who led the project.<br/>\"Seeing him walk so naturally is so moving,\" he said. \"It is a paradigm shift in what was available before\".<br/>The brain implants build on Prof Courtine's earlier work, when only the spinal implant was used to restore movement. The spinal implant amplified weak signals from the brain to the damaged part of the spinal column and was boosted further by pre-programmed signals from a computer.<br/>BBC News reported how  in 2018, David M'Zee became the first patient to be successfully treated with a spinal implant, so much so that he was able to have a baby with his wife, something that had not been possible previously. <br/>And last year we reported how as the result of the same technology, Michel Roccati became the first man with a completely severed spine to walk again.<br/>Both have benefitted tremendously but their walking motion is pre-programmed and looks robotic. They also have to keep their intended movements in step with the computer and have to stop and reset if they get out of sync.<br/>Gert-Jan had only the spinal implant before he had the brain implants. He says that he now has much greater control.<br/>\"I felt before that the system was controlling me, but now I am controlling it\".Neither the previous or new systems can be used constantly. They are bulky and still at an experimental stage. <br/>Instead, patients use them for an hour or so for a few times a week as part of their recuperation. The act of walking trains their muscles and has restored a degree of movement when the system is turned off, suggesting that damaged nerves may be regrowing.<br/>The eventual aim is to miniaturise the technology. Prof Courtine's spin out company Onward Medical, is making improvements to commercialise the technology so it can be used in people's day-to-day lives.<br/>\"It's coming,\" says Prof Courtine,. \"Gert-Jan received the implant 10 years after his accident. Imagine when we apply our brain-spine interface a few weeks after the injury. The potential for recovery is tremendous\".<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Man with severed spine walks in world first<br/>Paralysed men walk again with spinal implant<br/>EPFL<br/>Spinal Research<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

However, he has managed to retain his billionaire status - he has a net worth of \u00a32.4bn according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. <br/>When it became clear Virgin Orbit was unable to secure long-term funding, it filed for bankruptcy protection in the US early last month. <br/>Rival start-up Rocket Lab has bought most of Virgin Orbit's headquarters in California as well as other assets. The company's Boeing 747 plane, which was converted to help launch satellites, has also been sold off. In total, the asset sale fetched $36.4m (\u00a329.4m).<br/>Virgin Orbit, which was founded in 2017, never made a profit as a public company.<br/>So much was riding on Virgin Orbit's rocket launch from Cornwall in January, it was supposed to be a spectacular start to a new industry in the UK.<br/>But the dislodging of a small component - a fuel filter - had a domino effect. The rocket failed, confidence was lost in Virgin Orbit and now the company has been sold off, piecemeal. <br/>Where does this leave Spaceport Cornwall, the UK's first licensed spaceport? US-based Virgin Orbit was their key customer.   <br/>The Cornwall team there say they're working with other launch companies, including Sierra Space, and they'll continue to create and grow a space cluster in the South West. <br/>But another Cornwall blast off is unlikely to happen anytime soon. The site at Newquay Airport is limited to horizontal launches - where a plane takes off, carrying a rocket, which is then launched mid-flight.  <br/>Other sites around the UK have their sights set on space too. SaxaVord Spaceport, based on the Shetland island of Unst, is now leading the way.<br/>This is a vertical launch site where rockets blast off skywards from a pad. SaxaVord is working with several firms, including a German company called Rocket Factory Augsburg - engine testing is set to take place in Shetland later this year.<br/>And it's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides.<br/>The demise of Virgin Orbit shows just how hard this race to space can be - and there may well be more failures along the way. But the UK's ambitions for space are far from over.  <br/>A UK Space Agency spokesperson said the UK space sector was thriving and generating an income of \u00a317.5bn a year, employing around 49,000 people. <br/>It said its focus remained on supporting multiple projects designed to make the UK the \"leading provider of commercial small satellite launch in Europe by 2030\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Virgin Orbit rocket heads into space<br/>Branson feared 'losing everything' in pandemic<br/>Branson's rocket company cuts majority of workforce<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is an extraordinary decision. And I think we should remember who it is who is making it.\"<br/>He was speaking at the PIER23 conference on tackling online harms at Anglia Ruskin University Chelmsford.<br/>The security minister singled out the Meta boss for criticism. <br/>\"I am speaking about Meta specifically, and Mark Zuckerberg's choices particularly. These are his choices,\" he said.<br/>A government advertising campaign will soon be launched \"to tell parents the truth about Meta's choices and what they mean for the safety of their children\", he said. <br/>The campaign, which would run in print, online and broadcast, would \"encourage tech firms to take responsibility and to do the right thing\", Mr Tugendhat said.<br/>The Home Office declined to provide more detail about the campaign when approached by the BBC.<br/>Meta argues the majority of British people already rely on apps that use encryption to keep them safe from hackers, fraudsters and criminals.<br/>\"We don't think people want us reading their private messages so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security\", it said.<br/>The company removes and reports millions of images each month. <br/>WhatsApp, which Meta owns, made more than one million reports in a year even though it uses end-to-end-encryption.<br/>The Home Office has promoted similar campaigns in the past, such as last year's No Place to Hide campaign, which also called on Facebook to abandon plans for end-to-end encryption. <br/>But the data watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office was critical of the campaign, arguing the tech helped protect children from criminals and abusers, urged Facebook to roll it out without delay.<br/>The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communication regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.<br/>Several messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.<br/>The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material.<br/>The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.<br/>This, critics argue, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages and to argue otherwise would be like arguing that digging a hole under a fence did not break the fence<br/>Signal told the BBC in February that it would \"walk\" from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.<br/>In response to the minister's comments, its president Meredith Whittaker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was trying to implement \"a mass surveillance apparatus\". It would, she said, require people to \"run government-mandated scanning services on their devices\".<br/>Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, told Today that: \"Essentially it's building a door that doesn't currently exist, not into the encrypted messaging app but into devices, which could be used or misused by people who aren't interested in protecting children for more nefarious purposes.\" <br/>Mr Martin said he believed the UK would end up in the \"unhappy situation\" where the power in the bill would be passed by Parliament but not used. <br/>Apple tried client-side scanning, but abandoned it after a backlash. In an article in the Financial Times, Mr Martin suggested Apple is privately critical of the powers in the bill, but the firm has so far declined to set out publicly its position on the issue.<br/>BBC News learned from Freedom of Information requests that Apple has had four meetings since April 2022 with the Ofcom team responsible for developing policy regarding the enforcement of the relevant section of the bill. <br/>Twitter launches encrypted private messages - Musk<br/>WhatsApp and messaging apps against 'surveillance'<br/>Watchdog criticises government encryption campaign<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The testers said Evolv should inform potential clients.<br/>Despite this, the company has been expanding into schools, and now claims to be in hundreds of them across the US. <br/>In March 2022, the Utica Schools Board bought Evolv's weapons scanning system for 13 schools. It was installed over the summer holidays.<br/>On 31 October, CCTV captured the perpetrator of the attack against Ehni Ler Htoo entering Proctor High School and passing through the Evolv weapons scanners, according to one source at the school who has seen the security footage. <br/>\"When we viewed the horrific video, we all asked the same question. How did the student get the knife into the school?\" said Brian Nolan, Superintendent of Utica Schools.<br/>The knife used in the stabbing was more than 9in (22.8cm) long. <br/>The attack triggered an internal investigation by Utica's school district. <br/>\"Through investigation it was determined the Evolv Weapon Detection System\u2026 was not designed to detect knives,\" Mr Nolan said.<br/>The scanners were removed from Proctor High School and replaced by 10 metal detectors. But the scanners are still operating in the district's remaining 12 schools. Mr Nolan says the district cannot afford to get rid of Evolv's system in its remaining schools. <br/>Since that attack, Mr Nolan says three other knives have been found on students in other schools in the district where the Evolv systems continue to operate. <br/>One of the knives was 7in long. Another was a curved blade with finger holes. Another was a pocket knife. Mr Nolan says they were all found because they were reported to staff - not because the weapons scanner had detected them. <br/>\"The kids [who had the knives] all said they walked right through the weapons detection system, we asked them about that\u2026 it truly, truly does not find knives,\" he said.<br/>After the stabbing, the wording on Evolv's website changed. <br/>Up until October last year, Evolv's homepage featured a headline that boasted of \"Weapons-Free Zones\". The company then removed that wording, and changed the text  to \"Safe Zones\". It has now been changed again and reads \"Safer Zones\". <br/>Evolv claims its system uses cutting-edge AI technology to find weapons. However, its critics say not enough is known about how the system works - or how effective this technology is at finding different types of weapons.<br/>The BBC sent a detailed right of reply to Evolv, laying out what had happened at the school in Utica, and the decision of the school to stop using its system. <br/>We also asked what Evolv had told schools about what its system could and could not detect, whether it had told schools that independent testing had found its systems could not reliably detect large knives, and whether it thought its systems were suitable for use in schools. Evolv did not answer the questions.<br/>Conor Healy of IPVM, a firm that analyses security equipment, says Evolv has exaggerated how effective the system is.<br/>\"There's an epidemic of schools buying new technology based on audacious marketing claims, then finding out it has hidden flaws, often millions of dollars later. Evolv is one of the worst offenders. School officials are not technical experts on weapons detection, and companies like Evolv profit from their ignorance.\"<br/>Playing fast and loose with marketing claims is unacceptable when you sell a security product used to protect young people, he added.<br/>Although Evolv did not give the BBC a comment, it did direct it to a blog post from its CEO, Peter George, in which he defends the lack of detail in how much the firm has said about how the technology works. <br/>\"Marketing weapons detection security requires a delicate balance between educating stakeholders on new technology and not providing bad actors with the information they could use to do harm,\" he said. <br/>\"So, while public-facing marketing materials are intentionally not specific, we communicate all aspects of the Evolv Express system - including limitations and\u202fcapabilities - with the trusted security professionals at our customers, partners, and prospects\", the blogpost read. <br/>The BBC contacted seven other school districts that all use Evolv weapons scanners. Five did not respond.

It will make it illegal for app stores to offer TikTok, but does not ban people who already have TikTok from using it.<br/>Montana, which has a population of just over one million, banned the app on government devices last December.<br/>TikTok says it has 150 million American users. Although the app's user base has expanded in recent years, it is still most popular with teenagers and users in their 20s.<br/>However, there are concerns across the US political spectrum that TikTok could be a national security risk.<br/>The social media platform is owned by ByteDance - a Chinese company. ByteDance has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government.<br/>The lawsuit also argues that Montana has overstepped its authority by concerning itself with users' data and national security - which is the purview of the federal government.<br/>It says the ban is based on the \"unfounded speculation\" that China's government could access TikTok data.<br/>Lawyers for Montana's government have previously said that they expected lawsuits, and that they are prepared to defend the ban in courts. <br/>You may also be interested in:<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The fight over TikTok explained in 60 seconds<br/>First state-wide TikTok ban in US signed into law<br/>What could a TikTok ban mean for creators?<br/>TikTok defends app following government phone ban<br/>The good and bad of ADHD content on TikTok<br/>TikTokers give their lives Wes Anderson treatment<br/>Montana becomes first US state to pass TikTok ban<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that the decision \"does not apply in the UK\" but said it had \"noted the decision and will review the details in due course\".<br/>Most large companies have complex webs of data transfers - which can include email addresses, phone numbers and financial information - to overseas recipients, many of which depend on SCCs. <br/>And Meta says their broad use makes the fine unfair.<br/>Facebook president Nick Clegg said: \"We are therefore disappointed to have been singled out when using the same legal mechanism as thousands of other companies looking to provide services in Europe.<br/>\"This decision is flawed, unjustified and sets a dangerous precedent for the countless other companies transferring data between the EU and US.\"<br/>But privacy groups have welcomed that precedent. <br/>Caitlin Fennessy, of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said: \"The size of this record-breaking fine is matched by the significance of the signal it sends.<br/>\"Today's decision signals that companies have a whole lot of risk on the table.\"<br/>It could make EU companies demand US partners stored data within Europe - or switch to domestic alternatives, she added.<br/>In 2013, former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed American authorities had repeatedly accessed people's information via technology companies such as Facebook and Google.<br/>And Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems filed a legal challenge against Facebook for failing to protect his privacy rights, setting off a decade-long battle over the legality of moving EU data to the US. <br/>Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), has repeatedly said Washington has insufficient checks in place to protect Europeans' information.<br/>And in 2020, the ECJ, ruled an EU-to-US data transfer agreement invalid.<br/>But the ECJ left the door open for companies to use SCCs, saying the transfer of data to any other third country was valid as long as it ensured an \"adequate level of data protection\".<br/>It is that test Meta has been found to have failed.<br/>Asked about the \u20ac1.2bn fine, Mr Schrems said he was \"happy to see this decision after 10 years of litigation\" but it could have been much higher.<br/>\"Unless US surveillance laws get fixed, Meta will have to fundamentally restructure its systems,\" he added. <br/>Despite the record-breaking size of the fine, experts have said they think Meta's privacy practices will not change. <br/>\"A billion-euro parking ticket is of no consequence to a company that earns many more billions by parking illegally,\" Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.<br/>The US recently updated its internal legal protections to give the EU greater assurances American intelligence agencies would follow new rules governing such data access.<br/>In 2021, Amazon was fined for similarly flouting the EU's privacy standard.<br/>Ireland's DPC has also fined WhatsApp, another Meta-owned business, for breaching stringent regulations relating to the transparency of data shared with its other subsidiaries. <br/>WhatsApp issued second-largest GDPR fine<br/>WhatsApp changes privacy policy after fine<br/>Amazon hit with $886m fine for alleged law breach<br/>Amazon charged with abusing EU competition rules<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He died later in hospital. <br/>Prosecutors did not suggest a motive but said there was DNA evidence that called into question the defence's claim of self-defence.<br/>According to court documents, a witness told police that Mr Momeni questioned Mr Lee about his sister the night before the stabbing.<br/>He asked Mr Lee about whether his sister was \"doing drugs or anything inappropriate\", prosecutors said. Mr Lee \"had to reassure [Mr Momeni] nothing inappropriate happened\".<br/>Mr Momeni's sister, Khazar Elyassnia, is married to a prominent plastic surgeon in the Bay Area - both of whom attended Thursday's hearing.<br/>Shortly after midnight, Mr Lee went to Mrs Elyassnia's apartment. Mr Momeni was already there and CCTV shows Mr Lee and Mr Momeni leaving together in Mr Momeni's BMW about half an hour before the murder.<br/>The hearing was told Mr Momeni was caught drink driving in 2004, and was charged in 2011 with a misdemeanour for carrying a switchblade, criminal records show, but that case was dismissed after he took a plea deal.<br/>According to public records, Mr Momeni's IT consulting business was struggling, and acquaintances described him as an introvert, the Wall Street Journal reported. <br/>Ms Canny said Mr Momeni was not a US citizen and faced deportation to Iran, the San Francisco Standard reported.<br/>Mr Lee's death fuelled existing fears and criticism of rising crime in the city, before police announced the suspect was known to him.<br/>Tech worker arrested in Cash App founder's killing<br/>Argument led to Cash App founder's murder - court<br/>Cash App founder killed in San Francisco stabbing<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This week Ireland saw semiconductor firm ADI invest \u20ac630m in a research and manufacturing facility in Limerick.<br/>The chair of the House of Commons Business Select Committee, Labour MP Darren Jones, welcomed the strategy and the recognition of the need to invest but added, \"the initial \u00a3250m is a very small amount of subsidy compared to other countries\".<br/>Under the strategy \u00a3200m will be invested between 2023-25 to provide infrastructure for industry, fund more research, and promote international co-operation.<br/>Labour shadow culture minister Lucy Powell said that after years of delays, the strategy would be met with disappointment and showed \"significantly less ambition than our competitors\".<br/>Gaurav Gupta of consultants Gartner said the funding was fine for research, but if the ambition was to be competitive with the big players in the field - Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom and AMD then the \u00a31bn was \"insignificant\".<br/>Dr Simon Thomas, chief executive of UK based graphene semiconductor start-up Paragraf, told the BBC the announcement was \"quite frankly flaccid\". <br/>\"It is a long way from addressing the needs of UK chipmakers,\" he said. <br/>Zoe Kleinman, the BBC's technology editor said: \"Many businesses making hardware say when there's a shortage, it's difficult to get a look-in with the enormous chip manufacturers because their output is hoovered up by giants like Apple with far deeper pockets than anybody else. <br/>\"Will the UK government have sharp enough elbows to muscle in? It is a noble ambition to attempt to \"mitigate\" supply chain issues but ultimately, if we aren't making chips at scale ourselves, we are always going to be at the mercy of someone else.\"<br/>The BBC, and other media, were not shown the full report ahead of publication, but a summary was provided by officials. <br/>The strategy will focus on areas the UK is particularly good at: semiconductor design, cutting-edge  \"compound\" semiconductors, and research - areas that also require less funding than large scale chip manufacturing where essential machines cost hundreds of millions of pounds. <br/>The strategy will also try to increase the security of chip supply through international partnerships. <br/>Recent pandemic-fuelled chip shortages disrupted supplies of products from games to cars and critical manufacturing is concentrated in a few countries, such as Taiwan.<br/>Peter Claydon, the president of Picocom a chip design company based in Bristol, told the BBC it was good to have the strategy but said: \"It's not a lot of money.\"<br/>And he would have liked to have seen tax breaks used to support the industry and more emphasis on education to help supply the skilled professionals the industry needs.<br/>However, he valued the strategy's emphasis on international cooperation, although he said it would have been better to have remained in the EU with its multi-billion euro programme, which was enough to \"make some difference\", he said.<br/>Arm opts for US-only stock market listing<br/>The US is beating China in the battle for chips<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Share your experiences with us.<br/>Other campaigners agree internet access is now a vital utility essential for day-to-day life. <br/>People who cannot afford data can experience problems such as managing benefits, applying for jobs online or benefiting from cheaper online prices which exacerbate their difficult financial situation.<br/>The government said its job centre staff \"regularly signpost claimants to relevant information on social tariffs, and claimants can access computers for their work search at their local job centre\".<br/>Citizens Advice cited the case of Rob, 63, who since about 2012 had been unable to afford broadband: \"Not having access at home means if I am applying for a job I need to give myself more time because the library is not open all day. <br/>\"I can't just think at 22:00, 'let me go back to that application and finish filling it in'. It also limits me from accessing services like my GP, online help and shopping.\" <br/>The government points to a number of steps it has taken to help those who find broadband hard to afford. <br/>In June, following negotiations with the government, leaders from major broadband and mobile operators agreed a set of public commitments to support customers struggling to pay their bills. <br/>But campaigners the Digital Poverty Alliance echoed the concerns of Citizen Advice and said while social tariff uptake was \"slowly improving\", it was still far below the levels needed to ensure all households were digitally included. <br/>\"For households in severe poverty, even an affordable social tariff may mean that essential connectivity is still out of reach,\" the organisation said.<br/>Millions of families miss out on cheap broadband<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

There are no charges for getting a package, no fee to leave before the contract expires, and the price won't increase midway through.<br/>However, which package you can access will depend on where you live, as not all properties can receive every broadband service. Those in rural areas in particular will have limited options.<br/>Before choosing a supplier you should consider exactly what internet speed suits your particular needs.<br/>That comes down to:<br/>BBC iPlayer and Netflix both recommend a 5Mbps connection to stream a programme in high quality, so you might think a 10Mbps connection is enough.<br/>But the moment two people in a household are both streaming video, that would put the connection at capacity - and that's assuming you aren't using your phone while streaming video.<br/>You should also keep in mind the speeds quoted are average speeds.

The press is the essential element in a community of being able to attain that.\"<br/>Asked why anyone should become a reporter today, he said to find \"the best obtainable version of the truth\".   <br/>The Chat GPT programme, which uses AI, has become widely used in the past year and Rajan read them an excerpt that the tool had produced about the two veteran US journalists. <br/>It briefly summarised who they were and said their work \"had inspired a new generation of journalists and established a new standard for investigative reporting\".<br/>Bernstein said he wasn't enamoured by the extract and described it as \"an amalgam of things that have been written about us\".<br/>He recognised part of it from a brochure used for the conference they had attended. Despite it being the early stages of artificial intelligence, he said: \"AI is a huge force we're going to have to grapple with in this world.\"<br/>Discussing the limitations of AI, Woodward said: \"I can call the Pentagon and say, 'I'd like to talk to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the top military man', and he's either going to talk or maybe not. AI can't do that.\"<br/>Amol Rajan Interviews: Watergate to Trump<br/>Amol Rajan interviews Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two journalists at the heart of the Watergate scandal, about Nixon, Trump and America today.<br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)<br/>Their Watergate story began with the two reporters carrying out traditional journalism, knocking on doors following a burglary, and ended by exposing the wrongdoing of President Nixon. <br/>The pair are revered in US journalism for their award-winning reporting, and their book about Watergate was adapted for the big screen in All the President's Men. <br/>The movie came out in 1976 and starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein.<br/>Bernstein drew a parallel between the dramatic events surrounding the resignation of President Nixon and those around the end of President Trump's time in office.<br/>\"We never thought we would see it with another president. It happened even more so and even more dangerously with Trump,\" he said.<br/>This year, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News paid out nearly $800m (\u00a3643m) over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election. <br/>Murdoch owns many media outlets, including the Times, the Sun and the Wall Street Journal, as well as Fox News.<br/>Asked whether Rupert Murdoch has been a force for good, Bernstein said: \"Instead of being remembered for his imagination in terms of what he did with the movie business, with changing television shows like South Park, all of this has been overwhelmed by promoting, encouraging and accepting a culture of untruth that has been the hallmark of his journalism\". <br/>\"I think in terms of his legacy, it is going to be evil because he has taken untruth and made it his imprimatur.\"<br/>Woodward has written many books including ones on Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and the CIA. Carl Bernstein, himself an author of five best-selling books, is a regular voice on US news programmes.<br/>Amol Rajan interviews - Watergate to Trump will be broadcast at 19:00 BST on Thursday 18 May on BBC Two.<br/>Trump in feud with Watergate reporter<br/>Profile: Bob Woodward<br/>Why the Woodward effect damages Trump<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Firms that break the law face penalties of up to $10,000 (\u00a38,012), which would be enforced by Montana's Department of Justice.<br/>It means that technology giants like Apple and Google could face fines if they allow TikTok to be downloaded in Montana from their app stores.<br/>TikTok's owner ByteDance has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government.<br/>You may also be interested in:<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The fight over TikTok explained in 60 seconds<br/>What could a TikTok ban mean for creators?<br/>TikTok defends app following government phone ban<br/>The good and bad of ADHD content on TikTok<br/>TikTokers give their lives Wes Anderson treatment<br/>Montana becomes first US state to pass TikTok ban<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\"<br/>Inside the routine at Elizabeth Holmes' prison<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\"<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia. <br/>The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain. <br/>The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals.<br/>There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety. <br/>Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\"<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810,000) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen.<br/>China bans major US chip maker from key projects<br/>China tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT rival<br/>OpenAI announces ChatGPT successor GPT-4<br/>Students warned against using AI for assignments<br/>'Google killer' ChatGPT sparks AI chatbot race<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Huge arrays of angled solar panels sit atop jet black steel supports, soaking up the sun and shading the vehicles beneath. <br/>Outside the offices of a major car manufacturer in the south of England, there are now more than 2,000 panels in total with a peak capacity of just under 1 megawatt (MW).<br/>That's enough to power hundreds of homes.<br/>\"They are looking stunning,\" declares Guy Chilvers, business development manager at SIG, the firm that supplied the solar canopies.<br/>These structures make car parks more visually appealing, he insists, while admitting, \"I would say that\".<br/>Solar car parks or car ports enable electricity production in open spaces that tend to be positioned conveniently near to energy-guzzling facilities such as hospitals, shopping centres or offices. The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox. Lately, he's quoted for hotels, hospitals and leisure centres. Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs.<br/>He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates.<br/>In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: \"Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. <br/>\"I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\"<br/>Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: \"Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,\" <br/>At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron.<br/>After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. <br/>It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings.<br/>As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. <br/>In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.<br/>Things did not go smoothly.<br/>He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard.<br/>He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. <br/>An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city.<br/>He survived \"Operation Scouse Grovel\", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.<br/>Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered.<br/>He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way.<br/>He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre.<br/>In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021.<br/>It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. <br/>Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician.<br/>His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party.<br/>His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. <br/>In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.<br/>Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a \"career psychopath\".<br/>When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. <br/>However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. <br/>Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.<br/>He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into \"the status of a colony\". <br/>When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job.<br/>He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May.<br/>In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.<br/>After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to \"Get Brexit Done\", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide.<br/>The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall.<br/>His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. <br/>It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted \"it could have gone either way\".<br/>As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic.<br/>He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world.<br/>But his political problems were mounting up.<br/>In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street.<br/>Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. <br/>Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.<br/>Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.<br/>Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.<br/>The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. <br/>He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.<br/>The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.<br/>A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to \"get on with the job\" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.<br/>He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership.<br/>He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. <br/>But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party.<br/>He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards.<br/>But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict.<br/>Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills.<br/>But the road back looks like a long and steep one.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

should pay back the public money used to cover a \u00a3245,000 bill for his lawyers during the Partygate inquiry, opposition MPs say.<br/>An inquiry by MPs found the former prime minister had deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties.<br/>The top lawyers defending Mr Johnson were paid for with taxpayer funds.<br/>Labour says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should demand Mr Johnson \"pays back every penny\" of public money used to fund his legal defence.<br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Mr Sunak should not have \"propped him up as long as he has\".<br/>Ms Rayner said the British public should not be made to pay for Mr Johnson's lawyers because he \"hasn't got a defence\", adding \"he's bang to rights\".<br/>Mr Johnson's spokesperson has been contacted for a comment.<br/>The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to \"do the decent thing and force Johnson to pay the bill himself\".<br/>\"It's frankly unbelievable that hardworking taxpayers are being left to foot the bill for Boris Johnson's shameful antics,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said.<br/>The SNP's leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: \"The legal costs, which the public have paid for, need to be recouped from Mr Johnson.\"<br/>The inquiry by the Privileges Committee was launched last April, after opposition parties accused Mr Johnson of misleading MPs about gatherings in government buildings during Covid-19 lockdowns.<br/>In an unprecedented decision, the committee found Mr Johnson had committed repeated contempts of Parliament with his Partygate denials.<br/>In its conclusions, the committee said criticisms of the inquiry in opinions submitted by Mr Johnson's legal advisers were \"without merit\".<br/>Mr Johnson said the inquiry amounted to a \"political assassination\", and branded the committee's findings \"deranged\".<br/>The Cabinet Office made the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs for the inquiry last year, when he was still prime minister.<br/>The government has sought to justify the decision by claiming there is a precedent for supporting former ministers with legal representation.<br/>But the government has not been able to name a single example of a former minister receiving taxpayer-funded legal support for a parliamentary inquiry.<br/>The BBC has spoken to two former ministers who were investigated by MPs for misleading Parliament and were not given legal support.<br/>The former Labour MP and transport secretary, Stephen Byers, was not offered legal support when he faced a four-month inquiry in 2005.<br/>Nor was the former Labour MP and paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, who was found to have \"inadvertently\" misled MPs in 2001.<br/>In a response to a parliamentary question this week, Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin defended the decision to pay Mr Johnson's legal costs.<br/>He said the principle \"can also be applied to parliamentary inquiries, where it relates to one's conduct as minister of the Crown\".<br/>But Mr Quin provided no examples of former ministers having their legal bills covered for parliamentary inquiries.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>The MP who submitted the question, Labour's Karl Turner, said that the Cabinet Office had \"created a precedent\" with the decision to fund Mr Johnson's legal defence.<br/>This meant there was now a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers receive legal support to fight parliamentary inquiries, and backbench MPs do not, he added.<br/>\"We cannot have a system that unfairly advantages one member as against another member, in terms of having their excessively large legal bills covered by the taxpayer,\" Mr Turner said.<br/>\"Mr Johnson is a multi-millionaire if he wants to instruct the country's leading public lawyers and solicitors then let him pay for it.\"<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr

Why was that so important when people were dying of Covid and burying their loved ones?<br/>\"He was in a leaving event for 25 minutes. It took less than three minutes for them to switch off the ventilator for my dad when he died.\"<br/>He added: \"I think for bereaved families... we all followed the rules.

We couldn't hug her.

This punishment is absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness.\"<br/>Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he was \"appalled\", adding, \"I'm backing fairness and justice - not kangaroo courts.\"<br/>Meanwhile, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg - also given a knighthood in the resignation honours last week - described the report as \"fundamentally flawed\". <br/>Nadine Dorries, who has said she plans to stand down as a Conservative MP, tweeted that the report had \"overreached\".<br/>Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said Mr Johnson had \"made his decision, he made the decision to resign\" after he saw the report last week, and added: \"Boris has achieved an awful lot.\"<br/>But senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said he hoped the report would allow MPs to move on from the \"public pantomime\".<br/>Former attorney-general and Conservative MP Dominic Grieve dismissed any suggestions the committee \"had it in\" for the former primer minister.<br/>The sanctions recommended by the committee were \"a result of his own actions,\" he said, adding: \"The history of his lying is just epic.\"<br/>Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Boris Johnson was \"not only a lawbreaker, but a liar\". <br/>\"He's not fit for public office.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one. All MPs will vote on the suggested sanction next week. <br/>He will also remain a member of the Privy Council, the body that meets around once a month to get the monarch's formal approval for government orders approved by ministers.<br/>There are several hundred privy councillors, although only current members of the government are involved in day-to-day business.<br/>All cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, are appointed for life.<br/>The only prime minister to have been removed from the list of privy councillors was short-lived premier William Cavendish, who was struck off by King George III when he suspected him of plotting against him. <br/>What happens for Boris Johnson now he's resigned?<br/>Calls for Truss not to take yearly \u00a3115,000 as ex-PM<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

but were outvoted.<br/>Expulsion is extremely rare in Parliament's history, having occurred only three times in the last hundred years or so.<br/>But suspending him is no longer an option, given that he's already stood down as an MP in his blistering resignation statement last week.<br/>However, the report says that now, given what he's said about the committee, they would have recommended a ban of 90 days - an extremely long ban by the standards of recent years. <br/>And it says he should not get a parliamentary pass, which former MPs would normally be able to apply for. <br/>Perhaps the greatest punishment in the report, ultimately, will be the damage it does to his reputation among Conservative MPs -

And, like the greatest art, her work was simple and uncluttered.\"<br/>In its tribute, the RSC described her as \"a tour de force in acting and politics, dedicating her life to both\".<br/>The company added: \"We're proud her extraordinary talent was seen on RSC stages early in her career in ground-breaking productions.\"<br/>Jackson played Elizabeth I in BBC drama Elizabeth R - another role she famously revisited - winning Emmys for both Elizabeth R and also playing the queen opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave in 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots.<br/>Further Oscar nominations came her way for portraying a frustrated office worker in a love triangle in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday, and for taking the title role in 1975's Hedda, adapted from Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler.<br/>Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote a biography of Jackson in 1999, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"She had such versatility.<br/>\"It's the quality of the work, and the variety. Her voice could go to gravel to caramel in three seconds.\"<br/>Former Labour MP Baronness Hoey told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When she came into Parliament, she was so modest. She never wanted to be reminded that she was an actress.\"<br/>Other credits included playing English poet Stevie Smith in Stevie, and as Hollywood icon Patricia Neal in The Patricia Neal Story.<br/>A staunch Labour supporter, she was approached to stand for Parliament - and said she agreed because she disliked former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the \"destruction that her policies has had on human beings\".<br/>There was a link between acting and politics, she said.<br/>\"The best theatre is about trying to find and tell the truth,\" she told Desert Island Discs. \"It's not about covering up. It's not about playing games. It's not about hiding. It's not about pretending you're something you're not.<br/>\"It's trying to find what it is to be a human being and why we behave towards each other in the ways that we do.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn.

However that's to overlook we will have our full cohort of decision makers later this year. They will be trained up and fully proficient.\"<br/>At the start of May, there were 1,280 Home Office staff working on asylum decision making, a big increase on a year previously, although a slight fall from the number employed at the start of 2023. <br/>The committee also heard from a senior Home Office official, Dan Hobbs, who confirmed that the proportion of asylum decision makers who leave their jobs each year stood at 28%.<br/>The government has also introduced a streamlined process for asylum claims from nationals of five countries with the highest asylum acceptance rates.<br/>Questioned by MPs, Ms Braverman also conceded conceded that women trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation could be deported under new measures to tackle illegal migration.<br/>The home secretary said women could receive protection if there was \"compelling evidence for their reasonable grounds\" or if \"they are part of a police investigation\".<br/>She was also asked by the SNP's Alison Thewliss about the disappearance of 154 asylum seeker children from temporary hotel accommodation. <br/>Ms Braverman said missing persons cases were a matter for the police, but confirmed there were no longer any unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021.

Paigon is slang for enemy. The song is explicit and listener discretion is advised.<br/>In the past, HMRC has closed its telephone line when it could not cope with demand, a public accounts committee report has said. <br/>In the past five years the number of customer service staff has reduced from 25,500 to 19,500 as HMRC has moved more customers to digital systems. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"Our online services, including the HMRC app, are quick and easy to use and have been significantly improved.\"<br/>While the helpline is closed, taxpayers will be redirected to a digital assistant and online guidance. HMRC have said this change will free up 350 advisers to take urgent calls on other lines and answer customer correspondence. <br/>Jonathan Eida, of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be furious to learn that HMRC's self-assessment phone will be off the hook for months this year. <br/>\"Workers trying to do the right thing require assistance all year around, and for many people going online presents a number of challenges. <br/>\"HMRC should reverse this decision and pick up the phone this summer.\"   <br/>You must fill in a self-assessment tax return if in the last tax year you were self-employed as a \"sole trader\" and earned more than \u00a31,000, if you in a business partnership or if you earned \u00a3100,000 or more. <br/>Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said: \"Given the potentially significant impact closing the self-assessment helpline may have on taxpayers, we're looking for clarification that HMRC has fully considered the costs and benefits of this decision. <br/>\"There are also concerns around the short notice with which this was announced. HMRC must be open, upfront and transparent when making decisions which could impact so many individuals.\" <br/>Ms Baldwin has written to HMRC to ask about the impact the closure will have on taxpayers and whether an analysis and consultation has taken place. <br/>She also wants to know if the helpline will be reopened earlier than planned if the negative impact on taxpayers is greater than expected. <br/>Ms Baldwin also asks if the closure of the helpline is related to HMRC's homeworking policy or staffing issues, as well as for information on the procedures in place to assist vulnerable taxpayers and those unable to use digital services. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"We continually review our services and a seasonal [self-assessment] helpline will make more of our expert advisers available to respond to the most urgent queries over the summer.\"<br/>The self-assessment helpline receives far fewer calls over the summer, with calls around 50% higher between January and April compared with June to August according to HMRC.<br/>HMRC also previously announced a decision to close its VAT registration helpline from Monday 22 May. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

A representative of the guru was also present at the event.<br/>Nithyananda fled India in 2019 while facing multiple criminal charges, including rape and sexual assault. <br/>He has since claimed to have founded a new country, known as the \"Republic of Kailaasa\", on an island off the coast of Ecuador. <br/>Nithyananda has denied the accusations against him.<br/>In December last year, Lord Ranger, a businessman who has donated tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party over the past decade, told The Observer he had no knowledge of Nithyananda or his organisation.<br/>Had he known about the guru, he would not have attended the event, he told the newspaper. <br/>Standards Commissioner Akbar Khan said in his report that Lord Ranger had abused his position as a member of the House of Lords in his social media feud with Ms Joshi.<br/>\"He was acutely aware of this imbalance of power and abused it by persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating Ms Joshi,\" said Mr Khan. <br/>\"Examples of this included his frequent disparaging remarks including 'Who is asking you? Who has given you the authority to insult others who do not appease you? You are showing your poor upbringing by bullying'.\" <br/>But, the commissioner found, Ms Joshi had \"also publicly made potentially damaging allegations about Lord Ranger\".<br/>\"Both Lord Ranger and Ms Joshi sought to undermine one another by issuing inflammatory tweets and sought to involve their family members in their dispute,\" the report said.<br/>\"Ms Joshi claimed that her social media activity was intended to hold Lord Ranger 'to account' but there were occasions where it appeared that her tweets were intended to insult or ridicule him.\"<br/>The commissioner rejected Ms Joshi's complaint that Lord Ranger had also broken the rules relating to the use of Lords facilities by charging uninvited guests at the Diwali event up to \u00a320 to cover costs.<br/>In conclusion, Mr Khan said there had been \"fault on both sides\" in this case. <br/>He said Lord Ranger would normally have been facing a short suspension from the Lords over his conduct, but in light of the \"significant provocation by Ms Joshi\" a public apology and behaviour training \"constituted an appropriate outcome\".<br/>In a statement, Lord Ranger said: \"The commissioner has found my behaviour fell short of the high standards I expect of myself, and which others expect of me as a sitting member of the House of Lords. I have expressed my remorse and I apologise to Ms Joshi.<br/>\"The investigation process and reading and reflecting on the report has had a profound and lasting effect on me.

In response, Mr Johnson accused Mr Sunak of \"talking rubbish\".<br/>The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours.<br/>The House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) said it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations. However, there has been no confirmation of who the nominees were and why they were not included on the list.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said HOLAC did not support the peerage nominations of the MPs put forward by Mr Johnson.<br/>The spokesperson added: \"It is unprecedented for a sitting prime minister to invite HOLAC to reconsider the vetting of individual nominees on a former prime minister's resignation list.\"<br/>But Ms Dorries said Mr Sunak's team \"had made sure that certain names would not be on\" the list sent to HOLAC.

It makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\"<br/>Labour MP Stella Creasy also called for urgent reform, telling BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I don't understand in whose interests this case was.\"<br/>Madeline Page, director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students, described the case as a \"sad situation\" and said she would welcome a parliamentary debate.<br/>The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which opposes abortion, criticised providers for \"pushing for dangerous home abortions,\" and said women such as Foster were \"left to self-administer these drugs alone with no medical supervision or support.\"<br/>But providers say the most common side-effects of at-home abortions are \"usually easy to treat\", and \"rarely have any long-term health effects\". <br/>The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is one of 30 campaign and health groups calling for the law to be repealed to decriminalise women seeking to end their own pregnancies.<br/>BPAS chief executive Clare Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are now seeing a mother-of-three prosecuted under laws that do not exist in the same way in any other country.\"<br/>She said \"a growing number of women\" were coming under police investigation over suspected illegal abortions, with another woman facing trial later this year. <br/>A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said cases such as that of Carla Foster were \"exceptionally rare... complex and traumatic\".<br/>They added: \"Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\"<br/>Downing Street said it recognised that abortion was \"a highly emotive issue and there is a strength of feeling on all sides,\" but \"the law is clearly set out.\"<br/>\"It's up to the police and the judiciary to enforce it,\" the spokesperson added. <br/>Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs select committee, called for the government to decriminalise abortion.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Removing the criminal law is a very sensible, reasonable step, but it's not to deregulate abortion care and who can provide it.\"<br/>The CPS argued in court that Foster had been aware of abortion limits and had provided false information during a remote medical consultation. <br/>Her defence said lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare, adding: \"This will haunt her forever.\" <br/>Foster went into labour on 11 May 2020 and the baby was confirmed dead 45 minutes later. <br/>The 44-year-old from Staffordshire had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby, the court heard.<br/>Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall accepted she had been \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.<br/>He said she was a good mother to her three sons, one of whom has special needs, and that a suspended sentence might have been possible if there had been an earlier guilty plea.<br/>But he rejected appeals from women's health organisations to pass a non-custodial sentence, saying it was the court's duty to \"apply the law as provided by Parliament\".<br/>Ahead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.<br/>The judge told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".<br/>But he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\".<br/>Mother jailed for taking abortion pills too late<br/>Abortion rise 'may be driven by cost of living'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This by convention is something peers virtually never do. <br/>She said she had thought long and hard before putting her motion, but she said: \"We threw this out and they're bringing it back in a sneaky way - and quite honestly it's breaking all the rules.\" <br/>Lord Jackson retorted that the Lords would be in danger of \"legislative over-reach\" if it believed it knew better than the elected Commons - their role was to revise legislation, not strike it down. <br/>For the opposition parties to defeat the government in the Lords, they need Labour on board, and Baroness Jones hopes they will allow their peers at least a free vote. <br/>But Labour shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker says his party is not prepared to break the normal conventions of the Lords to defeat the changes.<br/>\"We certainly aren't going to vote to kill it.

What we wouldn't want to see is people unfairly traducing the work of a legitimate committee.\" <br/>Members of the Privileges Committee have been offered additional security, the BBC's Chris Mason says.<br/>Our political editor says there is widespread anger among the MPs' colleagues - from many political parties - that the tenor, tone and language of some of the criticisms of the committee, from Mr Johnson and others, has contributed to an atmosphere where committee members feel vulnerable. <br/>He says there is additional irritation that, some believe, the integrity of committee members has been impugned without them being able to respond to it publicly. <br/>In addition to reaching a conclusion on Mr Johnson, it is also expected that the report will reflect on the conduct of others in Parliament in how they have described the committee during its work, but without naming them. <br/>Mr Johnson stood down from Parliament just hours after Downing Street published his resignation honours list without the names of key supporters, including Nadine Dorries, Sir Alok Sharma and Nigel Adams.<br/>All three had been expecting to be appointed to the House of Lords.<br/>Competing claims about how and why the names were removed are now at the heart of a rift within the Tory party following the former PM's resignation.<br/>The House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) - the official body for checking and vetting new peers - has confirmed it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations on the grounds of propriety.<br/>On Monday, Mr Gove defended the decision to pass Mr Johnson's honours list to the King before the Privileges Committee report was published, insisting this was a \"separate procedure\".<br/>Within 24 hours of the list being published, both Ms Dorries and Mr Adams resigned as MPs - triggering by-elections in their constituencies, both of which are considered safe seats for the Conservatives.<br/>Mr Johnson's resignation also triggers a by-election in his marginal constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>Headlines about ex-leaders make governing tougher<br/>Country doesn't miss Johnson drama, says Shapps<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Why did Boris Johnson resign?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But using an external agency to resolve workplace issues is not difficult. <br/>\"Neither Parliament nor the whips' offices are equipped to do it. This is highly specialised stuff.\" <br/>She said whips could remove the whip from MPs, but \"that's a political party decision\".<br/>\"The whips shouldn't be enacting sanctions as part of the complaints process. It may be considered prudent by a political party to withdraw the whip pending an investigation.\" <br/>Current MPs have also raised concerns about a lack of \"HR professionals\" to deal with cases like this. <br/>One Conservative MP said: \"Where does the buck stop? The whips, the police, the Speaker, there's also the parties. I don't see that there is any formal coming together of those.\" <br/>Parties often \"live in fear of someone saying: 'why didn't you take action?' That's where the judgement comes,\" they added.   <br/>This MP said that, while they still wanted a say in who their staff were, \"I do think there's a benefit in more HR support for MPs - I'm not an HR expert.\" <br/>They compared MPs employing their own staff with Parliament \"dealing in effect with 650 small businesses\".  <br/>Another former chief whip the BBC spoke to echoed the argument for \"external supervision\", saying the role of the whips was to \"look after their flock, not to sit in judgement of them\", and to persuade them to vote with their party the \"right\" way. <br/>On Monday, MPs will debate proposals to bar some MPs under criminal investigation for violent or sexual offences from setting foot in Parliament. <br/>The proposals have been drawn up by the House of Commons Commission, a body of senior MPs which oversees the working of the Commons, following a consultation.<br/>If approved, the plans could allow MPs or peers to be barred from the Houses of Parliament if they are deemed to pose a risk.<br/>The exclusion would apply to the parliamentary estate in Westminster and any parliamentary-funded travel.<br/>MPs are being asked to have their say on the plans, but a formal vote has yet to be arranged. <br/>The Commission has proposed that if the parliamentary authorities were presented with credible allegations of a sexual or violent offence by the police at any point in the criminal justice process, a staff panel would assess the claims.<br/>If the panel undertook a full risk assessment on the basis of information provided by the police, it would consider the nature of the alleged misconduct and whether there were any safeguarding concerns.<br/>If this led to exclusion being recommended, this would be put to an adjudication panel for a decision.<br/>Under the proposals, excluded members would get a proxy vote so their constituents were not disadvantaged.<br/>The BBC has been told there is some disagreement on the plans - with a number of MPs arguing members should not be excluded unless they are charged by police, and others arguing that the threshold for exclusion should be lower. <br/>One former chief whip said excluding people who had not been charged flew \"against natural justice\".<br/>\"Allegations can be made against members of parliament that may be false, and they may be made in a vexatious way.\" <br/>Ms Milton said she believed Parliament should be able to vote on excluding MPs from the Commons, because it was \"quite a serious issue democratically\". <br/>\"Their [MPs'] job is to hold the government to account. If you're going to withdraw an MP's ability to do this on behalf of their constituents. that's serious enough for the whole House to make a decision.\" <br/>Alleged sex offence MPs could face Parliament ban<br/>Plans to curb Westminster abuse incoherent - Casey<br/>Plan to keep sex charge MPs away from Parliament<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I'll treat her in the same way I've treated, for example, Colin Beattie.<br/>\"Those that have been released without charge I see no reason to suspend their membership.\"<br/>Mr Beattie, the SNP MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, resigned as SNP treasurer following his arrest. <br/>Mr Murrell had quit as chief executive in March after taking responsibility for misleading the media about party membership numbers.<br/>Earlier SNP MSPs Ash Regan and Michelle Thomson urged Ms Sturgeon to quit the party while the police investigation continues. <br/>Angus MacNeil, the SNP MP, said there should be \"political distance\" between the SNP and its former leader.<br/>Asked if his predecessor should resign the whip, Mr Yousaf said: \"There's no pressure on her to do so from the party or from me as leader of the SNP.\"<br/>He added: \"She has been released without charge and I think it is so important that presumption of innocence is upheld.\"<br/>Opposition party MSPs have joined calls for Ms Sturgeon to be suspended, with Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross saying the SNP to \"follow their own precedent\". <br/>And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: \"If you look at previous incidents in the SNP normally people in that position have been suspended.

And maybe Lord Speakers past and present will weigh in. <br/>Many peers have identified patronage in appointments to the Lords as the main reputational threat to their chamber. <br/>All this will be superimposed on an otherwise low-key parliamentary agenda - it's been getting embarrassing; last week saw the Lords sit until 04:16 on Thursday morning debating the Illegal Migration Bill, while the Commons ran out of steam on Tuesday at 14:20. <br/>Peers are debating late into the night; MPs are home in time for Hollyoaks. There may be efforts to avoid the unbearable lightness of last week's Commons business in the week ahead, but the causes remain the same - a surfeit of detailed legislation inching through the Upper House, while MPs twiddle their thumbs on the green benches of the Commons.<br/>On the committee corridor, watch out for the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman's appearance before Home Affairs on Wednesday - but as has been the recent trend, the real action is in the Lords, where peers have continued to defeat the government on a variety of issues and continue to battle the Commons over the Retained EU Law Bill.<br/>But while they regularly push back on the content of bills, Labour inhibitions about voting down secondary legislation make it highly unlikely that Green Party peer Jenny Jones's attempt to strike down an order which would give the police greater power to control or ban protest marches will have the numbers to succeed.<br/>Commons (14:30): Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following.<br/>Main debate: Motion to approve a statutory instrument, the Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023. This is a highly controversial measure to rewrite what constitutes serious disruption, with the aim of giving clearer legal underpinning for the police to ban or restrict protests.<br/>That's followed by a general debate on proposed new rules for risk-based exclusion of MPs who have been accused of sexual misconduct or violent offences. This is a tough issue where the constitutional rights of MPs to attend Parliament are balanced against the safeguarding concerns of the thousands of people who work on the parliamentary estate, and many MPs are worried that the new system would make excluding them from parliament the option of first resort, as soon as there was a live accusation.<br/>The expectation had been that there would be a vote to approve proposals from the House of Commons Commission, the Commons administrative arm, but, tellingly, there will not now be a vote. The Commons Leader, Penny Morduant has, however, said she expects their will be a vote before the Summer recess. Watch out for pressure to rewrite the proposals.<br/>MPs also respond to the latest Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law Bill. This bill is now bouncing between the two Houses, and peers have pinged back new clauses requiring that EU regulations rewritten by ministers must be put before Parliament, with the possibility of debate and amendment in both Houses, and that such regulations must not reduce environmental protections and must not conflict with the UK's international agreements. Expect a few rounds more of ping pong between the Commons and the Lords.<br/>Westminster Hall: Petitions Committee debate (16:30) on two petitions taking opposite views on the legal definition of sex - the first, e-petition 623243 calls on the government to update the Equality Act to make clear the characteristic \"sex\" is biological sex and not \"sex as modified by a Gender Recognition Certificate\". This petition attracted 109,463 signatures.<br/>The second, e-petition 627984 says the government should commit to NOT amending the Equality Act's definition of sex, arguing that ministers had previously committed to not remove legal protections for trans people, an already marginalised group, but this change would do so. The petition attracted 138,886 signatures<br/>Committees: Foreign Affairs (16:00) questions Foreign Secretary James Cleverly on UK relations in the Indo-Pacific region. There will be more general questions, too.<br/>Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16:00) holds the first evidence session of its inquiry into the finances and sustainability of the social housing sector in England, with evidence from the National Housing Federation and housing associations, plus academic experts.<br/>Lords (14:30): It's day four of committee scrutiny on the Illegal Migration Bill , with another late night in prospect. Remember, this is the preliminary phase of detailed debate - attempts to amend the bill follow at the later report stage, in July.<br/>Commons (11:30): Foreign Office Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill in which Conservative Richard Graham proposes a measure against spiking drinks with alcohol or drugs.<br/>Main debate: MPs polish off the Procurement Bill - watch out for a joint amendment proposed by former anti-corruption Czar John Penrose and Public Accounts Committee Chair, Dame Meg Hillier, to require all government contracts to specify the policy objective they seek to meet, so future contracts can be judged by results.<br/>Westminster Hall: Conservative Richard Fuller leads a debate (14:30) on the proposed Bedford to Cambridge rail link - one facet of the wider development controversies between Oxford and Cambridge. Could be lively.<br/>Committees: Business and Trade (10:00) hear from CBI chief Rain Newton-Smith on the aftershocks of its recent scandals.   <br/>Culture Media and Sport (10:00) quiz BBC Director General Tim Davie on issues including overall performance, impartiality, commercial activities, equal pay, safeguarding and the licence fee. MPs will also discuss the internal review of former Chair Richard Sharp and the appointment process for a new chair.<br/>Education (10:00) holds a one-off session with Ofsted's Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman covering children's social care and safeguarding.<br/>Lords (14:30): Day three of report consideration of the Financial Services and Markets Bill - watch out for amendments financial products which link to deforestation, and on reviewing pension funds potential to fuel economic growth - a policy option flagged up by Labour.<br/>Then there's the ultra-contentious Draft Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023 - new regulations, which will give the police clearer powers to stop slow-walking protest marches blocking roads and bringing cities to a halt.<br/>Labour have a regret motion from Lord Coaker complaining about both the content and the process - while the Greens' Baroness Jones will propose a rare \"fatal motion\" which would kill the order. She looks unlikely to succeed, given that Labour will not support her, and without the biggest Opposition Party, the numbers don't stack up.<br/>Commons (11:30): Science Innovation and Technology questions, followed, at noon, by Prime Minister's Question Time.<br/>Ten Minute Rule Bill: Labour's Emma Lewell Buck wants to ensure families eligible for the Healthy Start Scheme, which provides help to buy food and milk for low income parents, are registered to receive it.<br/>Main debate: A half day debate on an SNP motion to be announced (they usually come up with some cunning device to ensure that the government has to actually vote against their motion, rather than ignore it). That's followed by a general debate on defence policy - including Ukraine and Nato.<br/>Westminster Hall: Labour's Rebecca Long-Baily leads a debate on insolvency law and director disqualifications (14:30).<br/>Committees: Home Affairs (09:45) questions Home Secretary Suella Braverman on issues including asylum and immigration, policing, Windrush, violence against women and girls, fraud strategy and the Passport Office. <br/>Culture Media and Sport (10:00) plunges into the Phillip Schofield controversy with ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall facing questions on the broadcaster's approach to safeguarding and complaint handling.<br/>Lords (15:00): Another long committee stage day on the Illegal Migration Bill beckons; this is supposed to be the final one. Bring a toothbrush.<br/>Commons (09:30): Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed mini question times for the MPs who represent the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission, the Parliamentary Restoration and Renewal Client Board, and the Electoral Commission.<br/>Finally, there's the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House.<br/>Main debate: Dame Angela Eagle and Elliot Colburn lead a backbench debate on Pride Month - this is now an annual event and will cover such subjects as conversion therapy, and the lack of a bill to ban it; hate crime and the government's review into relationship and sex education.<br/>That's followed by another backbench debate, on government policies on migration - led by Dan Carden, Sir Peter Bottomley and Tim Loughton, who say a broad debate is urgently needed to address numerous outstanding issues on migration policy.<br/>Westminster Hall: Debates on the Scottish Affairs Committee report on public broadcasting in Scotland, led by Committee Chair Pete Wishart (13:30), and then on VAT on audiobooks - Conservative Sir Mike Penning wants VAT removed on audiobooks, to bring them into line with the zero-rating of paper books. He argues that charging VAT penalises blind and partially sighted people.<br/>Committees: Public Accounts (10:00) question senior officials on the effort to get to net zero by 2050.<br/>Lords (11:00): Debate on the performance of the NHS and health service innovation; on support for freelancers in the arts and creative industries and on local government in England.<br/>The Commons is not sitting.<br/>Lords (10:00): Peers will whiz through the third reading rubber-stamping of a series of private members' bills (laws proposed by individual MPs) sent over from the Commons - the Shark Fins Bill, the Co-operatives, Mutuals and Friendly Societies Bill , the Child Support Collection (Domestic Abuse) Bill, the Offenders (Day of Release from Detention) Bill, and the Supported Housing (Regulatory Oversight) Bill.<br/>This is their final parliamentary stage and they will shortly become law.<br/>Also up for third reading - the Ofcom (Duty Regarding Prevention of Serious Self-harm and Suicide) Bill and the Coroners (Determination of Suicide) Bill. Although they will clear their Lords process, they will not be debated in the Commons.<br/>Then it's back to more private members' bills from MPs - with second reading (initial) debates on the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, the Powers of Attorney Bill, the Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Bill and the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Bill.<br/>Also up for debate, but again with no real chance of becoming law, the Public Advocate Bill (from Labour's Lord Wills).<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania.

the official body for checking and vetting new peers - has confirmed it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations on the grounds of propriety.<br/>Pressed on whether Mr Sunak's team had taken names off the list months before the nominations were sent to HOLAC, Mr Shapps said: \"As far as I'm aware that is not true.\"<br/>The spat might look grubby from the outside - but some of Mr Johnson's allies have no desire to let this lie.  <br/>Within 24-hours of the list being published both Ms Dorries and Mr Adams resigned as MPs - triggering by-elections in their constituencies, both of which are considered safe seats for the Conservatives.<br/>Mr Johnson's resignation also triggers a by-election in his marginal constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>This hat-trick of by-elections have the potential to create major problems for Mr Sunak at a time when the Conservatives are trailing Labour by an average of 15 points in national polls.<br/>Pressed on whether Mr Johnson had been the victim of a witch hunt, Mr Shapps said: \"I don't think that's true.\"<br/>\"Boris himself has decided to step down -

Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\"<br/>It was a direct aim at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - hours after he stepped off a plane from Washington where Mr Sunak was not talking about a free trade agreement with the US. <br/>And Mr Johnson's statement was an attempt to rally Brexiteers in his party, suggesting his demise was driven by a motivation to \"reverse the 2016 referendum result\".<br/>The statement contained further criticism of former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who investigated lockdown gatherings at Number 10. <br/>\"I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence\" that she will soon become \"chief of staff designate\" of the Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer, Mr Johnson wrote.<br/>Ending his 1,000-word letter, Mr Johnson said he was \"very sad to be leaving Parliament\" before adding - \"at least for now\" - for anyone thinking he is about to retreat into obscurity. <br/>Mr Johnson's exit will trigger a by-election in his west London seat, which he held with a 7,000 vote majority in the 2019 election. <br/>The Conservatives will also have to defend the Mid Bedfordshire seat of Nadine Dorries - a close ally of Mr Johnson - after she stepped down as an MP earlier on Friday.<br/>Mr Johnson's dramatic move came after he was given the committee's findings, including details of criticisms it intended to make and evidence to support its conclusion. <br/>He had faced a potential by-election if MPs recommended a suspension from the Commons as a punishment for misleading Parliament. <br/>Responding to his statement, a Privileges Committee spokesperson said: \"The committee has followed the procedures and the mandate of the House at all times and will continue to do so.<br/>\"Mr Johnson has departed from the processes of the House and has impugned the integrity of the House by his statement. The committee will meet on Monday to conclude the inquiry and to publish its report promptly.\"<br/>Elsewhere, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner condemned what she called a \"never-ending Tory soap opera\".<br/>For the Liberal Democrats, deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Good riddance.\"<br/>And SNP deputy Westminster leader Mhairi Black said Mr Johnson \"jumped before he was pushed\", adding \"no-one in Scotland will be sorry to see the back of him\". <br/>However, former home secretary Priti Patel, who was made a Dame in his resignations honours list also announced on Friday, praised Mr Johnson for his work as prime minister on the issues of Ukraine and Brexit, describing him as \"a political titan\". <br/>Boris Johnson's local Conservative association chairman, Richard Mills, said the former PM \"has delivered on his promises to local residents\".<br/>Another sitting MP announced in the resignation honours list, Sir Michael Fabricant, criticised the Privileges Committee for what he called its \"disgraceful treatment\" of the former prime minister. <br/>Mr Johnson was prime minister from July 2019 until September 2022, and has been an MP since 2001 - although not continuously, having served as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. <br/>The ghost of Boris Johnson haunts Rishi Sunak<br/>Boris Johnson: Resignation statement in full<br/>Patel and Rees-Mogg rewarded in Johnson honours list<br/>I misled MPs but not intentionally, says Johnson<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I take my responsibilities seriously. I did not lie, and I believe that in their hearts, the Committee know it.\u00a0But they have wilfully chosen to ignore the truth, because from the outset, their purpose has not been to discover the truth, or genuinely to understand what was in my mind when I spoke in the Commons.\u00a0<br/>Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\u00a0This is the very definition of a kangaroo court.\u00a0<br/>Most members of the Committee - especially the chair - had already expressed deeply prejudicial remarks about my guilt before they had even seen the evidence. They should have recused themselves.\u00a0<br/>In retrospect, it was na\u00efve and trusting of me to think that these proceedings could be remotely useful or fair. But I was determined to believe in the system, and in justice, and to vindicate what I knew to be the truth. <br/>It was the same faith in the impartiality of our systems that led me to commission Sue Gray. It is clear that my faith has been misplaced.\u00a0Of course, it suits the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to do whatever they can to remove me from Parliament.\u00a0 <br/>Sadly, as we saw in July last year, there are currently some Tory MPs who share that view.\u00a0I am not alone in thinking that there is a witch hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result.\u00a0<br/>My removal is the necessary first step, and I believe there has been a concerted attempt to bring it about.\u00a0I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence that Sue Gray - who investigated gatherings in Number 10 - is now the chief of staff designate of the Labour leader.\u00a0<br/>Nor do I believe that it is any coincidence that her supposedly impartial chief counsel, Daniel Stilitz KC, turned out to be a strong Labour supporter who repeatedly tweeted personal\u00a0attacks on me and the government.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>When I left office last year, the government was only a handful of points behind in the polls.\u00a0That gap has now massively widened.\u00a0<br/>Just a few years after winning the biggest majority in almost half a century, that majority is now clearly at risk.\u00a0<br/>Our party needs urgently to recapture its sense of momentum and its belief in what this country can do.\u00a0<br/>We need to show how we are making the most of Brexit and we need in the next months to be setting out a pro-growth and pro-investment agenda. We need to cut business and personal taxes - and not just as pre-election gimmicks - rather than endlessly putting them up.\u00a0<br/>We must not be afraid to be a properly Conservative government.\u00a0<br/>Why have we so passively abandoned the prospect of a Free Trade Deal with the US? Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\u00a0<br/>We need to deliver on the 2019 manifesto, which was endorsed by 14 million people.\u00a0We should remember that more than 17 million voted for Brexit.\u00a0<br/>I am now being forced out of Parliament by a tiny handful of people, with no evidence to back up their assertions, and without the approval even of Conservative party members, let alone the wider electorate. <br/>I believe that a dangerous and unsettling precedent is being set.\u00a0<br/>The Conservative Party\u00a0has the time to recover its mojo and its ambition and to win the next election.\u00a0I had looked forward to providing enthusiastic support as a backbench MP. Harriet Harman's committee has set out to make that objective completely untenable. <br/>The Committee's report is riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice, but under their absurd and unjust process, I have no formal ability to challenge anything they say.\u00a0<br/>The Privileges Committee is there to protect the privileges of Parliament. That is a very important job. They should not be using their powers - which have only been very recently designed - to mount what is plainly a political hit job on someone they oppose.\u00a0<br/>It is in no one's interest, however, that the process the Committee has launched should continue for a single day further.\u00a0<br/>So I have today written to my Association in Uxbridge and South Ruislip to say that I am stepping down forthwith\u00a0and triggering an immediate by-election.\u00a0<br/>I am very sorry to leave my wonderful constituency.\u00a0It has been a huge honour to serve them, both as Mayor and MP. <br/>But I am proud that after what is cumulatively a 15-year stint, I have helped to deliver, among other things, a vast new railway in the Elizabeth Line and full funding for a wonderful new state of the art hospital for Hillingdon, where enabling works have already begun.\u00a0<br/>I also remain hugely proud of all that we achieved in my time in office as\u00a0prime minister: getting Brexit done, winning the biggest majority for 40 years and delivering the fastest vaccine roll out of any major European country, as well as leading global support for Ukraine.\u00a0<br/>It is very sad to be leaving Parliament - at least for now - but above all, I am bewildered and appalled that I can be forced out, anti-democratically, by a committee chaired and managed, by Harriet Harman, with such egregious bias.<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But there will now be one in Mr Johnson's own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>Former Conservative minister Nadine Dorries was not put forward for the House of Lords, despite speculation she would be on the published list.<br/>Ms Dorries - who served as culture secretary under Mr Johnson - stood down as an MP \"with immediate effect\" just over an hour before the honours list was released.<br/>The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours. <br/>The long-awaited list, approved nine months after Mr Johnson resigned as prime minister, included 38 honours and seven peerages. <br/>Kulveer Singh Ranger, a former director of transport while Mr Johnson was London mayor, and former Downing Street chief of staff Dan Rosenfield are also among those who will enter the Lords.<br/>Charlotte Owen, a former adviser to Mr Johnson, will become one of the youngest peers, as will fellow advisers Ben Gascoigne and Ross Kempsell.<br/>Honours were handed out to some of Mr Johnson's closest advisers during his premiership, including former directors of communications Jack Doyle and Guto Harri, who were both made CBEs.<br/>Also among recipients were aides who served with Mr Johnson during the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Martin Reynolds, Mr Johnson's former principal private secretary, was awarded the Order of Bath.<br/>In May 2020, Mr Reynolds sent an invite to a \"bring your own booze\" party to Downing Street staff when the nation was under lockdown.<br/>Ben Elliot, the former co-chair of the Conservative Party, has also been awarded a knighthood, as have Tory MPs Michael Fabricant and Conor Burns, two Mr Johnson loyalists.<br/>The first name on the list was Tory MP and long-standing Brexit backer Bill Cash, who has become a companion of honour. <br/>Membership is a special award granted to those \"who have made a major contribution to the arts, science, medicine, or government\" and it is only held by up to 65 people at any one time.<br/>Rishi Sunak has approved Mr Johnson's resignation honours list and \"forwarded it unamended\" to King Charles, the prime minister's press secretary said.<br/>\"He had no involvement or input into the approved list,\" the press secretary said.<br/>By convention, a former prime minister's resignation list of new peers is forwarded to the House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC), which vets appointments.<br/>Another Tory MP who did not feature on the list, despite being widely tipped for a peerage, was Alok Sharma, who was president of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. <br/>Usually when sitting MPs are given peerages, they resign their seats, triggering by-elections.<br/>Following the Partygate scandal and the political turbulence of Mr Johnson's premiership, the former PM's honours list was always expected to be controversial and to provoke fierce criticism.<br/>Some of the reaction to the names published on Friday has met those expectations.<br/>A formerly loyal aide to Mr Johnson branded the honours list \"an utter disgrace\", telling the BBC it was \"rewards for failure all round\".<br/>They said: \"Boris has slammed the door shut on the prospect of any return to the frontline of British politics and trashed what remained of his legacy.\"<br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said it was \"shameful\" that Mr Sunak had \"failed to stand up to his former boss's outrageous demands and agreed to hand out prizes to this carousel of cronies\". <br/>\"He promised integrity, but this weak prime minister is once again showing his appalling judgement by doing Boris Johnson's bidding,\" Ms Rayner said.<br/>And Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Boris Johnson has been allowed to hand out gongs to his Partygate pals, and Rishi Sunak has just waved it through.\"<br/>The seven new peers on Mr Johnson's honours list will enter a House of Lords that already has more than 800 members.<br/>The Electoral Reform Society campaign group said Mr Johnson's resignation list \"demonstrates just how discredited and partisan the honours system has become\".<br/>\"It's time to end this rotten system of patronage and replace the unelected Lords with a smaller elected chamber, where the people of this country - not former prime ministers - choose who shape the laws we all live under,\" its chief executive Darren Hughes said.<br/>Boris Johnson is loyal to those who are loyal to him. And his resignation honours list underlines this - until the ink runs out.<br/>Almost all of the 45 names know him personally. Many worked for him either at No 10 or when he was London mayor.<br/>Even his current spokesman has been transformed into a legislator, with a seat in the House of Lords.<br/>And for anyone who assumed that meritocracy might play a part in the honours system, a long-standing parliamentary hairdresser, Kelly Dodge, gets a gong for doing... Mr Johnson's hair.<br/>Yes, you read that correctly.

I think I possibly, maybe I should have stood down [as an MP] then.\"<br/>The prime minister's press secretary said Mr Johnson's peerage list had been handed to HOLAC unaltered \"as is convention\", and HOLAC then passed back its approved list. <br/>\"He [Rishi Sunak] had no involvement or input into the approved list,\" she added. <br/>Born in Liverpool in 1957, Ms Dorries worked as a nurse before becoming an MP in 2005. <br/>She is also a successful author of romantic historical novels and hit the headlines in 2012 for taking part in ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity, which led to her suspension from the Conservative parliamentary party for six months. <br/>She was a vocal critic of then-Prime Minister David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne, once describing them as \"a pair of posh boys who don't know the price of a pint of milk\".<br/>When Mr Johnson entered Downing Street he made her a health minister before appointing her as culture secretary in September 2021.<br/>She left government last September when Mr Johnson stepped down as prime minister. <br/>Since then she has been a strong critic of current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and has hit out at those who sought to oust Mr Johnson. <br/>Announcing that she would not stand in the general election in February, she criticised \"the lack of cohesion, the infighting and occasionally the sheer stupidity from those who think we could remove a sitting prime minister\".<br/>\"I'm afraid it's this behaviour that I now just have to remove myself from,\" she added. <br/>Nadine Dorries to stand down at next election<br/>Dorries writing book about Johnson's downfall<br/>The unlikely rise of Nadine Dorries<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But we've got to do that in a responsible way.\"<br/>However, pressed on how much investment there would be in the first year of a Labour government, Ms Reeves would not commit to a figure, arguing the economic backdrop would not be clear until closer to the time.<br/>Announcing the party's Green Prosperity Plan in 2021, Ms Reeves said the \u00a328bn would come from borrowing and would be spent on projects like offshore wind farms and developing batteries for electric vehicles. <br/>Since then the economic picture has changed considerably, with interest rates and borrowing costs soaring. <br/>Labour wants to be seen as economically credible and privately there had been concerns raised about whether the \u00a328bn of investment was affordable in the current context. <br/>There have also been complaints about how the policy has landed, with some worried the \u00a328bn figure was better known than what the money would be spent on. <br/>The Conservatives have also used the alleged dangers of the policy - that extra borrowing could increase interest rates and mortgage costs - as an attack line. <br/>However, the change in tack could make it more difficult to deliver Labour's aim of generating all electricity without using fossil fuels by 2030. <br/>Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands said Labour's main economic policy was \"in tatters\" after they realised \"it would lead to disaster\". <br/>\"It doesn't matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour's plan remains to stick \u00a328bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" he said.<br/>The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the move was \"the latest in a long line of broken promises\" from Labour, which \"could have very real and damaging consequences for Scotland's green energy potential\". <br/>Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Labour had offered a policy which \"does not go far enough\" and then \"row[ing] back at the first sign of any difficulty\". <br/>Ms Reeves was also critical of the deal Prime Minister Rishi Sunak secured with the US on his visit to Washington this week. <br/>Plans for a full free trade agreement have been abandoned but the new proposals include allowing UK electric car firms access to US green tax credits and subsidies. <br/>Ms Reeves, who visited the US herself last month, said she was \"staggered\" that Mr Sunak had returned with \"no industrial plan for Britain\". <br/>She has said Labour is taking inspiration from US President Joe Biden's plan to tackle inflation and create jobs, which includes a huge package of subsidies and tax breaks for green industries. <br/>But she said her \"secureonomics\" strategy would be \"built on the rock of financial stability and economic security\", with strict limits on borrowing.<br/>Labour has also promised to create a publicly owned renewable energy company to create jobs and improve the country's energy security. <br/>Last week the party pledged to ban new licences for oil and gas production in the UK, despite concerns from unions this could cost jobs.<br/>Starmer vows to prevent oil communities withering<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Labour plans publicly owned renewable energy giant<br/>Labour pledges \u00a328bn a year to make economy greener<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

On the plane ride over to Washington Mr Sunak said: \"For a while now, that has not been a priority for either the US or UK.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy criticised Mr Sunak, saying the government has left \"Britain's cupboards bare\" by not securing a trade deal. <br/>\"This statement shows the government has failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised in the 2019 manifesto, or to secure the ally status under the Inflation Reduction Act that is so important for the automotive sector and for the green transition,\" Mr Lammy said. <br/>Mr Biden said the special relationship with the UK was in \"real good shape\", referring to their co-operation on Ukraine.<br/>\"Together we are providing economic and humanitarian aid and security systems to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion from Russia,\" he said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Joe Biden calls Rishi Sunak \"president\" by mistake<br/>The Atlantic Declaration includes plans to mitigate some of the impact of the US flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  on the UK economy, with proposals to remove barriers which affected trade in electric vehicle batteries.<br/>Under current policy, the IRA provides tax credit worth $3,750 (\u00a33,000) for each electric vehicle (EV) manufactured in the US, or which use components mined, processed or manufactured in the country. <br/>The UK is already a net exporter of raw materials for EV batteries to the US. But nations without a US trade deal are barred from accessing IRA subsidies.  <br/>The Atlantic Declaration commits the UK and US to working on a new critical minerals agreement - which would give buyers of vehicles made using critical minerals processed, recycled or mined by UK companies access to tax credits.<br/>The declaration says the agreement would be launched after consultation with US Congress.<br/>Japan already has a similar deal, which allows Japanese firms to also swerve export duties on minerals used in producing EV batteries.<br/>The declaration also includes a commitment to a \"new UK-US Data Bridge\" which would allow UK firms to transfer data freely to certified US organisations without paying a levy.<br/>Downing Street estimate the change will affect around 55,000 UK businesses - translating into \u00a392.4m in direct savings per year.<br/>Mr Biden also supported Mr Sunak's plans to set up an international summit on AI safety which will be hosted in the UK later this year.<br/>The prime minister said: \"The UK and US have always pushed the boundaries of what two countries can achieve together.<br/>\"So it is natural that, when faced with the greatest transformation in our economies since the industrial revolution, we would look to each other to build a stronger economic future together.  <br/>\"The Atlantic Declaration sets a new standard for economic cooperation, propelling our economies into the future so we can protect our people, create jobs and grow our economies together.\" <br/>Both Mr Biden and Mr Sunak agreed to carry out work to improve the resilience of supply chains and efforts will be stepped up to shut Vladimir Putin's Russia out of the global civil nuclear market. <br/>US Senate passes sweeping $700bn economic package<br/>Sunak to raise trade issues in US talks with Biden<br/>Is UK being left behind in global fight for investment?<br/>Chris Mason: What Sunak is trying to achieve in the US<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

If not, the tax will  remain in place until March 2028.<br/>The level has been set at $71.40 per barrel for oil and \u00a30.54 per therm for gas. <br/>Brent crude oil was trading at $75 per barrel on Friday morning, with gas prices at around \u00a30.62.<br/>Energy firms have been urging ministers to reduce the windfall tax, warning that it was causing companies to pull back investment.<br/>In April, the UK's largest oil and gas producer Harbour said it would shed 350 UK onshore jobs as a result of the windfall tax. French oil giant TotalEnergies also said it would cut its planned 2023 North Sea investment by a quarter - \u00a3100m - because of the extension to the windfall tax.<br/>The Treasury said its decision had reflected those concerns.<br/>It said any fall in investment \"puts the long-term future of the UK's domestic supply at risk, meaning we would be forced to import more from abroad at a time when reliable and affordable energy is a focus for families and businesses\".<br/>A Labour spokesperson said: \"We need a proper windfall tax on the enormous profits of oil and gas giants to help with ease the cost of living crisis.   \"We will look at the detail of this change. Of course if the windfalls of war disappear then we'll look at what the right long-term tax position should be for the North Sea.\"<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak introduced the Energy Profits Levy in May last year when he was chancellor, with the rate set at 25%.<br/>In the autumn, current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would increase to 35% from January 2023.<br/>The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas, but not from other activities - such as refining oil and selling petrol and diesel on forecourts.<br/>Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea already pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that.<br/>So with the windfall tax, that takes the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies to 75%.<br/>If it is eliminated, the overall tax rate on energy firms would return to 40%.<br/>Trade body Offshore Energies UK welcomed the announcement, but warned the industry still faced challenges.<br/>Its chief executive David Whitehouse said: \"This is a step in the right direction, but many more will need to be taken to restore confidence to our sector.<br/>\"We will now work closely with government and lenders to understand the detail of the measure and its effectiveness at unlocking investment.\"<br/>Oil and gas giant Shell also welcomed the announcement. A spokesperson said it \"should help to improve investor confidence in the UK North Sea, which will remain crucial to maintaining Britain's energy security in the coming years\".<br/>However, the change to the windfall tax was criticised by the Green Party.<br/>\"The government seems happy to allow these huge corporations to not only wreck the climate but to profit off the back of the cost-of-living crisis which they themselves have contributed to,\" said Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay.<br/>\"Instead, the government should be tightening the tax, closing the loopholes and ensuring the money raised helps people through the cost-of-living crisis and funds the sustainable green energy jobs in the renewable sector we urgently need.\"<br/>Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Georgia Whitaker, said: \"Irrespective of what happens to the price of oil and gas, the tax these companies pay should be higher, permanently.<br/>\"This cash should be used to help insulate homes and transition the UK to cheap, clean energy, not fill the bank balances of already wealthy shareholders.\"<br/>How much windfall tax are oil giants paying?<br/>What is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

an increase of about two thirds on the same period last year.<br/>The Conservatives have reclaimed the top spot for donations, overtaking Labour, which raised the most money in the final quarter of 2022.<br/>The party has reversed a dip in donations since Rishi Sunak became Tory leader and prime minister in October last year.<br/>A Tory source said last year was \"very difficult for donations\" in the wake of Boris Johnson's premiership, but insisted the latest Electoral Commission figures showed \"a big recovery\".<br/>The source said the increase in donations was important \"because we're hiring lots of campaign managers to target the marginal seats\" ahead of the next general election.<br/>A large chunk of the \u00a312.1m in donations the party raised between January to March this year came from Mr Mansour, who was appointed Tory treasurer by Mr Sunak last year.<br/>Writing in the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Mansour said he felt reassured by Mr Sunak's leadership and revealed he had donated \u00a35m to the party's \"election fighting fund\".<br/>The Egyptian-born business tycoon, who has British citizenship, said the country had \"a very capable prime minister\" who \"understands how growth is generated in the modern economy\".<br/>\"I look at what he has achieved in his first months in office and think what he could do in five years,\" Mr Mansour wrote.<br/>Mr Mansour himself was once a politician in Egypt, where he served as a transport minister from 2006 to 2009 under Hosni Mubarak, the late Egyptian president who stood down in 2011 during the Arab Spring.<br/>Outside politics, Mr Mansour is a prominent businessman, with a fortune Forbes estimates to be $3.6bn.<br/>He is the chairman of the Mansour Group, which employs 60,000 people, and founded the London-based investment firm Man Capital.<br/>A Tory source said Mr Mansour's function as a treasurer was to \"open up networks\" and introduce the party to new contacts in the business world.<br/>Mr Mansour's \u00a35m gift was second only to Lord Sainsbury's in 2019, when he gave the Liberal Democrats \u00a38m - the biggest individual donation ever.<br/>The Conservatives received two more big donations, both valued at \u00a32m - one from Amit Lohia, a wealthy Indian industrialist, and Graham Edwards, another Conservative Party treasurer.<br/>The largest individual donations to Labour totalled \u00a3500,000 from Gary Lubner, the former chief executive of the company that owns Autoglass.<br/>Mr Lubner is expected to donate \u00a35m to the party before the next election and told the Financial Times he wanted to give Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer financial help to put the party in power \"for a long time\".<br/>Labour also received \u00a32.3m from its trade union backers, including \u00a31.1m from Unite and \u00a3359,168 from Unison.<br/>The Liberal Democrats' largest donation was \u00a3200,000, from a company called Peak Scientific Instruments, a nitrogen generator manufacturer.<br/>Tim Bale, a professor of politics and author of The Conservative Party after Brexit, said the money raised by parties ahead of general elections was important because \"it can actually make a difference to what a party can do in the campaign itself\".<br/>He said it is difficult to tell if the latest donations \"represent a vote of confidence in the current [Conservative] leadership or instead smack of panic and desperation\".<br/>The professor said there may be a \"growing fear\" of a Labour government among those who \"worry they'll lose out if that happens\".<br/>Professor Bale said, as far as some donors are concerned, the Conservative Party \"ultimately exists as an insurance policy against a social democratic government they believe will take the country in the wrong direction and, in so doing, damage their wealth\".<br/>Louise Edwards, of the Electoral Commission, said publishing the figures was vital to ensure transparency but called on the government to do more to raise confidence in the system.<br/>She said: \"We know transparency of party and campaigner finance is important for people, but our research tells us that only 24% of people believe party funding is transparent.<br/>\"It's clear that publishing this information is not enough.

The recent clampdown on protest, the new section 12 which the police used today to finally end the march\u2026 all of these are undemocratic.<br/>\"To go even further and say a walking protest is illegal - I think that's incredible.

the nature and climate emergencies\".<br/>She thanked her supporters, who she said had \"put the politics of hope above the politics of fear\".<br/>She was elected for Brighton Pavilion in 2010, becoming the first Green MP.<br/>Ms Lucas, who had two stints as Green leader, has increased her majority at every election since, winning by a margin of almost 20,000 votes in 2019.<br/>The MP's decision comes a month after her party lost control of Brighton and Hove council, despite making record gains in May's local elections in England.<br/>In an open letter, Ms Lucas said it had been the \"privilege of my life to serve this extraordinary constituency and community\".<br/>She said: \"I have always been a different kind of politician - as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly 10 years ago will recall.<br/>\"And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises.<br/>\"I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election.\"<br/>The Green Party's co-leader, Carla Denyer described Ms Lucas as a \"force of nature\" and said the party was \"so proud of her achievements\".<br/>Ms Denyer - her party's candidate for the Bristol West constituency - said Ms Lucas's record \"demonstrates how essential it is to have Green voices in UK politics\".<br/>The party's joint leader, Adrian Ramsay, said the Greens would be \"striving to get more Green MPs elected at the next general election so that we can build on Caroline's achievements\".<br/>The party won its highest ever vote share of 3.8% in 2015's general election but Ms Lucas was the only Green candidate to win a seat.<br/>Although Ms Lucas remains the only Green MP, the party has enjoyed success in recent local elections.<br/>In England's local elections in May, the Green Party won more than 240 seats and made history in Mid-Suffolk, taking control of the council for the first time.<br/>The Greens have traditionally performed best in urban areas, such as Brighton and Bristol, but the party concentrated its campaigning firepower on rural, traditional Tory areas.<br/>Labour is now expected to focus efforts on trying to win the seat after taking control of Brighton and Hove Council from the Greens in May. <br/>Labour sources point to the Greens facing anger locally over their management of the council and to their gains at the expense of the Greens in wards that map onto the parliamentary constituency.<br/>One local party source said: \"In May's local elections residents in Brighton delivered a damning and decisive verdict on the Green Party - with Labour winning nearly twice as many councillors as the Greens in Caroline Lucas' seat.<br/>\"Labour will continue to make the case to voters in Brighton Pavilion that we are the only party with the answers to the serious challenges facing the country.\"<br/>Ms Lucas's first period as Green leader was between 2008 and 2012, before her second as co-leader with Jonathan Bartley for two years from September 2016.<br/>The Brighton Pavilion MP said she came into politics \"to change things\".<br/>She said she had put a universal basic income on the political agenda, secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform, and been involved in the addition of a natural history GCSE to the syllabus.<br/>She told the BBC she was \"definitely not quitting\" politics, or \"retiring with my knitting\".<br/>\"I think right now, the Greens are at such as exciting stage,\" she said. \"Working to get more Greens elected is my priority.\"<br/>Ms Lucas is the latest senior MP to announce her departure from Parliament at the next election, which is expected to be held in 2024.<br/>Dozens of MPs have stated their intention leave the Commons, including former health secretary Matt Hancock, the former deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, and former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.<br/>Best ever local election results for Greens<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

<br/>The government will be keen to pass any legislation before Westminster breaks for the summer recess on 20 July.<br/>But don't expect a quick decision from the DUP. <br/>The party may want assurances around a financial package to help plug Stormont's \u00a31.1bn black hole. <br/>They may also decide to reserve judgement until the new arrangements agreed in Windsor Framework are put into operation in October. <br/>Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the pace towards the return of a Stormont executive is being \"ramped up\". <br/>He said the all-party talks with the head of the civil service were positive. <br/>Mr Beattie said those around the table talked about \"when\" the Executive is restored.<br/>He said talks focused on the financial ask of the treasury to plug the \u00a31.1bn black hole in Stormont's finances.<br/>Alliance MP Stephen Farry said that the talks and the progress being made should not be seen as a barrier to getting the Executive back up and running again. <br/>But he added the talks on Thursday were a positive sign and that \"serious work\" was being done to put together a plan from the parties for the UK government on moving forward. <br/>Mr Farry said: \"There is some degree of momentum building in this process but it's still early days.\" <br/>Sir Jeffrey also criticised Sinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane over his planned attendance at an IRA commemoration at the weekend in Armagh. <br/>He said his \"attendance was wrong on so many levels\". <br/>He added they were \"building a fun day around celebrating volunteers who were one of the most feared killing machines in Northern Ireland during the troubles\"<br/>He urged Sinn F\u00e9in to think again about its involvement this weekend and to think of the impact on the victims families who still carry the hurt and pain.<br/>Sinn F\u00e9in has previously said that \"everyone has the right to remember their dead\".<br/>Stormont parties called to talks over power sharing<br/>A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Brexit deal<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But, there would be greater public oversight and higher standards. <br/>The report recognises that providers would need to be better funded - arguing that more than \u00a37bn has been spent by councils on care homes which are inadequate.<br/>While the case for more funding is set out, the report is rather shy when it comes to specific numbers.<br/>It says Labour should make a promise to increase real terms funding by a \"significant percentage each year\".<br/>\"Significant increases for adult social care are essential and inevitable,\" the report said.<br/>Insiders say that, with Labour under fire from opponents for specific spending commitments on green policies, there is a reluctance to set out specific sums in other areas well before an election.<br/>But critics are more concerned that the report has largely ducked the question of the lifetime cost of care for individuals.<br/>In a 2011 report, for the then Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot recommended a cap on social care costs of between \u00a325,000-\u00a335,000.<br/>This was never implemented. But Boris Johnson's government did commit to capping lifetime care costs at \u00a386,000.<br/>However the current chancellor Jeremy Hunt delayed implementation until 2025 - pushing it until after the next general election. <br/>Labour have denounced this as \"another broken Tory promise\".<br/>But the Fabian Society report suggests a care cap should simply be \"considered\" as an option by Labour, with reform of means-testing as another possibility. <br/>It is perhaps unsurprising that some of those with knowledge of the care system are now accusing Labour of ducking the issue.<br/>Charles Tallack from the independent charity the Health Foundation said the report \"fudged crucial questions about social care costs\".<br/>\"Options for reform are well known - including building on a cap on care costs - but the missing ingredient is political will,\" he added.<br/>Streeting: I won't pretend NHS is envy of world<br/>Face-to-face GP appointments promised by Labour<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Moscow has denied responsibility, instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.<br/>Mr Sunak also said the UK should \"have confidence\" in its ability to act as a global leader in regulating artificial intelligence (AI), a topic he is set to discuss with President Biden at a White House meeting on Thursday.<br/>The prime minister is hoping to put post-Brexit UK in the driving seat of efforts to set new global rules for the emerging technology.<br/>Some experts have questioned the extent to which the UK will be able to shape new global rules outside the European Union, with the UK now shut out of key gatherings between European and American regulators such as the Tech and Trade Council.<br/>But Mr Sunak said the level of AI investment in the UK, and the quality of British research, meant it could \"shape the conversation\" on future rules.<br/>\"Other than the US, there's no other democratic country that has that strength in AI,\" he argued.<br/>Chris Mason: What Sunak is trying to achieve in the US<br/>Johnson to bypass government on Covid WhatsApps<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I'm sure you'll be able to get in there and see some of it.\"<br/>Wednesday's visit is the second time this year that a DUP MP has celebrated a famous singer at Parliament.<br/>In March, Strangford representative Jim Shannon submitted an early day motion to mark the 50th anniversary of Dolly Parton's song 'I will always love you'. <br/>He said he noted the sentiment behind the song \"and what it means to so many\", including Mr Shannon's wife.<br/>Simmons said what politicians do \"is far more important\" than music.<br/>\"We're a diversion,\" he said. \"Our job is to make you forget about your troubles, just for those few hours that you're with us.\"<br/>Asked if he could be tempted to enter politics, Simmons said he could joke \"they don't pay enough\".<br/>\"I can literally make more in one evening doing a concert than I can being a politician for the entire year, as shocking as that may sound,\" he continued.<br/>However, he added democracy is \"our only hope\". <br/>\"If I was called to serve, sure, I would do it, but I would not accept a salary, I would do it for one dollar, tax-free of course.\"<br/>You can listen to Good Morning Ulster's interview with Gene Simmons in full here.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

the MP for Kingston upon Hull East - has written back to Mr Tierney asking for specific examples. <br/>The Labour MP told the BBC he had looked into this and believed \"there is no example the government can rely on\".<br/>He said Cabinet Office officials \"either have to give me an example when a former minister or a serving minister has been provided with legal support for a parliamentary inquiry, or they have to accept that they've set a new precedent with Boris Johnson\".<br/>Mr Turner said the government had seemingly established a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers \"get the protection of the taxpayer to cover their legal fees\", and backbench MPs do not.<br/>The last former minister to be investigated by a parliamentary committee for misleading Parliament was former Labour MP and transport secretary Stephen Byers in 2005.<br/>The BBC has been told Mr Byers was not offered taxpayer-funded legal representation.<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs during the inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson has faced calls to pay the legal costs himself, with opposition parties highlighting he has earned millions since standing down as prime minister.<br/>The former prime minister was joined by his lawyers when he appeared in front of the Privileges Committee in March.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>He denied knowingly or deliberately misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Mr Johnson has submitted answers to the committee about a number of events at Chequers and Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Privileges Committee sources say they are hoping to wrap up the inquiry before Parliament's summer recess in July.<br/>If the committee finds Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament, he faces suspension as an MP, which could trigger a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>Separate to the Privileges Committee inquiry, Mr Johnson is being provided with taxpayer-funded legal support for the public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.<br/>Last month, Mr Johnson severed ties with the government-appointed lawyers who were set to represent him in the Covid inquiry.<br/>In a letter, reported by the Sunday Times, the Cabinet Office warned Mr Johnson that public funding for his legal representation could be withdrawn if he tried to \"undermine\" the government.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the letter \"simply reiterates that taxpayer-funded lawyers must be used to aid the Covid Inquiry and for no other purpose\".<br/>\"This letter was intended to protect public funds.

He began a data protection action in 2021, then started a defamation claim.<br/>Ms Leslie, MP for Bristol North West from 2010-17, is the former managing director of the Conservative Middle East Council, which promotes links between MPs and the Middle East.<br/>Mr Justice Nicklin said there were \"several aspects of the conduct of the claimant\", Mr Amersi, which gave \"real cause for concern\" as to the purpose of his actions. <br/>He questioned whether Mr Amersi genuinely sought \"vindication\", which is the aim of such litigation. He also said Mr Amersi had adopted \"an exorbitant approach\" to the litigation, bringing an unnecessarily complex case.<br/>Ms Leslie said the judgment \"spoke for itself\" and she was \"delighted to have this vindication after two-and-a-half years of legal action against me\".<br/>Mr Amersi said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" and was considering an appeal. He added that he had been \"denied justice\". <br/>In a statement he said the judge's interpretation of the law \"provides effective immunity to those who publish serious falsehoods to small but influential groups of people\".<br/>David Davis MP told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the result was a \"victory for free speech\". He later described it as a \"landmark for press freedom and fair comment\".<br/>He described the case as a SLAPP : \"Strategic Litigation against Public Participation\". There has been growing concern about the use of such lawsuits to stifle public debate. <br/>The government has described them as an abuse, used to \"harass intimidate and financially exhaust an opponent\".<br/>Last year the government held a consultation on changing the law and an update is expected shortly.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Like all prime ministerial trips abroad, it wasn't exactly typical.<br/>Here are four things that make travelling with the prime minister a unique experience.<br/>For years the debate raged. Was it legitimate for the prime minister to have a plane they could call their own?<br/>The issue made headlines during Tony Blair's premiership - when, inevitably, the prospect of such a thing was called Blair Force One. In 2006, a plan was announced. But in 2008, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, it was scrapped.<br/>Is a private jet ostentatious? Does it help with the practicalities of being a frequently flying leader? Does it project an image of the UK abroad that you wouldn't get turning up on a chartered plane? <br/>For now at least, the debate is over: the prime minister does have access to his own plane. And I type these words sitting on it, somewhere over the Atlantic.<br/>It is an Airbus A321, with a union flag on the tail fin, and \"United Kingdom\" written down the side. <br/>When you fly on this thing, it is rather different from rolling up at the airport to go on holiday. We leave from a private terminal, we often don't get a boarding pass and usually we take all of our baggage on with us - for a reason I'll get to shortly.<br/>But meanwhile\u2026<br/>You might imagine, in a private jet, the entertainment system would be something else. <br/>There is WiFi, so the prime minister and his team can stay connected and work efficiently, which is something they value. And it helps us reporters too.<br/>On the plane, there are none of those little screens you get in the back of the seat in front of you on some flights, packed with films and playlists and maps showing precisely where you are over the ocean. Instead, we often have what is called a \"huddle\".<br/>A huddle involves the prime minister coming to the back of the plane, where reporters crowd around him, and each ask him a question.<br/>This is how it works: all the reporters get together beforehand, in the airport, to work out what we are going to ask, in what order, to ensure we cover a range of topics. <br/>The conversation is \"on the record\" - to use the jargon - meaning we can quote the words and attribute them to the prime minister. But the huddle is not recorded for television or radio. <br/>A round of on-camera interviews with the prime minister tends to happen later in the trip. Each broadcaster is assigned a strictly agreed amount of time - often seven minutes - to attempt to find things out, hold the government to account and test its arguments. <br/>Interviewing any prime minister is a huge privilege and responsibility: working on your behalf, trying to ask the questions you want asking. I will always ask the brilliant producer I am working with to stand just out of shot counting down the minutes I have left on their fingers. <br/>Journalistically, there is a tension on these trips: we are close to the prime minister and his team throughout. This is useful, in understanding what they are doing and what motivates their decisions. But instinctively reporters want to be detached, independent and disinterested, and being in what can feel like a bubble feels odd in that context.<br/>Oh, and if we are going somewhere on a long-haul flight - for example Indonesia, Japan or the west coast of America, as we've have recently - we end up having to stop to refuel. <br/>And so those trips involved landing in Dubai, Muscat, Almaty and Washington, hanging around for an hour or so, and then taking off again. <br/>There aren't huge queues to check in. Or any queues at all. <br/>There are comfy settees to sit on, there is loads of natural light and a free coffee machine. To say it feels different from when you head off on a family holiday with the kids is to put it gently. Mind you, I don't take laptops, a tripod, and no end of other broadcasting kit with me on holiday either. <br/>Recently, we flew back into Luton Airport in the middle of the night and pulled up at a private terminal. Past the entrance to what was described as the \"VVIP lounge\" (I couldn't see in, I'm afraid) was a glass cabinet proffering stuff from Harrods, including a collection of pink teddies complete with \"recycled polyester filling\". <br/>A large rectangular steel clock hung on the wall. \"We commissioned this clock from Beaumont flying art,\" read the inscription. Also on the wall, a colossal screen, pitching the merits of executive private jets, the kind that only carry a handful of passengers. \"15 hours of peaceful luxury!\" is how they describe the flight on offer.<br/>When the prime minister's plane lands abroad, a diplomatic ritual begins. As the plane pulls up, a smiling delegation greets us. <br/>One of the first people off the plane is the camera journalist assigned to film the prime minister's arrival on behalf of all the broadcasters. There might be a red carpet. There are almost always flags.<br/>The UK ambassador to wherever we are will be there at the bottom of the plane steps. Maybe even some sort of performance will be offered by the hosts - at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport last autumn, it was a troupe of traditional dancers.<br/>And while the prime minister is getting off via the front set of steps, the rest of us are piling off at the back and getting into a seemingly never-ending line of minibuses waiting on the tarmac.<br/>There's no time to wait for a bag in the hold. That's why we take them onto the plane with us.<br/>In next to no time, the motorcade is moving - and moving fast. Police outriders swarm all around us, and junctions are closed, so we can race through.<br/>On the motorway, the fast lane is (temporarily) closed so we can zip by. Passers by can be lining the streets, sometimes, to grab pictures. <br/>On a recent trip to Japan, the press minibus wasn't the nippiest, its engine squealing to keep up with the slick Mercedes of the prime minister a dozen or so vehicles ahead.<br/>What Sunak\u2019s Atlantic Declaration is \u2013 and isn\u2019t<br/>Sunak and Biden announce green funding agreement<br/>Sunak to raise trade issues in US talks with Biden<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That committee is made up mainly of Tory MPs. The former PM has faced the same procedure as other MPs that get into trouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he has been \"forced out\", remember he has chosen to quit before we even see the black and white of their verdict. <br/>It is also a fact there are some Conservatives who begrudge him his success. It is also true that during his last few months in No 10 there were internal enemies trying to force him out. <br/>But to dress that up as a grand conspiracy is, candidly, a stretch. One of those who knows him best told me his resignation announcement was \"1,000 words that tell you everything about Johnson's mindset - it's your fault not mine\".<br/>Rather than confront what has happened or try to defend himself from the judgement that is coming, Boris Johnson made a political choice this week not to stay and fight. <br/>As ever, the line between farce and tragedy is skinny. While most of the headlines screamed of the shock, the former prime minister's exit from Parliament is entirely on brand. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Boris Johnson's political career... in 72 seconds<br/>The timing on a Friday was unexpected, but no surprise. He never much liked Parliament anyway, even though he managed to find a gong for the Commons' hairdresser. <br/>The idea he would savour being a humble backbencher asking questions about cash for the local hospital or appearing at school fetes was for the birds. And if the Privileges Committee's findings are as savage as expected he would have faced a by-election. <br/>Clues from his track record tell us there is little chance he would have fought if he hadn't been sure he could win. He pulled out of the Tory leadership race in 2016 when Michael Gove's move blew up his status as front-runner. <br/>He didn't run in 2022 despite a dash back from the Caribbean and fevered claims that he had enough support. One former cabinet ally says he is \"more calculating than people think and this will have been a calculation -  if he thought he would win the by-election he would stay\". To win and lose does not match brand Boris. To leave like this absolutely does.<br/>The power of his personality - frankly his fame - means he leaves behind some devastated colleagues and a strand of the public who believe he has been hard done by. <br/>One former cabinet minister says: \"The party wounded itself when it defenestrated Boris and continues to bleed.\"<br/>Some of his hard-core supporters left on the backbenches say his exit is a sad day for democracy and - with some justification believe his leadership is what secured their seats, particularly in parts of the country where the Tories could never have dreamt of doing well before. <br/>Some of his loyal backers do feel like he is the great hero in a tragedy, cast aside unfairly in an epic drama, undone by those who envy his talents. <br/>His exit is arguably a tragedy for those who genuinely believed in and adored him. And there is a political tragedy for the Conservative Party, which many MPs privately believe squandered a once in a generation majority. <br/>2019 gave it one of those rare chances to make radical changes to the country, and while many believe it was thrown away by mismanagement and mistakes, there was of course the unexpected horror of the Covid pandemic too. <br/>For those who deplore Boris Johnson, there is a different kind of tragedy, the damage they believe he did to the UK's reputation. And several of those who have been close to him over the years identify a fourth element of the mess - the fact they believe it was never going to end well. <br/>In the Greek tragedies so beloved of Mr Johnson himself, fate, and inevitability plays an important role. One of them says: \"Boris is a genuine tragedy. This was all inevitable. We knew how it would play out, but we are still surprised and shocked about how dreadful it is. All our hard work pissed away.\" <br/>So what happens next? Some MPs are actually cock-a-hoop despite the colossal mess. One tells me: \"The man-baby has gone - so pleased!\"<br/>But allies talk up his chances of running for another seat some time. One former senior minister tells me \"the question is does he plan to get another seat or even Mid-Beds?\" - the constituency his close ally and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has just left. <br/>Another former cabinet minister says: \"It would be very unwise for him to run again. He has a vociferous 20% in the party who like him but 80% don't. If he ran in a by-election the Lib Dems would murder him.\"<br/>Would party HQ even let that happen? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has changed the personnel in charge there. One senior figure pours a bucket of freezing water over the idea telling me: \"Boris died today.\"<br/>What is not clear yet is whether as that MP suggests the manner of his departure could \"generate so much unrest I fear there will be an election much sooner than thought\".<br/>Mr Johnson has thrown grenades at No 10 - not just the committee that has judged him - suggesting Mr Sunak is not running a \"proper Conservative\" government. <br/>One former ally says the ex-PM has \"gone full circle, returning to his political home - a hut across the water where he can now lob rocks without any sense of responsibility or accountability - and that is ultimately very dangerous for his party and Sunak\". <br/>But if Boris Johnson is unlikely to run for Parliament again, and is happy to dangle the prospect of a return, what else might he do with his time?<br/>You'll find plenty of people in Westminster chattering that he'll return to his first love - writing - but might there be something bigger? <br/>By chance his old newspaper the Telegraph has just come up for sale and - by chance - its former editor Will Lewis has just been made a knight by Mr Johnson. Is there, by chance, the possibility they might be part of a bid to take it over? <br/>It's been suggested to me that is in fact something that has been discussed. It's no secret that Mr Lewis - now Sir Will - would be keen to take it on. <br/>He advised Mr Johnson in No 10 sometimes and the two men worked together at the Telegraph when the former PM was its star columnist who attracted extra subscribers each week. <br/>Going back as a columnist would be one thing for Mr Johnson and not all that surprising. But for him to take a bigger role - as one source whispers, the editor - might be the Conservatives' worst nightmare. <br/>I'm told that conversations are only at the stage of ideas being scribbled down on paper. A formal sale process, let alone any decisions about actual bids, is a long way off.  <br/>But I can't help wondering, what would the consequences be for Downing Street and the Conservatives if their most loyal backer in the press gave a major role to Mr Sunak's bitter rival? Could the next twist in the Boris Johnson story be even wilder than the last? Perhaps. <br/>Some of those who have worked alongside him believe it is more likely to be \"terminal Boris\". A former ally says \"he was obviously once someone with exceptional skills, who came so far, and did so much in the face of incredible opposition\".<br/>But they say, perhaps in sorrow and in anger: \"His career ends with him alone, a victim of his utter inability to tell the truth to anyone, including himself.\"<br/>Maybe he will fade into obscurity. Perhaps he'll be back in Parliament one day. He might make millions speaking and writing or become Rishi Sunak's most powerful opposition. <br/>But his name is now on the list of those unprovable political \"what ifs' so furiously and perpetually debated by political nerds. <br/>What if Mrs Thatcher hadn't been forced out? What if Tony Blair hadn't invaded Iraq? What if Boris Johnson had given a different answer in the Commons when he was first asked what happened under his roof during the Covid lockdowns? <br/>We will never know. But what we do know this weekend is that one era is over. We know Boris Johnson had huge potential to create, but also to destroy - his extraordinary majority, his reputation, and the party he led too. <br/>He must now decide what to do with the power that he still retains. And his old party must decide how much attention it wants to pay. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years.

Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. It's his job is to look at constitutional issues like this. <br/>He told me: \"If the inquiry requests documents and info - then whoever it has asked should comply.\"<br/>He said this included the government.                             <br/>Caroline Nokes - another select committee chair - said Baroness Hallett was unlikely to roll over and there would be \"less pain for the government if they hand [the messages] over quickly\".<br/>Former Conservative health secretary Matt Hancock is among those who have made clear they are happy to share unredacted messages in full.<br/>Boris Johnson's allies have also made clear he is happy to send more information - and he says he has given his WhatsApp messages and notebooks in full to the Cabinet Office.<br/>He has also said he will bypass the Cabinet Office by providing WhatsApps dating from April 2021 onwards directly to the inquiry. <br/>So where does this leave the government? <br/>Potentially in a tricky place. <br/>It has now launched a legal battle with the inquiry looking into how it functioned during a public health crisis that changed all of our lives. <br/>If it loses, that would be an embarrassing defeat. Questions would be asked about using public money to fight the case. <br/>If it wins, it's quite possible the Covid inquiry will be seriously undermined. <br/>Will bereaved families who have demanded full transparency accept this? Where would such a ruling leave inquiry chair Baroness Hallett, who has made her position clear? <br/>Cabinet minister Mel Stride has questioned the need for \"irrelevant\" documents to be provided to the inquiry - saying they would not add value.<br/>He told the BBC the government would be \"robust and open and candid\" in its dealings with the inquiry.<br/>But he drew a distinction with information that was \"unambiguously, entirely irrelevant\".<br/>He added: \"It seems to me to request lots and lots of that kind of data is not something which is adding any value\". <br/>With the government and the inquiry now locked in a legal battle, this row looks set to drag on.<br/>Covid inquiry demands release of Johnson WhatsApps<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years, starting with the USA.\" <br/>In truth the likelihood of such a full fat agreement, on that timeframe in particular, was probably pretty small, and it's been very small for as long as President Joe Biden has been in the White House - a reality acknowledged by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss as well as Rishi Sunak. <br/>And three years on from 2019 was 2022, last year - and there is no such deal.<br/>This is why I asked the prime minister and the president about it: given they are unveiling something of an alternative - the Atlantic Declaration - it is important to scrutinise and highlight the gap between what was in the prospectus for government that gives Mr Sunak his mandate to govern, and what he is now talking up.<br/>Not least because trade deals have been done with others, possible once the UK was outside the European Union.<br/>From Mr Sunak's perspective, the politics of this is straightforward: attempting a free trade agreement, even if President Biden wanted to deliver one and could deliver one, would take longer than either man has between now and facing their electorates in the next 18 months.<br/>So better to work up an arrangement now, even if chunks of it require further negotiation before they happen. <br/>Downing Street argues, in explaining why there has been no such deal with the US, that the world has changed since 2019. And it has. <br/>It is worth exploring how it has changed, how that is remoulding international relations and the consequences for the UK.<br/>Covid, the threat posed by China, and the war in Ukraine have been catalysts for a collective fretting from many of the relatively rich democracies over economic security.<br/>Translated: how to get hold of components or energy without relying on now hostile states. <br/>This Declaration, at least partially, attempts to address this. <br/>There is concern about military security too, which prompted the  AUKUS pact between the UK, the US and Australia.<br/>But the economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors is America's Inflation Reduction Act - a massive stimulus to address economic security and base green industries of the future in previously left behind American areas. <br/>It is so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally. <br/>The Biden Administration's motivation is this: the economy needs to adapt given climate change, China and Russia - so let's make America less dependent on others and ensure those jobs of the future are in America.<br/>Labour say they'd do something similar. The Conservatives won't - but No10 point to elements in this deal that mitigate against some of its downsides to British businesses.<br/>Downing Street are upbeat about how the last few days have panned out. <br/>Rishi Sunak and his delegation stayed at Blair House, the President's official guesthouse. <br/>Talk to those who have been there and it's a reminder the accommodation on these trips is part of the diplomacy.<br/>The political history at every turn. The portraits on the walls. The giant strawberry dipped in chocolate left in a guest's room.<br/>Oh, and it turns out the chef in Blair House is from Warrington. <br/>He keeps fish and chips on the menu as a nod to his British heritage. But hasn't yet persuaded his bosses of the merits of shepherd's pie. <br/>The prime minister appears to relish the international element of his job: the methodical building of alliances and personal relationships, the deal making.<br/>But the domestic fray beckons again, as he swaps the Oval Office of the White House for a gathering of his northern English MPs in South Yorkshire.<br/>Sunak and Biden announce green funding agreement<br/>Chris Mason: What Sunak is trying to achieve in the US<br/>Is UK being left behind in global fight for investment?<br/>Truss admits no US trade deal on horizon<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And then there was this wave of nationalism and Nicola Sturgeon,\" the 25-year-old says.<br/>Euan, who lives in Glasgow, says he's \"delighted\" Ms Sturgeon has left and believes voters are motivated to remove a \"very bad SNP government\".<br/>\"Some people did have a soft spot for Nicola Sturgeon,\" he says.<br/>\"But now you look at the opinion poll ratings of Humza Yousaf, they certainly don't feel that way about him.<br/>\"I think that's going to motivate people to go out and vote for unionist parties and particularly the Scottish Conservatives.\"<br/>But how does Euan think the Scottish Tories will appeal to young voters, a group they haven't always been associated with?<br/>\"I think we've got a big task, I'm not going to pretend lots and lots of young people are voting Scottish Conservative,\" he says. <br/>\"But I think it's why we've got to direct policies to young people that will benefit them. <br/>\"We need to build more houses, all of my friends are struggling to get on the housing ladder.

And an ocean of nuance.<br/>Net migration added 606,000 to the UK's population last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.<br/>An estimated 1.2 million people arrived, while just over half a million left.<br/>But migration is about so much more than just numbers.<br/>It is about emotion, communities and public services. It is about promises, people and places.<br/>Who and how many should the country welcome, from where and for how long?<br/>I have been talking to people in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk about it.<br/>The east of England is highly dependent on immigration - and Great Yarmouth overwhelmingly backed Brexit too.<br/>The promises of three successive Conservative prime ministers were washed away by reality.<br/>\"Net migration will be in the order of tens of thousands each year, no ifs, no buts,\" claimed David Cameron.<br/>There were lots of ifs and even more buts - he never got close.<br/>\"We believe sustainable numbers are the tens of thousands,\" repeated Theresa May.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled.<br/>Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration<br/>Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He has advised that on this occasion further investigation is not necessary and I have accepted that advice. On the basis of your letter and our discussion, my decision is that these matters do not amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code.<br/>As you have recognised, a better course of action could have been taken to avoid giving rise to the perception of impropriety.<br/>Nevertheless, I am reassured you take these matters seriously. You have provided a thorough account, apologised and expressed regret.<br/>It is vital that all those in Government maintain the high standards the public rightly expects. I know you share this view, just as we are committed to delivering on the issues that matter to the British people - from making our streets safer and reducing net migration to stopping the boats.<br/>Yours ever<br/>Rishi Sunak<br/>Dear Prime Minister,<br/>I am writing to provide further information in relation to my receipt and handling of a speeding ticket, which has been the subject of recent media interest.<br/>Around June 2022, while Attorney General, I was found to be speeding. I received notification that I could take a group speed awareness course or receive a fine and three points on my licence, which was clean at the time. I opted to take the course and booked a date in Autumn.<br/>After arriving at the Home Office in September as Home Secretary, I informed officials in my Home Office Private Office (PO) about the course and asked whether it was appropriate given my new role. <br/>This reflected my lack of familiarity with protocol relating to my newly acquired official status as a 'protected person', which means I am required to have a close protection security team overseeing my movements, and with me always in public. <br/>This involves close protection having knowledge of and involvement in many areas of what would otherwise be considered my 'private life', not related to my work as a Minister or Member of Parliament.<br/>In discussions with my Principal Private Secretary (PPS) I was advised that the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET) would be the best source of advice on whether it was appropriate to seek to do the course in a way that protected my privacy, security, and was least disruptive to the course participants and provider. <br/>I readily agreed to this suggestion. Consequently, on 28 September 2022 my PPS discussed this with the Permanent Secretary's Office. <br/>The Permanent Secretary's Office, at the request of the Permanent Secretary, then asked PET for guidance (noting that their own initial view was that this was not a matter for civil servant involvement) and asked if they were aware of any precedents and for any advice. <br/>PET advised it was not an appropriate matter for civil servants to take forward. <br/>My PPS also rightly pointed out that I needed to be mindful to ensure that I did not ask a company to change their rules due to my position, which neither I, nor to the best of my knowledge anyone acting on my behalf, ever sought to do. <br/>My PPS confirmed that I could continue discussing the matter with Special Advisers, and asked them to pick up with me. I made no further requests of officials.<br/>I therefore later engaged with Special Advisers about how we would enable my participation in a way that would maintain my security and privacy. <br/>This was to determine whether there were other options possible within the overall framework and rules of the provider.<br/>My preference at this point, following consultation with my Special Advisers, was to attend a group course in person rather than online due to privacy concerns. <br/>Participation in a speed awareness course is supposed to be private, and Special Advisers raised concerns about the risk of me being covertly recorded while participating online, and the political ramifications of this. PO and the Permanent Secretary's officials also had previously advised that participating online risked generating media interest.<br/>However, Special Advisers raised concerns about the difficulties of ensuring the appropriate security arrangements for an in-person course. <br/>Their concerns included that my protective Security team might need to join me in the room or be unable to undertake appropriate vetting of other course participants owing to third party privacy concerns.<br/>Special Advisers then contacted the course provider to better understand the range of appropriate options that might be available - and consistent with the course provider's rules, policies and practices. <br/>Based on this further information, I concluded that none of these could satisfactorily address the aforementioned security, privacy and political concerns. I therefore opted to take the points and pay the fine, which I did in November.<br/>I accept that I was speeding and regret doing so. At no point did I try to avoid sanction. My actions were always directed toward finding an appropriate way to participate in the speed awareness course, taking into account my new role as Home Secretary and the necessary security and privacy issues that this raised. <br/>My interactions with officials intended to provide appropriate clarification of the options available to me in my role as Home Secretary. Whenever I was informed that a possible option was not available, I accepted that. At no point did I instruct officials to behave contrary to the advice that was provided.<br/>I considered the involvement of my Special Advisers appropriate, given the logistical, security, privacy, media, and therefore political considerations involved. I regret that my attempt to find a way to participate in the course in a manner that would have satisfied these concerns has enabled some to construe a potential conflict of interest. <br/>With hindsight, I acknowledge that the better course of action would have been to take the points and fine upfront.<br/>The Ministerial Code sets out that Ministers must provide a list of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. It does not define what should be included, but it does specify the different types of interests. <br/>These are all framed around the responsibility for avoiding a conflict of interest between Ministers' public duties and their private interests, and tend to relate to ongoing circumstances or relationships. Recognising the importance of integrity and transparency, I approach my declarations with great care and consideration.<br/>The purpose of the form is to declare anything which might interfere, or be perceived to interfere, with a Minister's integrity when making decisions in the public interest. I did not consider that a speeding infringement or attending a speed awareness course, needed to be disclosed. <br/>It is not an ongoing situation with the potential to influence my decisions. In general, minor driving offences tend to be excluded from official forms. For example, barristers are not required to inform the regulator of minor speeding infractions; similarly, these are excluded if you are asked about any criminal history when you apply for a visa to the UK, or in the annual security questions asked of civil servants in the Home Office with heightened security clearance. <br/>I note that PET has, since November 2022, introduced references to fixed penalty notices in their introductory discussions with new ministers, recognising that the position was unclear given these are not currently explicitly covered by Ministerial interest forms. I am grateful for this clarity, and in the future would declare any similar speeding course or fine.<br/>As I outlined, I informed my officials of the speeding and driving course, and the Permanent Secretary's office was involved in the conversations as described above, determining whether it was appropriate for civil servants to engage with the security and logistics of me attending this course. It was never suggested by anyone in my PO or the Permanent Secretary's Office that I needed to disclose the situation on an updated form. <br/>I also understand that, despite being aware of events at the time, at no point did the Permanent Secretary or Cabinet Office suggest that my actions resulted in a conflict of interest or merited any investigation.<br/>I am deeply committed to all the Nolan Principles of Public Life, including honesty, integrity and openness, and I regret that these events have led some to question my commitment. <br/>I have at all times been truthful and transparent, and taken decisions guided by what I believed was right and appropriate given my office, not by any personal motivation. Another principle, of course, is leadership: Ministers must hold themselves \u2014 and be seen to hold themselves \u2014 to the highest standards. I have always strived, and will continue to strive, to do this.<br/>As I say, in hindsight, or if faced with a similar situation again, I would have chosen a different course of action. I sought to explore whether bespoke arrangements were possible, given my personal circumstances as a security-protected Minister. <br/>I recognise how some people have construed this as me seeking to avoid sanction \u2014 at no point was that the intention or outcome. Nonetheless, given the fundamental importance of integrity in public life, I deeply regret that my actions may have given rise to that perception, and I apologise for the distraction this has caused.<br/>I hope this clearly sets out my involvement in this matter and provides you with all relevant information. Should you require any further information, I will of course be happy to provide it.<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>Suella Braverman<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Ms Murty subsequently said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income.<br/>While personally wealthy, Ms Murty has chosen a variety of designer and High Street brand clothes for her wardrobe.<br/>And her choices will come under more scrutiny in future, as her trip to Japan and appearance at other high-profile events, including the coronation of King Charles, shows.<br/>Akshata Murty has spent much of her life in the US and India, where her father founded one of the country's biggest companies. <br/>She studied economics and French in California and then earned a diploma at a fashion college before working at Deloitte and Unilever, and studying for an MBA at Stanford University.<br/>Her relationship with Mr Sunak began at the university's campus near San Francisco. <br/>In 2009, they married in a ceremony in the bride's home city of Bangalore, later hosting a wedding party in New York.<br/>In the years after graduation, they lived in Santa Monica, California, where they still own a penthouse apartment.

For MPs from the party, the data on voting intention highlights their thin support among younger generations.<br/>A YouGov poll found only 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019, compared to 67% in the over-70s category.<br/>In recent polling, done at this month's local elections, only 8% of the 18 to 24 group said they would vote Conservative.<br/>\"For the 29 to 49-year-olds, that figure was 10%,\" Mr Hancock tells the event.<br/>That 10% figure, Mr Hancock says, \"is catastrophic for the electability of the Conservative Party, not just now, but for a decade\".<br/>\"We need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about,\" he says.<br/>As a TikTok enthusiast with 184,000 followers on the platform, Mr Hancock claims to have an antenna for what young people are looking for in politics.<br/>Curbing climate change, providing more affordable housing, and technological innovation are what young people care about - not some \"divisive culture war\", Mr Hancock says.<br/>Even though he's been suspended as a Tory MP over his appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity, Mr Hancock is well received here.<br/>But does his analysis really reflect the hopes and fears of younger generations?<br/>At the event, we speak to five people under the age of 30, and tellingly, all of them say housing is their biggest worry.<br/>Eve Redmond, a 23-year-old renter who recently moved to London, says: \"I don't think I'll get on the property ladder in the next 10 to 15 years.<br/>\"I do think housing is a particularly important political issue for young people under the age of 30, millennials like me.\"<br/>Joe Lynch, the 18-year-old chairman of Romford Young Conservatives, agrees.<br/>\"We need more affordable housing,\" he says. \"If we can do that as a party, more young people can flock to us.\"<br/>He says the creeping Americanisation of British politics has damaged the Conservative brand.<br/>Some young people, he says, \"think we're all Make American Great Again lunatics, but that's not the case at all\".<br/>The perception among young people of being \"the nasty party\" troubles Nathan Stone, 20.<br/>He says the war against woke - a term that has come to symbolise conservative resistance to social changes - has been \"taken to the extremes\" lately.<br/>He says some of the ideas expressed at this week's National Conservatism Conference - an event organised by a right-wing American think tank - are \"not really going to appeal to younger people\".<br/>In his comments, Mr Hancock savages the \"Conservative Corbynistas\" in his party, who \"preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left\".<br/>\"Looking at what's going on at other conferences, sometimes it felt like 'I'm a Conservative get me out of here',\" he says.<br/>With Mr Hancock standing down as an MP at the next election, he soon will be out of there. And yet, he still believes the liberal wing of his party has the answers to today's political questions.<br/>They will need answers if they are to bridge the generational gulfs exposed at recent general elections. In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent.

For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods and companies pay tax on their profits.<br/>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens.<br/>But if it can't, it needs to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow. <br/>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.<br/>So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which it also hopes will help the economy.<br/>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.<br/>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. <br/>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.<br/>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. <br/>The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called \"quantitative easing\".<br/>The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. <br/>When people submit tax returns In January, often paying a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. <br/>So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date.<br/>In the 2022-23 financial year, the government borrowed \u00a3137.1bn. That was up by about 13% from the previous year.<br/>In April, the government borrowed \u00a325.6bn, which was the second-highest borrowing figure for April since records began in 1993.<br/>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently just over \u00a32.5 trillion. <br/>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.<br/>That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. <br/>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level.<br/>But in relation to the size of the economy, today's debt is still low compared with much of the last century, as shown above, and also compared with many leading advanced economies. <br/>The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. <br/>That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s. But it is more noticeable now that interest rates have risen. <br/>Two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: \u00a320bn in June and \u00a318bn in December. The third largest amount came in April 2023, hitting \u00a39.8bn.<br/>During the last financial year, the government put aside \u00a3106.7bn on debt interest - more than it spends on education. <br/>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  <br/>Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?<br/>Most economists and politicians agree that debt cannot keep growing compared to the size of the economy forever, because at some point it becomes impossible to pay the interest.<br/>But there is debate about whether or how fast to cut borrowing. <br/>Growing the economy is another way to bring down the main measure of the total national debt: its size compared to GDP. <br/>Governments often increase borrowing when they face unusually difficult situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, or the current cost-of-living crisis. <br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has blamed the \"twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine\" for driving up government costs.<br/>He has said it is \"vital [that] we stick to our plan to reduce debt over the medium term\".<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises.<br/>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.<br/>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. <br/>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. <br/>It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Europe, the Middle East, and the South Atlantic also saw significant increases in turbulence.<br/>Prof Williams said the increased turbulence was due to greater wind shear - or differences in wind speed - in the jet stream, a strong wind system blowing from west to east, about five to seven miles above the Earth's surface. It exists largely due to a difference in temperature between the world's equator and poles. <br/>While satellites can't see the turbulence, they can see the structure and the shape of the jet stream, allowing it to be analysed.<br/>Radar can pick up turbulence from storms, but clear-air turbulence is almost invisible and hard to detect. <br/>Turbulent flights are not only uncomfortable, but can also cause injuries for those on the flight. Severe turbulence is very rare, but clear-air turbulence can come out of the blue, when passengers are not belted in.<br/>\"Nobody should stop flying because they're afraid of turbulence, but it is sensible to keep your seat belt fastened all the time, unless you're moving around, which is what the pilots do,\" said Prof Williams. \"That is almost a guarantee that you will be safe even in the worst turbulence.\"<br/>There are also financial consequences. The aviation industry loses between $150m (\u00a3120m) and $500m (\u00a3400m) in the US alone annually due to effects of turbulence, including wear-and-tear on aircraft, said the researchers.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

The science is complicated and human factors like how we manage land and forests also contribute.<br/>But scientists say that climate change is making weather conditions like heat and drought that lead to wildfires more likely.<br/>Robert Scheller, professor of forestry at North Carolina State University, says: \"The climate signal is very strong.

He has been studying virgin births, known scientifically as parthenogenesis, for 11 years.<br/>Dr Booth analysed the foetus and found that it was more than 99.9 % genetically identical to its mother - confirming that it had no father.<br/>He told BBC News that he wasn't surprised by the discovery.<br/>''We see it in in sharks, birds, snakes and lizards and it is remarkably common and widespread''.<br/>He speculated that the reason that parthenogenesis has not been seen in crocodiles is because people have not been looking for instances of them.<br/>''There was a big increase in reports of parthenogenesis when people started keeping pet snakes. But your average reptile keeper doesn't keep a crocodile,\" he said.<br/>One theory is that it happens in species capable of parthenogenesis when numbers dwindle, and they are on the verge of extinction. And Dr Booth told BBC news that this may have happened to some species of dinosaurs when their numbers dwindled due to environmental changes.<br/>''The fact that the mechanism of parthenogenesis is the same in so many different species suggests that it is a very ancient trait that has been inherited throughout the ages. So this supports the idea that dinosaurs could also reproduce this way.<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Virgin births found in critically endangered birds<br/>Virgin-born sawfish found in Florida<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Aimee's blood sugar levels also worsened and her blood fat levels - lipids - went up.<br/>This was a short-term study on just one set of twins, but the results highlight growing fears among some scientists about the possible impact of so-called ultra-processed foods on our health, which BBC Panorama has been investigating.<br/>Prof Tim Spector, is a professor of epidemiology at King's College London, who studies trends in disease and oversaw the test. <br/>He told BBC Panorama: \"In the last decade, the evidence has been slowly growing that ultra-processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn't thought. <br/>\"We're talking about a whole variety of cancers, heart disease, strokes, dementia.\" <br/>The term ultra-processed foods - or UPF - was only coined 15 years ago but it makes up about half the things we now eat in the UK. <br/>From sliced brown bread to ready meals and ice cream, it is a group of foods made with varying - but often substantial - levels of industrial processing. Ingredients used, such as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, do not typically feature in home cooking. <br/>\"Ultra-processed foods are among the most profitable foods companies can make,\" says Prof Marion Nestle, a food politics expert and professor of nutrition at New York University.<br/>As our consumption of ultra-processed foods go up - the UK is one of the biggest consumers per head in Europe - so have rates of diabetes and cancer.<br/>Some academics think the link is not coincidental. <br/>Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health?<br/>Ultra-processed convenience foods contain chemicals that UK regulators say are safe, but Panorama investigates emerging scientific evidence of a link between some of these chemicals and cancer, diabetes and strokes.<br/>Watch on BBC iPlayer now, or on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Monday 5 June (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 23:10 in Wales) <br/>In January, one of the most comprehensive studies on ultra-processed food - by Imperial College's School of Public Health - was published in The Lancet medical journal.  <br/>The study of 200,000 UK adults found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods may be linked to an increased risk of developing cancer overall, and specifically ovarian and brain cancers. <br/>And, as of last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now cautioning against the long-term use of artificial sweeteners - citing potential health risks. <br/>It follows dozens of studies linking increasing consumption of UPF to increased risk of developing serious illnesses.<br/>But proving that specific ingredients cause human harm can be challenging - there are a range of other factors in our lifestyles that can cause these diseases. For example: lack of exercise, smoking or sugary diets.<br/>Common ultra-processed foods:<br/>The first investigations into mortality and consumption of ultra-processed food started in France at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord, as part of the ongoing study into the eating habits of 174,000 people.<br/>\"We have 24-hour dietary records during which they tell us all the foods, the beverages and so on, that they are eating,\" explains Dr Mathilde Touvier who heads up the study.<br/>The ongoing research has already published results showing UPF may drive an increased burden of cancer.<br/>More recently, they have been looking into the impact of one specific ingredient - emulsifiers - which act as a glue in ultra-processed foods to hold everything together.<br/>Emulsifiers are the Holy Grail for the food industry - they improve the appearance and texture of food, and help to extend the shelf life far beyond that of less-processed food.<br/>They're everywhere, in mayonnaise, chocolate, peanut butter, meat products. If you eat, you're likely to be consuming emulsifiers as part of your diet. <br/>BBC's Panorama was given exclusive access to Dr Touvier's early results.<br/>They are yet to be peer reviewed - a crucial verification step for scientific studies - but she said they are still concerning. <br/>\"We observed significant associations between emulsifier intake and increased risk of cancer overall - and breast cancer notably - but also with cardiovascular diseases,\" she says.<br/>This means that a pattern has been observed between consuming ultra-processed food and disease risk, but further research is needed.<br/>Despite the growing body of evidence, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) - which regulates the food industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has yet to issue any regulation restricting emulsifiers.<br/>When Panorama asked the FSA about the growing body of evidence that these additives could cause harm it said: \"We have not been presented with any evidence - by this programme or otherwise - of any specific emulsifiers which are believed to pose a risk to health.\"<br/>But the FSA said it planned to hold a public consultation. <br/>Could the food industry itself be playing a role in pushing back on regulation?<br/>The BBC Panorama team spent the past eight months investigating.<br/>\"Food companies are not public health agencies... their job is to sell products,\" food politics expert Prof Nestle told the BBC. <br/>She said the food industry has been known to fund research, sponsor experts and disparage existing studies to prevent regulation.<br/>The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is a body that receives funding from some of the world's largest food companies.<br/>It says its mission is to \"provide science that improves human health\" - but it has previously published studies globally undermining regulation and public guidance on healthy diets. In 2012, the European Food Safety Agency was so worried about potential conflicts of interest, it insisted anyone associated with ILSI either had to resign from the institute or leave the agency.  <br/>Prof Alan Boobis, emeritus professor at Imperial College London, is an unpaid director of ILSI Europe and a former vice president of its board of directors. But he also heads up a group of UK scientists, known as the Committee on Toxicity which provides advice on the risk of chemicals in food to the FSA.  <br/>More than half the members of the committee have recent links to the food or chemicals industries. And over the past 10 years, the committee hasn't supported a single restriction on the use of any chemical additive in our food. <br/>Prof Boobis told Panorama his advice wasn't slanted to favour industry, and he had always been \"totally committed to conducting and identifying the very best scientific research... whoever is funding it.\" <br/>The Food Standards Agency said it had a \"clear code of conduct\u2026 for declarations of interest\" and that it had \"no evidence\" bias has affected its decisions.<br/>ILSI said: \"[We] operate within a framework of the highest principles of scientific integrity.\" <br/>One of the most controversial additives in UPF is the sweetener aspartame. <br/>Two-hundred times sweeter than sugar, it has been heralded as a great low-calorie alternative - turning once unhealthy sugary drinks, ice cream and mousses into products marketed as \"healthy\".<br/>There have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.  <br/>Then, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of \"type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality\".   <br/>In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position. <br/>The Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results \"did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public\". <br/>Six years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.<br/>He discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame. <br/>And that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.  <br/>A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took \"the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations\".<br/>A spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: \"Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"<br/>The FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame. And the government says it is aware of the growing concerns around UPF and has ordered a review into the evidence on ultra-processed foods. <br/>Watch Panorama - Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health? - on BBC iPlayer and listen to 5Live listeners have their say with Nicky Campbell, Is ultra processed food okay?<br/>Ultra-processed food linked to early death<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Ordinary solar panels have a capacity of about 400W, so if you count both rooftops and solar farms, there could be as many as 2.5 billion solar panels.,\" says Dr Rong Deng, an expert in solar panel recycling at the University of New South Wales in Australia.<br/>According to the British government, there are tens of millions of solar panels in the UK. But the specialist infrastructure to scrap and recycle them is lacking.<br/>Energy experts are calling for urgent government action to prevent a looming global environmental disaster.<br/>\"It's going to be a waste mountain by 2050, unless we get recycling chains going now,\" says Ute Collier, deputy director of the International Renewable Energy Agency. <br/>\"We're producing more and more solar panels - which is great - but how are we going to deal with the waste?\" she asks.<br/>It is hoped a major step will be taken at the end of June, when the world's first factory dedicated to fully recycling solar panels officially opens in France. <br/>ROSI, the specialist solar recycling company which owns the facility, in the Alpine city of Grenoble, hopes eventually to be able to extract and re-use 99% of a unit's components. <br/>As well as recycling the glass fronts and aluminium frames, the new factory can recover nearly all of the precious materials contained within the panels, such as silver and copper, which are typically some of the hardest materials to extract. <br/>These rare materials can subsequently be recycled and reused to make new, more powerful, solar units.<br/>Conventional methods of recycling solar panels recover most of the aluminium and glass - but ROSI says the glass, in particular, is of relatively low-quality. <br/>The glass recovered using those methods can be used to create tiles, or in sandblasting - it can also be mixed with other materials to make asphalt - but it cannot be used in applications where high-grade glass is required, such as the production of new solar panels.  <br/>The new ROSI plant will open during a boom period for solar panel installations. <br/>The world's solar energy generation capacity grew by 22% in 2021. Around 13,000 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are fitted in the UK every month - most of them on the roofs of private houses. <br/>In many cases, solar units become relatively uneconomical before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. New, more efficient designs evolve at regular intervals, meaning it can prove cheaper to replace solar panels that are only 10 or 15 years old with updated versions. <br/>If current growth trends are sustained, Ms Collier says, the volume of scrap solar panels could be huge.<br/>\"By 2030, we think we're going to have four million tonnes [of scrap] - which is still manageable - but by 2050, we could end up with more than 200 million tonnes globally.\"<br/>To put that into perspective, the world currently produces a total of 400 million tonnes of plastic every year. <br/>The reason there are so few facilities for recycling solar panels is because there has not been much waste to process and reuse until recently. <br/>The first generation of domestic solar panels is only now coming to the end of its usable life. With those units now approaching retirement, experts say urgent action is needed.<br/>\"Now is the time to think about this,\" says Ms Collier. <br/>France is already a leader among European nations when it comes to processing photovoltaic waste, says Nicolas Defrenne. His organisation, Soren, partners with ROSI and other firms, co-ordinating the decommissioning of solar panels all over France.<br/>\"The biggest one [we decommissioned] took three months,\" Mr Defrenne recalls. <br/>His team at Soren has been experimenting with different ways of recycling what they collect: \"We're throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\"<br/>At ROSI's high-tech plant in Grenoble, the solar panels are painstakingly taken apart to recover the precious materials inside - such as copper, silicon and silver.<br/>Each solar panel contains only tiny fragments of these precious materials and those fragments are so intertwined with other components that, until now, it has not been economically viable to separate them. <br/>But because they are so valuable, extracting those precious materials efficiently could be a game-changer, says Mr Defrenne. <br/>\"Over 60% of the value is contained in 3% of the weight of the solar panels,\" he says.<br/>The team at Soren are hopeful that, in the future, nearly three-quarters of the materials needed to make new solar panels - including silver - can be recovered from retired PV units and recycled - to help speed up production of new panels. <br/>Currently there is not enough silver available to build the millions of solar panels which will be required in the the transition from fossil fuels, says Mr Defrenne: \"You can see where you have a production bottleneck, it's silver.\" <br/>Meanwhile British scientists have been trying to develop similar technology to ROSI. <br/>Last year, researchers at the University of Leicester announced they had worked out how to extract silver from PV units using a form of saline. <br/>But so far, ROSI is the only company in its field to have scaled up its operation to industrial levels.<br/>Moreover, the technology is expensive. In Europe, importers or producers of solar panels are responsible for disposing of them when they become expendable. And many  favour crushing or shredding the waste - which is far cheaper. <br/>Mr Defrenne acknowledges that intensive recycling of solar panels is still in its infancy. Soren and its partners recycled just under 4,000 tonnes of French solar panels last year. <br/>But there is potential to do a lot more. And he's making that his mission. <br/>\"The weight of all the new solar panels sold last year in France was 232,000 tonnes - so, by the time those wear out in 20 years, that's how much I'll need to collect every year.  <br/>\"When that happens, my personal goal is to ensure France will be the technological leader of the world.\"<br/>Listen to The Climate Question on BBC Sounds<br/>Why car parks are the hottest space in solar power<br/>The ambitious goal of Germany's solar-powered town<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Countries agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.<br/>Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires. <br/>But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.<br/>Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. <br/>Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. <br/>By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's \"more likely than not.\"<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average. <br/>Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas. <br/>For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world. <br/>Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure. <br/>Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.<br/>And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time. <br/>\"We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.<br/>\"I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,\" he told a news conference. <br/>The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed. <br/>\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas<br/>\"However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" he said.<br/>There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up. <br/>The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon with global implications. <br/>For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a event which has dampened climate warming to some extent. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>El Ni\u00f1o: How does it affect global weather?<br/>But the extra heat that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.<br/>However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.<br/>\"It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Ni\u00f1o that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,\" Prof Scaife told reporters. <br/>\"But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Ni\u00f1o and that might be the one that does it. \"<br/>The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters. <br/>Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.<br/>Unexplained ocean warming alarms scientists<br/>Wind is main source of electricity for first time<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday.<br/>Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem.<br/>It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.<br/>Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:<br/>Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. <br/>Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. <br/>Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.<br/>\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. <br/>\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. <br/>Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. <br/>Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.<br/>Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"<br/>How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.<br/>Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. <br/>\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.<br/>Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" <br/>\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  <br/>She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.<br/>Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.<br/>Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.<br/>\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.<br/>Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.<br/>\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.<br/>\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It's an important summary of six key pieces of research completed over the past five years. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the critical messages.<br/>The sober tones of this study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make clear that there is very little chance of keeping the world from warming by more than 1.5C. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid that. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s, despite all the political speechmaking.<br/>\"It has always been clear in the IPCC and in climate science, that it's not very likely that we always will stay below 1.5C,\" said Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team.<br/>Dr Geden and his colleagues now argue that coming back down as quickly as possible after overshooting this mark is where the focus should be. <br/>Overshooting is risky, as the report acknowledges, because it might trip tipping points that can't be uncrossed, such as the melting of permafrost that would in turn release vast amounts of warming gases.  <br/>Coming back from overshooting will need expensive, unproven technology to pull CO2 from the air, something known as carbon capture.<br/>It also means that it's even more urgent to get as quickly as possible to net zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere does not increase. Every increment of global warming and every year that goes by really matters. <br/>While the report doesn't definitively say it, there are some clear indications that there's no future for coal, oil and gas on a liveable planet.<br/>It highlights how renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar are now cheaper and that sticking with fossil fuels may be more expensive in many places than switching to low carbon systems.<br/>\"The message in terms of urgency, I think, is stop burning fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible,\" Dr Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors told BBC News.<br/>\"It is not because we are lacking some important piece of technology or some important knowledge. It is because so far, the sense of urgency has been lacking in the places where the important decisions are made.\"<br/>While it is easy to think that scientific reports on climate change are all about governments and energy policy, the IPCC has been moving to highlight the fact that the actions that people can take make by themselves make massive difference to the overall picture. <br/>\"We could cut 40 to 70% of projected 2050 emissions with end-use measures,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.<br/>This includes shifting to plant-based diets, avoiding flights, building more walkable and bikeable cities,\" she told BBC News. <br/>The report nudges governments towards reforming their transport, industry and energy systems so that making these low carbon choices becomes much easier and cheaper for individuals.<br/>It's amazing to think that the decisions we make around the world over the next seven years will echo down the centuries.<br/>The report warns that with sustained warming of between 2 and 3C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost \"almost completely and irreversibly\" over multiple millenia.<br/>Many other thresholds will be crossed at low levels of heating, impacting things like the world's glaciers. <br/>To stop this runaway train of warming, governments need to up their commitments before 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, in order to keep warming in or around 1.5C by 2100. <br/>\"I think our climate system, but also our social systems and our ecosystems, all show us that it's bloody urgent, so that we can still change the world to make it a better place for all of us,\" said Dr Otto.<br/>The real strength of the IPCC is that their reports are agreed with governments - and as such the reports are approved by their representatives in the presence of the scientists who research and write them.<br/>But the future of fossil fuels is becoming more and more a political question. <br/>Last November in Sharm el-Sheikh, a number of countries tried but failed to get the UN to agree to phase out oil and gas as well as coal. <br/>This argument is not going away - with the EU now openly supporting such a move.<br/>This new IPCC report will be central to it when countries meet again at COP28 in Dubai later this year. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.<br/>\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.<br/>Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.<br/>The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.<br/>\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. <br/>Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. <br/>Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\" <br/>The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.<br/>Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. <br/>It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. <br/>By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.<br/>Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. <br/>\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.<br/>\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.<br/>\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"<br/>The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. <br/>And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. <br/>\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.<br/>\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"<br/>The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". <br/>The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. <br/>They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. <br/>But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.<br/>Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.<br/>Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. <br/>\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Following their recent reunion, he said: \"It was as wonderful an experience this time as it was 50 years ago. I shall miss her.\"<br/>Other tributes were paid from across the worlds of the arts and politics.<br/>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who now sits in Jackson's former seat, tweeted: \"Devastated to hear that my predecessor Glenda Jackson has died.<br/>\"A formidable politician, an amazing actress and a very supportive mentor to me. Hampstead and Kilburn will miss you Glenda.\"<br/>Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, who worked for Jackson before becoming an MP herself, recalled the \"incredibly kind\" politician's \"cutting humour\" and \"general disdain at most things\".<br/>\"She was the definition of an icon, successfully spanning the world of acting and politics with great aplomb,\" Powell wrote.<br/>Broadcaster and former Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth said she was \"a wonderful actress, a committed politician [and] a remarkable human being\".<br/>\"We became MPs on the same day in 1992 & I treasure our unlikely friendship,\" he wrote. \"She was such a gifted, caring & special person who came into the world to make a difference - and did.\"<br/>A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was \"extremely sad news\", adding: \"His thoughts will be with her friends and family at this time.\"<br/>TV presenter Carol Vorderman said: \"To see this unique woman turn into a firebrand in politics was deeply impressive for young girls like me. May she rest in peace.\"<br/>Jackson began acting after joining an amateur dramatics group as a teen while working in Boots near her tome town of Birkenhead in Merseyside.<br/>She won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) in London, and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1963.<br/>After making her name on stage, she won her first Oscar for playing a headstrong artist in director Ken Russell's film of DH Lawrence's novel Women in Love.<br/>Her second Academy Award came three years later for A Touch of Class, a romantic comedy in which she played a fashion designer caught up in a catastrophic love affair with a US businessman. <br/>She did not attend either ceremony, though, saying she was busy.<br/>\"All awards are very nice to have,\" she told BBC Radio 4's This Cultural Life last year. \"But they don't make you any better.\"<br/>The role in A Touch of Class came about after she famously showed off her comedy skills in a guest appearance as Cleopatra on Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise's hit Saturday night TV show.<br/>\"I've always said, and I mean it, they were the apotheosis of my career, working with them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.<br/>She also played the Egyptian queen - more seriously - on stage in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra for the RSC.<br/>Sir Jonathan, who was also in that production, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Everyone will talk about her tremendous strength and courage and intelligence, [and] her wit.<br/>\"I worked with her twice in the 70s, and she was always direct, always honest. And, like the greatest art, her work was simple and uncluttered.\"<br/>In its tribute, the RSC described her as \"a tour de force in acting and politics, dedicating her life to both\".<br/>The company added: \"We're proud her extraordinary talent was seen on RSC stages early in her career in ground-breaking productions.\"<br/>Jackson played Elizabeth I in BBC drama Elizabeth R - another role she famously revisited - winning Emmys for both Elizabeth R and also playing the queen opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave in 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots.<br/>Further Oscar nominations came her way for portraying a frustrated office worker in a love triangle in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday, and for taking the title role in 1975's Hedda, adapted from Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler.<br/>Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote a biography of Jackson in 1999, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"She had such versatility.<br/>\"It's the quality of the work, and the variety. Her voice could go to gravel to caramel in three seconds.\"<br/>Former Labour MP Baronness Hoey told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When she came into Parliament, she was so modest. She never wanted to be reminded that she was an actress.\"<br/>Other credits included playing English poet Stevie Smith in Stevie, and as Hollywood icon Patricia Neal in The Patricia Neal Story.<br/>A staunch Labour supporter, she was approached to stand for Parliament - and said she agreed because she disliked former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the \"destruction that her policies has had on human beings\".<br/>There was a link between acting and politics, she said.<br/>\"The best theatre is about trying to find and tell the truth,\" she told Desert Island Discs. \"It's not about covering up. It's not about playing games. It's not about hiding. It's not about pretending you're something you're not.<br/>\"It's trying to find what it is to be a human being and why we behave towards each other in the ways that we do.

It's a wholesome celebration of friendship, tinged with heartbreak, that ultimately proves to be a crowdpleaser.\"<br/>Greatest Days is directed by Coky Giedroyc and written by Tim Firth, who has adapted his own stage musical, originally titled The Band.<br/>Bea plays Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who was a huge fan of Take That in her teens, along with her four best friends from school.<br/>When she wins tickets to see the group on their reunion tour in Athens, she reunites her old group, some of whom have not seen each other for 25 years. <br/>The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said: \"A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad.<br/>\"But it's a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it's at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies.\"<br/>The film features many of Take That's biggest hits, including Shine, Never Forget, Patience, Back For Good and Rule the World.<br/>However, the group are only referred to as \"The Boys\" in the film, rather than their real-life name.<br/>In a three-star review, Terry Staunton of the Radio Times said: \"At its root, director Coky Giedroyc's feel-good fare is a tale of everyday, ordinary women taking stock of their lives and pondering what the future holds.<br/>\"This being a film with the music of Take That at its foundation, viewers are guaranteed a succession of bangers; familiar and enduring hits whose anthemic qualities made them shoo-ins for a fresh lease of life on the West End stage in the first place.\"<br/>Total Film's Tom Dawson wrote: \"Giedroyc doesn't ignore life's inevitable sadnesses - along the way there are unexpected bereavements, family rifts, unfulfilled youthful dreams\u2026 It's the uplift that sticks, though.\"<br/>There was praise for the cast from Smooth Radio's Tom Eames, who said: \"Aisling Bea proves she can lead a film with charm and relatability, while there are standout 'watch this space' performances from up-and-comers Eliza Dobson and Jessie Mae Alonzo.\"<br/>Greatest Days is released in the UK on Friday, following its London premiere on Thursday evening. It received its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival last month.<br/>\"It may be fuelled by the schmaltzy lyrics of a boy band, but this is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of female friendship,\" said Screen Daily's Nikki Baughan.<br/>\"Aisling Bea brings a sharp wit (and essential levity) to the central character of Rachel; now a mid-40s no-nonsense children's ward nurse but, back in 1993, a 16-year-old school girl (played, in excellent casting, by Bea lookalike Lara McDonnell) and diehard fan of a boyband only ever referred to as 'The Boys'.<br/>\"Underneath the '90s vibes, colourful production design and occasionally cringey boyband lyrics, that's a deep-rooted sentiment that we can all take to heart.\"<br/>Yahoo's Roxy Simons said: \"As far as musicals go, Greatest Days is an enjoyable caper thanks to its fun reinterpretations of Take That's songs, like the airport-based rendition of Shine that features stylish choreography and elaborate costumes <br/>\"Some songs feel perfectly suited for the scene they're used in, but there are others that feel as if they were added on just as a way to make sure fan favourites weren't missed off the list. When this happens it can be quite jarring: the placement of Patience is a prime example of this.\"<br/>She concluded: \"It might not have the longevity of musicals like Mamma Mia! in the long run, but Greatest Days is sure to delight fans of Take That in a new and inventive way.\"<br/>You may also be interested in:<br/>Take That launch The Band with Lulu<br/>Take That musical to become a movie<br/>Mark Owen on the Take That songs he avoids playing<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Rupert Murdoch shut down the 168-year-old paper.<br/>In 2012, the Leveson Inquiry looked into the culture, practices and ethics of the press and published its recommendations.<br/>But that was more than a decade ago. Done and dusted, you might have imagined.<br/>Prince Harry has dragged the issue back into the spotlight. Perhaps only he has the celebrity, the drive - and the funds - to take on the tabloids.<br/>A new BBC documentary, Scandalous: Phone Hacking on Trial, offers up some context to his quest. And it suggests there are still some uncomfortable - and unanswered - questions for the British media.<br/>Actress Sienna Miller has spoken for the first time in depth and on camera about her experiences as part of the documentary.<br/>She settled a case with the Sun over phone hacking in 2021. News Group paid her a significant sum of money but made no admission of liability regarding what she alleged took place at the newspaper.<br/>At the time, she stood outside the Rolls Building of the High Court - the same court in which Prince Harry has been pursuing his case against Mirror Group in recent weeks - and said she had wanted to go to trial but didn't have \"countless millions\".<br/>People old enough to remember the early 2000s may have a hazy memory of the reports in question - an up-and-coming actress who was endlessly in the papers. Perhaps the least charitable will have viewed her as a wannabe who used a romantic relationship with a famous star to court fame.<br/>Her descriptions force us to question those assumptions.<br/>In a powerful and emotional interview, Miller tells the BBC: \"It was completely crazy, the number of stories that were coming out. And the number of accurate stories that were appearing in the press was baffling.\"<br/>Catapulted on to the front pages by a relationship with actor Jude Law, when he cheated on her with his children's nanny - who sold her story - it was all over the papers. Miller then discovered she was pregnant. That too was reported in the UK, having appeared first in a US publication. It made her decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy horrendously public.  <br/>\"I remember one photographer saying, 'Have you had your tits done to keep him?' And obviously I was pregnant\u2026 it was just awful,\" she said.<br/>\"I felt somebody must be selling stories. And I sat down the five people in our lives who knew and interrogated them violently. I was under such intense pressure.<br/>\"I remember my doctor's office phoning me and saying, 'We've sent the records that you'd asked for'. And me saying, 'I didn't ask for any records'.\"<br/>Miller's court case brought to light payments by the Sun to private investigators, such as \u00a3250 on 21 July 2005 for \"Sienna phone inquiries\". Or \u00a3950 on 3 August 2005 for \"Sienn's [sic] Miller pregnant research\".<br/>Dan Waddell, a paralegal involved in pursuing cases against News Group, tells the BBC he believes these are indicative of phone hacking and other unlawful information gathering, including blagging private information to discover her pregnancy.<br/>News Group also told the BBC it does not accept Miller's version of events, which it says is not borne out by evidence. It says it is limited in the response it can give while litigation is ongoing.<br/>The private investigator that allegedly accessed Miller's medical records denies \"blagging\" the doctor's office.<br/>News Group Newspapers, which owned the News of the World, has reportedly paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in costs and damages to settle phone hacking cases in recent years.<br/>The vast majority relate to the News of the World. News Group has never admitted that phone hacking ever took place at its daily tabloid, the Sun. But can we be sure it didn't?<br/>It has settled Sun-only claims - without admissions of liability - with Miller and at least five others. Former Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes and former footballer Paul Gascoigne were among the first.  <br/>Neil Wallis, who's worked in senior editorial positions at the Sun and News of the World, as well as its rival the Sunday People, says claims for civil damages are \"an industry\".<br/>He tells the programme: \"The main newspaper groups are caught between a rock and a hard place. If you spend \u00a31m on fighting that case, if you can settle it for \u00a3100,000 I'm afraid it's a no-brainer. It's cheaper to settle than to fight for the truth.\"<br/>He calls it a \"legal scandal\".<br/>Within the last year, News Group has also reached Sun-only settlements, again without any admission of liability, with jockey Kieren Fallon and two people who aren't celebrities: London 7/7 bombing survivor John Tulloch, and Patricia Bernal.  <br/>Bernal's daughter Clare was shot dead in 2005 by a man with whom she had had a three-week relationship. Five years after the murder, the police told Bernal the News of the World had hacked her phone and Clare's.<br/>Bernal tells the programme: \"It's quite unbelievable that individuals could go to such lengths at a time when a family is so grief stricken.\"<br/>There's also an interview with Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who went to prison in 2007 for phone hacking at the News of the World.<br/>Mulcaire tells the BBC that the interview has been a \"long time coming\". Some will view the statements of a convicted hacker as tainted. For the first time on camera, Mulcaire admits he also hacked for the Sun. <br/>He says: \"I listened to Heather Mills' voicemails for The Sun. I hacked not only the target, which in this case would be Heather Mills, but also friends and family and associates, so they could get access to material from voice messages left by Heather.\"<br/>News Group has told the BBC it denies it asked Mulcaire to hack for the Sun. It paid Mills a significant sum in 2019 to settle her claim ahead of a trial, admitting Mulcaire hacked for the News of the World.  <br/>It made no admissions over hacking for the Sun. <br/>We learned from Prince Harry's recent case against Mirror Group that it has paid out \u00a3100m in costs and damages to settle 600 claims of phone hacking since 2015.<br/>That was after a judge in a previous civil case ruled that interception of voicemails was widespread at its papers for a decade.<br/>MGN says: \"Where historical wrongdoing has taken place, we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.<br/>\"MGN is now part of a very different company. We are committed to acting with integrity and our objective in this trial is to allow both the business and our journalists to move forward from events that took place many years ago.\"<br/>Actress Shobna Gulati, best known for Dinnerladies and Coronation Street, was one of those who sued MGN in 2015.<br/>When you watch her interview for the new programme, you realise the impact of what happened to her - even now.<br/>A single mum, she describes how she could \"never figure out\" how the paparazzi knew where she was going to be. It led to rows with boyfriends as her relationships \"became fodder\" and fears those closest to her were selling stories.<br/>Gulati says she had hoped to find a partner and have some more children.  <br/>\"That hasn't happened because I've missed those years. I've missed those years because it was all very tumultuous, filled with paranoia and anxiety and mistrust, and you can't form relationships like that.\"<br/>It took many months to persuade people whose phones had been hacked to take part in the programme. As Miller puts it: \"The whole point of fighting these newspapers is because I was so keen to have my privacy. I feel a sense of duty to expose them as they have exposed us.\"<br/>It was a dark chapter in media history. It was also a very different time - when the tabloids were all powerful, when the right to some privacy was an afterthought, when the prejudices expressed in many newspapers were commonplace.  <br/>One of the most shocking things to watch out for are the headlines used when Simon Hughes was outed as bisexual. \"Limp Dem confesses.\" \"Another one bites the pillow.\" Terms that would never be used these days.<br/>Some argue that campaigners, many of them previously involved in Hacked Off, are using the legal system to have a go at the tabloids. They say there are conflicts of interest, not least that some stand to gain financially every time a case is successfully put through the courts. Other witnesses, they point out, are themselves convicted criminals.<br/>Wallis spent four years on bail as part of Operation Weeting, the Metropolitan Police investigation into phone hacking, before the charges were dropped.  <br/>He says what's happening is a \"campaign against journalism\", which could force parts of the British media out of business.<br/>\"You have just about anybody who's ever appeared in a tabloid newspaper saying, 'Give me large wodges of cash please'.\"<br/>Others believe the final reckoning is still unfolding.  <br/>In an alternative reality, perhaps Prince Harry would have married Chelsy Davy years ago and got on with royal life.<br/>Instead, he's leading the charge to bring about reform of the press.

I'm not sure which is the greater crime.\"  <br/>The large exhibition also includes a detailed model explaining exactly how Banksy managed to shred his Girl With Balloon painting during an auction at Sotheby's in London in 2018.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post<br/>The work had just been auctioned for \u00a31m, when an alarm went off inside the frame and the picture dropped into a hidden shredder. A malfunction meant that the destruction stopped just over halfway.<br/>Banksy declared that it was now a new piece of work titled Love Is In The Bin and three years later the original buyer sold it for more than 20 times what they had paid for it. <br/>Other exhibits include the Union Flag stab vest worn by Stormzy when he headlined Glastonbury in 2019 and pieces previously only seen in Bethlehem in the West Bank, including a pillow fight between an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian citizen.<br/>The artist's most recent solo show was 2009's Banksy versus Bristol Museum, which included a burnt-out ice cream van in the main entrance hall, playing out spooky sounds as a giant ice cream melted on its roof.<br/>Banksy has held an exhibition in Glasgow before. He was a relative unknown when in 2001 he jointly put on Peace Is Tough at The Arches venue, with Jamie Reid, famous for his design work with The Sex Pistols.<br/>The event is described as having been poorly attended but did feature early works including Monkey Queen. <br/>He also created a number of stencil-based works around the city, none of which still exist. <br/>The announcement for Banksy's new show says that \"the artist has been plagued by a number of unsanctioned global exhibitions in recent years\", a reference to events such as The Art of Banksy, which are completely unauthorised.<br/>The Art of Banksy, which returns to London in September, describes itself as \"the world's largest collection of original and authenticated Banksy artworks\" and states that is has had 1.5 million visitors around the globe. <br/>In a statement Banksy jokes: \"While the unauthorised Banksy shows might look like sweepings from my studio floor, CUT & RUN really is the actual sweepings from my studio floor.\"<br/>There is a reason why the exhibition is being held at Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art. <br/>In a sign welcoming people to the venue, Banksy explains that he brought the show here because his \"favourite work of art in the UK\" is right outside. <br/>He writes: \"For anyone who isn't aware - the statue out the front has had a cone on its head continuously for the past 40 odd years. Despite the best efforts of the council and the police, every time one is removed another takes its place.\"<br/>Banksy is referring to the 1844 statue of the first Duke of Wellington sitting on a horse. <br/>Members of the public have been placing road cones on the statue's head for more than four decades, making it a Glasgow institution, one which featured in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony when Glasgow hosted the event in 2014. <br/>The Lonely Planet travel guide once included it in a list of the Top 10 most bizarre monuments on earth. <br/>Now that road cone has brought Banksy back to Glasgow. <br/>CUT & RUN is on until 28th August and at weekends will stay open all night.

Two of those who went to the south London venue that night never came home, and their families are still waiting for answers about what happened.<br/>Social media footage showed long queues of people, many thought to be ticketless, trying to gain entry to the sold-out gig by Afrobeats artist Asake on 15 December.<br/>Nursing graduate Rebecca Ikumelo, 33, from Newham in east London, and security dog-handler Gaby Hutchinson, 23, from Gravesend in Kent, both died from the injuries they sustained in the crush. A third person, a 21-year-old woman, remains in a serious condition in hospital.<br/>\"She was stunning, so, so beautiful,\" says Rebecca's aunt Mary Ikumelo. \"Such a beautiful individual, not only on the outside but also inside.\"<br/>\"Rebecca was a bubbly person,\" says her mother Yetunde Olodo, 59. \"She was very outgoing, caring, loving. She was an amazing mother.\"<br/>Her children, aged seven and five, face growing up without her. \"She's got two young kids, they're missing their mom,\" says Yetunde.<br/>\"They don't really know what actually happened to their mom. We really want justice.\" <br/>Speaking to Rebecca's family, their pride at the work she did to support parents of autistic children shines through.<br/>\"A lot of women that reached out said the most amazing things about her, how she selflessly always had time for them,\" Mary adds.<br/>\"She would give them routines, she would just give them little gems on how to help their children with the autism. <br/>\"That's strangers reaching out to say how amazing an individual was so you can imagine how blessed the people to have her in their lives constantly were.\"<br/>Like Rebecca's family, Gaby's relatives have photographs and memories on social media to help remember Gaby.<br/>\"I feel that if you ever met Gaby while she was alive, you would never forget her,\" her mum Christine told the BBC. \"She would make a really big impression on you, hopefully a good one.<br/>\"My heart feels like it's broken. It's never going to mend again. I wish it had been me rather than her because she had a life to live and at least I've lived 60 years.\"<br/>Gaby's sister Nina described her sibling as \"a great soul\". The 32-year-old said: \"She had a lot of passion in there. She was a real laugh. She was just so loving and caring.\"<br/>Half a year on, Christine and Nina say it still does not \"feel real\". They both paid tribute to Gaby's selflessness.<br/>\"She never would have walked out there knowing someone else was in danger or needed help,\" Nina adds. \"She would have stayed and that's what she did. She's a hero, she really is. <br/>\"Maybe a stupid one, but she's our hero and we're grateful that we did get the time that we had with her.\"<br/>Both families want anyone with any information or footage to share it with police, who say they have spoken to hundreds of people who were there.<br/>\"We're angry that there are things that haven't gone right that has led to people dying or being seriously injured and we just want those people to have justice,\" Nina says.<br/>\"We want to know how it happened, we want to know why it happened,\" adds Mary, \"and then we just want to know how are we moving forward going to prevent this from happening to somebody else's daughter, mum, sister, niece.<br/>\"All we want is justice, for people to come forward and help us. Whatever they know, they should come and tell the police.<br/>\"It's really, really important for all of us as a community to stand together and to just make sure that this type of thing doesn't happen again.\"<br/>Brixton Academy's operator the Academy Music Group, which hopes the venue can reopen despite the Met's opposition, previously said it was \"devastated\" about the deaths and that it had \"engaged collaboratively\" with both Lambeth Council and the Metropolitan Police since the crush.<br/>Det Ch Insp Nigel Penney, the senior investigating officer, said a criminal investigation is being conducted involving a range of potential offences such as \"corporate manslaughter, criminal negligence manslaughter, unlawful act manslaughter and health and safety at work offences, along with violent disorder and offences against the person or assaults\".<br/>He said he was \"extremely confident\" police would get to the bottom of what happened - but explained that he needed more witnesses to \"help me piece together the puzzle as to how that crush ever happened in the first place\".<br/>He told the BBC hundreds of statements had already been taken but \"there were thousands of people there, so there's still a lot to do\".<br/>The detective said his message was a simple one: \"Come forward with anything you know, even if it's something you've heard.

I knew it wasn't criminal because it was me.

But Jackson was not easily flattered.<br/>Famously prickly, her view of Tinseltown often bordered on contempt. \"If I'm too strong for some people,\" she said, \"that's their problem\".<br/>And, at the height of her acting power, she gave it all up for a career in politics.<br/>Glenda May Jackson was born on 9 May 1936 in Birkenhead, in Wirral, the daughter of a bricklayer. <br/>She attended the local grammar school, leaving at 16 to work at Boots.<br/>Bored, she joined a YMCA drama group. \"I had no real ambition about acting,\" she later recalled.  \"But I knew there had to be something better than the bloody chemist's shop.\"<br/>Two years later, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).<br/>It was, according to one reviewer, her \"intense, sexually-charged talent\" that won her a place at the prestigious academy.<br/>She made an impression while still at RADA, when she appeared in a production of Terence Rattigan's Separate Tables. <br/>She followed this up with the traditional actor's apprenticeship, doing six years in rep.  She also had a small role in the 1963 film, This Sporting Life.<br/>By this time she had married actor and art dealer Roy Hodges. The couple had a son, Dan, who is a noted political commentator. <br/>She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1964. A year later, her big breakthrough came in Peter Brook's stage production of Marat/Sade.<br/>Jackson played the lunatic asylum inmate who finds herself acting the role of Charlotte Corday, the assassin of the French revolutionary, Jean Marat.<br/>David Edgar described her performance as that of a \"waif-like narcoleptic unable to control her behaviour, but also - completely believably - the differently-mad person playing Corday\".<br/>Jackson transferred with the production to Broadway and, in 1967, appeared in a film version - also directed by Brook.<br/>In 1969, she won her first Oscar, for best actress, in Ken Russell's adaptation of the DH Lawrence novel, Women in Love.<br/>The beautifully shot film became notorious for its nude scenes which, Jackson later recalled, she played with \"a prevailing sense of coldness\".  <br/>Her co-star Oliver Reed - hardly a shrinking violet himself - memorably described acting alongside her as like \"being run over by a Bedford truck\".<br/>The movie sparked Jackson's admiration for director Russell. Russell reciprocated, casting her in The Music Lovers, his biopic of Tchaikovsky.<br/>The film, which revolved around the relationship between the homosexual composer and his nymphomaniac wife - played by Jackson - was not a commercial success. <br/>But, according to one critic, the film was worth watching \"thanks largely to a powerhouse performance by Glenda Jackson, one actress who can hold her own against Russell's excess\".<br/>In 1971, having appeared as Elizabeth I in the historically dubious film, Mary, Queen of Scots, she reprised the role in BBC TV's Elizabeth R.<br/>The six-part series saw her play the Virgin Queen from princess to ailing old woman.  <br/>Jackson played the part with her customary intensity, even shaving her hair to accommodate the make-up required as her character aged.<br/>She was now firmly established as one of the world's foremost dramatic actresses.  She responded by sending herself up.<br/>One interviewer described her as \"so defiantly charmless that there is something oddly engaging about her, even vulnerable\".<br/>\"As for her sense of humour,\" they went on, \"it's by no means non-existent, but you often need long tweezers to find it.\"  But that did not mean she lacked comic timing.<br/>In 1971, she made her first appearance on the Morecambe and Wise Show - playing a comedy Cleopatra.  <br/>\"All men are fools,\" she declared with a flourish, \"and what makes them so is not having beauty like what I have got.\"  The audience loved it, and Hollywood took note.<br/>Soon she found herself cast opposite George Segal in a romantic comedy, A Touch of Class.  <br/>Jackson plays a British divorcee who has an affair with a married American, and falls in love. Her classy, understated performance won her a second Oscar.<br/>\"Stick with us,\" cabled Morecambe, \"and we will get you another one\". But - as with her previous Academy Award - she refused to go to Hollywood to pick up the statuette.  <br/>\"You don't do a play to compete for an award, \"she explained. \"I didn't win them. They were given to me.\"<br/>Jackson's marriage ended in 1976, after Jackson's husband sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery.  <br/>She did not deny it, but later noted that she had never been involved in a non-violent relationship.<br/>\"When I have to cry,\" she later said, \"I think about my love life. And when I have to laugh, I think about my love life.\"<br/>She returned to the RSC in the title role of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, directed by Trevor Nunn.  She was Oscar-nominated for the subsequent film version, which Nunn also directed.<br/>She also received plaudits for her role in Howard Barker's play, Scenes from an Execution, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1984 - which subsequently transferred to the stage.<br/>Jackson wowed the critics on Broadway when she appeared in Eugene O'Neill's melodrama, Strange Interlude.  It required her to be on stage for four hours, as her character aged from a naive teenager to embittered mother. <br/>The New York Times was ecstatic: \"She's equally mesmerizing as a Zelda Fitzgerald-esque neurotic, a rotting and spiteful middle-aged matron and, finally, a spent, sphinx-like widow happily embracing extinction.\"<br/>She joined forces with Russell again in 1989, with an appearance in The Rainbow.<br/>At the age of 56, Jackson announced she was quitting acting - to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate in the 1992 general election.<br/>\"The best theatre is trying to tell the truth,\" she said. \"And the best politics is trying to tell the truth.\"<br/>In an otherwise miserable election for her party, she won a notable victory in Hampstead and Highgate, which had been a Conservative seat for two decades.<br/>When Labour came to power in 1997, Jackson became a junior minister with responsibility for London Transport.<br/>She resigned two years later, to make a bid to become Labour's candidate for the London mayor, but was defeated by Frank Dobson.<br/>A left-winger by inclination, she became a fierce critic of Tony Blair's New Labour project and spoke out against the invasion of Iraq.<br/>In 2005, she threatened to stand against Blair for the party leadership unless he announced his intention to stand down.<br/>With boundary changes, Jackson clung on to her seat in the 2010 general election with a wafer-thin majority of 42.<br/>But the most controversial moment in her political career came in April 2013, when Parliament was recalled to pay tribute to the former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.<br/>Lady Thatcher had just died. But Jackson saw no reason to rein in her criticism of a woman she believed \"had inflicted heinous social, economic and spiritual damage upon the country\".<br/>Conservative MPs were furious when the Speaker refused to rule her remarks out of order. One political commentator accused the Labour left of being \"petty\", \"childish\" and \"self-indulgent\" with its ungracious attacks on the Iron Lady's memory. The writer was Jackson's son, Dan Hodges.<br/>Jackson decided not to defend her seat at the 2015 general election. And - at the age of 79 - she returned to acting.<br/>She played the 104-year-old Adelaide Fouque in a BBC Radio 4 production entitled Emile Zola: Blood Sex and Money.  <br/>And, in 2016 - a full quarter of a century after last treading the boards - took on the role of King Lear at the Old Vic.  <br/>\"My fear,\" she said, \"was that I would not have the physical or vocal strength\" to play one of Shakespeare's most challenging parts.  <br/>But the Daily Telegraph described her performance as \"one of those 11th-hour feats of human endeavour that will surely be talked about for years to come\".<br/>Two years later, she won a Tony Award on Broadway in a revival of Edward Albee's Three Tall Women.<br/>Chain-smoking and often barbed, she tolerated no fools. \"No-one does scorn like Jackson,\" said one shell-shocked interviewer.  <br/>But the writer Marilyn Stasio best summed up the experience of watching her act:  \"It is like looking straight into the sun,\" she wrote in Variety magazine.  <br/>\"Her expressive face registers her thoughts while guarding her feelings. But it's the voice that really thrills. <br/>\"Deeply pitched and clarion clear, it's the commanding voice of stern authority.  Don't mess with this household god or she'll turn you to stone.\"<br/>Jackson was winning accolades for her acting work as recently as 2020, when she won a Bafta TV Award for best leading actress for her performance in Elizabeth is Missing, about a woman suffering from dementia.<br/>Shortly before her death, Jackson completed filming The Great Escaper, in which she co-starred with Michael Caine.<br/>Sir Michael Caine leads tributes to Glenda Jackson<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Her job is done.<br/>\"I didn't realise I was a good screamer until I started working with the guys,\" she says. \"I'm now going to go home and gargle some honey.\"<br/>The filming takes place in a large professional studio with multiple sets on an industrial estate in Rochford - a far cry from Churchyard's earliest films, which were shot in family bedrooms.<br/>\"My first feature film, I Scream on the Beach, was shot over weekends with what we could spare from our earnings,\" the 35-year-old says.<br/>The crew is shooting scenes for two films - Mosaic, which has a budget of about \u00a37,000, and Video Shop Tales of Terror: Lust and Revenge, which Churchyard hopes to keep \"well under \u00a310,000\".<br/>Market studies show the horror genre is becoming increasingly popular with younger audiences, particularly in the US, where it is biting at the heels of the action film market.<br/>The independent horror scene depends on a mix of DVD, screenings at key festivals such as FrightFest and Horror on Sea and, increasingly, online streaming.<br/>\"There's a big appetite for independent, low-budget horror,\" says Churchyard, who works as a video editor during the week.<br/>It is an industry, he says, in which fans with the necessary passion and ability can help make the films they love. Fans, he says, like 48-year-old Singh Lall.<br/>By day Mr Lall works as a business studies teacher at a local secondary school. By night (or in this case weekend) he is the producer of Video Shop Tales of Terror: Lust and Revenge.<br/>\"I've been a genre fan for as long as I can remember,\" says Lall. \"I used to stay up late with my mum watching Hammer films and that led to horror festivals.\"<br/>It was through networking at those festivals that he got the chance to make Video Shop Tales of Terror two years ago.<br/>\"If somebody had told me I'd be producing horror films five years ago, I would have said, 'never in a million years',\" he says.<br/>\"But that's the beauty of this - anybody can pick up a camera and create something and there are outlets, festivals and fans. I am one of them.\"<br/>Lauren Jane Barnett and Tony Mardon have travelled to the Essex set from London to help out.<br/>When Mardon, usually a director, learns one of the female cast members has not been able to make it, he puts on a short sequin dress and a red wig to cover the part<br/>\"Everybody helps each other; it is just how it is. Doing stuff like this is great, though I don't usually wear a dress.\"<br/>\"And it is a lot of fun,\" says film historian Barnett, who moved to the UK from North Carolina 13 years ago.<br/>\"I grew up watching B movies and because I met Tony through my work, I ended up in his film The Witches of the Sands and, because everybody knows each other, I'm here to help out.<br/>\"Acting is an accidental part of the journey.\"<br/>Make up artist Alex Gent, a former newspaper journalist, has a lot on his hands.<br/>\"I've been told we want somebody turned into a robot, I've got somebody I've got to kill off quite graphically and I know I've got some wounds and injuries to inflict during the day,\" he says.<br/>Among the most grizzly of the injuries on his job sheet is what's known as a \"face pull-off\", in which the actor's face appears to be ripped away from their head.<br/>\"Once you've got the tools and the confidence you can actually do things quite easily,\" he says.<br/>The robot outfit created by Gent was worn by Andrea Rose.<br/>Thus far in her horror career, the softly-spoken actress is most often cast as a sinister feminine aggressor or a zombie.<br/>\"People say they just can't imagine me as a scare actor, but I just love it,\" she says.<br/>Today, she after playing the robot, she then plays a victim.<br/>\"It is really nice to be a victim because I'm usually the sinister one.\"<br/>Chris Mills and Annabella Rich are rising stars in the indie horror scene and have travelled from Portsmouth and Chichester to perform.<br/>Mr Mills, 33, will be playing a space cop and a character called Joshua, a delinquent son, who will be joining the rest of his family for a festive meal.<br/>\"We love horror, we really do,\" says Mr Mills. \"We absolutely live and breathe it.\"<br/>\"The independent horror scene in the UK is just so inclusive and fun,\" says Ms Rich, 27. <br/>\"Quite a lot of the big actresses started out in horror.<br/>\"A lot of people turn their noses up at it, but it is great and has one of the best fan bases around.<br/>\"The films are some of the only ones you can make on such a low budget and will see a great return.\"<br/>Photography: Laurence Cawley<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

It was one of several songs on a cassette labelled \"For Paul\" that Lennon had made shortly before his death in 1980. <br/>Lo-fi and embryonic, the tracks were largely recorded onto a boombox as the musician sat at a piano in his New York apartment.<br/>Cleaned up by producer Jeff Lynne, two of those songs - Free As A Bird and Real Love - were completed and released in 1995 and 96, marking the Beatles' first \"new\" material in 25 years.<br/>The band also attempted to record Now And Then, an apologetic love song that was fairly typical of Lennon's later career, but the session was quickly abandoned.<br/>\"It was one day - one afternoon, really - messing with it,\" Lynne recalled.<br/>\"The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish.\"<br/>Sir Paul later claimed George Harrison refused to work on the song, saying the sound quality of Lennon's vocal was \"rubbish\".<br/>\"It didn't have a very good title, it needed a bit of reworking, but it had a beautiful verse and it had John singing it,\" he told Q Magazine.<br/>\"[But] George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it.\"<br/>There were also said to have been technical issues with the original recording, which featured a persistent \"buzz\" from the electricity circuits in Lennon's apartment.<br/>In 2009, a new version of the demo, without the background noise, was released on a bootleg CD. Fans have speculated that this recording may not have been available in 1995, suggesting it was stolen from his apartment, along with other personal effects, after his death.<br/>In the intervening years, Sir Paul has repeatedly talked about his desire to finish the song.<br/>\"That one's still lingering around,\" he told a BBC Four documentary on Jeff Lynne in 2012. \"So I'm going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days.\"<br/>It would seem that technology has now afforded the musician a chance to achieve that goal.<br/>The turning point came with Peter Jackson's Get Back documentary, where dialogue editor Emile de la Rey trained computers to recognise the Beatles' voices and separate them from background noises, and even their own instruments, to create \"clean\" audio.<br/>The same process allowed Sir Paul to \"duet\" with Lennon on his recent tour, and for new surround sound mixes of the Beatles' Revolver album to be created last year.<br/>\"He [Jackson] was able to extricate John's voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\" Sir Paul told Radio 4's Martha Kearney. <br/>\"We had John's voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI. They tell the machine, 'That's the voice. This is a guitar. Lose the guitar'. <br/>\"So when we came to to make what will be the last Beatles' record, it was a demo that John had [and] we were able to take John's voice and get it pure through this AI. <br/>\"Then we can mix the record, as you would normally do. So it gives you some sort of leeway.\"<br/>However, the musician admitted that other applications of AI gave him cause for concern. <br/>\"I'm not on the internet that much [but] people will say to me, 'Oh, yeah, there's a track where John's singing one of my songs', and it's just AI, you know? <br/>\"It's kind of scary but exciting, because it's the future.

I need a fresh start. So I moved away,\" he said. <br/>\"The week I moved down to England I got signed to Patrick Topping's [Trick] label and my career just kind of went from there.<br/>\"But I've never forgotten where I come from.

He now tries to emulate the \"soulful and raw\" 90s sound of that scene. <br/>In April his two great passions - dance music and Ayr - finally collided when he staged the Pavilion Festival in his home town. <br/>With the help of STREETrave, which was responsible for some legendary club nights in Ayr in the 80s and 90s, they brought 7,500 ravers to Ayr for the inaugural festival.<br/>He said it was \"biblical\" to work with the experienced promoters, who were returning to the Ayrshire coast for the first time in 30 years.<br/>\"I had no idea how to run a festival. I just had an idea in my head,\" he said. <br/>\"I can always picture stuff like that but you never know how it's going to turn out until you have the people there and it's all set up. I just never thought it was going to happen.\"<br/>McVicar headlined the two-day event alongside acts like Skream, Kettama, Karen Dunbar and Optimo Espacio.<br/>\"It's all about celebrating being Scottish and having a good time,\" the DJ said. <br/>His house rules were: \"Don't be a dafty\". <br/>\"It worked,\" he said. \"Everyone was so lovely and it was a credit to the punters that came to Pavilion.<br/>\"I've put faith in my hometown and they've given that back to me tenfold.\"<br/>He said he wanted to give a boost to a town which had seen a downturn in fortunes since he left. <br/>\"I want folk to have belief and see a different part of Scotland which doesn't normally get talked about,\" he said. <br/>The event was a huge success - and now the leader of South Ayrshire Council has backed plans for the festival to be held annually over the next five years. <br/>But McVicar is being secretive about his future plans for Pavilion. <br/>\"All we're focusing on is making the experience as good as it can be on the site and hopefully we'll increase the capacity a little bit - just a little bit every year.\"<br/>Although he can now add \"successful festival organiser\" to his CV, he is not letting it distract from his music. <br/>He's working on a new album and a collaboration with one of the world's most famous DJs and record producers. <br/>\"I'm writing an album right now and me and Calvin Harris have got a track on it right now... that's an exclusive, by the way, I've not told anyone that,\" he said. <br/>They're both Scottish - Harris is from Dumfries - but they're from \"different realms\", according to McVicar. <br/>\"We both play different music but the amount of respect I have for him, for everything he's done and the fact he's Scottish as well is just insane.<br/>\"And then when he saw me he was like: 'Its good to finally meet you.' He's lovely\u2026 what a lovely guy he is.<br/>\"I'm looking to release the album next year and I think it's going to be a huge turning point in me going from Ewan McVicar, the wee happy DJ, to actually folk taking me a bit more seriously. <br/>\"It's not just fun anymore.

A love of music has shaped both her life and her approach to design, she says.<br/>\"This morning I went up to my design studio and they were playing heavy rock. I looked up at the girls and said, 'Soz, I'm changing it.'\"<br/>Choosing the right music to create the right \"buzz\" for clients who come to visit her west London studio is of the utmost importance to Kelly Hoppen.<br/>Music sets the mood for them, but it also helps her get creative. \"It has to be a certain music for me to get into the zone to design,\" she explains.<br/>In fact, it's often through discussion of music that the decisive creative breakthroughs with clients are made.<br/>\"I say to them, 'If you wanted your room to sound like a piece of music, what would it be?'\" she says. \"Some don't understand the question, but others say, 'Oh, 100%, Say A Little Prayer for You by Burt Bacharach.' And I get that! <br/>\"I can't explain why, but music is design to me.\"<br/>In a career that spans five decades, Hoppen, 63, has established herself as one of the UK's best-known interior designers. She is famed for her neutral palette, Zen-like greys which are meant to create a relaxing ambience. <br/>Many of her celebrity customers have been musicians, including Victoria Beckham, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and, most recently, Boy George.<br/>Her job is to figure out what they really want, which isn't always straightforward. Boy George visited her home and explained the decor he was after.<br/>\"I said, 'I'm absolutely convinced you don't [want that],\" recalls Hoppen.<br/>But by speaking to him she found out the deeper feelings he was looking for, which gave her clues on how to express his personality in home decor - which is very different to his flamboyant stage persona, she points out.<br/>It's the part of the job she loves, getting into a client's head like a psychologist, she says.<br/>The language of music is part of her method for \"getting the information\" she needs.<br/>Hoppen was born in South Africa, where her mother is from, but with her British father the family moved to London when she was two.<br/>They went back to visit her grandparents during holidays, and her grandmother's elegant home was another design inspiration for her.<br/>In the mid-1970s, aged 16, she decided to \"run away\" back to South Africa on her own. <br/>Her parents had divorced and she was living with her father after falling out with her mother. When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour. (\"But in my own home? Nope.\") <br/>Apart from her design consultancy, her business empire also includes her best-selling books, which explain some of her design secrets.<br/>The jobs that come into her studio tend to be from high net-worth clients, or companies that cater to them. Her customers have not been particularly affected by the cost of living crisis, she says.<br/>She is aware of \"the divide\" that exists between her clientele's design needs, and the day-to-day concerns of most people.<br/>But she is equally passionate about improving home design for those on smaller budgets, she says, and has built a large following on Instagram, sharing ideas about how to do it.<br/>Interior design doesn't have to involve spending money, she says. You can create impact by small things like changing cushions, or rehanging pictures.<br/>\"I'm such a geek about it, if I could go into everyone's homes and help with the changes, I would. I'd love to be that magician.\"<br/>People have come to appreciate their homes more now as \"sanctuaries\" since the pandemic and lockdowns, Hoppen believes.<br/>And one thing that music and good interior design at home have in common, she's realised, is that they both have the power to influence your mood and have a positive effect on your mental health.<br/>You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

A new streaming series shows what became of the characters.<br/>The Full Monty film opened with a shot of a derelict Sheffield factory, and ended with a group of former employees hauling themselves off the scrapheap to stage a strip show in a working men's club.<br/>Twenty-six years on, the new Disney+ series opens with a shot of the same working men's club. It's now derelict too.<br/>A quarter of a century may have passed, but not much has changed.<br/>And despite the 1997 film's uplifting ending, it turns out that most of the six friends have only narrowly avoided dereliction themselves. <br/>They are led by lovable rogue Gaz, played by Robert Carlyle. The actor says that after years of industrial decline, when the film came out there was a sense of optimism in the UK, thanks to New Labour, Cool Britannia and Britpop. \"It seemed to be that things can only get better.\"<br/>That didn't last long, though, Carlyle continues. \"The past 25 years have been really tough for people. Twenty-five years, it seems, of austerity that's really chipped away at these characters and their lives.<br/>\"It's chipped away the infrastructure in the country as well. And I think the show reflects that.\"<br/>Gaz is now a porter on a psychiatric ward, while best mate Dave (played by Mark Addy) is a caretaker at the school where his wife Jean (Lesley Sharp) is headteacher. Both fertile settings for storylines about a crumbling state.<br/>Meanwhile, Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) and Horse (Paul Barber) have been left behind by modern life, and Lomper (Steve Huison) runs a caf\u00e9 called Big Baps with his husband - although that name soon gets cancelled.<br/>Only Guy (Hugo Speer) seems to have prospered, now the privately-financed pantomime villain.<br/>However, he disappears half-way through the series because the actor was himself cancelled after Disney investigated \"allegations of inappropriate conduct\" on set. The actor denied that and said he \"didn't believe I'd done anything wrong\".<br/>The gang are joined by William Snape - who played Gaz's son Nathan in the film - and Talitha Wing, who has been cast as Gaz's daughter Destiny.<br/>At 26, Wing is the same age as the film. She familiarised herself by watching it with her grandparents. \"I thought we'd find different bits funny,\" she says.<br/>\"But we all actually were laughing at the same bits. So the humour and people coming together in times of hardship, I guess, is something that transcends time and generations, and is a story that everyone can understand.<br/>\"Even though I might not have been around at the time that it was going on, I feel like you can take the message and apply it to whatever is going on [today]. And unfortunately in some instances, not that much has changed.\"<br/>The eight-part series has been co-written by Simon Beaufoy - who was nominated for an Oscar for the original - and Alice Nutter.<br/>They have been able to put a wide range of issues \"in a package and still make it funny\". Carlyle says. \"That's the genius of Simon's writing. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.\"<br/>With the main characters now in their mid-50s to mid-70s, the South Yorkshire-set comedy-drama resembles what might emerge if Ken Loach directed Last of the Summer Wine.<br/>In a three-star review, The Telegraph's Michael Hogan said the new version \"firmly wears its politics on its sleeve - with mixed success\".<br/>\"The issues will be all too recognisable, especially to those in neglected communities,\" he wrote.<br/>\"If the optimism of the original... has gone, that's the point - this is a sobering reminder of how far we haven't come.\"<br/>Collider's Chase Hutchinson described it as \"a slightly baggy series elevated by the charm of flawed characters just trying to find their way in the world\".<br/>He concluded that \"the overall experience is a mirthful yet melancholic one worth riding along with\".<br/>While having eight episodes does make the series \"slightly baggy\" (there are major plots about a Britain's Got Talent-winning dog, a lost racing pigeon and a Job Centre siege), it does provide more time for characters like Jean.<br/>\"In the 90 minutes that was the film, naturally and rightly the story had to be about that group of men, who were all trying to live with being made redundant,\" Sharp says.<br/>\"What's fantastic about revisiting it is that instead of having 90 minutes, you've got eight hours to explore in detail what has happened subsequently to all of those characters. And yes, that includes a lot of really vibrant, whip smart women - young and older. <br/>\"So I think it's great that the original film, which was male centric, is now being ameliorated by the presence of some really interesting older and younger women.\"<br/>While revisiting a beloved film is a surefire way to attract eyeballs, it also comes with expectations.<br/>\"Revisiting anything can be fraught with complication,\" Sharp accepts. \"But because the film had been so loved and because Simon obviously wanted to continue telling the story of those characters, it felt like it was an enormous opportunity.\"<br/>One plot line that gets relatively little screen time is stripping. \"Well, nobody really needs to see that,\" smiles Addy. \"It's about so much more.<br/>\"That was our starting block and it's interesting to see where these characters have gone from there.\"<br/>Much of the film's appeal, though, came from the idea of stripping, if not the act itself - as a clever way to give the men a liberating and cheeky opportunity to shed society's limitations and regain control of their lives.<br/>Its feel-good power was such that the film has spawned a number of celebrity charity spin-offs - see The Real Full Monty on Ice - as well as inspiring amateur fundraisers.<br/>\"There are still men who get together and do the Full Monty for charity,\" Carlyle notes. \"And I think that's an amazing thing. If The Full Monty has done nothing [else] and it was only that, then it is worth it.\"<br/>The actor originally feared the film would bomb because it was such a tough shoot. \"You'd go home at night thinking, what is this? Is this funny? Is this anything?\" he says.<br/>\"I thought, this is never going to work. Of course, the finished article proved me wrong.\"<br/>This time, filming was \"relatively easy\", he says. \"It really was beautiful to see the guys again, because you look in each other's faces and you see life, you know, in the lines in their face. And that was lovely.<br/>\"And the thing is, The Full Monty has been like a huge big warm shadow that's followed me my whole career. There's only about four or five other people in the world that understand that. And it's those guys. It was fantastic to be back doing all that again.\"<br/>The Full Monty is on Disney+ from Wednesday 14 June.<br/>Striking Full Monty writers picket own premiere<br/>First images of new Full Monty series released<br/>The Full Monty to return as TV series<br/>Stars go the Full Monty on stage<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Tory shot Meg.\"<br/>Megan told the courtroom Lanez had offered her $1m to keep quiet about what happened, and called her afterwards to apologise, claiming he was \"just too drunk\".<br/>Through tears, she said she had regrets about coming forward, saying speaking out had been \"torture\".<br/>Lanez was convicted in December of three charges: assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.<br/>Prosecutors are seeking a 13-year prison sentence and the 30-year-old faces deportation to his native Canada.<br/>But he still hasn't been sentenced.<br/>On 13 June, a judge accepted his lawyer's request to delay the sentencing until 7 August to give them more time to prepare their recommendations.<br/>During the brief court hearing, Lanez - wearing an orange jail outfit and black cap - mostly kept his head down and barely made eye contact with anyone.<br/>Outside the court, Lanez' supporters stood opposite crowds of fans carrying \"We stand with Megan\" signs.<br/>And as Megan arrived at the building, his side heckled her by shouting: \"Why are you lying on that boy?\"<br/>Accusations of lying have dogged the Grammy-winning rapper throughout the case, because her story changed early on.<br/>She initially told police she'd been hurt by stepping on broken glass.<br/>It wasn't until later, on Instagram, when she first said that Tory had shot her. <br/>She then told an interviewer she'd needed surgery to remove bullets from her feet which had missed her bones and tendons.<br/>Megan, 27, said she lied to officers at the time because she didn't want to \"get in more trouble\". <br/>It sparked a long war of words between her and Lanez - they both released tracks about the case.<br/>In his song Money Over Fallout, Lanez accused Megan of trying to frame him, while Megan said she was the one \"speakin' facts\" in her track Shots Fired.<br/>The dispute spilled out into the wider hip-hop world, with artists like 50 Cent and even Drake getting involved.<br/>Megan frequently defended herself on Twitter and said she'd been painted as aggressive and a \"snitch\".<br/>She suggested misogynoir - misogyny against black women - could be why she was targeted.<br/>Megan criticised Drake when he released Circo Loco, a collab with 21 Savage that appeared to reference the shooting case.<br/>But she did receive support from fellow artists, like JoJo and Kehlani. <br/>And a group of prominent black women, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, released an open letter backing Megan.<br/>In Da Club rapper Fiddy eventually apologised for sharing memes casting doubt on Megan's version of events.<br/>He said he'd changed his mind after hearing evidence from the trial.<br/>Lanez has always denied the charges against him, he's filed various appeals and his lawyers could launch other motions after his sentence.<br/>Since the guilty verdict, Megan has tried to reclaim the narrative around the shooting, and spoken about the effect \"false narratives\" and \"conspiracy theories\" had on her.<br/>In an Elle Magazine feature, she said the guilty verdict \"was a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them\".<br/>\"We can't control what others think, especially when the lies are juicier than the truth,\" she said.<br/>\"But as a society, we must create safer environments for women to come forward about violent behaviour without fear of retaliation.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. <br/>50 Cent sorry for Megan Thee Stallion lying claims<br/>Tory Lanez guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion<br/>Megan Thee Stallion testifies Tory Lanez shot her<br/>Megan Thee Stallion shooting trial begins in LA<br/>Megan Thee Stallion living with bullet fragments in feet<br/>Megan Thee Stallion 'scared' after 2020 shooting<br/>Megan Thee Stallion 'told to dance before shooting'<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory. <br/>\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.<br/>She has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart. <br/>Meanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed. <br/>The synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.<br/>Prof Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos. <br/>\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\" <br/>Most countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.<br/>However, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.  <br/>Dr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development. <br/>\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\" <br/>Legal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.  <br/>Researchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.<br/>Prof Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.<br/>\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\" <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Cases have fallen by more than 99% since the late 1980s and about 20 million people who would have been paralysed can walk thanks to vaccines. <br/>The original or \"wild\" poliovirus is now contained to small pockets of Afghanistan and Pakistan and the oral vaccines play a pivotal role in the attempt to rid the world of polio. <br/>\"The issue is they're genetically unstable,\" Dr Andrew Macadam, from the UK's MHRA, told BBC News.<br/>It takes only one mutation to turn the safe polio vaccine back into a virus that can move out of a child's stomach, invade their nervous system and cause paralysis. <br/>And if those viruses spread from an immunised child - through their contaminated faeces - there is a risk of infecting the unvaccinated and triggering an outbreak. <br/>There are now more cases of \"vaccine-derived polio\" than of the wild poliovirus and the polio detected in London's sewers last year was connected to the oral vaccine. <br/>So the researchers have genetically altered the weakened virus even further to make it much harder for it to start causing paralysis again. <br/>\"By genetically modifying this part of the virus, we could modify this region so it couldn't revert and this I think has been remarkably successful,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Prof Raul Andino, from University of California San Francisco, said he was \"super-proud\" of the scientific effort showing the vaccine was \"50 to 100 times more stable\".<br/>In March 2021, the World Health Organization made the researchers' vaccine against type-two polio available for emergency use. Since then, it has been used more than 650 million times. <br/>Now, in the journal Nature, the researchers have detailed the creation of stable vaccines against polio types one and three. <br/>The first-stage human trials of the upgraded vaccines have already been conducted - and, the researchers say, the data, which is still being analysed, is \"very promising\". <br/>The trio represent the first new polio vaccines in 50 years. <br/>\"I don't think there's any question that they're helpful, the new vaccines address the instability question, but it doesn't address the coverage issue,\" Dr Macadam said.<br/>Tackling the last 1% of polio cases has proven stubborn. The original goal was to completely eradicate polio by the year 2000 - but delivering vaccines to some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden parts of the world has been a challenge. <br/>Prof Alan Barrett, from the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, at the University of Texas, called the \"super-engineered\" vaccines a feat of \"impressive science\".<br/>\"[But] will it lead the endgame to the finish line? That is a big question,\" he added.<br/>Joseph Swan, from the World Health Organization and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said more stable vaccines were a \"significant part\" of the plan for a polio-free world.<br/>But, he said: \"Simply having these new and better tools will not get us over the finish line - vaccination, not just vaccines, is what will end polio.\"<br/>There was now a \"unique opportunity\" to eradicate wild poliovirus - but vaccine-derived polio outbreaks were causing problems in places facing \"complex humanitarian emergencies\", in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Yemen. <br/>The oral polio vaccine is no longer used in the UK and other countries with established healthcare systems as they have moved to the polio injection.<br/>Follow Jameson Twitter. <br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The hot weather was already causing high demand for urgent services - and people should avoid the sun at the hottest time of day and drink plenty of fluids.<br/>Alongside heat-stroke, hot weather also brings an increase in heart failure and kidney problems as well as high rates of sprains and fractures and respiratory problems.<br/>Consultants are being drafted in to provide cover during the strike but the amount could be lower than during previous junior doctors' strikes, in March and April.<br/>Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health bosses, said a particular challenge this time was \"securing the level of consultant cover\" - because of the amount consultants were asking for overtime payments - creating uncertainty over how many appointments would need to be postponed.<br/>The four-day April walkout saw about 196,000 hospital appointments and treatments postponed. And the hospital waiting list, growing since the start of the pandemic, has now hit a record 7.4 million people.<br/>\"Each wave of strikes chips away at the NHS's resilience, impacting on staff, internal relationships and their ability to deliver on government pledges to reduce the elective backlog,\" Mr Deighton said.<br/>NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the strike would have an \"enormous impact\".<br/>\"The NHS is facing significant disruption this week, with a three-day strike that is set to be exacerbated by the ongoing hot weather,\" he said.<br/>\"Emergency, urgent and critical care will be prioritised this week but some patients will unfortunately have had their appointments postponed - if you haven't been contacted to reschedule, please do continue to attend your planned appointment.<br/>\"As ever, use 999 and A&E for life-threatening emergencies - and NHS 111 online for all other health conditions.\"<br/>While hospitals are expected to bear the brunt of the disruption, community services, including GPs, will be much less affected.<br/>Dr Tom Corkery-Bennett is in his second year as a junior doctors and works in the A&E at Royal Berkshire Hospital.<br/>He works an average of 48 hours a week, but can put in up to 60 and regularly receives messages asking if he can take on extra shifts.<br/>What has happened to pay was a major factor in the staffing shortages, the 26-year-old said, and \"grossly unfair\".<br/>\"The resilience in the system is so low - staffing levels are skeletal,\" Dr Corkery-Bennett said.<br/>\"There is very often situations where doctors call in sick for a nightshift and there's no cover available.<br/>\"It means there's a large number of patients without a doctor to cover them and care is really put in jeopardy.  <br/>\"One doctor will cover the work of two or three doctors if there's no contingency plan in place, which very often happens, and that's unsafe.\"<br/>Junior doctors want a 35% pay hike to make up for 15 years of below-inflation rises.<br/>In talks last month, the government offered an extra 5%, which Health Secretary Steve Barclay called \"fair and reasonable\", adding the \"extremely disappointing\" walkout would put patients at risk.<br/>Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said he wished the strikes were not going ahead, but added the reason for them was \"because they haven't got someone to negotiate\". <br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the strikes should be viewed alongside the broader range of issues affecting doctors, such as retention and career progression, but would not be drawn on what salary Labour would offer doctors if in government.<br/>\"I really do fear what the state of the economy will be by the time of the next general election - I can't yet be sure what the state of the public finances will be and at the moment I'm fearing the worst.\"<br/>Prof Powis told the same programme that other discussions held between government and other NHS employees showed it was possible to resolve disputes, but the \"key is talking\". <br/>BMA junior doctor leader Dr Vivek Trivedi said the offer from government \"beggars belief\" given inflation had reached double-digits this year. <br/>\"Junior doctors are in despair at this government's refusal to listen,\" Dr Trivedi said.<br/>\"We have made clear that junior doctors are looking for the full restoration of our pay. <br/>\"The NHS can only function with a workforce that is properly valued.\"<br/>BMA Deputy Chair Emma Runswick told the BBC that doctors' roles had become more important since 2008 and that they were \"not willing to accept that further pay cuts is all the government can give us\". <br/>This walkout affects services in England only - but junior doctors in Scotland have this week announced they too will be going on strike, after a vote by BMA members.<br/>A strike ballot for consultants in England is also being held. And Royal College of Nursing members are voting on whether to continue their industrial action, after joining the minority of health unions to have rejected the government's offer of 5% plus a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655.<br/>Have you had your treatment cancelled?

when they were running around to correct their mistakes, which they have done. <br/>\"So it was really something which has upset me so much.\"<br/>Ms Pattison, who worked for CPFT as a health care assistant at the time, made a formal complaint to the trust.<br/>The BBC has separately spoken to consultant nurse and psychotherapist Des McVey, who was asked by the trust to investigate a complaint in July 2021, understood to be the one from Ms Pattison.<br/>Mr McVey said: \"I noticed that the deceased did have care plans, but they were written the day after his death and they were also evaluated the day after his death and I was concerned that this wasn't picked up by the SUI.\"<br/>He said this \"really alarmed me\", adding: \"Surprisingly, there was no care plan to address his suicidal ideation and he had... an extensive history of trying to kill himself.\"<br/>He was also concerned about the methodology used to investigate possible racism by comparing the death to two Caucasian suicides, which he said \"demonstrated a poor understanding of the complexities of institutional racism\".<br/>Mr McVey said he told a manager he believed the SUI \"was not credible\" and said he could not complete the complaint investigation.<br/>He said he made them aware of his view \"that the risk assessment was so remarkably wrong, that they hadn't answered to why they'd taken him off the [community treatment order] against the advice of his current team\".<br/>He said they \"had made so many speculative conclusions without any evidence, in fact sometimes evidence to the contrary\".<br/>But Mr McVey said no-one contacted him for six or seven weeks, before finding out the investigation had been given to someone else.<br/>Mr McVey left the trust in early 2022 but said in June he contacted the new chief executive, Anna Hills, to raise his concerns \"that there was possibly criminal activity going on, falsification of documentation and that the SUI was un-credible\".<br/>Ms Hills said an investigation would be completed but he has not heard back, he claimed.<br/>Mr Ndhlovu's mother, from Newmarket, Suffolk, said: \"I believe that if everything worked well Charles' death was going to be preventable, because there were so many things... to avoid his death.\"<br/>CPFT has previously been criticised by a coroner over a serious untoward incident concerning the death of James Nowshadi, that it was \"not credible\" and had taken matters on \"face value\".<br/>The co-author told the inquest that a reference to the method of Mr Nowshadi's suicide was removed after the review was \"touched up\" by others.<br/>Mr McVey said CPFT needed have an external audit into their serious untoward incidents, stating: \"How many un-credible SUIs have been done by the trust?\"<br/>In response to the allegations, a spokesman for CPFT said: \"The death of Mr Ndhlovu was tragic, and our continued condolences are extended to his family.<br/>\"Patient safety and the learnings from all deaths are vital to us to enable improvements in care.<br/>\"While there was a delay in investigating a complaint made by Mr Ndhlovu's mother - for which we sincerely apologised - those concerns were rigorously investigated in 2022, and a further review was conducted by our director of nursing following concerns raised to the new CEO.<br/>\"Over the past year, we have strengthened our processes around complaints and incidents, and the learnings from the review have played an important role in that.<br/>\"While there was no evidence of any racial discrimination towards Mr Ndhlovu during his treatment, we take any accusation of prejudice in our practices extremely seriously and will always fully investigate concerns raised.\"<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Check on those who may be more vulnerable, such older people and babies.<br/>Here's what you need to know about the effects of heat on the body and how to stay cool.<br/>As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.<br/>This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. <br/>At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. <br/>This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:<br/>If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.<br/>Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.<br/>It is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. <br/>But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.<br/>It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.<br/>As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.<br/>The UK Health Security Agency has some tips:<br/>Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.<br/>If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.<br/>NHS advice says: <br/>However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.<br/>It is a medical emergency and you should call 999.<br/>People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. <br/>Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.<br/>Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. <br/>Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.<br/>People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.<br/>Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.<br/>Diuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.<br/>Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.<br/>Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.<br/>And other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. <br/>There are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year.<br/>Most of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.<br/>The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.<br/>However, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than \"peak summer\".<br/>This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.<br/>The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In England just 61% of patients start treatment in that time against a target of 85%.<br/>Growing delays are, in part, the flip side of a medical success story.<br/>Scientific progress in cancer care has been remarkable, with cutting-edge drugs offering hope where previously there was little that could be done.<br/>New techniques are more effective but often far more complex for doctors to deliver.<br/>At the same time the UK population is getting older - and as cancer risk is strongly linked to age it means more more demand for expensive scanners, along with more staff to analyse those scans, and more specialist doctors and nurses. <br/>The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a perfect storm - and says the workforce is struggling to keep up.  <br/>Across the four UK nations, it calculates there is now a 15% shortfall of specialist cancer doctors - or clinical oncologists - who deliver chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <br/>Without action, it says this gap will grow to 25% - or a shortage of 368 full-time consultants - by 2027.<br/>Just as concerning is an even larger shortage of consultant radiologists - highly trained doctors who interpret scans to diagnose cancer or monitor its progression.<br/>The RCR says for each month a patient waits to start cancer treatment, the risk of death is increased by about 10%. <br/>In its annual survey, 44% of cancer service managers say they are now \"highly concerned\" about patient delays, up from 29% in the previous year.<br/>\"There are examples in almost every cancer centre where parts of the service just aren't running as well as we would like,\" said Dr Tom Roques, a consultant oncologist and vice-president of the RCR.<br/>\"We're having to tell patients all the time that we can't quite treat them as quickly as we would like, or in the way that we'd like, and that's a stressful thing to have to do.\"<br/>Kevin O'Hara, 60, from County Durham, broke five ribs in a motorbike accident last November. <br/>A scan of his upper body also picked up a shadow near one of his kidneys that was later diagnosed as cancer.<br/>He was offered drug treatment meant to slow the growth of the tumour and - in early February - was told the waiting list for surgery would be three to four months. <br/>That period has now been and gone but he is still waiting for a date for his operation. <br/>\"Every day you are waiting and waiting and nothing changes,\" he said. <br/>\"I come home from work and go to the door and, when there's no envelope that says NHS on the top, I just get so depressed.\" <br/>There is another trend in cancer care which is often overlooked.<br/>The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in people coming forward to get checked after spotting a possible symptom such as an unusual lump, strange mole or unexplained weight loss.<br/>The reasons for that are complex and include a bounceback in demand since Covid, stronger guidance for GPs to refer to cancer specialists, major NHS publicity drives and the work of campaigners such as \"Bowelbabe\" Deborah James.<br/>Cancer doctors view the spike in demand as a \"very good thing\", as a growing proportion of patients are now diagnosed earlier when cancer is easier to treat.<br/>But it also puts more pressure on NHS services, with waiting times for diagnosis and other scans one of the key bottlenecks in the system.<br/>Since Christmas there have been some signs of progress, with the NHS in England reducing the backlog of long waits for treatment and hitting one of its other standards - for faster diagnosis - for the first time. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>In Blackpool, the NHS has hit its skin cancer targets by changing the way patients are diagnosed, in an approach which is now being rolled out across England. <br/>The RCR also says there is a \"chink of light\" - with recruitment of oncologists rising over the last three years, particularly in parts of the country with the worst staff shortages.<br/>It wants each UK nation to increase medical school places and training posts, and says more also needs to be done to stop experienced staff cutting their hours or leaving the profession early. <br/>The Department of Health said that the total number of full-time staff in the cancer workforce in England had risen by 51% to 33,093 since 2010.<br/>A spokesman added: \"We want to build on this progress and will publish a workforce plan shortly to ensure we have the right numbers of staff, with the right number of skills.\"<br/>The Scottish government is also expected to publish its new 10-year cancer strategy within weeks, setting out ways to attract and retain more staff.<br/>The Welsh government recently published a cancer improvement plan and says it is now investing heavily to train more staff and build more diagnostic and treatment centres.  <br/>In Northern Ireland, the health department said it is \"extremely disappointing\" that cancer targets are being missed. It has recently opened two new rapid diagnostic centres and started a \"cancer strategy workforce review\". <br/>Data visualisation by Liana Bravo.<br/>Follow Jim on Twitter.<br/>Has your treatment been affected by the junior doctor strikes?

But vaping's helped millions of people to ditch traditional cigarettes.<br/>It's widely considered less harmful than smoking tobacco - and the UK government endorses vapes as a quitting aid.<br/>But what do you do when you want to take the next step and quit completely?<br/>The main reason vaping gets you hooked is nicotine - the same ingredient that makes smokers crave cigarettes.<br/>It's thought to be pretty harmless on its own, but is powerfully addictive. That's why vaping isn't recommended for non-smokers.<br/>Nicotine creates new receptors in the brain when it enters the body, and you quickly come to associate it with feeling good.<br/>So when you stop getting it you'll feel cravings. These tend to be worse in the first three to four days after your last dose.<br/>According to the NHS, other withdrawal symptoms, like bad moods, are likely in the early stages of quitting.<br/>There's no firm answer to this - it varies for each person - but there are some things we do know.<br/>It's technically possible to go \"cold turkey\" and suddenly stop vaping. But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

As a new documentary series follows union leaders up close, the BBC's economics editor asks whether this surge in strikes is likely to persist.<br/>\"Listen, don't fall out with each other. Don't fall out with each other. It's really important everybody sticks together,\" says Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, as tensions flare on a bus drivers' picket line. <br/>The Abellio drivers in two south London depots had been offered a 12% pay rise and a \u00a3500 bonus - splitting opinion among drivers, who had been striking without full pay for 10 days. <br/>One driver later says: \"The union rep, they're selling us out\u2026 there's a lot of traitors around.\" <br/>Others say: \"We got screwed\" and \"we've been here for two months freezing and we're dying\". They would eventually win an 18% rise. <br/>Settlements such as this one have been occurring in so-called shortage sectors, such as driving buses, lorries, and rubbish trucks, since the beginning of last year. Many of those settlements went under the radar, in very local disputes or even, as here, in individual depots. <br/>The past year across industry and public services has seen hundreds of ballots, hundreds of thousands on picket lines, dozens of negotiations, double-digit pay claims and awards, and major legal battles between the government and public sector unions. <br/>Only 15 months ago, No 10 were slapping down the governor of the Bank of England for saying that people should not ask for excessive pay rises. Four months before that, the then-prime minister was celebrating the prospect of a high-wage Britain for all. <br/>And this time last year Ms Graham, the general secretary of the biggest private sector union, had never done a broadcast interview in that role. She and her colleagues are now household names after promising a \"summer, autumn, spring and winter of discontent\". <br/>Strike: Inside the Unions<br/>With access to top union leaders, the two-part documentary follows internal machinations at Unite, RMT and the RCN, as well as the GMB's campaign to win recognition at Amazon in Coventry. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). The first episode will be on BBC Two at 21:00 on 25 May, with the second a week later.<br/>Part of Boris Johnson's survival strategy had involved squaring up to the unions over their pay claims and seeking to direct blame towards the Labour Party. <br/>But the unions calculated that the old pattern of mutually dismissive relations between organised labour and government had altered since the pandemic and in the shared pain of a common cost of living crisis. The last year raises questions not just about that relationship, but whether something has changed in the water in the way the UK thinks about industrial relations. <br/>Looming over all of this are the restrictions on ballots in the government's anti-union laws. The documentary shows how unions have got around restrictions requiring postal ballots and high thresholds on turnout. <br/>The pattern over the past year has been unions breaking down national disputes into a series of far smaller local and sectoral ones, for which it is easier to win ballot mandates. Action is then co-ordinated across localities on the same day, giving the impression of massive national or regional walkouts, as with bus drivers across London. <br/>The other pattern is that of the private sector settling high wage claims in areas of labour shortages. <br/>Unite has a unit of forensic accountants assessing the profits and available cash flow of the parent companies, often foreign-owned, of the employers involved in disputes. In this case the owner was effectively the Dutch state (though it has now sold its stake), a fact routinely used by the union in online campaigning. <br/>The experience in the public sector has been different. This time last year, there was no negotiation. The Pay Review Body process had recommended a settlement of around 3% across public services. This was often before the spike in inflation to double digits following the Ukraine war. <br/>Prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss dug in on the issue. At first, so too did the Sunak administration, fearful of the fiscal cost and inflationary potential of significant rises in the wage costs of state employees. <br/>The cameras were with Royal College of Nursing (RCN) General Secretary Pat Cullen ahead of the first strikes in its history.<br/>The RCN itself had been asking for a 19% rise for nurses. The government said at that time it could not shift from the recommendation of the Pay Review Body and was not negotiating. <br/>\"It's never, ever going to get a resolution to this dispute,\" Cullen said later. \"The last meeting that I had with the secretary of state, he arrived accompanied by five men and it was not a pleasant meeting. It was quite a bullyish conversation.\" Cullen said nurses had concluded that they were being treated differently because \"we are 90% female\". <br/>And she said a government minister had told her in a meeting that they were surprised nurses needed to live off their salaries: \"And you know, ministers coming into the room saying to me that they're shocked that nursing staff may be the main breadwinner in the family. Because they believe that it's a second salary that we don't depend on. They are totally out of touch.\" <br/>The Department of Health said it did not recognise the claim and had \"utmost respect\" for all staff. <br/>Nurses in the RCN in the end rejected the deal recommended by their own union - a sign of how strongly a large swathe of public sector workers felt about the squeeze in their real wages. <br/>The film shows how nurses felt emboldened by large-scale public sympathy, especially since the pandemic. <br/>This perception of support, even in less popular professions than the NHS, has helped underpin double-digit pay claims. The successful tactics in the private sector of balloting first for strike action in order to gain negotiating leverage in pay disputes has also spread to the public sector. <br/>Some union bosses also acknowledge that in an era where more workers can work from home, the strikes may not have disrupted the public as much. While the overall number of strikes has not been seen for a generation, the total number of days lost to strike action is nowhere near the highs of the 1970s. <br/>Nonetheless, some in the union movement are trying to push into new territory too, such as the GMB at Amazon. <br/>Outside the company's Coventry warehouse, Stuart Richards, a senior GMB organiser, is attempting to recruit new members.<br/>A US training video cartoon for Amazon managers leaked in 2018 certainly made clear that \"we do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders, or most importantly, our associates\" - its term for workers.<br/>But the staff arriving by car have been squeezed hard by the cost of living crisis - one tells of having to pawn a wedding ring - and some were willing to U-turn near the entrance to their workplace and sign up to Richards' campaign. <br/>Eventually the GMB get more than half the Coventry workforce, which the union estimates at 1,300 in total, and serve a letter demanding recognition from the Amazon bosses - it is the first site in the UK to do so, after a decade of trying.<br/>So the question really is whether the current spike in strike activity is entirely a reaction to rampant inflation or whether this is something that might have a longer-lasting impact. <br/>The full data is not yet available, but it is difficult to escape a pattern of unionised workplaces, especially in shortage occupations, getting double-digit pay settlements. <br/>They have responded to existing strike restrictions by moving to immediate localised ballots, even before starting negotiations. On the other hand, insiders say that membership spikes during pay disputes, but then falls back when pay deals are done. Union subs are another expense during a cost of living crisis. Official figures will come next year. <br/>There are some concerns, though, about the persistence and stickiness of inflation. Even the Bank of England, which began last year warning about excessive pay rises, now couples that message with concerns about corporate pricing and profits, a similar message to that pushed by some union leaders. <br/>And the political economy of all this does appear to be changing. <br/>Bashing the unions has proven tricky for the government over the past year. David Cameron's union tsar Lord Richard Balfe argues that PMs Johnson and Truss should have sued for peace with public sector workers much earlier. The opposition felt confident enough to announce it would repeal the new \"minimum service level\" laws as well as older restrictions on ballots, if it wins power. <br/>This current wave of industrial action appears to be calming, but is not yet over. The government is trying to settle pay deals it had previously left to Pay Review Bodies. Inflation may also now be falling sustainably. But the shadow of this year of industrial action may linger for some time.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me.

But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab?

That's a good thing for communication, for families and for most people.\"<br/>Face coverings were first recommended in healthcare settings in June 2020.<br/>The requirement to wear them in other places, such as on buses and in shops, was then introduced later as the country opened up after Covid lockdown measures. <br/>This legal requirement ended in April last year but guidance for health and social care settings was kept in place.<br/>Now staff, patients, service users and visitors will no longer be routinely asked to wear face masks in these settings.<br/>The BBC has heard from people with health conditions who have concerns about the latest relaxation of the rules.<br/>Brian Keeley, from Aberdeen, had a heart transplant in 2013 and takes medication every day to suppress his immune system and prevent organ rejection.<br/>Although he expects medics in immunotherapy settings will continue to wear masks, Brian frequently has appointments in other healthcare settings where he fears people may not be as careful.<br/>He said: \"I go to clinic every six months, but I also have to go to the GP, to respiratory appointments, local clinics to give blood samples, vaccinations clinics that are full of people.<br/>\"These are things we have to do anyway and nobody there knows the level of vulnerability of people. <br/>\"I was at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary recently and everyone there was wearing face masks.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They offer greater protection against severe disease or death. <br/>China claims to have made about half of all the world's Covid vaccine stock. But the government has not given approval to foreign-produced mRNA vaccines for general use in mainland China. <br/>BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer to produce a Covid vaccine, has also worked with a Shanghai-based company, Fosun Pharma, to develop the same mRNA-based vaccine.<br/>This has been made available to German nationals living in China, and is also available in Hong Kong and Macau. However, it is not currently authorised for the Chinese mainland market.<br/>China is reported to be developing its own mRNA vaccines, and although one has been given approval for emergency use in Indonesia, it is not being used in China at the moment.<br/>When asked about the EU offer to send surplus stock of its mRNA vaccines, a Chinese official spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China already had an adequate supply of vaccines.<br/>\"China's Covid situation is predictable and under control,\"\u2002she told a news conference on 3 January.<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.<br/>The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses.<br/>While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. <br/>More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.<br/>Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.<br/>The aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.<br/>Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.<br/>However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.<br/>Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.<br/>Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%.<br/>Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.<br/>Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%.<br/>When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%.<br/>There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.<br/>Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.<br/>The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.<br/>In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.<br/>Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. <br/>Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light.<br/>The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. <br/>In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. <br/>French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved.<br/>Will a vaccine give us our old lives back?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The more Covid that is circulating, the more chance there is for the virus to mutate. <br/>But new variants can pop up anywhere - the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India have all been the likely origins of previous variants of concern.<br/>So will the new Covid test restrictions make any difference?<br/>Several countries are asking travellers from China to produce a negative Covid test in order to gain entry. <br/>The US said this would \"slow the spread\" of the virus, while scientists worked to identify any potential variants that may emerge. But no-one is suggesting that this will stop Covid cases coming in. <br/>Italy has gone further, and is imposing mandatory post-arrival PCR tests on travellers from China. Those that test positive will need to quarantine for several days. <br/>This has the advantage of enabling genomic sequencing of the virus, and so aids the search for new variants. But it will also add to airport congestion.   <br/>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that those travellers from China who have tested positive so far are carriers of \"Omicron variants already present in Italy\". Italy wants an EU-wide approach on the issue - but the EU's disease agency says, for many reasons, that is \"unjustified\".<br/>In the UK, there is plenty of Covid about. Probably well over a million people a week are getting infected, either at work, home or socialising - in other words anywhere people gather. The latest ONS survey estimated that around 1 in 45 people had the virus earlier this month.<br/>But most of the UK population is very well protected from severe illness, via a combination of vaccines and repeated natural infection.<br/>That means Covid - while still a potential danger here - is no longer the threat it once was.  <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Hope and worry as Beijing relaxes zero-Covid policy<br/>How many Covid cases are there in China?<br/>US demands Covid tests for visitors from China<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. <br/>If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. <br/>The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. <br/>How many people have had boosters so far?<br/>Covid map: Where are cases the highest?<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>UK's ex-PM Johnson deliberately misled MPs over Partygate<br/>Inside North Korea: 'We are stuck, waiting to die'<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>How to teach Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets<br/>The man at the centre of India's huge wrestling row<br/>Is the US trying to kill crypto?<br/>Beyonc\u00e9 blamed for inflation surprise in Sweden<br/>Paul McCartney\u2019s unseen photographs<br/>Trump's court drama turbo-charges his campaign<br/>Kidnapped and tortured on Iran-Turkey border <br/>Tech Decoded: The latest news direct to your inbox<br/>Tech Decoded is the BBC's international technology newsletter, bringing you the latest twice a week<br/>The 1998 film that predicted the future<br/>What is an 'orchid' parent?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.
