Get in touch.<br/>The rise in the minimum wage had had a \"significant\" impact on the April pay figures, said Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the job search engine Adzuna.<br/>The minimum wage - known as the National Living Wage - rose to \u00a310.42 an hour in April for those aged 23 and over.<br/>\"Nearly two million workers in the UK saw an almost 10% increase in pay this spring,\" Mr Hunter told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>Workers in multiple industries have held strikes since last summer as pay rates fail to keep pace with inflation. But the gap is narrowing as inflation starts to fall. <br/>The Bank of England has warned sharp pay rises are likely to prolong the UK's still-high rates of inflation. The cost of living rose by 8.7% in the year to April, more than four times the Bank's 2% target. <br/>Mr Hunter said: \"Your average worker will be delighted that their pay on average is going up, but that's not necessarily a good thing for inflation.\"<br/>The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, told the House of Lords economic affairs committee that the latest figures on jobs showed the the labour market was \"very tight\".<br/>\"We've had a fall in the supply of labour, which is showing signs of recovering, but very slowly, frankly,\" he said.<br/>\"One of things firms pretty much universally say to me and have been saying to me for a little while, is that they find it so hard to recruit labour in the current market, they are not going to release labour.\"<br/>The market interest rate for the UK government to borrow money over two years is now effectively higher than it reached in the aftermath of Liz Truss's mini-budget. It is also the highest level for a decade and a half and now clearly higher than seen for the US government.<br/>The fact that this is not the same market panic as last autumn will come as little respite to many people renewing their mortgages.<br/>All this reflects market expectations that the UK has a specific problem with stubborn and sticky inflation that will require higher interest rates for longer. Some market bets now see a half percentage point rate rise next week, and rates settling closer to 6% than 5% at the end of the year.<br/>There is an important difference to the mini-budget aftermath. The moves are being seen mainly in short-term rates. The real problem last autumn was for longer term 10- and 30-year borrowing, which saw significant moves in yields, the result of a loss of market confidence in the then-government's tax and spend plans. Current rates for such long-term borrowing are still well below that market panic.<br/>Today's move is more like a steady squeeze as the markets come to terms with the idea of the Bank of England keeping rates higher for longer had been expected, and above rates seen in similar economies.<br/>Read more<br/>Figures from the ONS also showed that:<br/>The UK economy is currently struggling to grow as the soaring cost of living and rising interest rates squeeze households. But the jobs market remains resilient.<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: \"Rising prices are continuing to eat into people's pay cheques - so we must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year to boost living standards.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Family finances are being squeezed to breaking point by a further fall in real wages, and record numbers of people are out of work due to long-term sickness.\"<br/>1.

Get in touch and share your experiences.<br/>Savills said data from the first three months of the year showed buy-to-let investors had already been squeezed, with net profits falling below 4% - the lowest since 2007. That compares with profits of as much as 23% when rates were at ultra-low levels during the last decade.<br/>It said that larger landlords could be the most likely to stay in the sector.<br/>Savills research suggests 1.9 million properties are owned by 620,000 landlords aged over 65, with a further 1.9 million owned by landlords aged between 55 and 64.<br/>They could choose to leave, meaning tenants would have less choice, Mr Cook said.

The Bank also recorded a rise in people falling behind on mortgage repayments.<br/>Since then, mortgage rates have climbed for borrowers looking for a new deal, with a typical two-year fixed-rate deal now at a rate of 5.9%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example...

As a result, the average shopping basket contained 13% fewer calories, 15% fewer sugars and 24% less salt than in 2018, the FDF said.<br/>\"Companies will continue to innovate, but this often takes time, requires significant investment and can be technically challenging depending on the food,\" an FDF spokesperson said.<br/>Additional taxes would make the task harder by adding to the \"financial burden\" of rising costs that manufacturers were already facing, the FDF said.<br/>Mr Mayer said Danone UK & Ireland had committed to keep 90% of its range of products below the threshold that counts as high in fat, salt and sugar, and would not launch any new products marketed at children that were in that category."}, {"_id": "648897f751ac3398be9f6469", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65877210?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "MOVEit hack: Media watchdog Ofcom latest victim of mass hack", "lead": "The regulator says information about firms and employees has been affected by a cyber-attack.", "author": "By Chris Vallance", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:19.832504", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17986/production/_130064669_gettyimages-1478455049.jpg", "body": "Media watchdog Ofcom has confirmed that it is a victim of a cyber-attack by hackers linked to a notorious Russian ransomware group.<br/>Confidential data about some companies regulated by Ofcom, and personal information from 412 employees was downloaded during the mass hack.<br/>A number of firms, including British Airways, the BBC and Boots, have been affected by the software breach.<br/>Transport for London also told the BBC on Monday it had been affected.<br/>The mass hack breached software called MOVEit, which is designed to move sensitive files - such as employee addresses or bank account details - securely and is used by companies around the world.<br/>Ofcom said it had \"swiftly\" alerted all the affected companies that it regulates and referred the matter to the data and privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). <br/>It is understood that no payroll data was compromised.<br/>\"A limited amount of information about certain companies we regulate - some of it confidential - along with personal data of 412 Ofcom employees, was downloaded during the attack,\" said Ofcom. <br/>\"We took immediate action to prevent further use of the MOVEit service and to implement the recommended security measures. We also swiftly alerted all affected Ofcom-regulated companies, and we continue to offer support and assistance to our colleagues.\" <br/>It said that none of its own systems were compromised during the attack. <br/>Transport for London (TfL), which operates the capital's public transport, told the BBC it too had been affected. <br/>It said one of its contractors had suffered a data breach.<br/>\"The issue has been fixed and the IT systems have been secured. The data in question did not include banking details and we are writing to all of those involved to make them aware of the incident\".<br/>The breach did not relate to passenger data. TfL said the ICO had been informed. <br/>Accountancy firm Ernst & Young (EY) also told the BBC it was a victim.<br/>As soon as it became aware of the problem with MOVEit the firm \"immediately launched an investigation into our use of the tool and took urgent steps to safeguard any data\".<br/>It said the vast majority of its systems which used the software were unaffected but added: \"We are manually and thoroughly investigating systems where data may have been accessed. <br/>\"Our priority is to first communicate to those impacted, as well as the relevant authorities. Our investigation is ongoing.\"<br/>The hack is known as a \"supply-chain attack\". <br/>It was first disclosed when US company Progress Software said hackers had found a way to break into its MOVEit Transfer tool. <br/>A security flaw was exploited by hackers to gain access to a number of companies.<br/>Some organisations that do not even use MOVEit are affected because of third-party arrangements.<br/>The BBC, for example, has had data from current and past employees stolen because Zellis, a company that the broadcaster uses to process the payroll, used MOVEit and fell victim.<br/>It is understood eight companies that use Zellis are affected, including the airlines British Airways and Aer Lingus, as well the retailer Boots. Dozens of other UK companies are thought to be using MOVEit. <br/>The criminals responsible for the hack are linked to the notorious Clop ransomware group, thought to be based in Russia. <br/>They have threatened to begin publishing data of companies that do not email them to begin the negotiations by Wednesday. <br/>BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy said the group is well-known for carrying out its threats and it is likely that organisations will have private data published on the gang's darknet website in the coming weeks.  <br/>He said it is usually the case that if a victim does not appear on Clop's website, they may have secretly paid the group a ransom which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.<br/>Victims are always encouraged not to pay though as it fuels the growth of this criminal enterprise and there is no guarantee that the hackers will not use the data for secondary attacks.

It is not only anxious homeowners - tenants are worried their landlords, facing higher rates of their own, will put up their rent.<br/>Here are five reasons for the current commotion.<br/>If forecasts were to be believed, we should be seeing a significant slowdown in price rises. The rate of inflation shows the pace at which prices are going up, and so charts the rising cost of living.<br/>The latest official data spooked markets and lenders though, as it suggested inflation was going to stay higher for longer than anticipated. It also pointed to a theory that higher prices were becoming more embedded in the UK economy.<br/>The premier, if rather blunt, tool to tackle high inflation is for the Bank of England to put up interest rates. With the benchmark rate now expected to peak at 5.5%, rather than the current 4.5%, the cost to lenders would be greater, and so - in turn - they have put up the interest rate they charge for mortgages.<br/>Mohamed El-Erian, former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and president of Queens' College at Cambridge University, says the blame lies with central banks who suggested high inflation would only be temporary. <br/>\"It turned out inflation was persistent and therefore central banks were late and society as a whole was late to adjust to higher inflation,\" he told the BBC.<br/>Two years ago there was a rush from property buyers as tax concessions from ministers to keep the housing market moving during Covid were wound down.<br/>Lower or zero rates on stamp duty, and the equivalent tax in Scotland and Wales, made \"a hot market even hotter\", according to analysts. The pandemic led many people to reconsider where they lived, and stamp duty cuts made them move more quickly.<br/>Many of those buyers got two-year fixed mortgages, which are now due to expire.<br/>The peak for homeowners rolling off fixed mortgage deals is July to October this year, with more than 400,000 expected to do so, according to figures from the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. <br/>The timing isn't great. The rates being offered for a new deal now are considerably higher than back then. That could add hundreds of pounds to a monthly mortgage repayment.<br/>Anil and Jessica Jhamat, from Solihull, are having to find an extra \u00a3550 a month. They bought their home during the stamp duty holiday, which allowed them to purchase \"a house we wouldn't otherwise have been able to afford\".  <br/>\"We assumed interest rates would stay low, otherwise we'd have taken out a five-year fix,\" Mr Jhamat said. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\"<br/>The pharmacist and his wife, a digital manager, also have to find \u00a31,000 a month in childcare fees for their one-year-old son. \"Where we are now, we've lost what we saved [in stamp duty]. Essentially we're back to square one,\" he said.<br/>A mortgage repayment is the highest monthly outgoing for many people, so decisions over which product to choose are made with lots of thought and advice.<br/>The trouble is lenders are currently withdrawing their mortgage products with hardly any notice. That makes for a frenzied situation.<br/>On Thursday, HSBC gave notice to brokers that it was going to pull its deals four hours later. After being inundated with applications, it withdrew them within three hours, only to then temporarily reopen the channel for applications on Friday. <br/>At times like this, big lenders do not want their deals to be significantly cheaper than their rivals, and they only want as many applications as they can cope with.<br/>Justin Moy, founder at Chelmsford-based mortgage broker EHF Mortgages, said: \"These last-minute communications just add to the stress of the situation. Decisions on rate changes and repricing must give everyone the opportunity to react in a controlled manner, especially when the increases are hefty and make a real difference to a borrower.\"<br/>Homeowners who decide the best thing to do is sit on their hands and wait for things to settle down could face a nasty shock.<br/>When a fixed term comes to an end - usually after two or five years - then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). That rate is higher, which is why most people go on to another fixed deal instead, although not everyone has that option as, for example, they may have missed payments in the past.<br/>Brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill.<br/>\"Some lenders have a much higher SVR than others. We tell our clients how important it is to choose a lender that treats its customers fairly when their rates come to an end,\" says Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.<br/>Many people have been shocked by the rise in mortgage rates since December 2021, because they had grown so accustomed to ultra-low interest rates for the previous decade or more.<br/>A variety of economic, and pandemic, reasons kept interest rates down - at times at historic lows.<br/>Anyone who has bought a first home during that time would never have faced such a situation as now. Rates have been much higher in previous decades, but people are now borrowing more as house prices have soared.<br/>Lenders tested applicants' finances for their ability to cope with higher rates. That is now more reality than theory, and will lead some people to question whether they stretched themselves too far. Analysts say the availability of jobs, and a relative lack of unemployment, has saved many from having to sell up.<br/>The impact is felt by tenants too. Higher costs for landlords will push up rental prices, and would lead to fewer homes being available to rent if they decide to leave the sector.<br/>Read more here<br/>Additional reporting by Jemma Dempsey"}, {"_id": "648897f851ac3398be9f646c", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65854595?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "'Selling second-hand clothes online became my full-time job'", "lead": "\"Pre-loved\" clothing is big business and it is not just about saving money and the planet.", "author": "By Dearbail Jordan & Star McFarlane", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:20.548401", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175BA/production/_130047659_isabella.jpg", "body": "Second-hand clothing has come a long way from a rummage-fest in the musty charity shop of old.<br/>Buying and selling \"pre-loved\" clobber is now a huge industry, in part due to online companies - or marketplaces - such as Depop, Vinted and eBay where people can trade clothes.<br/>But there is evidence that some fashionistas are choosing to buy second-hand clothing only, not just for value and environmental reasons, but because they want individual style.  <br/>Isabella Vrana, 26, has made a business out of it. <br/>From a hobby that she started on Depop as a student eight years ago, she has generated sales of \u00a3800,000 and the business is still growing. <br/>It all started because of a \"shopping problem\".<br/>\"I was buying too much for myself basically,\" she says. \"But I was getting it all at really good prices because everything was second hand, so I just decided to start selling those pieces for money and realised that I was making profit off each piece.\" <br/>While her fellow university students were working in pubs or restaurants at the weekend, Ms Vrana - sometimes with the help of her mum - was packaging up vintage clothes for customers and dashing to the post office between lectures.<br/>After failing to get a job as a professional fashion buyer because of a lack of industry experience, Ms Vrana decided to take the plunge and move into selling second-hand clothing full-time.<br/>It was scary, she admits. \"At the time I was thinking, 'I just want a boss and a pay cheque and holiday and sick pay.'\"<br/>But she says: \"Actually I'm really glad I just sort of went for it because I love being self-employed.\" <br/>Ms Vrana now employs three people and has a shipping container/warehouse as well as two studios where clothes are shipped, sorted, photographed and sent out to customers who access her business through Depop. <br/>She also recently set up a wholesale business to sell vintage clothes to other online firms as well as hosting pop-up shops in New York, Dublin and Copenhagen. And she sells her own Isabella Vrana label.<br/>Over her eight years in the business, Ms Vrana says she has seen huge changes in demand for second-hand clothes. <br/>\"It wasn't such a normal thing when I started so I've definitely seen an increase in people buying second hand to try and be more sustainable,\" she says.<br/>Plus there's the quality of well-made vintage clothes. \"These items are lasting decades and they're being worn as well. Take a vintage pair of jeans - I've got jeans with dry cleaning labels from the 1990s and they're still going so strong,\" she says.<br/>\"I think people are realising that you might be investing a bit more of an upfront cost, but then it is really paying off long-term.\"<br/>Adam Jay, marketplace chief executive at the clothing resell app Vinted, says the growth in demand for second-hand clothing as been \"phenomenal\".<br/>Vinted now has over eight million registered members in the UK, up from 1.2 million in 2021.<br/>There are the obvious reasons why people are attracted to second-hand clothing. <br/>Buying new clothes and footwear can be expensive at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living. <br/>The rate at which prices are rising for clothing and shoes hit 6.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.   <br/>Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for generating between 8-10% of global emissions, according to the United Nations, from growing cotton to using oil to create synthetic materials such as polyester.<br/>But for fashion and sustainability vlogger Rosie Okotcha \"thrifted fashion is very cool now because its my personal style, no-one else can get it\".<br/>She credits TikTok and Instagram with driving the trend for second-hand clothing, in particular with \"Gen Z\" shoppers - that's people who were born in between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.<br/>That is reflected in the sort of styles people are buying. <br/>According to Depop, \"Y2K\" is a popular trend on its app including oversized denim, colourful crochet and vintage t-shirts. There's also demand for one-of-a-kind and customised items, as well as clothing that is handmade or reworked from existing pieces.  <br/>But while the internet might be fuelling the trend, there is vintage fashion to be found in the High Street charity shop.<br/>Ms Okotcha says that part of her mission is to try to \"break down the stigma that there is something wrong with shopping second hand because it is actually really fantastic fun and great for the planet\".<br/>While it might seem inevitable that the popularity of apps might have ended up re-routing clothing donations away from the High Street, the Charity Retail Association (CRA) says that's not the case.<br/>Charity shop sales rose by 15.1% between January and March compared with the same three months last year.  <br/>\"There is plenty of second-hand clothing to go around, so we see the growth of online selling platforms as complementary to the work of charity shops,\" says the CRA.<br/>Ms Vrana agrees that there is plenty of room for competition, and she plans to continue.  <br/>\"There's definitely money to be made,\" she says. <br/>\"You can definitely support yourself through doing this full-time, which I'm really grateful for because sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because I enjoy it so much.\" "}, {"_id": "648897f851ac3398be9f646d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65874494?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "George Soros hands reins of $25bn empire to son Alex", "lead": "The American financier, targeted by right-wing conspiracists, is passing control of foundations to his son.", "author": "By Lucy Hooker", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:20.759574", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B046/production/_130062154_fph2fdvwyaegfey.jpg", "body": "US billionaire philanthropist George Soros has handed over the running of his $25bn (\u00a319.9bn) financial and charitable empire to his son Alex.<br/>The Hungarian-born financier said his son had \"earned it\", in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.<br/>Since the 1990s the family's wealth has been directed to support democracy-building in dozens of countries.<br/>But in recent years the 92-year-old former hedge fund manager has become the focus of anti-Semitic conspiracies.<br/>A Soros spokesperson confirmed to the BBC the details of the interview published on Sunday.<br/>George Soros is also one of the largest donors to the US Democratic Party.

Cultivated chicken nuggets were briefly on the menu at a private members' club in 2021. <br/>That partnership lasted a few months and this year Huber's has started offering a chicken sandwich and a chicken pasta dish to the general public - albeit only once a week with limited dining slots available.<br/>\"Cultivated meat is real meat, but you don't have to slaughter an animal,\" says Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Eat Just, who spoke to the BBC from San Francisco. \"This way of eating makes sense for the future,\" he says.<br/>Unlike plant-based substitutes, cultivated meat is literally meat. The process involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats.<br/>The cells are allowed to divide and grow, before being placed in a large steel bioreactor, which acts like a fermentation tank.<br/>After four to six weeks, the material is 'harvested' from the bioreactor. Some vegetable protein is added, then it is moulded, cooked and 3-D printed to give it the necessary shape and texture.<br/>The resulting strips of deep fried chicken on my plate of orecchiette pasta certainly tasted like the real deal, if a bit processed. Perhaps the sort of chicken you would eat in a fast-food restaurant.<br/>\"It's meat - it's perfect!\" says Caterina, an Italian student who came here especially to try the cultivated chicken. Normally, for sustainability reasons, she would not eat meat but Caterina says she would eat this.<br/>Her only quibble? Serving the chicken with pasta, which typically does not happen in Italy.<br/>Another diner from Singapore says he was surprised by how much it resembled real meat.<br/>\"It's legit\", he says. \"I wouldn't know where it came from. My only concern would be the cost.\"<br/>The chicken pasta dish I ordered was S$18.50 ($13.70; \u00a311), but that is vastly discounted relative to the current cost of producing the meat. <br/>Eat Just will not say exactly how much it spends on making its cultivated chicken, but at the moment the company's production capacity only yields 2kg (4.4lb) or 3kg per week in Singapore.<br/>When you compare that to the 4,000kg - 5,000kg of conventional chicken sold weekly - at Huber's alone - it gives you a sense of the scale of the task ahead. Put simply, they will need to increase production enormously to avoid making a loss on each piece of chicken.<br/>Eat Just says it has already achieved a 90% reduction in costs since 2018 and the company offered me a tour of its new multi-million dollar production facility in Singapore, which it hopes will open next year.<br/>The pair of shiny steel 1,320 gallon (6,000 litres) bioreactors certainly represent a sign of intent, but in reality they are a tiny fraction of the millions of tonnes of chicken that would need to be produced to match the price of slaughtered chicken.<br/>The industry is urging for patience, but many scientists have already seen enough.<br/>\"The narrative presented by these companies is very strong\", says Ricardo San Martin, co-director of the Alt: Meat Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.<br/>\"But that narrative must be contrasted with the science\", he says. \"Run the numbers, look at every scientific paper written by people who have no skin in the game, and you'll see the answer is clear.\"<br/>\"Can you do this, at scale, at a reasonable cost? No. Can you talk about saving the world with this? Again, no. These companies have to be honest - it's wishful thinking\", he says.<br/>Not only are there doubts about scaling up production, there is also uncertainty over the industry's green credentials, which have been questioned by scientists.<br/>In theory, reducing the world's reliance on land and livestock for meat production should reduce carbon emissions, but at the moment the advanced technology needed to create cultivated meat is so energy intensive that it cancels out any benefits. <br/>One study by the University of California, Davis even estimated that the process produces between 4 and 25 times as much carbon dioxide as regular beef. However, East Just has called the study \"flawed\".<br/>When asked by the BBC whether the whole project might end in failure, Josh Tetrick from Eat Just replied: \"For sure\".<br/>But he remains undeterred: \"Making meat in this way is both necessary and highly uncertain,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not straightforward. It's complicated. It's not guaranteed and it might not work out. But the other option for us is not to do anything. So we decided to take a bet and go for it.\"<br/>Plenty of investors have decided to make that same bet. As of this year, an estimated $2.8bn has been spent on developing cultivated meat.<br/>However, if cultivated meat is to become anything more than a niche alternative for the well-off in the developed world, then relying on investments from private businesses may not be enough.<br/>Governments, Mr Tetrick says, are going to need to put \"significant public money\" into cultivated meat for it to rival conventionally slaughtered meat. <br/>\"This is like the transition to renewable energy... It's a lifetime project - maybe a multiple lifetimes project,\" he says.<br/>At the moment though no country outside Singapore has authorised the sale of cultivated meat, let alone committed to serious investment.<br/>According to Ricardo San Martin from UC Berkeley, both private and public funding for cultivated meat companies will dry up if they do not \"look in the mirror\" soon and present realistic forecasts to investors.<br/>\"Unless there is a clear path to success at some point in the future, investors and governments will not want to spend money on something that is not scientifically proven\"."}, {"_id": "648897f951ac3398be9f646f", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65669537?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why millions of usable hard drives are being destroyed", "lead": "It is estimated that 90% of hard drives are destroyed.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman."}, {"_id": "648897f951ac3398be9f6470", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-65411505?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Scotland", "subCategories": "Scotland Politics,Scotland Business,Edinburgh, Fife & East,Glasgow & West,Highlands & Islands,NE, Orkney & Shetland,South,Tayside & Central", "title": "Susannah Dale: I want to help keep mothers in the workplace", "lead": "Susannah Dale is urging firms to sign a \"maternity pledge\", to support pregnant staff and new mums.", "author": "By Magnus Bennett", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:21.661584", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17407/production/_129993259_susannah_dale.jpg", "body": "When Susannah Dale had her first child five years ago, she found herself struggling to cope.<br/>\"Motherhood hit me like a ton of bricks,\" she says. \"I struggled with bonding, with breastfeeding, with the monotony of the early days.\"<br/>She says it took three years and a second child before she had counselling.<br/>It helped and led her to look for answers about why she had struggled with the transition to motherhood.<br/>Susannah began talking to mothers and trawling through the internet to find out what impact motherhood was having on women, particularly on their careers.<br/>It ultimately led her to create a social enterprise that encourages companies across the UK to make workplaces as supportive as possible for pregnant employees and new mothers. <br/>Susannah's interest had been piqued by research from the Equality and Human Rights Commission which suggested at least 54,000 women a year were being pushed out of the UK workforce after becoming pregnant.<br/>Other areas of concern emerged for her, including a survey by HR tech firm Culture Shift which indicated that a quarter of expectant mothers feared \"negativity\" from colleagues and managers if they revealed they were pregnant.<br/>Susannah was also to stumble upon the concept of \"matrescence\", a term coined 50 years ago by anthropologist Dana Raphael to describe the complex and transformational process of becoming a mother.<br/>\"Simply put, matrescence means the physical, psychological and emotional changes you go through after the birth of your child,\" she says. <br/>\"This is tricky enough to navigate on its own, but can be even more stress-inducing when you add in the anxiety about going on, and returning from, maternity leave.\"<br/>For the past few months, Glasgow-based Susannah has been asking companies to commit to a series of wellbeing steps that go well beyond statutory requirements for maternity leave.<br/>More than a dozen UK firms - varying in size from under 20 employees to 200 - have already signed the pledge, which is divided into five \"pillars\".<br/>They include creating a maternity leave and return to work plan for employees and helping them \"maintain an emotional connection with the workplace so they do not feel anxious about being on maternity leave and their subsequent return to work\".<br/>Susannah believes current maternity leave practices often fall short of where they should be.<br/>She says: \"Although there are laws in place, the statistics and stories show that the measures currently in place to protect jobs and provide financial support are not working as well as they could as they're not reflective of the society we live in, what mothers want and the profound experience of motherhood.<br/>\"Our aim with the Maternity Pledge is to help keep mothers in the workplace if they want to be and through that we hope to see more women in leadership roles.\"<br/>Pregnant employees of firms that sign up are also given a \"matrescence pack\", which Susannah says covers \"the parts of motherhood which tend to be glossed over in pregnancy but can affect mental health\". <br/>It addresses issues such as breastfeeding problems and the affect of matrescence on relationships with partners.<br/>Companies already signed up to the pledge seem to be fully on board with its goals.<br/>Colchester-based PR company founder Megan Dorian says she is glad to be part of the project.<br/>\"When I launched Orange PR and Marketing when my first-born daughter was just over a year, I knew a priority for the business was to create an inclusive culture that not only supported but embraced parents in their journey,\" she says. <br/>\"There is still a stigma around women taking a career 'break' - it's certainly not a break - to have a baby and then return to work, and I am a big advocate for breaking this down.\"<br/>Another supporter is London-based Jenny Jones, chief operating officer of advisory, legal and accountancy firm Dragon Argent.<br/>\"Becoming a mother was the hardest transition I've ever had to make,\" she says. <br/>\"Going from being confident in your job and your life in general to being at home looking after a very small, fragile person 24/7 was tricky to say the least.  <br/>\"Supporting all our present and future parents through the often unspoken challenges of balancing parenthood and careers matters to us, which is why we signed The Maternity Pledge.\"<br/>Susannah says everyone benefits if companies support new mothers' return to work with as much flexibility and care for their wellbeing as possible.<br/>\"Maternity leave can work better for businesses and mothers if communication, support and empathy is improved,\" she says.<br/>\"Most women want to work -

Many are facing similar financial dilemmas as they contemplate rising mortgage costs. <br/>The Bank of England has been steadily raising interest rates for the last year and a half, as it tries to tackle soaring prices. <br/>After figures last week showed inflation not coming down as quickly as expected, many now predict the central bank will continue to raise rates from their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.<br/>That in turn had an immediate impact on the mortgage market. Lenders began raising their rates. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.49% and the average five-year fixed is currently 5.17%.<br/>And within a week hundreds of mortgage deals were removed from the market as lenders reassessed their offers.<br/>\"Carnage\" is how Craig Fish from Lodestone brokers in London described the situation. <br/>\"I'm currently on hold to NatWest - 30 minutes and counting - to discuss a possible new mortgage as they have just announced they are withdrawing rates at 10.30pm tonight. Do the lenders think the future is this uncertain?\" he said earlier this week.<br/>Jo Wilder, 28, works for Cardiff Council and pays \u00a3700 a month for a studio apartment she has been renting for the past 18 months. She now wants to buy her own home - a process that is taking longer than she hopes, as she watches rates rise. <br/>Despite having a healthy 20% deposit and a mortgage in principle, she says there are \"not really any properties on the market\".<br/>Repayments on a three-year fixed-rate deal at 4.5% would be between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 but she is worried about interest rates going up.<br/>\"It's not ideal. I'm just going to have to wait it out and hope rates come down. It really is very stressful,\" she says.<br/>Jo had hoped getting her own place would mean a drop in monthly outgoings but with rising food prices she no longer thinks that will be the case.<br/>\"It is disheartening,\" she adds. \"The way things are going I think it is actually going to be the same price, which is pretty daunting to be honest.\"<br/>In Bedfordshire, Anthony Jones and his wife have a 14-month-old daughter - they want to upsize and have been trying to sell since last August. <br/>The couple's five-year fixed deal has ended and they are now on a tracker mortgage, leaving them \u00a3200 worse off a month, at a little over \u00a31,200.<br/>\"It's a bit of a nightmare,\" says Anthony. \"We're looking at upsizing and all of a sudden are having to question the affordability of it.\"<br/>The 33-year-old says when they first put their house on the market there had been \"a lot of interest initially, then all of a sudden we had people saying 'our mortgage offer has been pulled' and 'we can't afford it anymore'.\"<br/>The couple have reduced the asking price from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3275,000, but say they cannot accept less because otherwise they will not have the deposit for their second home.<br/>\"Our daughter has grown so quickly, we need a garden and bigger bedrooms and more storage. The lack of space is even causing arguments between me and my partner,\" says Anthony.<br/>Read more here<br/>The upheaval for people going through the application process comes as Bank of England figures this week showed a decline in the number of mortgages being approved. <br/>The number of net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 48,700 in April from 51,500 in March.<br/>Mortgage broker London & Country is now seeing a trend for people fixing for one or two years, rather than the previous most popular five-year term, on the basis that interest rates will have fallen by the time they come to look for their next deal.<br/>Spokesman David Hollingworth says people who are refinancing should start searching for a new product six months before the end of their current deal.<br/>Some may want to consider taking out new mortgages over a longer term - something a lot of first-time buyers do to \"give themselves breathing space\", he says.<br/>If it is a struggle to meet payments on an existing mortgage there is also the option of extending the term, but Mr Hollingworth says this is \"not a move to be taken lightly because it will significantly increase the overall interest bill, by tens of thousands of pounds\".<br/>Are you struggling to get a mortgage or one that's affordable?

He had booked a train on Friday to get to Carlisle ahead of a 600km cycle event. <br/>The train he booked was cancelled, because of the strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which is expected to put a halt to half of Friday's scheduled trains. <br/>He can't depend on getting space for his bike on the trains that are running. So he'll be getting up at 07:00 to drive 300 miles instead.<br/>The leisure industry has protested the loudest about the impact of train strikes. <br/>\"We've seen time and time again that rail strikes put a significant dampener on any sales as visitors are deterred from booking visits or eating and drinking out,\" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said in a statement. <br/>The industry group reckons strikes this week, during the half-term school holiday, will cost the sector \u00a3132m, bringing the total impact on the sector to an \"eye-watering\" \u00a33.25bn.<br/>Having to cancel leisure activities was by far the most frequently mentioned impact of the strikes, according to the most recent study from the Office for National Statistics.  <br/>Businesses that are in stations obviously suffer particularly. The ONS tracks weekly sales from 400 Pret a Manger sandwich shops around the country, and the branches in stations see a noticeable dip in sales on strike weeks.<br/>And retailers were acutely affected by the wave of strikes in the key shopping days ahead of Christmas last year.<br/>But the impact of strikes on people getting to work is relatively limited, the ONS's work suggests. <br/>Only one in 10 people actually travel to work by train, according to a different ONS survey. <br/>And of those who do travel by train, 70% said they could work from home. <br/>The rest could get to work by other means - though not necessarily a 50-mile bike ride - and very few respondents said they couldn't work at all because of the train strike.<br/>Speaking to the BBC, the RMT's assistant general secretary John Leach said: \"We regret the inconvenience caused by industrial action. <br/>\"We would much rather be doing what we do every other day of the year, which is keeping Britain moving, our members coming to work to do that. It's an obvious regret but it's also our responsibility to represent our people, our members, and we will never apologise for doing that.\"<br/>Rail strikes have had much less impact since the signallers and other Network Rail staff agreed a pay deal to end their campaign. When the signallers joined the strikes, up to 90% of trains would be cancelled. <br/>The sector most hurt by the strikes may in fact be the railway industry itself.<br/>Mr Bezant says the strikes, and cancellations caused by engineering works, have shaken his faith in the rail network. <br/>\"I expect that any events I book in the future, I will consider driving. There's not much point trusting the trains. It will change the way I travel,\" he says.<br/>Even if the strikes were resolved tomorrow, he would still be uncertain. \"It has been going on for so long. It will affect me for quite some time I think.\"<br/>He estimates the train journeys he has not made because of strikes add up to around \u00a3700 - lost revenue for an industry that is already in a serious financial condition.<br/>The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies, reckons the dispute has cost the rail industry around \u00a3580m so far, a sum which increases with every new day of strike action. The bill is ultimately met by the government, which now picks up the tab for any shortfall in ticket sales.  <br/>And Mr Bezant is unlikely to be the only one who will take some time to regain his faith in the railways, even when the disputes are over.<br/>How are you affected by the latest train strikes?

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\""}, {"_id": "648897fa51ac3398be9f6474", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65321487?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumps", "lead": "Whole towns in Europe are being heated by huge, energy efficient heat pumps.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:22.708374", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/042A/production/_129766010_f91b782b-55ab-46ab-9866-7ebe54e08d24.jpg", "body": "There are 2.5 million litres of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. <br/>If for some reason you wanted to bring it from a pleasant 20C to boiling point, German firm MAN Energy Solutions (MAN ES) has a heat pump that could do it. And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\""}, {"_id": "648897fa51ac3398be9f6475", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65640622?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?", "lead": "Linda Yaccarino has started her new post as chief executive of Twitter, a few weeks ahead of schedule.", "author": "By Natalie Sherman", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:22.946802", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18068/production/_129880489_whatsubject.jpg", "body": "Why would anyone want to leave a plum post at one of America's biggest media companies to take a chance leading Twitter, a social media platform with a spotty business record and an infamously mercurial owner?<br/>Enter Linda Yaccarino, a 60-year-old New York native widely respected in the advertising industry, who not only took the job, but started it a few weeks early.<br/>\"She's someone who really likes to be superwoman,\" says marketing veteran Lou Paskalis, who has known Ms Yaccarino for more than two decades, and describes her as fierce, shrewd and ambitious. She would jump at the chance, he says, \"to step in... and say, 'I can fix this'\".<br/>Which begs the question: can she?<br/>Even before billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, the social network had problems.<br/>It has been fiercely criticised, by the left and right, for how it polices misinformation and hate speech, and the business has struggled to break even - making an annual profit just twice since its launch in 2006.<br/>Growth, whether measured by users or the money it brings in, has been bumpy.<br/>Since Mr Musk took over the platform last year, the issues have only gotten worse.<br/>He has cut 75% of its former staff, including teams charged with tracking abuse; changed how the company verifies authentic accounts; and sparked debate with his own tweets spreading conspiracy theories.<br/>Advertisers have left in large numbers and users also appear sceptical. A recent poll by Pew found that six in 10 adults in the US, Twitter's largest base, were taking a break and a quarter said they did not expect to be using the app in a year.<br/>Even Mr Musk has seemed daunted by the challenges, going through with his $44bn purchase last year only under threat of a lawsuit. He has joked that only someone \"foolish\" would want the chief executive title from him.<br/>Ms Yaccarino appears undaunted. <br/>Raised in an Italian-American family, the daughter of a police officer has risen through the ranks of some of the biggest media companies in the US, forging a reputation as a high-heeled and hard-charging executive, who has helped steer entertainment giant NBCUniversal through the upheaval wrought by the growth of the tech giants.<br/>At NBCU, home to brands such as NBC News, Focus Features and Bravo, Ms Yaccarino overhauled the ad sales business, pushed the 2020 launch of its ad-supported streaming platform Peacock, and drove industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrated online. <br/>The mother-of-two, who met her husband Claude Madrazo on a blind date and became a grandmother last year, was known to want some kind of promotion after a decade at NBCU where she was chairman of global advertising and partnerships. <br/>There was widespread speculation about her interest in Twitter, especially after she defended Mr Musk at a conference last year, urging critical advertisers to \"give the guy a minute\". <br/>\"I've long been inspired by your vision to create a brighter future,\" she tweeted after her new post was announced. \"I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\"<br/>By hiring Ms Yaccarino, Mr Musk has \"purchased trust\" from advertisers, says Mr Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory.<br/>Indeed, industry giant GroupM, who represents brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle, has already said it sees the platform as less risky.<br/>But repairing Twitter's business will be no small task. <br/>Though big ad buyers are eager to have choices beyond the tech giants, the platform remains too small to be a must-buy, says long-time media analyst Brian Wieser, now principal at consultancy Madison and Wall. <br/>Beyond advertising, she will also face a host of pressing issues: regulatory scrutiny of Twitter's hate speech and privacy controls; lawsuits from landlords, vendors and former staff over unpaid bills; not to mention user complaints and basic tech glitches, like the malfunctions that plagued the high-profile interview with Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis hosted on the platform. <br/>The biggest wild card of all, of course, is Mr Musk, who has said he intends to remain involved at the site, overseeing products and technology. <br/>\"Anybody taking this job has been set up to fail - it's not specific to her,\" Mr Wieser says. \"The question is whether or not the odds are more likely to be in her favour than any alternative. And yeah, actually the odds are more favourable.\"<br/>Friends and former colleagues say they expect Ms Yaccarino to use her background in television to improve the platform's ad business and expand the use of video across the site. <br/>She has called Mr Musk's vision of Twitter as a starting point for an \"the everything app\", offering messages, payments and other functions a \"great opportunity\" for advertisers.<br/>\"[She has] the guts and the courage to take big swings,\" says Jacqueline Corbelli, founder and chief executive of Brightline, a tech company focused on streaming adverts, which has partnered with NBCU. <br/>\"If Twitter gives her the space to do it, she will bring the ability to integrate what's been successful in the past and blend that with what advertisers are going to be looking for to regain trust in Twitter.\"<br/>Whether Ms Yaccarino will have room to run remains a big if.<br/>Some commentators have already suggested she is poised to encounter the \"glass cliff\" - a phenomenon in which women reach positions of power only at the riskiest moments.<br/>\"As someone used to wearing 4 inch heels, let's be crystal clear: I don't teeter,\" Ms Yaccarino shot back on Twitter recently, in response to such analysis.<br/>At an industry conference before her appointment, Ms Yaccarino, whose politics have been described as conservative but not ideological, pressed Mr Musk to explain what Twitter's \"freedom of speech, not freedom of reach\" meant and how it differed from rules at other companies.  <br/>She also asked Mr Musk if he would curb his own tweeting, although she got little firm commitment, at least publicly, in response. <br/>\"I'll say what I want even if it costs me money,\" he told CNBC recently.<br/>Friends say Ms Yaccarino, who has described her strategy for dealing with difficult colleagues as \"patience and wine\", is entering her new role clear-eyed about the risks.<br/>\"Linda is not afraid,\" says Shelley Zallis, chief executive of the Female Quotient, which works to advance women in the workplace, and whom Ms Yaccarino has described as a \"soul sister\".<br/>\"Linda is fierce and fearless and Linda looks for the solution....

which is the maximum price suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity - a typical household will pay \u00a32,074 a year for gas and electricity from July.<br/>That is \u00a3426 a year less than what they pay now, although still far higher than what we saw before the energy crisis.<br/>So far, most big suppliers have said they will bring their tariffs in line with the new cap but none have set out cheaper fixed deals for customers.<br/>Such deals have effectively been off the table since the government stepped in to subsidise bills with its Energy Price Guarantee in October, holding them at \u00a32,500 a year for the average household. <br/>Suppliers have claimed they are not able to offer more competitive pricing plans, and so consumers have not been able to shop around.<br/>However, Natalie Mathie, an energy expert at the switching site Uswitch.com, believes the fall in the price cap will be \"a watershed moment\" for suppliers, \"who can now look to start offering fixed deals again given the market conditions\".<br/>\"The majority of homes are on standard variable tariffs and now subject to the volatility of price cap changes every three months,\" she says. <br/>\"But customers should have the choice of whether to lock in the benefits of lower wholesale prices for 12 months, just as they do in the mortgage market. <br/>\"We see no reason why energy suppliers cannot offer competitive fixed deals around the \u00a32,000 level.\"<br/>Emily Seymour, of consumer group Which?, thinks we could start seeing such deals some time this year. <br/>\"We hope to see consumers back able to make some choices,\" she said. <br/>\"It will be worth doing a bit of research to see if there's a deal out there that could be cost effective while also offering good customer service and low exit fees.\"<br/>However, she says it will depend on where energy prices go next, with fixed deals less likely if the cap has to go up again. <br/>Others meanwhile warn that fixed deals may not be best for everyone given the uncertainty over future prices. <br/>For example, energy supplier Ovo launched a fixed deal for existing customers in March that was cheaper than the government's limit on household bills. <br/>It offered a fixed 12-month tariff of \u00a32,275 for existing customers, but anyone who signed up is now locked into that rate, meaning they will miss out when the new cap comes into effect.<br/>Martin Lewis, from personal finance website Money Saving Expert, has also questioned just how much choice consumers will get when fixed deals finally return. <br/>\"I am expecting to see existing customer offers - where you will get a bespoke offer from your firm rather than deals offered across the market,\" he told BBC Radio 4.<br/>This could stifle competition, he warned, as the rules say companies do not have to publish the details of their existing customer offers. <br/>\"It makes it very hard for people like me to assess,\" he said. <br/>In any event, the energy analysts Cornwall Insight have suggested consumers should not expect to see huge savings from deals that do emerge. <br/>That is because further substantial falls in energy prices will be unlikely, particularly if there is a cold winter in Europe, with the UK competing to buy gas and electricity with other countries.<br/>\"Our forecasts suggest until the end of this decade, higher and more volatile prices are going to be seen, and that includes the impact they're going to have on domestic bills unfortunately,\" Cornwall analyst Kate Mulvany told the BBC.<br/>Energy suppliers should be in touch in the coming weeks to let customers know what their bill will look like under the new cap.<br/>However, Ms Seymour says it is always worth having a conversation with your supplier about any bespoke deals they can offer you. <br/>If you find yourself struggling to pay bills, consumer experts suggest speaking to your energy supplier about a payment plan that is manageable.<br/>By paying what you can - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears will grow more slowly and your supplier is likely to be less worried about your debt.<br/>Your supplier could also check if you qualify for any government schemes. <br/>It's also important to check the amount you pay each month if you use a direct debit. <br/>Your monthly payment is based on your estimated usage through the year not what you actually use so keep a close eye and update your supplier with your meter readings.<br/>Listen to The Martin Lewis Podcast for more on the new energy price cap<br/>Here are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips.<br/>What do I do if I can't afford to pay my debts?<br/>What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?"}, {"_id": "648897fb51ac3398be9f6477", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65675027?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpower", "lead": "Innovation and good timing combined to make California's Nvidia the dominant firm for AI computer chips.", "author": "By Zoe Corbyn & Ben Morris", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:23.410940", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C3D6/production/_129843105_gettyimages-1468619875.jpg", "body": "Shares in computer chip designer Nvidia have soared over the past week, taking the company's valuation above the one trillion dollar mark.<br/>It means it joins tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the elite club of $1tn US companies.<br/>The surge was sparked by its latest quarterly results which were released late on Wednesday. The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\""}, {"_id": "648897fb51ac3398be9f6478", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65688117?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Is the spike in strike action here to stay?", "lead": "BBC economics editor Faisal Islam asks whether a historic surge in industrial action is likely to persist.", "author": "By Faisal Islam", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:23.623092", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/386C/production/_129844441_strikingnurse2.jpg", "body": "Over the past 12 months, a historic wave of industrial action has swept the UK. As a new documentary series follows union leaders up close, the BBC's economics editor asks whether this surge in strikes is likely to persist.<br/>\"Listen, don't fall out with each other. Don't fall out with each other. It's really important everybody sticks together,\" says Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, as tensions flare on a bus drivers' picket line. <br/>The Abellio drivers in two south London depots had been offered a 12% pay rise and a \u00a3500 bonus - splitting opinion among drivers, who had been striking without full pay for 10 days. <br/>One driver later says: \"The union rep, they're selling us out\u2026 there's a lot of traitors around.\" <br/>Others say: \"We got screwed\" and \"we've been here for two months freezing and we're dying\". They would eventually win an 18% rise. <br/>Settlements such as this one have been occurring in so-called shortage sectors, such as driving buses, lorries, and rubbish trucks, since the beginning of last year. Many of those settlements went under the radar, in very local disputes or even, as here, in individual depots. <br/>The past year across industry and public services has seen hundreds of ballots, hundreds of thousands on picket lines, dozens of negotiations, double-digit pay claims and awards, and major legal battles between the government and public sector unions. <br/>Only 15 months ago, No 10 were slapping down the governor of the Bank of England for saying that people should not ask for excessive pay rises. Four months before that, the then-prime minister was celebrating the prospect of a high-wage Britain for all. <br/>And this time last year Ms Graham, the general secretary of the biggest private sector union, had never done a broadcast interview in that role. She and her colleagues are now household names after promising a \"summer, autumn, spring and winter of discontent\". <br/>Strike: Inside the Unions<br/>With access to top union leaders, the two-part documentary follows internal machinations at Unite, RMT and the RCN, as well as the GMB's campaign to win recognition at Amazon in Coventry. <br/>Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only). The first episode will be on BBC Two at 21:00 on 25 May, with the second a week later.<br/>Part of Boris Johnson's survival strategy had involved squaring up to the unions over their pay claims and seeking to direct blame towards the Labour Party. <br/>But the unions calculated that the old pattern of mutually dismissive relations between organised labour and government had altered since the pandemic and in the shared pain of a common cost of living crisis. The last year raises questions not just about that relationship, but whether something has changed in the water in the way the UK thinks about industrial relations. <br/>Looming over all of this are the restrictions on ballots in the government's anti-union laws. The documentary shows how unions have got around restrictions requiring postal ballots and high thresholds on turnout. <br/>The pattern over the past year has been unions breaking down national disputes into a series of far smaller local and sectoral ones, for which it is easier to win ballot mandates. Action is then co-ordinated across localities on the same day, giving the impression of massive national or regional walkouts, as with bus drivers across London. <br/>The other pattern is that of the private sector settling high wage claims in areas of labour shortages. <br/>Unite has a unit of forensic accountants assessing the profits and available cash flow of the parent companies, often foreign-owned, of the employers involved in disputes. In this case the owner was effectively the Dutch state (though it has now sold its stake), a fact routinely used by the union in online campaigning. <br/>The experience in the public sector has been different. This time last year, there was no negotiation. The Pay Review Body process had recommended a settlement of around 3% across public services. This was often before the spike in inflation to double digits following the Ukraine war. <br/>Prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss dug in on the issue. At first, so too did the Sunak administration, fearful of the fiscal cost and inflationary potential of significant rises in the wage costs of state employees. <br/>The cameras were with Royal College of Nursing (RCN) General Secretary Pat Cullen ahead of the first strikes in its history.<br/>The RCN itself had been asking for a 19% rise for nurses. The government said at that time it could not shift from the recommendation of the Pay Review Body and was not negotiating. <br/>\"It's never, ever going to get a resolution to this dispute,\" Cullen said later. \"The last meeting that I had with the secretary of state, he arrived accompanied by five men and it was not a pleasant meeting. It was quite a bullyish conversation.\" Cullen said nurses had concluded that they were being treated differently because \"we are 90% female\". <br/>And she said a government minister had told her in a meeting that they were surprised nurses needed to live off their salaries: \"And you know, ministers coming into the room saying to me that they're shocked that nursing staff may be the main breadwinner in the family. Because they believe that it's a second salary that we don't depend on. They are totally out of touch.\" <br/>The Department of Health said it did not recognise the claim and had \"utmost respect\" for all staff. <br/>Nurses in the RCN in the end rejected the deal recommended by their own union - a sign of how strongly a large swathe of public sector workers felt about the squeeze in their real wages. <br/>The film shows how nurses felt emboldened by large-scale public sympathy, especially since the pandemic. <br/>This perception of support, even in less popular professions than the NHS, has helped underpin double-digit pay claims. The successful tactics in the private sector of balloting first for strike action in order to gain negotiating leverage in pay disputes has also spread to the public sector. <br/>Some union bosses also acknowledge that in an era where more workers can work from home, the strikes may not have disrupted the public as much. While the overall number of strikes has not been seen for a generation, the total number of days lost to strike action is nowhere near the highs of the 1970s. <br/>Nonetheless, some in the union movement are trying to push into new territory too, such as the GMB at Amazon. <br/>Outside the company's Coventry warehouse, Stuart Richards, a senior GMB organiser, is attempting to recruit new members.<br/>A US training video cartoon for Amazon managers leaked in 2018 certainly made clear that \"we do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders, or most importantly, our associates\" - its term for workers.<br/>But the staff arriving by car have been squeezed hard by the cost of living crisis - one tells of having to pawn a wedding ring - and some were willing to U-turn near the entrance to their workplace and sign up to Richards' campaign. <br/>Eventually the GMB get more than half the Coventry workforce, which the union estimates at 1,300 in total, and serve a letter demanding recognition from the Amazon bosses - it is the first site in the UK to do so, after a decade of trying.<br/>So the question really is whether the current spike in strike activity is entirely a reaction to rampant inflation or whether this is something that might have a longer-lasting impact. <br/>The full data is not yet available, but it is difficult to escape a pattern of unionised workplaces, especially in shortage occupations, getting double-digit pay settlements. <br/>They have responded to existing strike restrictions by moving to immediate localised ballots, even before starting negotiations. On the other hand, insiders say that membership spikes during pay disputes, but then falls back when pay deals are done. Union subs are another expense during a cost of living crisis. Official figures will come next year. <br/>There are some concerns, though, about the persistence and stickiness of inflation. Even the Bank of England, which began last year warning about excessive pay rises, now couples that message with concerns about corporate pricing and profits, a similar message to that pushed by some union leaders. <br/>And the political economy of all this does appear to be changing. <br/>Bashing the unions has proven tricky for the government over the past year. David Cameron's union tsar Lord Richard Balfe argues that PMs Johnson and Truss should have sued for peace with public sector workers much earlier. The opposition felt confident enough to announce it would repeal the new \"minimum service level\" laws as well as older restrictions on ballots, if it wins power. <br/>This current wave of industrial action appears to be calming, but is not yet over. The government is trying to settle pay deals it had previously left to Pay Review Bodies. Inflation may also now be falling sustainably. But the shadow of this year of industrial action may linger for some time."}, {"_id": "648897fb51ac3398be9f6479", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65888228?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "US moves to block Microsoft's Activision takeover", "lead": "Regulators have asked a judge to block the proposed deal, arguing it could harm competition levels.", "author": "By Michael Race", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:23.974863", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A654/production/_129508524_facc65e821a9633e3fb2a326d4afa4458ee4a51f145_629_4262_23984262x2398.jpg", "body": "Regulators in the US have asked a judge to block Microsoft from completing its $69bn (\u00a356bn) purchase of Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard.<br/>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the deal, which would be the largest in the history of the video games industry, could \"substantially lessen competition\" in the sector.<br/>The move comes after the UK blocked the deal over concerns it would hurt competition, but the EU approved it.<br/>A trial in the US will begin in August.<br/>The FTC said in a court filing that a \"preliminary injunction is necessary to... prevent interim harm\" while the regulator determines whether \"the proposed acquisition violates US antitrust law\".<br/>Microsoft's proposed takeover of Activision has split global regulators, and in order for the deal to go through the parties need approval from regulatory bodies in the UK, the EU and the US.<br/>The European Commission has approved the acquisition, saying that Microsoft's offer of 10-year free licensing deals -

Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law.

And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example...

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\"."}, {"_id": "648897fc51ac3398be9f647d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65850668?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Why making AI safe isn't as easy as you might think", "lead": "AI could improve our lives hugely or destroy us all, the experts say - so how do we make it safe?", "author": "By Zoe Kleinman and Philippa Wain", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:24.916497", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D37/production/_130070218_gettyimages-866481488.jpg", "body": "Artificial-intelligence experts generally follow one of two schools of thought - it will either improve our lives enormously or destroy us all.

It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks."}, {"_id": "648897fd51ac3398be9f647e", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65881800?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Amazon cracks down on fake reviews with AI", "lead": "The tech giant is developing new tools to help track down the brokers buying and selling reviews.", "author": "By Shiona McCallum", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:25.119415", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8351/production/_130071633_gettyimages-1325244511.jpg", "body": "Amazon says it is using the latest in artificial intelligence (AI) to crack down on fake reviews and identify comments that aren't genuine.<br/>The tech giant has been grappling with fake review \"brokers\", which are a huge problem for its shopping site. <br/>Amazon has invested in machine learning models that analyse thousands of data points to help it detect the fraudulent behaviour. <br/>But UK consumer group Which? says the action is still \"nowhere near enough\". <br/>Fake review brokers use third-party platforms, including social media and encrypted messaging services, to buy, sell and host fake reviews.<br/>Fake reviews can sway customers to make purchasing decisions, for example over which laptop or children's toy to buy, based on what they believe is genuine feedback from other shoppers, when in reality someone has been paid to write a glowing review to boost a seller's ratings, or to undermine a rival firm.<br/>They aren't always easy to spot, although generic information, or a very high percentage of five star reviews can be a give-away.<br/>In 2022, Amazon reported more than 23,000 social media groups, with over 46 million members and followers, that facilitated fake reviews.<br/>Amazon has been using AI in the battle against fake reviews for several years, but the company says continued investment in more \"sophisticated tools\" should improve protection for customers and sellers on its platform.<br/>The company said its fraud-detecting AI was able to look at a range of factors to calculate the likelihood that a review is fake. That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe.

We also swiftly alerted all affected Ofcom-regulated companies, and we continue to offer support and assistance to our colleagues.\" <br/>It said that none of its own systems were compromised during the attack. <br/>Transport for London (TfL), which operates the capital's public transport, told the BBC it too had been affected. <br/>It said one of its contractors had suffered a data breach.<br/>\"The issue has been fixed and the IT systems have been secured. The data in question did not include banking details and we are writing to all of those involved to make them aware of the incident\".<br/>The breach did not relate to passenger data. TfL said the ICO had been informed. <br/>Accountancy firm Ernst & Young (EY) also told the BBC it was a victim.<br/>As soon as it became aware of the problem with MOVEit the firm \"immediately launched an investigation into our use of the tool and took urgent steps to safeguard any data\".<br/>It said the vast majority of its systems which used the software were unaffected but added: \"We are manually and thoroughly investigating systems where data may have been accessed. <br/>\"Our priority is to first communicate to those impacted, as well as the relevant authorities. Our investigation is ongoing.\"<br/>The hack is known as a \"supply-chain attack\". <br/>It was first disclosed when US company Progress Software said hackers had found a way to break into its MOVEit Transfer tool. <br/>A security flaw was exploited by hackers to gain access to a number of companies.<br/>Some organisations that do not even use MOVEit are affected because of third-party arrangements.<br/>The BBC, for example, has had data from current and past employees stolen because Zellis, a company that the broadcaster uses to process the payroll, used MOVEit and fell victim.<br/>It is understood eight companies that use Zellis are affected, including the airlines British Airways and Aer Lingus, as well the retailer Boots. Dozens of other UK companies are thought to be using MOVEit. <br/>The criminals responsible for the hack are linked to the notorious Clop ransomware group, thought to be based in Russia. <br/>They have threatened to begin publishing data of companies that do not email them to begin the negotiations by Wednesday. <br/>BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy said the group is well-known for carrying out its threats and it is likely that organisations will have private data published on the gang's darknet website in the coming weeks.  <br/>He said it is usually the case that if a victim does not appear on Clop's website, they may have secretly paid the group a ransom which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.<br/>Victims are always encouraged not to pay though as it fuels the growth of this criminal enterprise and there is no guarantee that the hackers will not use the data for secondary attacks.

effectively a community of people who gather to discuss a particular interest. <br/>Reddit users - or Redditors - will typically join a variety of subreddits, rather than following individual users on other platforms, and see posts from these communities in their feed.<br/>As well as a few paid administrators, the website uses tens of thousands of unpaid moderators - known as mods - to keep the website functional.<br/>These mods may spend one or two hours per day ensuring that their subreddit does not get filled with off-topic comments, content that is banned, or even content which is illegal.<br/>But the flipside of this is that Reddit does not charge any hosting fees for people who want to set up their own community based on an interest they have.<br/>In a post to the website on Friday, Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman said it \"needs to be a self-sustaining business\" and addressed the blackout. <br/>\"We respect when you and your communities take action to highlight the things you need, including, at times, going private,\" he said.<br/>\"We are all responsible for ensuring Reddit provides an open accessible place for people to find community and belonging.\"<br/>He also confirmed that explicit content would remain on the site, but Reddit would limit how it can be accessed from third-party apps.<br/>The blackout includes 3,489 subreddits in total, including five of the 10 most popular communities on the site - r/gaming, r/aww, r/Music, r/todayilearned and r/pics - which each have memberships of more than 30 million people.<br/>A moderator for one of these subreddits told the BBC the protest was about \"strength in numbers\".<br/>\"If it was a single subreddit going private, Reddit may intervene,\" they said. <br/>\"But if it's half the entire website, then you feel a lot more pressured. <br/>\"This is a completely volunteer position, we don't receive any financial compensation, and despite that, we do like to take it quite seriously.\"<br/>They said they wanted Reddit admins to realise that they rely on moderators to operate the site and felt that the only way to send a message was by harming Reddit's traffic.<br/>\"Our entire community is supporting us against this change,\" they said.<br/>\"It feels good to be able to have the power to say: 'We will not continue to moderate our communities if you push these changes through'.<br/>\"If it's almost the entire website, would they destroy what they've built up in all these communities, just to push through this highly unpopular change that both the mods and users of Reddit are overwhelmingly against?\"<br/>Reddit, which describes itself as \"the front page of the internet\", has an official app but it was developed in 2016, many years after the website was founded.<br/>Because of this, third-party apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Sync and ReddPlanet were set up as a way for people to access the platform on their mobile devices. <br/>Reddit has introduced a series of charges to the developers who wish to continue using its Application Programming Interface (API) - the behind-the-scenes code which allows third-party apps to find and show the content on Reddit.<br/>All four of these apps have said they will be shutting down as a result of Reddit's new API pricing. <br/>These charges have been heavily criticised as extortionate - with Apollo developer Christian Selig claiming it would end up costing him $20m (\u00a315.9m) to continue operating the app.<br/>But a Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that Apollo was \"notably less efficient\" than other third-party apps.<br/>They said the social media platform spends \"multi-millions of dollars on hosting fees\" and \"needs to be fairly paid\" to continue supporting third-party apps. <br/>\"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs,\" they said.<br/>The spokesperson also said that not all third-party apps would require paid access. Previously, Reddit announced it would not charge apps which make the platform more accessible.<br/>But the moderator the BBC spoke to said they believed the blackout could continue until Reddit row back on the changes.<br/>\"The current plan for many communities is... they might keep the blackout going for longer, beyond the original forty-eight hours, or keep their subreddits restricted so that nobody can post,\" they said.<br/>\"Every community operates differently, and different moderators have different views on what's happening right now, so it does vary. <br/>\"But given recent communications between moderators and Reddit admins, I don't believe that they are intending to reverse these changes.\"<br/>And some communities, such as r/Music - which has 32 million members - say their subreddit will be indefinitely inaccessible until Reddit reverses its policy."}, {"_id": "648897fd51ac3398be9f6481", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65878227?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Xbox showcase 2023: Is Microsoft back in the game?", "lead": "Microsoft had a lot to prove in some people's eyes -

perhaps the biggest \"didn't know we needed it\" announcement of the night.<br/>And Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty update was introduced in a recorded message from Keanu Reeves.<br/>It wasn't quite as breathtaking as his E3 appearance to promote the original game, but it was met with approval from many.<br/>One of the main complaints -

which didn't show any gameplay.<br/>But, if there were a Metacritic page for Microsoft's 2023 showcase, it would probably say the show had \"generally favourable\" reviews.<br/>And even PlayStation fansite Push Square was among those admitting it was \"probably the strongest Xbox Showcase in recent memory\".<br/>Microsoft still has hurdles to clear in its Activision Blizzard buyout, and the PS5 remains the bigger-selling console.<br/>It's clearly got big plans for gaming, though, so it's worth keeping an eye on the big green machine.<br/>Microsoft's collected all of its showcase trailers on its website.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

technology which sees computers perform specific tasks that would typically require human intelligence - is already widely used across a range of industries.<br/>While high-profile experts' fears that AI could lead to the extinction of humanity have recently been making headlines, the tech's more practical realities are already being shown in healthcare. <br/>Its potential to speed up the process of drug and disease discovery means many scientists and doctors see AI as a powerful tool to work with, rather than replace, practitioners.<br/>The number of screen-detected breast cancers of women of all ages grew to 1,830 between 2021 and 2022 in Scotland, according to Public Health Scotland (PHS) data.<br/>Of the 5,000 mammograms scrutinised on average by radiologists each year, between 250 and 300 patients will be called back - with 30 to 40 of them requiring closer attention.<br/>\"There is a chance that with that number, you could miss cancers,\" Dr Gerald Lip, clinical director of the North East Scotland Breast Screening Programme, told BBC Click.<br/>NHS Grampian's Gemini project -

rather than another human pair of eyes - made the process feel less intrusive.<br/>\"You know your images are on screen, and people are looking at them,\" she said. \"Whereas when it's an artificial intelligence, that bit of feeling that somebody is looking has gone.\"<br/>The results of June's biopsy means she will once again be having surgery.<br/>\"The biopsy showed that I do have an early-stage cancer, they've certainly caught it at an earlier stage this time,\" June said. \"But because I've had previous history with it, I'm going to go in and have a mastectomy.<br/>\"It's not treatment I want to have. But at the same time, it's reassuring that it's being caught.\"<br/>A major review of Scotland's breast screening programme published last year suggested a large number of radiology and advance practitioner staff are either nearing or at retirement age.<br/>It said the decline of \"super reader\" radiologists, relied on by the service to review a particularly high number of results, risks leaving the service \"vulnerable\".<br/>The Royal College of Radiologists has also warned the UK is facing \"chronic staff shortages\", with patients waiting too long for vital tests and cancer treatments.<br/>With two radiologists needed to read and report results, the Scottish government's review said replacing one human reader with AI could \"cover half of the screening image reading burden of approximately 1.72 million images read each year\". <br/>But could the technology being tested in Aberdeen some day replace human staff?<br/>\"I think the goal of this evaluation is to see what's the best way we can work with AI, whether it's replacing one of the radiologists, whether it's part reading some of the normal mammograms, or whether it's to improve our cancer detection as a safety net,\" Dr Lip said.<br/>Peter Kecskemethy, co-founder of Kheiron, said the tech will used by more than 30 NHS trusts across the UK for millions to access.<br/>And with trusts in England already exploring how AI can support better, faster outcomes for breast cancer patients, the tech looks to continue playing a large role in helping doctors save lives.<br/>You can see the full report and more ways AI is changing industries on this week's episode of Click."}, {"_id": "648897fe51ac3398be9f6484", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65834521?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave platform", "lead": "One streamer tells BBC News this is the push he needed to leave the platform altogether.", "author": "By Tom Gerken", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:26.495560", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED7F/production/_126799706_gettyimages-1235589070.jpg", "body": "Twitch is scrapping its own new advertising rules, following a backlash that saw streamers leave the platform.<br/>The Amazon-owned livestreaming service had said it would restrict the size and type of ads used by streamers who create content on Twitch.<br/>This would have substantially reduced the ways in which streamers generate income on the platform.<br/>Twitch has abandoned this policy, after several creators threatened to boycott the platform and some moved elsewhere.<br/>But not all of the new rules have been reversed, some streamers say, despite Twitch's statement.<br/>In a tweet viewed 13.4 million times, it called the new rules \"bad for you and bad for Twitch\".<br/>\"Sponsorships are critical to streamers' growth and ability to earn income,\" it said. \"We will not prevent your ability to enter into direct relationships with sponsors - you will continue to own and control your sponsorship business.<br/>\"We want to work with our community to create the best experience on Twitch - and to do that we need to be clear about what we're doing and why we're doing it.

Once the headset is on, you see the room around you but you're not seeing it through glass, you're seeing it through the many on-board cameras. This is important for the \"mixed-reality\" experience - digital content projected onto your surroundings.<br/>You physically press a single button on the top right-hand side of glasses, and up pops some familiar app icons you'll recognise if you have used an iPhone - iMessage, photos, Apple TV (there will be more as developers make them). <br/>And from then on it's all about gesture control - the headset tracks where you are looking so when you look at an app and pinch your thumb and forefinger together, it opens.<br/>Apple swept me through a number of demos. A gallery of photos, stretching from floor to ceiling, were impressive to see - although these were clearly very carefully curated, and very beautifully shot. <br/>You can shoot 3D video using the cameras on the headset - I watched a child blow out birthday candles on a cake so close to me that I felt I could almost feel her breath.<br/>I had a live video call with another Apple employee, also wearing a headset - well, a photorealistic avatar of him rather than an actual video. I don't know what he really looked like because I never met him in real life but there was something a bit weird about the smoothness of his skin, and the detail of his eyes, even when he smiled and frowned.<br/>I watched movie clips on a giant virtual screen with the room digitally darkened around me like a cinema theatre. A gigantic 3D T. rex dinosaur sniffed my face.

It can fill the entire room or appear like a TV screen superimposed against your wall. <br/>If someone walks in front of you in real life, you can see them no matter how immersed you are.<br/>I had a laborious go at trying to respond to a text message on the digital keyboard that popped up in front of me. \"Remember this is not a finished product!\" was the enthused response every time I said something that was less than glowing.<br/>Unfortunately, I can't show you any of this because everyone there was banned from recording anything. Noticeably, nobody from Apple actually wore a Vision Pro either - not even the boss, Tim Cook, or Disney CEO, Bob Iger, who described the device as \"real-life magic\".<br/>I've tried a lot of virtual-reality (VR) and mixed-reality headsets in my time as a tech journalist and this was one of the better ones. And with a launch price tag of $3,499 (\u00a32,899) you'd hope so. <br/>It will probably still be the most-expensive headset on the market when it goes on sale next year. Bloomberg has reported that Apple hopes to shift 900,000 in the first year of sales.<br/>I think Apple is playing a very clever game here with its marketing - although I'm not sure whether it will work. Traditionally, mixed-reality headsets have been targeted at gamers and promised big, extravagant moments. Kill monsters the size of your house! Be a rock star on stage at Wembley Stadium! <br/>Apple barely mentioned gaming at all. The message here was much more: do everything you do on your phone, only bigger and brighter and against the backdrop of your own home.<br/>There was much speculation that the Apple Vision Pro announcement would be an \"iPhone moment\" - that is, a huge, game-changing product from Apple in the way the iPhone changed the smartphone landscape forever.<br/>But what if the Apple Vision Pro actually is the new iPhone?<br/>By making it a useful bit of every day kit rather than an occasional thrill, Apple is very much aiming this at the mainstream. <br/>I'm not sure whether it will work. Apple has a unique magic and a very loyal customer base. People who like the brand really, really like the brand. But hardware has long been a barrier in VR. <br/>Wearing a headset for long periods of time just does not feel great. Plenty of people experience nausea (I do too, although I didn't on Monday - my demo was only 15 minutes long though, with a couple of minutes on each section). <br/>I can tell you with certainty that while it was a remarkable experience, I'm not sure I want to be sniffed by a virtual dinosaur again any time soon.<br/>Now clearly $3,499 is not a novelty product price. I remember wincing last year when Facebook-owner Meta announced its Quest Pro headset would cost about $1,500, less than half the price (it has since fallen to $999).<br/>You are of course paying for the years of research and development that goes into building the first generation of any product. But what if you use it every day? <br/>A friend of mine who works in the fashion industry says you should spend the most money on the clothes you wear most often. <br/>So if you spend \u00a3100 on a dress and wear it once, that single wear was \u00a3100. But if you wear it 100 times - it's only cost you \u00a31 each time.  <br/>Perhaps Apple is gambling that if it can make the headset useful enough, people are more likely to think about it that way. It needs a lot of content, and a lot of developers to make that work.<br/>But if you like Apple, and you like mixed reality, and you have the cash - you'll probably like this headset. <br/>If in five years time it's replaced your smartphone - well, perhaps our avatars can virtually FaceTime each other and have a chat about it. <br/>Follow Zoe on Twitter."}, {"_id": "6488980051ac3398be9f648b", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65822884?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Technology minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings", "lead": "Paul Scully says there should be more of a focus on the good artificial intelligence can do.", "author": "By Chris Vallance", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:28.045191", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09C5/production/_130010520_gettyimages-85475547.jpg", "body": "Tech minister Paul Scully has warned so-called \"Terminator-style\" risks to humanity from artificial intelligence (AI) should not be highlighted at the expense of the good it can do.<br/>The Terminator sci-fi film franchise envisages a malevolent AI \"Skynet\" system bent on humanity's destruction.<br/>Last week several firms warned AI could pose a threat to human existence.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is about to travel to the US where AI is one of the items he will be discussing.<br/>AI describes the ability of computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. <br/>When it came to AI, there was a \"dystopian point of view that we can follow here. There's also a utopian point of view. Both can be possible\", Mr Scully told the TechUK Tech Policy Leadership Conference in Westminster.<br/>A dystopia is an imaginary place in which everything is as bad as possible.<br/>\"If you're only talking about the end of humanity because of some, rogue, Terminator-style scenario, you're going to miss out on all of the good that AI is already functioning - how it's mapping proteins to help us with medical research, how it's helping us with climate change.<br/>\"All of those things it's already doing and will only get better at doing.\" <br/>The government recently put out a policy document on regulating AI which was criticised for not establishing a dedicated watchdog, and some think additional measures may eventually needed to deal with the most powerful future systems .<br/>Marc Warner, a member of the AI Council, an expert body set up to advise the government, told BBC News last week a ban on the most powerful AI may be necessary.<br/>However, he argued that \"narrow AI\" designed for particular tasks, such as systems that look for cancer in medical images, should be regulated on the same basis as existing tech.<br/>Responding to reports on the possible dangers posed by AI, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We are not complacent about the potential risks of AI, but it also provides significant opportunities. <br/>\"We can not proceed with AI without the guard rails in place.\"<br/>Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell told the BBC that while there was a \"level of hysteria going on and that's certainly dominating the public debate at the moment, there are real opportunities with the development of a technology like AI\".<br/>However, she added: \"But we do have to think really carefully about the risks, make sure we've got good regulation in place.\"<br/>It was also important that everyone benefited from the impact of AI and it \"doesn't just go to the big tech giants in the US as happened in the last technological revolution\".  <br/>Ms Powell earlier told the Guardian she felt AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which had dedicated regulators.<br/>AI company OpenAI recently blogged that a global regulator like the International Atomic Energy Authority might be needed for super-intelligent AI.<br/>At the same event, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the most powerful AIs may need safety licences to operate.<br/>\"Before a model can be deployed it will have to pass some some kind of safety review.\" <br/>Mr Smith argued it would be better if there was international co-operation and a single model of regulation. He said that when it came to cyber and national security, the UK and US were well placed to work together.<br/>He told reporters at the event that Microsoft would not join \"the fear parade\", adding it would be better to reduce some of the rhetoric and focus more on current problems.<br/>A number of other experts have also said focusing on sci-fi-like disaster scenarios is a distraction from current issues with AI, such as the risk of racial or gender biases in algorithms."}, {"_id": "6488980051ac3398be9f648c", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65823482?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "'Ducking hell' to disappear from Apple autocorrect", "lead": "One of the most common swear words will no longer be automatically changed when typing.", "author": "By Shiona McCallum", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:28.234952", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8C5A/production/_130003953_gettyimages-1020478238.jpg", "body": "Apple has said it will no longer automatically change one of the most common swear words to 'ducking'.<br/>The autocorrect feature, which has long frustrated users, will soon be able to use AI to detect when you really mean to use that expletive.<br/>\"In those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too,\" said software boss Craig Federighi.<br/>He announced the development at Apple's developers' conference in California.<br/>iPhone users have often complained about how autocorrect forces them to rewrite their own messages - with the term \"damn you autocorrect\" becoming an acronym, a meme, an Instagram account and even a song. <br/>The changes to the function will happen thanks to the use of a transformer model, which learns context by tracking relationships in data, like the words in this sentence, using mathematical techniques. <br/>Initially flagged in a 2017 paper from Google, transformers are some of the most powerful classes of AI models, and autosuggest - or predictive text - systems are beginning to become more mainstream.<br/>The autocorrect change will be part of the iOS 17 operating system upgrades which are expected to be available as a public beta in July, with the general release in September. <br/>It should mean that iPadOS 17 also carries the new function.<br/>Elsewhere at the developers' conference, Apple unveiled an augmented reality headset, Apple Vision Pro which will retail at $3,499 (\u00a32,849).<br/>Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the new headset \"seamlessly blends the real world and the virtual world\".<br/>It will be available early next year in the US and in other countries later in 2024.<br/>On Monday, Apple's market valuation reached just under $3 trillion - a new company record.<br/>Have you sent any funny or unfortunate autocorrect texts?

it is too time consuming and they care about one thing only, getting paid.<br/>And they will probably send ransom demands to the organisations breached, asking for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.<br/>\"The important message to organisations right now is not to panic, to install the security patch and not to pay the criminals,\" former National Cyber Security Centre lead Prof Ciaran Martin says.<br/>But once an organisation has been breached, the hackers have the upper hand.<br/>And the criminals thought to be responsible for the MoveIt hack are notoriously ruthless with their extortion techniques.<br/>The hackers often take time to consider their extortion tactics.<br/>\"Some prior incidents involving these criminals have seen victims not contacted until weeks after data was stolen - so if you don't hear from them in the coming days, you are not in clear,\" Mandiant Intelligence senior manager Kimberly Goody says.<br/>The group, thought to be based in Russia, will then contact a company email address, demanding payment not to publish the stolen data online, Mandiant research suggests.<br/>These demands are usually in the seven- or eight-figure range, Mandiant experts say, but there have been ones over $35m (\u00a328m).<br/>And law enforcement agencies around the world advise organisations not to pay, as it fuels the growth of these criminal gangs.<br/>For individuals, the advice is also not to panic but to be suspicious.<br/>If your organisation refuses to pay the criminals, there is a good chance they will publish the data on the dark web or try to sell it to other hackers.<br/>But there are many steps between that and you losing money.<br/>\"There really is an important message not to panic, as it's very unlikely that organisations have been storing data like full bank details which can lead directly to sort of financial harm,\" Prof Martin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. <br/>And although some organisations, such as British Airways, say some staff bank details have been stolen, this was highly unlikely to lead to individuals' bank accounts being drained.<br/>The risk, experts say, is from secondary attacks, where hackers use the details they have to trick victims into revealing more details.<br/>So the advice is to look out for suspicious emails and phone calls - particularly ones about the hack. <br/>In a typical scam, individual victims might receive a message claiming to be from their organisation, asking them to log in and verify their account because \"fraudulent activity has taken place\". <br/>Things to look out for, experts say, include:<br/>The MoveIt breach is likely to become more serious as other companies discover they have been hacked -

When it comes to moderating violent images from wars, however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights violations.<br/>Ihor Zakharenko, a former travel journalist, encountered this in Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion he has been documenting attacks on civilians.<br/>The BBC met him in a suburb of Kyiv where one year ago men, women and children had been shot dead by Russian troops while trying to flee occupation.<br/>He filmed the bodies - at least 17 of them - and burnt-out cars. <br/>He wanted to post the videos online so the world would see what happened and to counter the Kremlin's narrative. But when he uploaded them to Facebook and Instagram they were swiftly taken down.  <br/>\"Russians themselves were saying those were fakes, [that] they didn't touch civilians, they fought only with the Ukrainian army,\" Ihor said.<br/>We uploaded Ihor's footage on to Instagram and YouTube using dummy accounts. <br/>Instagram took down three of the four videos within a minute.<br/>At first, YouTube applied age restrictions to the same three, but 10 minutes later removed them all. <br/>We tried again - but they failed to upload altogether. An appeal to restore the videos on the basis that they included evidence of war crimes was rejected.<br/>Key figures within the industry say there is an urgent need for social media companies to prevent this kind of information from vanishing.<br/>\"You can see why they have developed and train their machines to, the moment they see something that looks difficult or traumatic, to take it down,\" Mr Rusbridger told the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent \"supreme court\" for the company, which owns Facebook and Instagram.<br/>\"I think the next question for them is how do we develop the machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more reasonable decisions,\" Mr Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.<br/>No-one would deny tech firms' right to police content, says US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaak: \"I think where the concern happens is when that information suddenly disappears.\"<br/>War Crimes: Do Not Delete<br/>Atrocities from war are being documented on social media. This material can be used as evidence to help prosecute war crimes.

But our experiment with Ihor's videos suggest otherwise.<br/>Meta says it responds \"to valid legal requests from law enforcement agencies around the world\" and \"we continue to explore additional avenues to support international accountability processes\u2026 consistent with our legal and privacy obligations\".<br/>YouTube says that while it has exemptions for graphic content in the public interest, the platform is not an archive. It says, \"Human rights organisations; activists, human rights defenders, researchers, citizen journalists and others documenting human rights abuses (or other potential crimes) should observe best practices for securing and preserving their content.\"<br/>The BBC also spoke to Imad, who owned a pharmacy in Aleppo, Syria, until a Syrian government barrel bomb landed nearby in 2013.<br/>He recalls how the blast filled the room with dust and smoke. Hearing cries for help, he went to the market outside and saw hands, legs and dead bodies covered in blood.<br/>Local TV crews captured these scenes. The footage was posted on YouTube and Facebook but has subsequently been taken down. <br/>In the mayhem of the conflict, Syrian journalists told the BBC their own recordings of the original footage were also destroyed in bombing raids. <br/>Years later, when Imad was applying for asylum in the EU, he was asked to provide documents that proved he was at the scene. <br/>\"I was sure that my pharmacy was captured on camera. But when I went online, it was taking me to a deleted video.\" <br/>In response to this sort of incident, organisations like Mnemonic, a Berlin-based human rights organisation, have stepped in to archive footage before it disappears. <br/>Mnemonic developed a tool to automatically download and save evidence of human rights violations - first in Syria and now in Yemen, Sudan and Ukraine.<br/>They have saved more than 700,000 images from war zones before they were removed from social media, including three videos showing the attack near Imad's pharmacy.<br/>Each image might hold a key clue to uncover what really transpired on the battlefield - the location, the date or the perpetrator.<br/>But organisations like Mnemonic cannot cover every area of conflict around the world. <br/>Proving that war crimes have been committed is incredibly hard - so getting as many sources as possible is vital.<br/>\"Verification is like solving a puzzle - you put together seemingly unrelated pieces of information to build a bigger picture of what happened,\" says BBC Verify's Olga Robinson.<br/>The task of archiving open-source material - available to pretty much anyone on social media - often falls to people with a mission to help their relatives caught up in violent conflict. <br/>Rahwa lives in the United States and has family in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, which has been wracked with violence in recent years, and where the authorities in Ethiopia tightly control the flow of information.<br/>However, social media means there is a visual record of a conflict that might otherwise remain hidden from the outside world.<br/>\"It was our duty,\" says Rahwa. \"I spent hours doing research, and so when you're seeing this content trickle in you're trying to verify using all the open-source intelligence tools you can get your hands on, but you don't know if your family is OK.\"<br/>Human rights campaigners say there is an urgent need for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted content.  This would include preserving metadata to help verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.<br/>Ms Van Schaak, the US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice, says: \"We need to create a mechanism whereby that information can be preserved for potential future accountability exercises.

And on Wednesday, the bloc's technology chief, Margrethe Vestager, said a voluntary code of conduct for AI could be created \"within the next weeks\".<br/>Some fear that advanced computational ability could be used for harmful purposes, such as the development of deadly new chemical weapons.<br/>Prof Bengio told the BBC he was concerned about \"bad actors\" getting hold of AI, especially as it became more sophisticated and powerful.<br/>\"It might be military, it might be terrorists, it might be somebody very angry, psychotic. And so if it's easy to program these AI systems to ask them to do something very bad, this could be very dangerous.<br/>\"If they're smarter than us, then it's hard for us to stop these systems or to prevent damage,\" he added.<br/>Prof Bengio admitted those concerns were taking a personal toll on him, as his life's work, which had given him direction and a sense of identity, was no longer clear to him.<br/>\"It is challenging, emotionally speaking, for people who are inside [the AI sector],\" he said.<br/>\"You could say I feel lost. But you have to keep going and you have to engage, discuss, encourage others to think with you.\" <br/>The Canadian has signed two recent statements urging caution about the future risks of AI. Some academics and industry experts have warned that the pace of development could result in malicious AI being deployed by \"bad actors\" to actively cause harm - or choosing to inflict harm by itself.<br/>Fellow \"godfather\" Dr Geoffrey Hinton has also signed the same warnings as Prof Bengio, and retired from Google recently saying he regretted his work. <br/>The third \"godfather\", Prof Yann LeCun, who along with Prof Bengio and Dr Hinton won a prestigious Turing Award for their pioneering work, has said apocalyptic warnings are overblown.<br/>Twitter and Tesla owner Elon Musk has also voiced his concerns.<br/>\"I don't think AI will try to destroy humanity, but it might put us under strict controls,\" he said recently at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. <br/>\"There's a small likelihood of it annihilating humanity. Close to zero but not impossible.\"<br/>Prof Bengio told the BBC all companies building powerful AI products needed to be registered.<br/>\"Governments need to track what they're doing, they need to be able to audit them, and that's just the minimum thing we do for any other sector like building aeroplanes or cars or pharmaceuticals,\" he said.<br/>\"We also need the people who are close to these systems to have a kind of certification... we need ethical training here. Computer scientists don't usually get that, by the way.\" <br/>But not everybody in the field believes AI will be the downfall of humans - others argue that there are more imminent problems which need addressing.<br/>Dr Sasha Luccioni, research scientist at the AI firm Huggingface, said society should focus on issues like AI bias, predictive policing, and the spread of misinformation by chatbots which she said were \"very concrete harms\". <br/>\"We should focus on that rather than the hypothetical risk that AI will destroy humanity,\" she added.<br/>There are already many examples of AI bringing benefits to society. Last week an AI tool discovered a new antibiotic, and a paralysed man was able to walk again just by thinking about it, thanks to a microchip developed using AI.<br/>But this is juxtaposed with fears about the far-reaching impact of AI on countries' economies. Firms are already replacing human staff with AI tools, and it is a factor in the current strike under way by scriptwriters in Hollywood.<br/>\"It's never too late to improve,\" says Prof Bengio of AI's current state. \"It's exactly like climate change. <br/>\"We've put a lot of carbon in the atmosphere. And it would be better if we hadn't, but let's see what we can do now.\"<br/>Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk<br/>What are your questions about artificial intelligence?"}, {"_id": "6488980451ac3398be9f649a", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65762114?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Elon Musk: Tesla boss on first China trip in over three years", "lead": "The multi-billionaire has not yet publicly commented on the visit, which comes amid US-China tensions.", "author": "By Annabelle Liang", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:32.397416", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C781/production/_129937015_962bf1c875278696e9c31b8e2bb5bf1f79ad5d15.jpg", "body": "Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is in China, as he makes his first trip to the world's second largest economy in over three years.<br/>He arrived in Beijing on Tuesday and is also expected to visit Tesla's huge manufacturing plant in Shanghai.<br/>The multi-billionaire met China's foreign minister Qin Gang within hours of arriving in the country.<br/>Mr Musk has not yet publicly commented on the trip, which comes amid tensions between the US and China.<br/>He also declined to make any comments about his plans for the trip when asked by reporters as he left a hotel in Beijing on Wednesday.<br/>Later on Wednesday, Mr Musk met China's industry minister Jin Zhuanglong and discussed the development of electric vehicles.<br/>In a statement on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said that Mr Musk was willing to expand the car maker's business in the country, which is Tesla's biggest market after the US.<br/>The ministry added that during the meeting Mr Musk had described the economies of the US and China as \"conjoined twins\".<br/>Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.<br/>Mr Musk has also been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter, which he owns and where he has more than 141 million followers.<br/>He is known for tweeting many times a day but as of midday on Wednesday had not posted anything since arriving in the country on Tuesday afternoon. <br/>The social media platform is banned in China but it can be accessed through VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks.<br/>Mr Musk is the latest high-profile US executive to make a trip to China.

Her arrival at the facility was confirmed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which declined to give any more details about her confinement, citing privacy concerns. <br/>There, the woman once billed as the world's youngest self-made billionaire might work alongside other inmates for between 12 cents (10p) and $1.15 (93p) an hour - much of which will go towards her court-mandated restitution payments. <br/>Earlier this month a US judge ordered Holmes and her former romantic and business partner, ex-Theranos boss Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, to pay $452m to victims.<br/>Balwani is already serving a 13-year prison sentence in California for his role in the scheme. <br/>Together, the pair are accused of duping some of the world's richest and most prominent investors - including media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and former US Treasury Secretary George Shultz - into backing Theranos. <br/>The firm, once valued at $9bn, promised it had technology that could detect conditions such as diabetes with just a few drops of blood. The tech, however, never worked. The company finally collapsed in 2018. <br/>The Texas prison camp where Holmes will serve time is a sprawling 37-acre facility. Most inmates there have been convicted of non-violent crimes, low-level drug dealing or white-collar offences. <br/>According to the facility's handbook, life largely revolves around work and extracurricular activities that include foreign language, computer literacy or business courses.<br/>Holmes had fought to stay out of prison while her legal appeal works its way through the courts. She argued a delay would allow her to raise \"substantial questions\" about the case that could warrant a new trial. <br/>Her defence team also argued that she should remain free to care for her children, one who is nearly two and the other three months old. <br/>The Wall Street Journal reported the prison has facilities where inmates can host gatherings and where children can play.<br/>Holmes and other mothers are allowed to hold their children in their lap and breastfeed their infants, according to official Bureau of Prison guidelines. <br/>The image of Holmes walking into a federal prison on Tuesday stands as a dire warning to other bosses in Silicon Valley, where observers have long warned of a \"fake it until you make it\" culture. <br/>Still, it is rare to see tech bosses go to prison on fraud charges.<br/>The US government hopes that Holmes's plight will deter executives from making outlandish claims about what their technology can do while hunting for financial backing. <br/>Eileen Lepera, who lost part of her savings investing in Theranos, told the BBC this week that she is \"glad she [Ms Holmes] got 11 years\". <br/>\"Her hubris is beyond belief,\" she added. \"I don't believe she's still taking any responsibility for what has happened.\" <br/>In tearful remarks ahead of her sentencing in November, Holmes said she regrets her failings at Theranos \"with every cell in my body\" but did not admit any criminal wrongdoing."}, {"_id": "6488980451ac3398be9f649c", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Artificial intelligence could lead to extinction, experts warn", "lead": "Heads of OpenAI, Google Deepmind and Anthropic say the threat is as great as pandemics and nuclear war.", "author": "By Chris Vallance", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:32.823847", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B80/production/_129902572_gettyimages-1257740282.jpg", "body": "Artificial intelligence could lead to the extinction of humanity, experts - including the heads of OpenAI and Google Deepmind - have warned.<br/>Dozens have supported a statement published on the webpage of the Centre for AI Safety.<br/>\"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\" it reads.<br/>But others say the fears are overblown. <br/>Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Demis Hassabis, chief executive of Google DeepMind and Dario Amodei of Anthropic have all supported the statement.<br/>The Centre for AI Safety website suggests a number of possible disaster scenarios:<br/>Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who issued an earlier warning about risks from super-intelligent AI, has also supported the Centre for AI Safety's call.<br/>Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at the university of Montreal, also signed.<br/>Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and NYU Professor Yann LeCun are often described as the \"godfathers of AI\" for their groundbreaking work in the field - for which they jointly won the 2018 Turing Award, which recognises outstanding contributions in computer science. <br/>But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta, has said these apocalyptic warnings are overblown tweeting that \"the most common reaction by AI researchers to these prophecies of doom is face palming\". <br/>Many other experts similarly believe that fears of AI wiping out humanity are unrealistic, and a distraction from issues such as bias in systems that are already a problem.<br/>Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, has previously told the BBC that sci-fi-like disaster scenarios are unrealistic: \"Current AI is nowhere near capable enough for these risks to materialise.

They would \"drive an exponential increase in the volume and spread of misinformation, thereby fracturing reality and eroding the public trust, and drive further inequality, particularly for those who remain on the wrong side of the digital divide\". <br/>Many AI tools essentially \"free ride\" on the \"whole of human experience to date\", Ms Renieris said. Many are trained on human-created content, text, art and music they can then imitate - and their creators \"have effectively transferred tremendous wealth and power from the public sphere to a small handful of private entities\". <br/>But Centre for AI Safety director Dan Hendrycks told BBC News future risks and present concerns \"shouldn't be viewed antagonistically\". <br/>\"Addressing some of the issues today can be useful for addressing many of the later risks tomorrow,\" he said.<br/>Media coverage of the supposed \"existential\" threat from AI has snowballed since March 2023 when experts, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a halt to the development of the next generation of AI technology.<br/>That letter asked if we should \"develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us\".<br/>In contrast, the new campaign has a very short statement, designed to \"open up discussion\".<br/>The statement compares the risk to that posed by nuclear war.

That's despite Intel reporting more than $63bn in revenue last year, compared with Nvidia's $27bn. <br/>Geir Lode, head of global equities at Federated Hermes, said the magnitude of the recent leap in Nvidia's share price was \"an astonishing surprise even to techno-optimists\". <br/>\"Artificial intelligence is the next super charged growth area, and we expect this is just the beginning,\" Mr Lode said. \"We know growth will be there, but valuations can be hard to justify.\"<br/>Investor Cathie Wood, chief executive of Ark Invest, who is known as a tech booster, sold her stake in Nvidia in January, missing the gains made since then.<br/>She recently tweeted that the firm's shares were \"priced ahead of the curve\". She said markets were making a mistake to think the company was \"the only AI play\".<br/>In the past, investors have not hesitated to sour on former favourites. <br/>Facebook-owner Meta, which joined the $1tn club in 2021, was booted out just a few months later, as its shares lost roughly three quarters of their value.

She would jump at the chance, he says, \"to step in... and say, 'I can fix this'\".<br/>Which begs the question: can she?<br/>Even before billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, the social network had problems.<br/>It has been fiercely criticised, by the left and right, for how it polices misinformation and hate speech, and the business has struggled to break even - making an annual profit just twice since its launch in 2006.<br/>Growth, whether measured by users or the money it brings in, has been bumpy.<br/>Since Mr Musk took over the platform last year, the issues have only gotten worse.<br/>He has cut 75% of its former staff, including teams charged with tracking abuse; changed how the company verifies authentic accounts; and sparked debate with his own tweets spreading conspiracy theories.<br/>Advertisers have left in large numbers and users also appear sceptical. A recent poll by Pew found that six in 10 adults in the US, Twitter's largest base, were taking a break and a quarter said they did not expect to be using the app in a year.<br/>Even Mr Musk has seemed daunted by the challenges, going through with his $44bn purchase last year only under threat of a lawsuit. He has joked that only someone \"foolish\" would want the chief executive title from him.<br/>Ms Yaccarino appears undaunted. <br/>Raised in an Italian-American family, the daughter of a police officer has risen through the ranks of some of the biggest media companies in the US, forging a reputation as a high-heeled and hard-charging executive, who has helped steer entertainment giant NBCUniversal through the upheaval wrought by the growth of the tech giants.<br/>At NBCU, home to brands such as NBC News, Focus Features and Bravo, Ms Yaccarino overhauled the ad sales business, pushed the 2020 launch of its ad-supported streaming platform Peacock, and drove industry-wide debates about data gaps as audiences migrated online. <br/>The mother-of-two, who met her husband Claude Madrazo on a blind date and became a grandmother last year, was known to want some kind of promotion after a decade at NBCU where she was chairman of global advertising and partnerships. <br/>There was widespread speculation about her interest in Twitter, especially after she defended Mr Musk at a conference last year, urging critical advertisers to \"give the guy a minute\". <br/>\"I've long been inspired by your vision to create a brighter future,\" she tweeted after her new post was announced. \"I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!\"<br/>By hiring Ms Yaccarino, Mr Musk has \"purchased trust\" from advertisers, says Mr Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory.<br/>Indeed, industry giant GroupM, who represents brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestle, has already said it sees the platform as less risky.<br/>But repairing Twitter's business will be no small task. <br/>Though big ad buyers are eager to have choices beyond the tech giants, the platform remains too small to be a must-buy, says long-time media analyst Brian Wieser, now principal at consultancy Madison and Wall. <br/>Beyond advertising, she will also face a host of pressing issues: regulatory scrutiny of Twitter's hate speech and privacy controls; lawsuits from landlords, vendors and former staff over unpaid bills; not to mention user complaints and basic tech glitches, like the malfunctions that plagued the high-profile interview with Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis hosted on the platform. <br/>The biggest wild card of all, of course, is Mr Musk, who has said he intends to remain involved at the site, overseeing products and technology. <br/>\"Anybody taking this job has been set up to fail - it's not specific to her,\" Mr Wieser says. \"The question is whether or not the odds are more likely to be in her favour than any alternative.

He can also now stand and climb stairs.<br/>\"It has been a long journey, but now I can stand up and have a beer with my friend. It's a pleasure that many people don't realise.\"<br/>The development, published in the journal Nature, was led by Swiss researchers. Prof Jocelyne Bloch, of Lausanne University, who is the neurosurgeon who carried out the delicate surgery to insert the implants, stressed that the system was still at a basic research stage and was many years away from being available to paralysed patients. <br/>But she told BBC News that it was the team's aim to get it out of the lab and into the clinic as soon as possible.<br/>\"The important thing for us is not just to have a scientific trial, but eventually to give more access to more people with spinal cord injuries who are used to hearing from doctors that they have to get used to the fact that they will never move again.\"<br/>Harvey Sihota is chief executive of the UK charity Spinal Research, which was not involved in the research. He said that although there was a long way to go before the technology would be generally available, he described the development as \"very encouraging\".<br/>\"While there is still much to improve with these technologies this is another exciting step on the roadmap for neurotechnology and its role in restoring function and independence to our spinal cord injury community\".<br/>The operation to restore Gert-Jan's movement was carried out in July 2021. Prof Bloch cut two circular holes on each side of his skull, 5cm in diameter, above the regions of the brain involved in controlling movement. She then inserted two disc-shaped implants which wirelessly transmit brain signals - Gert-Jan's intentions - to two sensors attached to a helmet on his head.<br/>The Swiss team developed an algorithm which translates these signals into instructions to move leg and foot muscles via a second implant inserted around Gert-Jan's spinal cord - which Prof Bloch intricately attached to the nerve endings related to walking.<br/>The researchers found that after a few weeks of training he could stand and walk with the aid of a walker. His movement is slow but smooth, according to Prof Gr\u00e9goire Courtine of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale in Lausanne (EPFL),  who led the project.<br/>\"Seeing him walk so naturally is so moving,\" he said. \"It is a paradigm shift in what was available before\".<br/>The brain implants build on Prof Courtine's earlier work, when only the spinal implant was used to restore movement. The spinal implant amplified weak signals from the brain to the damaged part of the spinal column and was boosted further by pre-programmed signals from a computer.<br/>BBC News reported how  in 2018, David M'Zee became the first patient to be successfully treated with a spinal implant, so much so that he was able to have a baby with his wife, something that had not been possible previously. <br/>And last year we reported how as the result of the same technology, Michel Roccati became the first man with a completely severed spine to walk again.<br/>Both have benefitted tremendously but their walking motion is pre-programmed and looks robotic. They also have to keep their intended movements in step with the computer and have to stop and reset if they get out of sync.<br/>Gert-Jan had only the spinal implant before he had the brain implants. He says that he now has much greater control.<br/>\"I felt before that the system was controlling me, but now I am controlling it\".Neither the previous or new systems can be used constantly. They are bulky and still at an experimental stage. <br/>Instead, patients use them for an hour or so for a few times a week as part of their recuperation. The act of walking trains their muscles and has restored a degree of movement when the system is turned off, suggesting that damaged nerves may be regrowing.<br/>The eventual aim is to miniaturise the technology. Prof Courtine's spin out company Onward Medical, is making improvements to commercialise the technology so it can be used in people's day-to-day lives.<br/>\"It's coming,\" says Prof Courtine,. \"Gert-Jan received the implant 10 years after his accident. Imagine when we apply our brain-spine interface a few weeks after the injury.

However, he has managed to retain his billionaire status - he has a net worth of \u00a32.4bn according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. <br/>When it became clear Virgin Orbit was unable to secure long-term funding, it filed for bankruptcy protection in the US early last month. <br/>Rival start-up Rocket Lab has bought most of Virgin Orbit's headquarters in California as well as other assets. The company's Boeing 747 plane, which was converted to help launch satellites, has also been sold off. In total, the asset sale fetched $36.4m (\u00a329.4m).<br/>Virgin Orbit, which was founded in 2017, never made a profit as a public company.<br/>So much was riding on Virgin Orbit's rocket launch from Cornwall in January, it was supposed to be a spectacular start to a new industry in the UK.<br/>But the dislodging of a small component - a fuel filter - had a domino effect. The rocket failed, confidence was lost in Virgin Orbit and now the company has been sold off, piecemeal. <br/>Where does this leave Spaceport Cornwall, the UK's first licensed spaceport? US-based Virgin Orbit was their key customer.   <br/>The Cornwall team there say they're working with other launch companies, including Sierra Space, and they'll continue to create and grow a space cluster in the South West. <br/>But another Cornwall blast off is unlikely to happen anytime soon. The site at Newquay Airport is limited to horizontal launches - where a plane takes off, carrying a rocket, which is then launched mid-flight.  <br/>Other sites around the UK have their sights set on space too. SaxaVord Spaceport, based on the Shetland island of Unst, is now leading the way.<br/>This is a vertical launch site where rockets blast off skywards from a pad. SaxaVord is working with several firms, including a German company called Rocket Factory Augsburg - engine testing is set to take place in Shetland later this year.<br/>And it's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland.

also used in apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage - prevents law enforcement and the firms themselves from identifying the sharing of child sexual abuse material.<br/>Mr Tugendhat said: \"Faced with an epidemic of child sexual exploitation abuse, Meta are choosing to ignore it and in doing so, they are allowing predators to operate with impunity. <br/>\"That is an extraordinary moral choice. It is an extraordinary decision. And I think we should remember who it is who is making it.\"<br/>He was speaking at the PIER23 conference on tackling online harms at Anglia Ruskin University Chelmsford.<br/>The security minister singled out the Meta boss for criticism. <br/>\"I am speaking about Meta specifically, and Mark Zuckerberg's choices particularly. These are his choices,\" he said.<br/>A government advertising campaign will soon be launched \"to tell parents the truth about Meta's choices and what they mean for the safety of their children\", he said. <br/>The campaign, which would run in print, online and broadcast, would \"encourage tech firms to take responsibility and to do the right thing\", Mr Tugendhat said.<br/>The Home Office declined to provide more detail about the campaign when approached by the BBC.<br/>Meta argues the majority of British people already rely on apps that use encryption to keep them safe from hackers, fraudsters and criminals.<br/>\"We don't think people want us reading their private messages so have developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security\", it said.<br/>The company removes and reports millions of images each month. <br/>WhatsApp, which Meta owns, made more than one million reports in a year even though it uses end-to-end-encryption.<br/>The Home Office has promoted similar campaigns in the past, such as last year's No Place to Hide campaign, which also called on Facebook to abandon plans for end-to-end encryption. <br/>But the data watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office was critical of the campaign, arguing the tech helped protect children from criminals and abusers, urged Facebook to roll it out without delay.<br/>The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communication regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.<br/>Several messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.<br/>The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material.<br/>The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.<br/>This, critics argue, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages and to argue otherwise would be like arguing that digging a hole under a fence did not break the fence<br/>Signal told the BBC in February that it would \"walk\" from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.<br/>In response to the minister's comments, its president Meredith Whittaker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was trying to implement \"a mass surveillance apparatus\". It would, she said, require people to \"run government-mandated scanning services on their devices\".<br/>Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, told Today that: \"Essentially it's building a door that doesn't currently exist, not into the encrypted messaging app but into devices, which could be used or misused by people who aren't interested in protecting children for more nefarious purposes.\" <br/>Mr Martin said he believed the UK would end up in the \"unhappy situation\" where the power in the bill would be passed by Parliament but not used. <br/>Apple tried client-side scanning, but abandoned it after a backlash. In an article in the Financial Times, Mr Martin suggested Apple is privately critical of the powers in the bill, but the firm has so far declined to set out publicly its position on the issue.<br/>BBC News learned from Freedom of Information requests that Apple has had four meetings since April 2022 with the Ofcom team responsible for developing policy regarding the enforcement of the relevant section of the bill.

The testers said Evolv should inform potential clients.<br/>Despite this, the company has been expanding into schools, and now claims to be in hundreds of them across the US. <br/>In March 2022, the Utica Schools Board bought Evolv's weapons scanning system for 13 schools. It was installed over the summer holidays.<br/>On 31 October, CCTV captured the perpetrator of the attack against Ehni Ler Htoo entering Proctor High School and passing through the Evolv weapons scanners, according to one source at the school who has seen the security footage. <br/>\"When we viewed the horrific video, we all asked the same question. How did the student get the knife into the school?\" said Brian Nolan, Superintendent of Utica Schools.<br/>The knife used in the stabbing was more than 9in (22.8cm) long. <br/>The attack triggered an internal investigation by Utica's school district. <br/>\"Through investigation it was determined the Evolv Weapon Detection System\u2026 was not designed to detect knives,\" Mr Nolan said.<br/>The scanners were removed from Proctor High School and replaced by 10 metal detectors. But the scanners are still operating in the district's remaining 12 schools. Mr Nolan says the district cannot afford to get rid of Evolv's system in its remaining schools. <br/>Since that attack, Mr Nolan says three other knives have been found on students in other schools in the district where the Evolv systems continue to operate. <br/>One of the knives was 7in long. Another was a curved blade with finger holes. Another was a pocket knife. Mr Nolan says they were all found because they were reported to staff - not because the weapons scanner had detected them. <br/>\"The kids [who had the knives] all said they walked right through the weapons detection system, we asked them about that\u2026 it truly, truly does not find knives,\" he said.<br/>After the stabbing, the wording on Evolv's website changed. <br/>Up until October last year, Evolv's homepage featured a headline that boasted of \"Weapons-Free Zones\". The company then removed that wording, and changed the text  to \"Safe Zones\". It has now been changed again and reads \"Safer Zones\". <br/>Evolv claims its system uses cutting-edge AI technology to find weapons. However, its critics say not enough is known about how the system works - or how effective this technology is at finding different types of weapons.<br/>The BBC sent a detailed right of reply to Evolv, laying out what had happened at the school in Utica, and the decision of the school to stop using its system. <br/>We also asked what Evolv had told schools about what its system could and could not detect, whether it had told schools that independent testing had found its systems could not reliably detect large knives, and whether it thought its systems were suitable for use in schools. Evolv did not answer the questions.<br/>Conor Healy of IPVM, a firm that analyses security equipment, says Evolv has exaggerated how effective the system is.<br/>\"There's an epidemic of schools buying new technology based on audacious marketing claims, then finding out it has hidden flaws, often millions of dollars later. Evolv is one of the worst offenders. School officials are not technical experts on weapons detection, and companies like Evolv profit from their ignorance.\"<br/>Playing fast and loose with marketing claims is unacceptable when you sell a security product used to protect young people, he added.<br/>Although Evolv did not give the BBC a comment, it did direct it to a blog post from its CEO, Peter George, in which he defends the lack of detail in how much the firm has said about how the technology works. <br/>\"Marketing weapons detection security requires a delicate balance between educating stakeholders on new technology and not providing bad actors with the information they could use to do harm,\" he said. <br/>\"So, while public-facing marketing materials are intentionally not specific, we communicate all aspects of the Evolv Express system - including limitations and\u202fcapabilities - with the trusted security professionals at our customers, partners, and prospects\", the blogpost read. <br/>The BBC contacted seven other school districts that all use Evolv weapons scanners. Five did not respond. Two said they did not wish to comment."}, {"_id": "6488980951ac3398be9f64b0", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65679356?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "WhatsApp to allow users to edit messages within 15 minutes", "lead": "The instant-messaging service, which is used by 2 billion people, counts India as its largest market.", "author": "By Annabelle Liang", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:37.474709", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E2D9/production/_129837085_f46af221921b9b965194b8f638f605003e571ead.jpg", "body": "WhatsApp says it will allow users to edit messages, in a move that will see it match a feature offered by competitors like Telegram and Discord.<br/>The firm says messages can be edited for up to 15 minutes after being sent.<br/>The instant-messaging service is part of US technology giant Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram.<br/>The feature will made be available to WhatsApp's 2 billion users in the coming weeks.

This week Ireland saw semiconductor firm ADI invest \u20ac630m in a research and manufacturing facility in Limerick.<br/>The chair of the House of Commons Business Select Committee, Labour MP Darren Jones, welcomed the strategy and the recognition of the need to invest but added, \"the initial \u00a3250m is a very small amount of subsidy compared to other countries\".<br/>Under the strategy \u00a3200m will be invested between 2023-25 to provide infrastructure for industry, fund more research, and promote international co-operation.<br/>Labour shadow culture minister Lucy Powell said that after years of delays, the strategy would be met with disappointment and showed \"significantly less ambition than our competitors\".<br/>Gaurav Gupta of consultants Gartner said the funding was fine for research, but if the ambition was to be competitive with the big players in the field - Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom and AMD then the \u00a31bn was \"insignificant\".<br/>Dr Simon Thomas, chief executive of UK based graphene semiconductor start-up Paragraf, told the BBC the announcement was \"quite frankly flaccid\". <br/>\"It is a long way from addressing the needs of UK chipmakers,\" he said. <br/>Zoe Kleinman, the BBC's technology editor said: \"Many businesses making hardware say when there's a shortage, it's difficult to get a look-in with the enormous chip manufacturers because their output is hoovered up by giants like Apple with far deeper pockets than anybody else. <br/>\"Will the UK government have sharp enough elbows to muscle in?

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\""}, {"_id": "6488980e51ac3398be9f64bc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65669537?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why millions of usable hard drives are being destroyed", "lead": "It is estimated that 90% of hard drives are destroyed.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman."}, {"_id": "6488980e51ac3398be9f64bd", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65532128?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The tech tricks that make computer games look real", "lead": "Computer games are becoming indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:42.428524", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1580A/production/_129647088_cyberpunk_2077_street_bike_rtxon_badged.png", "body": "The police officer approaches a derelict, graffiti-scrawled industrial building.

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says."}, {"_id": "6488980e51ac3398be9f64be", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65678967?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Elizabeth Holmes has gone to prison.

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\""}, {"_id": "6488980e51ac3398be9f64bf", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65321487?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumps", "lead": "Whole towns in Europe are being heated by huge, energy efficient heat pumps.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:42.893667", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/042A/production/_129766010_f91b782b-55ab-46ab-9866-7ebe54e08d24.jpg", "body": "There are 2.5 million litres of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. <br/>If for some reason you wanted to bring it from a pleasant 20C to boiling point, German firm MAN Energy Solutions (MAN ES) has a heat pump that could do it. And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\""}, {"_id": "6488980f51ac3398be9f64c0", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65729383?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Tech", "subCategories": "", "title": "Neuralink: Why is Elon Musk\u2019s brain chip firm in the news?", "lead": "Elon Musk\u2019s brain chip firm Neuralink has received the US regulatory green light for its first human clinical trial, after earlier controversies.", "author": "By Shiona McCallum", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:43.105571", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7852/production/_122520803_gettyimages-1194820617.jpg", "body": "Elon Musk's brain chip firm Neuralink has said that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its first human clinical trial, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval. <br/>The FDA nod \"represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,\" Neuralink said in a tweet. <br/>It did not elaborate on the aims of the study, saying only that it was not recruiting yet, and more details would be available soon. <br/>The firm says it is trying to create a new way to allow computers to communicate directly with the human brain.  <br/>The hope is that by doing this, Neuralink would be able to tackle complex neurological conditions which have so far proved beyond the capability of medical intervention. These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia. <br/>The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain. <br/>The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals.<br/>There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety. <br/>Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\""}, {"_id": "6488980f51ac3398be9f64c2", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65034773?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "ChatGPT: Can China overtake the US in the AI marathon?", "lead": "Washington's efforts to limit China's access to crucial cutting-edge technology continue.", "author": "By Derek Cai & Annabelle Liang", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:43.566497", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13738/production/_129327697_gettyimages-1248931741.jpg", "body": "Artificial intelligence has emerged as enough of a concern that it made it onto what was already a packed agenda at the G7 summit at the weekend.<br/>Concerns about AI's harmful impact coincide with the US' attempts to restrict China's access to crucial technology.<br/>For now, the US seems to be ahead in the AI race. And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810,000) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen."}, {"_id": "6488980f51ac3398be9f64c3", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65626371?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why car parks are the hottest space in solar power", "lead": "Car parks are a good place for solar panels, providing shade and electricity where it is needed.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:43.900150", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1785A/production/_129764369_newsolarcarparkcanopy2-credit-jontillott.jpg", "body": "There's more than just cars and empty spaces in this car park.

The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox.

Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says."}, {"_id": "6488981051ac3398be9f64c4", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65468298?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "How the power of protein is being uncovered", "lead": "Artificial intelligence has transformed research into proteins and promises new drugs and materials.", "author": "By Ben Morris", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:44.160838", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1301A/production/_129605877_img_8334.jpg", "body": "The Light Gas Gun at the University of Kent is an unwieldy device which, to me, looks more like a lathe than a gun.<br/>Despite its lumbering appearance the gun can fire projectiles at a speed of 1.5km per second, or around 3,500mph, that's almost twice the speed of a bullet.<br/>Today it has been loaded up with a piece of of basalt rock, a bit smaller than a pea, which will be blasted at a very special gel. <br/>The gel is made of the protein talin - or at least a version of the protein that has been refined and tweaked to give it an extraordinary ability to absorb impacts, as we are about to find out.<br/>We are herded out of the gun room and after a quick countdown the gun operator, Luke Alesbrook, pushes the button, triggering the gun.<br/>Back inside smoke wafts from the gun barrel as the target is removed. On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>He sees new treatments emerging for cancer, neuro-degeneration and infectious diseases. Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" "}, {"_id": "6488981051ac3398be9f64c5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65625526?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "Elizabeth Holmes: Inside the routine at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas", "lead": "Here's what we know about the Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where Holmes will serve her 11-year sentence.", "author": "By Madeline Halpert", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:44.401435", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3BF3/production/_129774351_bry_lrg1.jpg", "body": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has swapped life in California for a minimum-security women's prison facility, roughly 100 miles (160 km) from her Texas hometown. <br/>The disgraced former CEO reported to prison on Tuesday to serve her over 11-year sentence at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas (known as FPC Bryan). <br/>Earlier this month a judge rejected Holmes' latest bid to remain free while appealing against her conviction. <br/>She was found guilty of defrauding investors in her blood-testing start-up last year.  <br/>Holmesreportedly spent her last free weeks in a rental home in San Diego, California with her partner, hotel heir William Evans, and their two young children, including a three month old. <br/>She will now be wearing khaki pants and a khaki shirt and getting an 06:00 wake-up call each day with other female inmates at FPC Bryan, according to a handbook for the prison. <br/>The facility, which sits on 37 acres, is home to more than 500 inmates - most of whom are serving time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes. <br/>Holmes, who grew up partly in Houston, Texas, would not be the first celebrity to spend time at the prison camp. Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Star Jen Shah is serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence there for wire fraud.<br/>The celebrity entrepreneur might have roommates in prison. Inmates are typically housed in dormitory-style two-person bunk beds, and four to eight person cubicles, according to Pink Lady Prison Consultants, a prison consulting group led by formerly incarcerated people. <br/>Life at the federal facility is centred around work and extracurricular programmes, the prison handbook says. <br/>All inmates are expected to work, and earn between 12 cents and $1.15 (\u00a30.90) an hour for their jobs. Many are involved in food service and factory work. <br/>Outside of their work, female inmates can take classes on business skills and foreign languages, watch television, play sports and go to religious services, according to the handbook.<br/>Holmes would be allotted an hour for each meal at the facility, which offers a standard Federal Bureau of Prisons menu, consisting of foods like chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs, tacos and macaroni. <br/>As per the prison handbook, she could speak to her family via video calls. Inmates are also allowed visitors during weekends and holidays, but like other inmates, Holmes would be allowed limited physical contact with her partner and young children.<br/>Rules at the female-only facility are also strict, the handbook says, adding that inmates are \"treated in a mature and responsible manner\" and are \"expected to act accordingly\". <br/>Inmates can face disciplinary measures for a number of actions, including not keeping their cell or room neat, sleeping past the early designated wake-up hour, sharing their phone account with other inmates, and leaving an area during an official inmate rollcall, which happens five times a day. <br/>Holmes' time behind bars will stand in stark contrast to her past life. Once lauded as the \"next Steve Jobs\", the start-up founder was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, making the cover of Forbes and other prominent magazines. <br/>She started Theranos shortly after dropping out of Stanford University. As the leader of the company, she raised millions of dollars from high-profile investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<br/>But the start-up fell apart in 2018 after it was revealed Holmes and other executives had lied about the company's technology. The blood-testing device was purported to be able to run a multitude of tests from just a few drops of blood.<br/>In addition to serving time in prison, Holmes has been ordered to pay $452m to the victims of her fraud. She will split the amount with her former romantic and business partner, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who started serving a 13-year sentence in prison in April.

So his grandparents gave him $200 (\u00a3159) Apple credit for Christmas.<br/>\"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days,\" says Ms Ward. \"After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game.\" <br/>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit. <br/>\"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit,\" says Ms Ward. \"He would do that out of desperation when he had used up his monthly gaming allowance.\"<br/>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense. <br/>\"It's something that I have to police constantly.\"<br/>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.<br/>The content purchased can be purely aesthetic - dance moves, skins or clothing. <br/>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.<br/>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.<br/>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases that are in-game purchase-free.<br/>Gaming companies use behavioural psychology to manipulate users into spending, says Prof Sarah Mills, and the link between gaming and gambling is becoming \"increasingly blurred\", she explains.<br/>Ms Mills is professor of human geography at Loughborough University. Her research found gambling techniques make gamers play for longer and spend more money, and drive repeat buying.<br/>Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive of Parent Zone, an organisation which helps parents navigate the digital world for their children, is more specific about how games incentivise players to part with their money.<br/>By spending players can \"avoid the grind\" - where making an in-game purchase means you avoid hours of monotonous gaming to progress to another level.<br/>\"Fun pain\" is where you risk losing something important if you don't make a purchase.<br/>Meanwhile, \"obfuscation techniques\", like in-game currencies, make it hard to see how much you're really spending.<br/>Another tactic is the use of \"loot boxes\". Players buy a box without knowing what's inside. It could contain a game-changing item - but more often than not the prize is nothing more than a mediocre customisation. <br/>\"Young people recalled senses of shame when they reflected on the amount they spent trying to gain a rare item, even if they were successful,\" says Prof Mills.<br/>And - despite many children saying they dislike in-game purchasing - spending money on microtransactions has become an expectation.<br/>While spending on games has risen, some argue that playing games can benefit young people and fears are exaggerated.<br/>Gaming as a form of play has been found to relieve stress, help develop cognitive skills and combat loneliness.<br/>As a teenager Zhenghua Yang, from Colorado, spent two years in hospital.<br/>\"I played a lot of video games. The single-player games made me feel like a hero. The multiplayer games connected me to other people. I made life-long friends all over the world.\"<br/>In 2014, Mr Yang founded Serenity Forge, a gaming company on a mission to help others. To date, more than 20 million people have played the firm's games.<br/>\"We are in the business of expanding people's horizons,\" says Mr Yang.<br/>Serenity Forge does not use microtransactions but, says Mr Yang, that could change in the future if they found them to contribute to \"meaningful, emotionally impactful games that challenge the way you think\".<br/>The impact of microtransactions, says Mr Yang, depends on the vulnerability of the user.<br/>\"Like a credit card can be dangerous for someone in an inappropriate context, so too can microtransactions. However, credit cards can also serve an important function and in-game purchases can be important to a gamer engaging with their favourite game.\"<br/>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming makes him happy.<br/>\"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the difference between reality and fantasy.\"<br/>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.<br/>\"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission,\" says the 43-year-old, \"but he always asks me before making a purchase.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While it can be difficult for parents to keep track of registered emails, passwords and payment cards across various platforms and devices - there are ways that you can protect your teen and your bank account.<br/>Child accounts and parental controls can be used to disable purchases or set a spending limit. Parents can set up email notifications to flag purchases, and use gift cards rather than credit cards.<br/>Perhaps most importantly, adds Mr Yang, talk to your child.<br/>\"In my experience, friction stems from a lack of parental presence,\" he says. \"I now have two kids and, instead of using games as a babysitting tool, I make sure I'm present in their lives as they consume media.\"<br/>Back in Barbados, Ms Ward has set up screen time limits and passcodes to keep Leif gaming safely. <br/>\"My password is needed to make any purchases and if he wants money added to his account he has to ask me.

In a bid to encourage homeowners to decarbonise their heating, Germany introduced a rebate scheme in January 2023 that offers up to 40% back on the cost of buying and installing a heat pump. <br/>Heat pumps use energy taken from the air, water or ground to provide both heating and cooling. They have been proven to work even in extreme temperatures and can drastically reduce energy bills once installed.<br/>The scheme is just one of a host of heat pump subsidies in place across Europe and part of a broader push to reduce carbon emissions. From 2024, every new heating system installed in Germany must run on 65% renewable energy.<br/>Bastian Distler, a product manager in Ketsch in south-west Germany, was considering upgrading to a heat pump anyway for environmental reasons, but admits that he wouldn't have been able to without the subsidy. Purchase and installation can cost anywhere from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac30,000 (\u00a38,700 to \u00a326,000; $11,000 to $33,000) compared to around \u20ac7,000 for a new gas boiler.<br/>\"I have two little children which makes you question some behaviours and you feel better if you do something good for the environment. But to be very honest, if it had been very, very expensive and it didn't pay off, I probably would not have done it,\" says Mr Distler.<br/>While the scheme is certainly making it easier for Germans to invest in heating system upgrades, heat pump sales were already on the increase. <br/>\"We had a market growth of 53% last year,\" says Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. \"The year before it was around 30% and the year before that around 40%. So we've had a good growth rate for several years now.\"<br/>The dramatic uptick in demand caught many manufacturers off guard, leaving some homeowners waiting up to 10 months before their new heat pumps could be supplied and installed by trained technicians, who are also in short supply.<br/>Manufacturers like Viessmann are scaling up production to solve the shortfall, as well as pouring huge investment into training installers, providing educational materials for would-be buyers, and helping customers navigate often complex subsidy applications.<br/>G\u00fcnther Schlachter, vice president of residential electric solutions at Viessmann, believes that supporting and training installers is key to decarbonising home heating. <br/>\"Our installer... can consult with their customers [and advise against] the cheapest gas or oil option to make use of the subsidies that are now in place for a future-proof solution,\" says Mr Schlachter.<br/>J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss agrees. \"Typically, installers focus on gas. For a heat pump, they need to also understand electrics and refrigeration. So educating the end user is important, but it's more important to educate the person selling the system because 80% of the decision-making process happens with the installer.\"<br/>Most European countries currently face the same issues with supply, installer training and cost, but geography and culture also heavily influence what we expect and demand from our heating systems.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>So perhaps it is not surprising that Europe's coldest countries, with the best insulation, have the highest heat pump penetration. According to the International Energy Agency, 60% of Norway's buildings are fitted with a heat pump, followed closely by Sweden at 43% and Finland at 41%. <br/>In Germany the figure is a little over 4% and in the UK just 1%.<br/>\"Scandinavia is much more advanced because they have higher insulation standards and moved from direct electric heating to heat pumps early because it's saved them from day one,\" says Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association.<br/>Central Europeans also tend to have high expectations of heating and insulation whereas people in the UK have long accepted the need for draught excluders and chunky indoor jumpers.<br/>Southern countries tend to eschew heating in favour of cooling and use instantaneous gas boilers to heat water, whereas Eastern Europeans often rely on solid fuel stoves. <br/>Regardless of where you live or how old your building is, there's an easy way to find out if your home is suitable for a heat pump. <br/>If you can feel comfortable at home when the flow temperature on your boiler is reduced to 55C, then you can install a heat pump straight away without retrofits or insulation upgrades. <br/>Of course, not everyone can choose how their home is heated. Germany has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe, which means the onus is on landlords and housing management companies to upgrade heating to serve the country's approximately 40 million tenants. <br/>The German Heat Pump Association has seen housing providers begin to understand that decarbonisation will soon begin to affect their bottom line. <br/>\"They have the goal of decarbonising their building stock because they realise that if they don't, in 10 or 20 years, they won't be able to rent these flats anymore,\" says Martin Sabel. <br/>Tenants who would prefer to take matters into their own hands may soon be able to access smaller-scale heat pump solutions for heating and cooling individual rooms.<br/>US start-up Gradient hopes to enter the European market in 2023 and is working on producing small, affordable, self-install heat pumps that fit over window sills and can replace existing air conditioning units. <br/>For Viessmann, the long-term vision is to build a holistic low-carbon, low-cost energy system where heat pumps, high-quality insulation, solar energy, rerouted waste heat, other renewables, and smart technology work in tandem to provide a circular system of heating and cooling, charging cars, and meeting other energy needs for homeowners and their wider community. <br/>Germany may still be a long way from that, but heat pumps are a good step on that road. When asked what message homeowners should take home about heat pumps, Thomas Nowak has a simple answer. <br/>\"They work. That's all. Don't trust anybody who tells you they don't.\""}, {"_id": "6488981151ac3398be9f64c8", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65261147?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Can a wind turbine handle hurricane speed winds?", "lead": "As wind farms expand into new areas they will need to withstand extreme wind speeds.", "author": "By Chris Baraniuk", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:45.134921", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13A68/production/_129388408_gettyimages-856895372.jpg", "body": "The world's biggest storms, which whip the high seas into a frenzy or flatten buildings on land, have long daunted wind farm developers. But that is changing. <br/>Operators are increasingly adopting turbines designed to withstand tropical cyclones. One of the latest examples is a \"typhoon-resistant\" floating wind turbine, which will soon help to power an offshore oil platform in China. <br/>According to the manufacturer, MingYang Smart Energy, this 7.25 megawatt (MW) turbine can survive wind speeds of up to 134mph for 10 minutes. It has been installed at a facility 136km off the coast of the island province of Hainan.<br/>MingYang did not respond to a BBC request for comment but theirs is not the first turbine designed to face down such an onslaught. In 2021, US firm GE received typhoon-certification for its mammoth Haliade-X turbine. It is fixed, not floating, and has a capacity of up to 13MW.<br/>The blistering growth of the wind energy industry is pushing turbines to their limits and some question whether the pace of the rollout is wise.<br/>While components such as turbine blades are remarkably strong, they are not indestructible. And the forces of nature, especially out at sea, are notoriously unpredictable, meaning the pressure is on to prove that wind turbines really are hurricane-ready.<br/>Tropical cyclones - often called typhoons or hurricanes depending on location - are a familiar threat in certain parts of the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico or around much of Southeast Asia.<br/>Such storms can produce wind speeds well in excess of 100mph. The strongest one-minute sustained winds on record, of 215mph, were created by Hurricane Patricia in the Eastern Pacific in 2015. <br/>Despite the meteorological challenges in such regions, the expansion of wind energy is expected there in the coming years and decades.<br/>Today's turbines already put up with some powerful gales. Those positioned off the northeast coast of the UK in the North Sea operate in wind speeds of up to 50mph or so, after which point they are switched off, notes Simon Hogg at Durham University, who holds the \u00d8rsted chair at the university, which is funded by energy firm \u00d8rsted. <br/>Technically, such turbines are designed to survive even higher wind speeds.<br/>Leon Mishnaevsky of the Technical University of Denmark suggests that wind turbine blades are generally quite reliable. These days, they are made from strong but lightweight carbon fibre composites and automated manufacturing processes help to ensure the uniform placement of the fibres, which is important for the blades' robustness, he notes.<br/>Wind turbine makers also perform a range of stress tests on blades to ensure that they are up to scratch.<br/>This can include attaching large \"exciters\" to the blades, which bounce up and down, simulating the repeated stresses of winds on the structure. Giant blades are also sometimes bent to the point of breaking, says Prof Hogg, which helps to confirm the maximum loads they can bear.<br/>But the fallibility of turbines, especially the biggest ones, is becoming more apparent as time goes by. Insurer GCube notes in a recent report that offshore wind losses rose from \u00a31m in 2012 to more than \u00a37m in 2021.<br/>Plus, machines with capacities larger than 8MW can suffer component failures within just two years of installation, the firm says, more than twice as fast as 4-8MW devices.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Some of the most dangerous forces to trouble turbine blades are torsion, or twisting, loads, says Find M\u00f8lholt Jensen, chief executive of Bladena, a firm that specialises in diagnosing and repairing large turbine blades around 60m in length, or longer. <br/>Repeated twisting of blades can induce difficult-to-spot fractures, he says: \"The damage cannot be seen from the outside.\"<br/>The longer the blade, the greater the risk, comments a spokesman for Bladena.<br/>Current testing and industry standards are not sufficient to prove that the largest turbine blades can withstand these stresses, argues Dr Jensen.<br/>New designs could help, though. In Japan, Challenergy has been working on a turbine with tall, vertical blades that spin around a central tower.<br/>While currently much smaller and less powerful than the biggest traditional, three-bladed turbines in operation today, Challenergy's device is intended to cope with very high winds. <br/>When a powerful typhoon called Hin Nam No struck the Philippines and Japan last August, it passed over two of the company's turbines. One of the devices, at Ishigaki City in Okinawa, recorded wind speeds of around 64mph. The turbine continued to operate without any problems, according to Challenergy.<br/>In the US, a research team has taken a cue from nature in their design of an alternative hurricane-resistant turbine. <br/>\"We were inspired by palm trees,\" explains Lucy Pao at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"In high winds they kind of go with the flow, they bend with the wind.\"<br/>She and her colleagues designed a prototype two-bladed wind turbine design with flexible blades. Plus, the rotor faces downwind rather than into the wind, as is common in traditional configurations, helping it to absorb the impact of strong gales.<br/>During tests at an onshore site in Colorado, the blade tips were observed deflecting by up to 600mm, more than half a metre. \"None of them snapped,\" says Prof Pao.<br/>Wind speeds in the area can reach 100mph in the wintertime, she adds.<br/>However, the wind energy industry has almost universally adopted the upwind, three-bladed design so selling a new concept is difficult, Prof Pao explains. Currently, her research in this area is on hold, pending further funding.<br/>She shares the concerns of other observers who question whether wind turbines are really ready for some of the strongest winds nature can hurl at them.<br/>\"The novel materials, they are stronger, they are pretty amazing, but I don't know that they've been tested out as thoroughly as maybe they should be,\" she says.<br/>Then there are the tricky economics of siting turbines in places where winds are especially variable. James Martin is chief executive at Gulf Wind Technology, a company exploring the deployment of turbines in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>In this area, low wind speeds are common for most of the year - with the occasional hurricane blasting its way through. <br/>\"If you design that turbine to be strong enough to withstand the peak wind event, then you'll be carrying a lot of extra cost for the times that you've got light wind,\" notes Mr Martin. He declines to share details of the turbines or technologies his firm is considering.<br/>In the coming years, you can expect to see more and more turbines arriving in regions affected by cyclones, though.<br/>\"We need [turbines] there as much as we need them in any other area of the globe,\" argues Prof Hogg. \"I don't think we should shy away from it.\""}, {"_id": "6488981151ac3398be9f64c9", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65251892?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "Why teaching robots to blink is hard but important", "lead": "Blinking conveys more information than you might think and it's hard to make robots do it properly.", "author": "By Christine Ro", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:45.368706", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16FA2/production/_129341149_theicubrobotinthecontactlabattheitalianinstitutefortechnology.creditchristinero..jpg", "body": "It's my first time drumming along with a robot.<br/>I'm sitting across a table from an adorable humanoid robot called the iCub. We each have our own stick and box, and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.<br/>This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.<br/>It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.<br/>Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.<br/>For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling. <br/>This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.<br/>\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.<br/>Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.<br/>Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.<br/>So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.<br/>\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.<br/>Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.<br/>Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply like blinking robots more. An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.<br/>Humans also perceive robots that blink more naturally as more intelligent. And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.<br/>Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.<br/>\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.  <br/>Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"<br/>Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. <br/>Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"<br/>Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.<br/>\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either. <br/>Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.<br/>With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.<br/>They've patented their system of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. <br/>Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\" <br/>The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in longer close-up interactions with humans.<br/>Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation. <br/>These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.  <br/>When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\"\u202f "}, {"_id": "6488981151ac3398be9f64ca", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65397192?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The people turning time into a currency", "lead": "So-called \"time-banking\" schemes are letting people get paid in time credits for the work they do.", "author": "By Elna Schutz", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:45.596272", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6127/production/_129517842_coralnew4.jpg", "body": "After spending 10 years as a Buddhist nun in Myanmar, Coral Sunone realised that she needed some fashion help when she returned to the outside world.<br/>But with money tight, getting assistance from a professional stylist was simply out of the question. Or was it?<br/>Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".<br/>Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.<br/>Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.<br/>Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.<br/>\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"<br/>The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago.

They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.<br/>The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.<br/>You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins. <br/>\"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites. <br/>The concept of time banking has been around since the 19th Century.

Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.<br/>The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.<br/>Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. <br/>One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.<br/>Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where nets draped over rows of apple trees limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. <br/>There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.<br/>Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. <br/>Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.<br/>For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. <br/>But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.<br/>But some researchers are working on hydrophobic nets, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.<br/>Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.<br/>Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.<br/>Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As her research in the Mediterranean has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.<br/>Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. <br/>Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. <br/>It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.<br/>Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to European policies intended to reduce insecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. <br/>The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges. <br/>Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.<br/>Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.<br/>Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.<br/>\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says. <br/>For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains. <br/>To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.<br/>Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. <br/>But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\""}, {"_id": "6488981251ac3398be9f64cc", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65322101?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Business", "subCategories": "Market Data,New Economy,New Tech Economy,Companies,Technology of Business,Economy,CEO Secrets,Global Trade,Cost of Living", "title": "The wedding tech now at the heart of couples' nuptials", "lead": "A growing number of brides and grooms are embracing technology for their big day.", "author": "By Anne Cassidy", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:46.066864", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C99C/production/_129421615_ondrej-jiri.jpg", "body": "Instead of traditional gold bands, Czech couple Jiri and Ondrej Vedral exchanged smart rings on their wedding day.<br/>Smart rings are wearable electronic devices with functions similar to smartwatches.

US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you.<br/>Called \"Wedding Writer's Block Assistant\", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI.<br/>Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words.<br/>\"We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,\" says Mr Joshi. \"The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful.\"<br/>The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home.<br/>But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. \"People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,\" she says.<br/>For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones.

More and more couples are thinking about the environment.\" <br/>Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception. <br/>One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring \"gif booths\" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone.<br/>\"Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,\" adds Ms Pabla. \"They want to be the Instagram couple.\" <br/>But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions.<br/>For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person.<br/>\"So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,\" says Ms Pabla. \"But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite.\"<br/>Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to \"make everything easier and much more interesting\".

However, there has been no confirmation of who the nominees were and why they were not included on the list.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said HOLAC did not support the peerage nominations of the MPs put forward by Mr Johnson.<br/>The spokesperson added: \"It is unprecedented for a sitting prime minister to invite HOLAC to reconsider the vetting of individual nominees on a former prime minister's resignation list.\"<br/>But Ms Dorries said Mr Sunak's team \"had made sure that certain names would not be on\" the list sent to HOLAC. Ms Dorries added she understands this \"to be true despite denials from those concerned\".<br/>Ms Dorries used her article to argue for her place in the House of Lords, writing: \"I was born into poverty and clawed my way out of it to build a new life for me and my family, and then carved out a role in public service.<br/>\"A seat in the Lords was recognition of that - and a means of continuing to give back to society.\"<br/>The prime minister's press secretary has denied Ms Dorries' version of events, saying: \"No-one in No10 amended or edited any list.\"<br/>\"As is convention, on receiving the former prime minister's resignation honours list the prime minister forwarded the peerage list unaltered to HOLAC,\" the press secretary said.<br/>Ms Dorries said Mr Johnson had told her in autumn last year she had been put on his resignation honours list.<br/>The former culture secretary said she had been vetted for the peerage, but because six months had passed, her checks had expired.<br/>She also said Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson had a meeting last week to discuss his honours list.<br/>Ms Dorries accused the prime minister of using \"weasel words\" at that meeting to give Mr Johnson the impression Mr Sunak would ask HOLAC to restart the vetting process.<br/>According to Ms Dorries, these \"duplicitous machinations\" were to avoid a by-election caused when an MP steps down to take a seat in the House of Lords."}, {"_id": "6488981251ac3398be9f64ce", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65878925?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Boris Johnson: What is the Privileges Committee and who are its members?", "lead": "The committee examined whether the former PM misled MPs about Downing Street parties during Covid.", "author": "By Tamara Kovacevic and Anthony Reuben", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:46.691777", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DB16/production/_130068065_898aa3206cfefc35efb94449b94489829443f3b5.jpg", "body": "A report from MPs about whether Boris Johnson misled Parliament over parties at 10 Downing Street is expected to be published on Wednesday. <br/>Boris Johnson stood down as an MP ahead of the Privileges Committee's report, claiming he was \"forced out of Parliament\".<br/>Committees are bodies in Parliament which examine issues such as laws or policies in more detail. <br/>The House of Commons Privileges Committee investigates cases which \"may prevent or hinder\" the work of Parliament. <br/>Its duties include looking at cases where MPs are accused of breaking rules. <br/>The committee has been considering whether Mr Johnson misled MPs about what he knew about parties held in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. <br/>The committee has \"privileges\" in its name because it deals with certain privileges that MPs enjoy. These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him, saying: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>The committee can order any MP to appear before it, and require them to hand over documents or other evidence. <br/>There isn't a set list of punishments it can recommend, but they must be approved by a vote in the House of Commons.<br/>Parties have traditionally not told their MPs which way to vote on such matters, although there have been exceptions to this.<br/>The committee can advise that an MP be suspended from the Commons. A suspension of more than two weeks could trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election. <br/>In the most extreme cases it can recommend an MP be expelled.<br/>The committee can also require an MP to apologise, or recommend that the House of Commons vote to rebuke them. It can call for an MP's salary to be withheld, or for public money to be repaid.<br/>As Mr Johnson has already resigned as an MP, it is not yet clear what sanctions the Committee will recommend.<br/>There is still expected to be a debate among MPs who will vote on whether to approve the report and there are suggestions opposition MPs may try introduce their own sanctions.<br/>Boris Johnson has been widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him.

It makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\"<br/>Labour MP Stella Creasy also called for urgent reform, telling BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I don't understand in whose interests this case was.\"<br/>Madeline Page, director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students, described the case as a \"sad situation\" and said she would welcome a parliamentary debate.<br/>The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which opposes abortion, criticised providers for \"pushing for dangerous home abortions,\" and said women such as Foster were \"left to self-administer these drugs alone with no medical supervision or support.\"<br/>But providers say the most common side-effects of at-home abortions are \"usually easy to treat\", and \"rarely have any long-term health effects\". <br/>The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is one of 30 campaign and health groups calling for the law to be repealed to decriminalise women seeking to end their own pregnancies.<br/>BPAS chief executive Clare Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are now seeing a mother-of-three prosecuted under laws that do not exist in the same way in any other country.\"<br/>She said \"a growing number of women\" were coming under police investigation over suspected illegal abortions, with another woman facing trial later this year. <br/>A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said cases such as that of Carla Foster were \"exceptionally rare... complex and traumatic\".<br/>They added: \"Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\"<br/>Downing Street said it recognised that abortion was \"a highly emotive issue and there is a strength of feeling on all sides,\" but \"the law is clearly set out.\"<br/>\"It's up to the police and the judiciary to enforce it,\" the spokesperson added. <br/>Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs select committee, called for the government to decriminalise abortion.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Removing the criminal law is a very sensible, reasonable step, but it's not to deregulate abortion care and who can provide it.\"<br/>The CPS argued in court that Foster had been aware of abortion limits and had provided false information during a remote medical consultation. <br/>Her defence said lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare, adding: \"This will haunt her forever.\" <br/>Foster went into labour on 11 May 2020 and the baby was confirmed dead 45 minutes later. <br/>The 44-year-old from Staffordshire had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby, the court heard.<br/>Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall accepted she had been \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.<br/>He said she was a good mother to her three sons, one of whom has special needs, and that a suspended sentence might have been possible if there had been an earlier guilty plea.<br/>But he rejected appeals from women's health organisations to pass a non-custodial sentence, saying it was the court's duty to \"apply the law as provided by Parliament\".<br/>Ahead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.<br/>The judge told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".<br/>But he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\"."}, {"_id": "6488981351ac3398be9f64d0", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65889239?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Entertainment & Arts",

He also suggested Mr Davie was \"managing decline\".<br/>\"Quite the reverse,\" the director general replied, noting that local radio audiences had declined by 20% in recent years.<br/>\"If you're sitting with all your money on broadcast, you will be managing decline,\" he said. \"That is a decision I cannot take for the BBC.\""}, {"_id": "6488981351ac3398be9f64d1", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65890443?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Tory peer Lord Ranger bullied journalist, watchdog finds", "lead": "Both Lord Ranger and Poonam Joshi apologise following a row which began at a Diwali celebration in Parliament.", "author": "By Brian Wheeler", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:47.361001", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11465/production/_130075707_ranger.jpg", "body": "Conservative peer and donor Lord Ranger has been reprimanded by the House of Lords authorities for bullying and harassing a journalist on social media.<br/>The peer got into a war of words with journalist and women's rights campaigner Poonam Joshi after a Diwali event he had organised in the Lords.<br/>Ms Joshi criticised the attendance at the event of a representative of controversial Indian guru Nithyananda.<br/>Lord Ranger has publicly apologised to Ms Joshi for his conduct.<br/>He has also agreed to take part in behaviour change training, as recommended by the Lords Commissioner for Standards, in a report on his conduct.<br/>Ms Joshi, a freelance Indian journalist based in the UK, has issued a written apology to the peer, in which she accepts \"a share of the responsibility for the circumstances which have arisen\".<br/>The row began in October last year at a party in a House of Lords function room to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.<br/>In an article, Ms Joshi criticised the event's organisers the Hindu Forum of Britain, which was co-founded by Lord Ranger, and raised concerns about a full page advert in its brochure promoting self-styled guru Nithyananda. A representative of the guru was also present at the event.<br/>Nithyananda fled India in 2019 while facing multiple criminal charges, including rape and sexual assault. <br/>He has since claimed to have founded a new country, known as the \"Republic of Kailaasa\", on an island off the coast of Ecuador. <br/>Nithyananda has denied the accusations against him.<br/>In December last year, Lord Ranger, a businessman who has donated tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party over the past decade, told The Observer he had no knowledge of Nithyananda or his organisation.<br/>Had he known about the guru, he would not have attended the event, he told the newspaper. <br/>Standards Commissioner Akbar Khan said in his report that Lord Ranger had abused his position as a member of the House of Lords in his social media feud with Ms Joshi.<br/>\"He was acutely aware of this imbalance of power and abused it by persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating Ms Joshi,\" said Mr Khan. <br/>\"Examples of this included his frequent disparaging remarks including 'Who is asking you?

You are showing your poor upbringing by bullying'.\" <br/>But, the commissioner found, Ms Joshi had \"also publicly made potentially damaging allegations about Lord Ranger\".<br/>\"Both Lord Ranger and Ms Joshi sought to undermine one another by issuing inflammatory tweets and sought to involve their family members in their dispute,\" the report said.<br/>\"Ms Joshi claimed that her social media activity was intended to hold Lord Ranger 'to account' but there were occasions where it appeared that her tweets were intended to insult or ridicule him.\"<br/>The commissioner also criticised Ms Joshi for leaking a story about the investigation to The Guardian.<br/>He rejected Ms Joshi's complaint that Lord Ranger had also broken the rules relating to the use of Lords facilities by charging uninvited guests at the Diwali event up to \u00a320 to cover costs.<br/>In conclusion, Mr Khan said there had been \"fault on both sides\" in this case. <br/>He said Lord Ranger would normally have been facing a short suspension from the Lords over his conduct, but in light of the \"significant provocation by Ms Joshi\" a public apology and behaviour training \"constituted an appropriate outcome\".<br/>In a statement, Lord Ranger said: \"The commissioner has found my behaviour fell short of the high standards I expect of myself, and which others expect of me as a sitting member of the House of Lords.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\"."}, {"_id": "6488981351ac3398be9f64d3", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65868314?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Slow-walk protest law heads for further Lords clash", "lead": "The government wants new regulations to give police powers to stop protests, but opposition parties are unhappy.", "author": "By Mark D'Arcy", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:47.816347", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1179E/production/_130028517_edf0ad4220af7ee637ae23869006d6a9eb606079.jpg", "body": "The government is being accused of trying to by-pass Parliament and rewrite the laws on public protests by \"sneaky\" means.<br/>MPs and peers are due to debate new regulations next week, which will give the police clearer powers to stop slow-walking protest marches blocking roads and bringing cities to a halt.<br/>The changes are designed to provide a clearer definition of what \"serious disruption to the life of communities\" means, so the police would be better able to block or impose conditions on demonstrations thought likely to cause it. <br/>The new definition would cover the cumulative impact of repeated protests and disruption and delays, with \"community\" defined as any citizens who might be affected.  <br/>Taken together these would provide a much clearer legal basis for imposing bans or restrictions. <br/>Conservative peer Lord Jackson said the government was reacting to public concern about protests by groups like Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil, and slow-walking tactics, which could \"clog up whole city centres\".<br/>The government majority in the Commons should see the order voted through by MPs on Monday, but it must also be approved in the Lords, on Tuesday, and there is no government majority in that House, so it is at least technically possible that the regulations could be defeated. <br/>There's also a looming row about the way the regulations have been introduced. <br/>Peers defeated exactly the same policy, when the government attempted to add it to the Public Order Bill in the Lords, in February. <br/>So many are now angry that a policy they rejected has been brought back as regulations, particularly because they are not allowed to propose changes, and, by convention, they never reject them.<br/>Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Hunt of Wirral said the government was seeking to bring the changes in, \"in a way, through the back door\", completely ignoring the decision the House of Lords had made in February. <br/>He will be calling for assurances that ministers would not try the same thing again. <br/>Meanwhile, the Green Party's Baroness Jones has put down a \"fatal motion\" to block the regulations.

Our position is very clear.

But using an external agency to resolve workplace issues is not difficult. <br/>\"Neither Parliament nor the whips' offices are equipped to do it. This is highly specialised stuff.\" <br/>She said whips could remove the whip from MPs, but \"that's a political party decision\".<br/>\"The whips shouldn't be enacting sanctions as part of the complaints process. It may be considered prudent by a political party to withdraw the whip pending an investigation.\" <br/>Current MPs have also raised concerns about a lack of \"HR professionals\" to deal with cases like this. <br/>One Conservative MP said: \"Where does the buck stop? The whips, the police, the Speaker, there's also the parties. I don't see that there is any formal coming together of those.\" <br/>Parties often \"live in fear of someone saying: 'why didn't you take action?' That's where the judgement comes,\" they added.   <br/>This MP said that, while they still wanted a say in who their staff were, \"I do think there's a benefit in more HR support for MPs - I'm not an HR expert.\" <br/>They compared MPs employing their own staff with Parliament \"dealing in effect with 650 small businesses\".  <br/>Another former chief whip the BBC spoke to echoed the argument for \"external supervision\", saying the role of the whips was to \"look after their flock, not to sit in judgement of them\", and to persuade them to vote with their party the \"right\" way. <br/>On Monday, MPs will debate proposals to bar some MPs under criminal investigation for violent or sexual offences from setting foot in Parliament. <br/>The proposals have been drawn up by the House of Commons Commission, a body of senior MPs which oversees the working of the Commons, following a consultation.<br/>If approved, the plans could allow MPs or peers to be barred from the Houses of Parliament if they are deemed to pose a risk.<br/>The exclusion would apply to the parliamentary estate in Westminster and any parliamentary-funded travel.<br/>MPs are being asked to have their say on the plans, but a formal vote has yet to be arranged. <br/>The Commission has proposed that if the parliamentary authorities were presented with credible allegations of a sexual or violent offence by the police at any point in the criminal justice process, a staff panel would assess the claims.<br/>If the panel undertook a full risk assessment on the basis of information provided by the police, it would consider the nature of the alleged misconduct and whether there were any safeguarding concerns.<br/>If this led to exclusion being recommended, this would be put to an adjudication panel for a decision.<br/>Under the proposals, excluded members would get a proxy vote so their constituents were not disadvantaged.<br/>The BBC has been told there is some disagreement on the plans - with a number of MPs arguing members should not be excluded unless they are charged by police, and others arguing that the threshold for exclusion should be lower. <br/>One former chief whip said excluding people who had not been charged flew \"against natural justice\".<br/>\"Allegations can be made against members of parliament that may be false, and they may be made in a vexatious way.\" <br/>Ms Milton said she believed Parliament should be able to vote on excluding MPs from the Commons, because it was \"quite a serious issue democratically\". <br/>\"Their [MPs'] job is to hold the government to account. If you're going to withdraw an MP's ability to do this on behalf of their constituents. that's serious enough for the whole House to make a decision.\" "}, {"_id": "6488981451ac3398be9f64d5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-65873820?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "England", "subCategories": "Regions,London", "title": "London mayor: Paul Scully fails to make Conservative Party shortlist", "lead": "The chosen Conservative candidate will go up against current Labour mayor Sadiq Khan at next May's election.", "author": "By Tim Donovan", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:48.739487", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4494/production/_129765571_0489bb3b-a320-43ee-b90d-b9435f88148b.jpg", "body": "London MP and government minister Paul Scully has failed to make the shortlist to become the Conservative candidate to fight the city's next mayoral contest.<br/>He was beaten into the final three by Susan Hall, a member of the London Assembly, former Number 10 aide Daniel Korski and barrister Mozammel Hossain.<br/>Mr Scully says he is \"disappointed\" by the decision but thanked campaigners for their \"incredible\" support.<br/>The winner will go up against current Labour mayor Sadiq Khan next May.<br/>In response, Mr Khan accused the Conservative party of \"running scared\" of their national political record by failing to select a government minister to run against him.<br/>The Conservatives say Mr Khan has hiked up council tax for Londoners to record levels, is \"failing to keep Londoners safe\", and has \"broken his promises on strikes\".<br/>Their candidate shortlist was drawn up following interviews by a selection panel at Conservative party headquarters.<br/>The successful Tory candidate is due to be announced on 19 July after a series of hustings and a ballot of party members.<br/>Mr Scully was elected MP for Sutton and Cheam in 2015 and has been minister for London since 2020 but stood back from that role during the selection process.<br/>As the only MP on the longlist, many had assumed he would be hard to beat.<br/>As minister for technology and the digital economy, he had a key part in shaping the Online Safety Bill -

And maybe Lord Speakers past and present will weigh in. <br/>Many peers have identified patronage in appointments to the Lords as the main reputational threat to their chamber. <br/>All this will be superimposed on an otherwise low-key parliamentary agenda - it's been getting embarrassing; last week saw the Lords sit until 04:16 on Thursday morning debating the Illegal Migration Bill, while the Commons ran out of steam on Tuesday at 14:20. <br/>Peers are debating late into the night; MPs are home in time for Hollyoaks. There may be efforts to avoid the unbearable lightness of last week's Commons business in the week ahead, but the causes remain the same - a surfeit of detailed legislation inching through the Upper House, while MPs twiddle their thumbs on the green benches of the Commons.<br/>On the committee corridor, watch out for the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman's appearance before Home Affairs on Wednesday - but as has been the recent trend, the real action is in the Lords, where peers have continued to defeat the government on a variety of issues and continue to battle the Commons over the Retained EU Law Bill.<br/>But while they regularly push back on the content of bills, Labour inhibitions about voting down secondary legislation make it highly unlikely that Green Party peer Jenny Jones's attempt to strike down an order which would give the police greater power to control or ban protest marches will have the numbers to succeed.<br/>Commons (14:30): Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following.<br/>Main debate: Motion to approve a statutory instrument, the Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023.

This is a tough issue where the constitutional rights of MPs to attend Parliament are balanced against the safeguarding concerns of the thousands of people who work on the parliamentary estate, and many MPs are worried that the new system would make excluding them from parliament the option of first resort, as soon as there was a live accusation.<br/>The expectation had been that there would be a vote to approve proposals from the House of Commons Commission, the Commons administrative arm, but, tellingly, there will not now be a vote.

Watch out for pressure to rewrite the proposals.<br/>MPs also respond to the latest Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law Bill. This bill is now bouncing between the two Houses, and peers have pinged back new clauses requiring that EU regulations rewritten by ministers must be put before Parliament, with the possibility of debate and amendment in both Houses, and that such regulations must not reduce environmental protections and must not conflict with the UK's international agreements.

In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania.

Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\"<br/>It was a direct aim at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - hours after he stepped off a plane from Washington where Mr Sunak was not talking about a free trade agreement with the US. <br/>And Mr Johnson's statement was an attempt to rally Brexiteers in his party, suggesting his demise was driven by a motivation to \"reverse the 2016 referendum result\".<br/>The statement contained further criticism of former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who investigated lockdown gatherings at Number 10. <br/>\"I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence\" that she will soon become \"chief of staff designate\" of the Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer, Mr Johnson wrote.<br/>Ending his 1,000-word letter, Mr Johnson said he was \"very sad to be leaving Parliament\" before adding - \"at least for now\" - for anyone thinking he is about to retreat into obscurity. <br/>Mr Johnson's exit will trigger a by-election in his west London seat, which he held with a 7,000 vote majority in the 2019 election. <br/>The Conservatives will also have to defend the Mid Bedfordshire seat of Nadine Dorries - a close ally of Mr Johnson - after she stepped down as an MP earlier on Friday.<br/>Mr Johnson's dramatic move came after he was given the committee's findings, including details of criticisms it intended to make and evidence to support its conclusion. <br/>He had faced a potential by-election if MPs recommended a suspension from the Commons as a punishment for misleading Parliament. <br/>Responding to his statement, a Privileges Committee spokesperson said: \"The committee has followed the procedures and the mandate of the House at all times and will continue to do so.<br/>\"Mr Johnson has departed from the processes of the House and has impugned the integrity of the House by his statement.

On the plane ride over to Washington Mr Sunak said: \"For a while now, that has not been a priority for either the US or UK.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy criticised Mr Sunak, saying the government has left \"Britain's cupboards bare\" by not securing a trade deal. <br/>\"This statement shows the government has failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised in the 2019 manifesto, or to secure the ally status under the Inflation Reduction Act that is so important for the automotive sector and for the green transition,\" Mr Lammy said. <br/>Mr Biden said the special relationship with the UK was in \"real good shape\", referring to their co-operation on Ukraine.<br/>\"Together we are providing economic and humanitarian aid and security systems to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion from Russia,\" he said.<br/>The Atlantic Declaration includes plans to mitigate some of the impact of the US flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  on the UK economy, with proposals to remove barriers which affected trade in electric vehicle batteries.<br/>Under current policy, the IRA provides tax credit worth $3,750 (\u00a33,000) for each electric vehicle (EV) manufactured in the US, or which use components mined, processed or manufactured in the country. <br/>The UK is already a net exporter of raw materials for EV batteries to the US. But nations without a US trade deal are barred from accessing IRA subsidies.  <br/>The Atlantic Declaration commits the UK and US to working on a new critical minerals agreement - which would give buyers of vehicles made using critical minerals processed, recycled or mined by UK companies access to tax credits.<br/>The declaration says the agreement would be launched after consultation with US Congress.<br/>Japan already has a similar deal, which allows Japanese firms to also swerve export duties on minerals used in producing EV batteries.<br/>The declaration also includes a commitment to a \"new UK-US Data Bridge\" which would allow UK firms to transfer data freely to certified US organisations without paying a levy.<br/>Downing Street estimate the change will affect around 55,000 UK businesses - translating into \u00a392.4m in direct savings per year.<br/>Mr Biden also supported Mr Sunak's plans to set up an international summit on AI safety which will be hosted in the UK later this year.<br/>The prime minister said: \"The UK and US have always pushed the boundaries of what two countries can achieve together.<br/>\"So it is natural that, when faced with the greatest transformation in our economies since the industrial revolution, we would look to each other to build a stronger economic future together.  <br/>\"The Atlantic Declaration sets a new standard for economic cooperation, propelling our economies into the future so we can protect our people, create jobs and grow our economies together.\" <br/>Both Mr Biden and Mr Sunak agreed to carry out work to improve the resilience of supply chains and efforts will be stepped up to shut Vladimir Putin's Russia out of the global civil nuclear market.

We continue to recommend to the UK government that it reforms the system, to help protect parties from those who seek to evade the law, and give voters more confidence.\""}, {"_id": "6488981951ac3398be9f64e5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65846155?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "I\u2019ve never lobbied Labour over Just Stop Oil, says donor", "lead": "The Labour donor says there's no link between his funding of Labour and support for the activist group.", "author": "By Hannah Capella", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:53.009862", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/114F7/production/_130030907_mediaitem130030906.jpg", "body": "Labour donor Dale Vince says he has not spoken to Sir Keir Starmer about the activist group Just Stop Oil.<br/>On Wednesday, Rishi Sunak accused \"eco zealots\" at Just Stop Oil of \"writing Keir Starmer's energy policy\".<br/>Mr Vince, who has given \u00a31.4m to the party, said he had never lobbied Labour, adding: \"There's no link between my funding of Labour and my support for Just Stop Oil.\"<br/>The group has been criticised for their tactics, including blocking roads.<br/>Mr Vince, who owns green energy company Ecotricity, joined demonstrators on a slow-walk protest along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square in central London on Thursday.<br/>The Labour leader has called the methods used by the protesters, which see traffic halted, \"stupid\" and said they put people's lives at risk.<br/>Mr Vince said: \"I understand his position and Labour's position, I respect it.

The recent clampdown on protest, the new section 12 which the police used today to finally end the march\u2026 all of these are undemocratic.<br/>\"To go even further and say a walking protest is illegal - I think that's incredible. I think you have to ask yourself, where do we live right now, are we living in Russia or are we living in Britain?\"<br/>The Labour party has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments and has promised to invest in renewables if it wins power. <br/>After unions raised concerns over potential job losses, Sir Keir said that existing North Sea projects would be able to continue until 2050, meaning \"oil and gas will be part our energy mix for years to come\". <br/>Mr Sunak accused the Labour party of \"putting ideology ahead of jobs, ahead of investment, and ahead of our energy security\". <br/>Mr Vince said he wouldn't stop funding Labour if Keir Starmer were to backtrack on his commitment over North Sea Oil. <br/>Asked if he had become more of a problem than an asset to Labour, Mr Vince said: \"I hope what I'm doing here [is] speaking out for Just Stop Oil and the millions of people that share their frustration...I hope that's not harming Labour, it's so vital Labour win the next election.\"<br/>A spokeswoman for the Labour leader's office said: \"Keir has been outspoken in his condemnation of Just Stop Oil who he believes have put lives and livelihoods at risk.<br/>\"The idea that they have influenced our policy is for the birds.\""}, {"_id": "6488981951ac3398be9f64e6", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65843261?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Lords debate Illegal Migration Bill until 4am", "lead": "The measures face strong opposition from peers, as they debated potential changes to the bill until the early hours.", "author": "By Emaan Warraich", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:53.233607", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/51A7/production/_130030902_16c6a8513a31d642ac0cc70789a6c7f31f29b4e3115_315_3334_18761000x563.jpg", "body": "A debate on the Illegal Migration Bill in the House of Lords continued until 4.16am on Thursday morning.<br/>There was criticism from some peers about the late hours, with one Labour peer describing it as \"disgraceful\".<br/>It is rare for MPs or peers to continue to debate so late.<br/>The bill, aimed at stopping people crossing the Channel in small boats, has already passed the Commons but has run into strong opposition from peers as they continue detailed debate.<br/>The legislation gives ministers the power to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally, and migrants would be barred from claiming asylum.<br/>Instead they would be detained and removed, either to Rwanda or another \"safe country\".<br/>The Lords was holding its third day debate on committee stage of the bill, which is when changes to the bill, or amendments, are discussed.<br/>Although targets are set for amendments at this stage, these are flexible and it is not unusual for extra days to be added. <br/>Despite late hour, an unusually large number of ministers remained in the chamber, along with the Lords chief whip and some Tory peers, as an apparent safety net in case a vote was called.<br/>Critics argued it was \"disappointing\" such important matters, including the care of unaccompanied migrant children and detention of pregnant women, were being dealt with in such a way.<br/>Labour former minister Lord Bach said: \"Can I for my own part say how disgraceful I think it is we are debating these really important and serious matters at this hour in the morning.\"<br/>Liberal Democrat Lord Scriven said: \"It is not funny and amusing to be told that we have to stay here until goodness knows what time to do our job because the government benches wish to rush this through at any cost as a red-wall, red-meat bill, rather than allowing us the serious job that we have to do as members of this House.

an issue that has been kicked into the political long grass for years.<br/>The report says the immediate priority - should Labour take power - would be to tackle recruitment and retention, and along with a new minimum wage of \u00a311.45 an hour, employment rights for care workers should also be improved.<br/>There is little doubt that this is in line with the Labour's leadership thinking.<br/>In a wide-ranging speech to the GMB union this week, Sir Keir Starmer promised \"a fair pay agreement for every care worker in the country and the deal...will set a new floor, a higher floor for wages\".<br/>By 2028, the report envisages the new National Care Service would be set up.<br/>This would be separate from the NHS, with care homes still predominantly privately owned. But, there would be greater public oversight and higher standards. <br/>The report recognises that providers would need to be better funded - arguing that more than \u00a37bn has been spent by councils on care homes which are inadequate.<br/>While the case for more funding is set out, the report is rather shy when it comes to specific numbers.<br/>It says Labour should make a promise to increase real terms funding by a \"significant percentage each year\".<br/>\"Significant increases for adult social care are essential and inevitable,\" the report said.<br/>Insiders say that, with Labour under fire from opponents for specific spending commitments on green policies, there is a reluctance to set out specific sums in other areas well before an election.<br/>But critics are more concerned that the report has largely ducked the question of the lifetime cost of care for individuals.<br/>In a 2011 report, for the then Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot recommended a cap on social care costs of between \u00a325,000-\u00a335,000.<br/>This was never implemented.

I'm sure you'll be able to get in there and see some of it.\"<br/>Wednesday's visit is the second time this year that a DUP MP has celebrated a famous singer at Parliament.<br/>In March, Strangford representative Jim Shannon submitted an early day motion to mark the 50th anniversary of Dolly Parton's song 'I will always love you'. <br/>He said he noted the sentiment behind the song \"and what it means to so many\", including Mr Shannon's wife.<br/>Simmons said what politicians do \"is far more important\" than music.<br/>\"We're a diversion,\" he said. \"Our job is to make you forget about your troubles, just for those few hours that you're with us.\"<br/>Asked if he could be tempted to enter politics, Simmons said he could joke \"they don't pay enough\".<br/>\"I can literally make more in one evening doing a concert than I can being a politician for the entire year, as shocking as that may sound,\" he continued.<br/>However, he added democracy is \"our only hope\". <br/>\"If I was called to serve, sure, I would do it, but I would not accept a salary, I would do it for one dollar, tax-free of course.\"<br/>You can listen to Good Morning Ulster's interview with Gene Simmons in full here."}, {"_id": "6488981a51ac3398be9f64ec", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65831922?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Cabinet Office defends Johnson\u2019s \u00a3245,000 Partygate legal bill", "lead": "Labour MP Karl Turner asks why public money is being used to pay for the former PM's legal team.", "author": "By Joshua Nevett & Paul Seddon  ", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:54.908885", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3E77/production/_130019951_2d3fc2cd-eb34-4fee-aee0-e941e3fa6a6a.jpg", "body": "The Cabinet Office has defended its decision to use public money to foot the \u00a3245,000 bill for Boris Johnson's lawyers during MPs' Partygate inquiry.<br/>MPs are investigating whether the former prime minister misled them over lockdown parties in Downing Street.<br/>Labour MP Karl Turner asked the Cabinet Office why public money was being used to pay for Mr Johnson's legal team.<br/>In reply, a senior civil servant said there was a precedent that former ministers may receive legal support.<br/>The response came from the director general of the Cabinet Office, Darren Tierney, in a letter seen by the BBC.<br/>In the letter, Mr Tierney said, because the Partygate inquiry by the Privileges Committee related to Mr Johnson's conduct as a minister, he was entitled to taxpayer-funded legal support.<br/>Mr Tierney cited legal support given to former ministers during public inquiries into the Grenfell Tower fire, the BSE disease outbreak in cattle, and infected blood products as examples of precedents.<br/>\"The principle is not limited to public inquiries and has been applied in other contexts, for example, litigation,\" he wrote.<br/>Mr Tierney provided no specific examples of former ministers having their legal bills covered for political parliamentary inquiries carried out by MPs.<br/>Mr Turner - the MP for Kingston upon Hull East - has written back to Mr Tierney asking for specific examples. <br/>The Labour MP told the BBC he had looked into this and believed \"there is no example the government can rely on\".<br/>He said Cabinet Office officials \"either have to give me an example when a former minister or a serving minister has been provided with legal support for a parliamentary inquiry, or they have to accept that they've set a new precedent with Boris Johnson\".<br/>Mr Turner said the government had seemingly established a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers \"get the protection of the taxpayer to cover their legal fees\", and backbench MPs do not.<br/>The last former minister to be investigated by a parliamentary committee for misleading Parliament was former Labour MP and transport secretary Stephen Byers in 2005.<br/>The BBC has been told Mr Byers was not offered taxpayer-funded legal representation.<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs during the inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson has faced calls to pay the legal costs himself, with opposition parties highlighting he has earned millions since standing down as prime minister.<br/>The former prime minister was joined by his lawyers when he appeared in front of the Privileges Committee in March.<br/>He denied knowingly or deliberately misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Mr Johnson has submitted answers to the committee about a number of events at Chequers and Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Privileges Committee sources say they are hoping to wrap up the inquiry before Parliament's summer recess in July.<br/>If the committee finds Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament, he faces suspension as an MP, which could trigger a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>Separate to the Privileges Committee inquiry, Mr Johnson is being provided with taxpayer-funded legal support for the public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.<br/>Last month, Mr Johnson severed ties with the government-appointed lawyers who were set to represent him in the Covid inquiry.<br/>In a letter, reported by the Sunday Times, the Cabinet Office warned Mr Johnson that public funding for his legal representation could be withdrawn if he tried to \"undermine\" the government.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the letter \"simply reiterates that taxpayer-funded lawyers must be used to aid the Covid Inquiry and for no other purpose\".<br/>\"This letter was intended to protect public funds.

He began a data protection action in 2021, then started a defamation claim.<br/>Ms Leslie, MP for Bristol North West from 2010-17, is the former managing director of the Conservative Middle East Council, which promotes links between MPs and the Middle East.<br/>Mr Justice Nicklin said there were \"several aspects of the conduct of the claimant\", Mr Amersi, which gave \"real cause for concern\" as to the purpose of his actions. <br/>He questioned whether Mr Amersi genuinely sought \"vindication\", which is the aim of such litigation. He also said Mr Amersi had adopted \"an exorbitant approach\" to the litigation, bringing an unnecessarily complex case.<br/>Ms Leslie said the judgment \"spoke for itself\" and she was \"delighted to have this vindication after two-and-a-half years of legal action against me\".<br/>Mr Amersi said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" and was considering an appeal. He added that he had been \"denied justice\". <br/>In a statement he said the judge's interpretation of the law \"provides effective immunity to those who publish serious falsehoods to small but influential groups of people\".<br/>David Davis MP told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the result was a \"victory for free speech\".

That committee is made up mainly of Tory MPs. The former PM has faced the same procedure as other MPs that get into trouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he has been \"forced out\", remember he has chosen to quit before we even see the black and white of their verdict. <br/>It is also a fact there are some Conservatives who begrudge him his success. It is also true that during his last few months in No 10 there were internal enemies trying to force him out. <br/>But to dress that up as a grand conspiracy is, candidly, a stretch. One of those who knows him best told me his resignation announcement was \"1,000 words that tell you everything about Johnson's mindset - it's your fault not mine\".<br/>Rather than confront what has happened or try to defend himself from the judgement that is coming, Boris Johnson made a political choice this week not to stay and fight. <br/>As ever, the line between farce and tragedy is skinny. While most of the headlines screamed of the shock, the former prime minister's exit from Parliament is entirely on brand. <br/>The timing on a Friday was unexpected, but no surprise. He never much liked Parliament anyway, even though he managed to find a gong for the Commons' hairdresser. <br/>The idea he would savour being a humble backbencher asking questions about cash for the local hospital or appearing at school fetes was for the birds. And if the Privileges Committee's findings are as savage as expected he would have faced a by-election. <br/>Clues from his track record tell us there is little chance he would have fought if he hadn't been sure he could win. He pulled out of the Tory leadership race in 2016 when Michael Gove's move blew up his status as front-runner. <br/>He didn't run in 2022 despite a dash back from the Caribbean and fevered claims that he had enough support. One former cabinet ally says he is \"more calculating than people think and this will have been a calculation -  if he thought he would win the by-election he would stay\". To win and lose does not match brand Boris. To leave like this absolutely does.<br/>The power of his personality - frankly his fame - means he leaves behind some devastated colleagues and a strand of the public who believe he has been hard done by. <br/>One former cabinet minister says: \"The party wounded itself when it defenestrated Boris and continues to bleed.\"<br/>Some of his hard-core supporters left on the backbenches say his exit is a sad day for democracy and - with some justification believe his leadership is what secured their seats, particularly in parts of the country where the Tories could never have dreamt of doing well before. <br/>Some of his loyal backers do feel like he is the great hero in a tragedy, cast aside unfairly in an epic drama, undone by those who envy his talents. <br/>His exit is arguably a tragedy for those who genuinely believed in and adored him. And there is a political tragedy for the Conservative Party, which many MPs privately believe squandered a once in a generation majority. <br/>2019 gave it one of those rare chances to make radical changes to the country, and while many believe it was thrown away by mismanagement and mistakes, there was of course the unexpected horror of the Covid pandemic too. <br/>For those who deplore Boris Johnson, there is a different kind of tragedy, the damage they believe he did to the UK's reputation. And several of those who have been close to him over the years identify a fourth element of the mess - the fact they believe it was never going to end well. <br/>In the Greek tragedies so beloved of Mr Johnson himself, fate, and inevitability plays an important role. One of them says: \"Boris is a genuine tragedy. This was all inevitable. We knew how it would play out, but we are still surprised and shocked about how dreadful it is. All our hard work pissed away.\" <br/>So what happens next? Some MPs are actually cock-a-hoop despite the colossal mess. One tells me: \"The man-baby has gone - so pleased!\"<br/>But allies talk up his chances of running for another seat some time. One former senior minister tells me \"the question is does he plan to get another seat or even Mid-Beds?\" - the constituency his close ally and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has just left. <br/>Another former cabinet minister says: \"It would be very unwise for him to run again. He has a vociferous 20% in the party who like him but 80% don't. If he ran in a by-election the Lib Dems would murder him.\"<br/>Would party HQ even let that happen? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has changed the personnel in charge there. One senior figure pours a bucket of freezing water over the idea telling me: \"Boris died today.\"<br/>What is not clear yet is whether as that MP suggests the manner of his departure could \"generate so much unrest I fear there will be an election much sooner than thought\".<br/>Mr Johnson has thrown grenades at No 10 - not just the committee that has judged him - suggesting Mr Sunak is not running a \"proper Conservative\" government. <br/>One former ally says the ex-PM has \"gone full circle, returning to his political home - a hut across the water where he can now lob rocks without any sense of responsibility or accountability - and that is ultimately very dangerous for his party and Sunak\". <br/>But if Boris Johnson is unlikely to run for Parliament again, and is happy to dangle the prospect of a return, what else might he do with his time?<br/>You'll find plenty of people in Westminster chattering that he'll return to his first love - writing - but might there be something bigger? <br/>By chance his old newspaper the Telegraph has just come up for sale and - by chance - its former editor Will Lewis has just been made a knight by Mr Johnson. Is there, by chance, the possibility they might be part of a bid to take it over? <br/>It's been suggested to me that is in fact something that has been discussed. It's no secret that Mr Lewis - now Sir Will - would be keen to take it on. <br/>He advised Mr Johnson in No 10 sometimes and the two men worked together at the Telegraph when the former PM was its star columnist who attracted extra subscribers each week. <br/>Going back as a columnist would be one thing for Mr Johnson and not all that surprising. But for him to take a bigger role - as one source whispers, the editor - might be the Conservatives' worst nightmare. <br/>I'm told that conversations are only at the stage of ideas being scribbled down on paper. A formal sale process, let alone any decisions about actual bids, is a long way off.  <br/>But I can't help wondering, what would the consequences be for Downing Street and the Conservatives if their most loyal backer in the press gave a major role to Mr Sunak's bitter rival? Could the next twist in the Boris Johnson story be even wilder than the last? Perhaps. <br/>Some of those who have worked alongside him believe it is more likely to be \"terminal Boris\". A former ally says \"he was obviously once someone with exceptional skills, who came so far, and did so much in the face of incredible opposition\".<br/>But they say, perhaps in sorrow and in anger: \"His career ends with him alone, a victim of his utter inability to tell the truth to anyone, including himself.\"<br/>Maybe he will fade into obscurity. Perhaps he'll be back in Parliament one day. He might make millions speaking and writing or become Rishi Sunak's most powerful opposition. <br/>But his name is now on the list of those unprovable political \"what ifs' so furiously and perpetually debated by political nerds. <br/>What if Mrs Thatcher hadn't been forced out? What if Tony Blair hadn't invaded Iraq? What if Boris Johnson had given a different answer in the Commons when he was first asked what happened under his roof during the Covid lockdowns? <br/>We will never know. But what we do know this weekend is that one era is over. We know Boris Johnson had huge potential to create, but also to destroy - his extraordinary majority, his reputation, and the party he led too. <br/>He must now decide what to do with the power that he still retains. And his old party must decide how much attention it wants to pay.

Like all prime ministerial trips abroad, it wasn't exactly typical.<br/>Here are four things that make travelling with the prime minister a unique experience.<br/>For years the debate raged. Was it legitimate for the prime minister to have a plane they could call their own?<br/>The issue made headlines during Tony Blair's premiership - when, inevitably, the prospect of such a thing was called Blair Force One. In 2006, a plan was announced. But in 2008, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, it was scrapped.<br/>Is a private jet ostentatious? Does it help with the practicalities of being a frequently flying leader? Does it project an image of the UK abroad that you wouldn't get turning up on a chartered plane? <br/>For now at least, the debate is over: the prime minister does have access to his own plane. And I type these words sitting on it, somewhere over the Atlantic.<br/>It is an Airbus A321, with a union flag on the tail fin, and \"United Kingdom\" written down the side. <br/>When you fly on this thing, it is rather different from rolling up at the airport to go on holiday. We leave from a private terminal, we often don't get a boarding pass and usually we take all of our baggage on with us - for a reason I'll get to shortly.<br/>But meanwhile\u2026<br/>You might imagine, in a private jet, the entertainment system would be something else. <br/>There is WiFi, so the prime minister and his team can stay connected and work efficiently, which is something they value. And it helps us reporters too.<br/>On the plane, there are none of those little screens you get in the back of the seat in front of you on some flights, packed with films and playlists and maps showing precisely where you are over the ocean. Instead, we often have what is called a \"huddle\".<br/>A huddle involves the prime minister coming to the back of the plane, where reporters crowd around him, and each ask him a question.<br/>This is how it works: all the reporters get together beforehand, in the airport, to work out what we are going to ask, in what order, to ensure we cover a range of topics. <br/>The conversation is \"on the record\" - to use the jargon - meaning we can quote the words and attribute them to the prime minister. But the huddle is not recorded for television or radio. <br/>A round of on-camera interviews with the prime minister tends to happen later in the trip. Each broadcaster is assigned a strictly agreed amount of time - often seven minutes - to attempt to find things out, hold the government to account and test its arguments. <br/>Interviewing any prime minister is a huge privilege and responsibility: working on your behalf, trying to ask the questions you want asking. I will always ask the brilliant producer I am working with to stand just out of shot counting down the minutes I have left on their fingers. <br/>Journalistically, there is a tension on these trips: we are close to the prime minister and his team throughout. This is useful, in understanding what they are doing and what motivates their decisions. But instinctively reporters want to be detached, independent and disinterested, and being in what can feel like a bubble feels odd in that context.<br/>Oh, and if we are going somewhere on a long-haul flight - for example Indonesia, Japan or the west coast of America, as we've have recently - we end up having to stop to refuel. <br/>And so those trips involved landing in Dubai, Muscat, Almaty and Washington, hanging around for an hour or so, and then taking off again. <br/>There aren't huge queues to check in. Or any queues at all. <br/>There are comfy settees to sit on, there is loads of natural light and a free coffee machine. To say it feels different from when you head off on a family holiday with the kids is to put it gently. Mind you, I don't take laptops, a tripod, and no end of other broadcasting kit with me on holiday either. <br/>Recently, we flew back into Luton Airport in the middle of the night and pulled up at a private terminal. Past the entrance to what was described as the \"VVIP lounge\" (I couldn't see in, I'm afraid) was a glass cabinet proffering stuff from Harrods, including a collection of pink teddies complete with \"recycled polyester filling\". <br/>A large rectangular steel clock hung on the wall. \"We commissioned this clock from Beaumont flying art,\" read the inscription. Also on the wall, a colossal screen, pitching the merits of executive private jets, the kind that only carry a handful of passengers. \"15 hours of peaceful luxury!\" is how they describe the flight on offer.<br/>When the prime minister's plane lands abroad, a diplomatic ritual begins. As the plane pulls up, a smiling delegation greets us. <br/>One of the first people off the plane is the camera journalist assigned to film the prime minister's arrival on behalf of all the broadcasters. There might be a red carpet. There are almost always flags.<br/>The UK ambassador to wherever we are will be there at the bottom of the plane steps. Maybe even some sort of performance will be offered by the hosts - at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport last autumn, it was a troupe of traditional dancers.<br/>And while the prime minister is getting off via the front set of steps, the rest of us are piling off at the back and getting into a seemingly never-ending line of minibuses waiting on the tarmac.<br/>There's no time to wait for a bag in the hold. That's why we take them onto the plane with us.<br/>In next to no time, the motorcade is moving - and moving fast.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything."}, {"_id": "6488981d51ac3398be9f64f1", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60203864?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Reality Check", "subCategories": "", "title": "Did Boris Johnson mislead Parliament over parties?", "lead": "MPs are investigating whether Mr Johnson was in contempt of Parliament.", "author": "By Reality Check team", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:57.252272", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2B58/production/_123269011_johnson_parliament_8dec.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has denied deliberately misleading Parliament when he made statements about gatherings which took place in Downing Street during lockdown. <br/>Mr Johnson is being investigated by the Privileges Committee of MPs which could recommend a range of sanctions, including suspension from the Commons, which could lead to a by-election in his Johnson's parliamentary constituency. <br/>On Wednesday 22 March, he gave evidence to them and admitted misleading Parliament but denied doing this on purpose. <br/>He was asked repeatedly about key statements he made when he was prime minister.<br/>Boris Johnson said this in response to a question from a Labour MP about whether he would tell MPs if there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November 2020. <br/>We know from civil servant Sue Gray's report into lockdown gatherings that there were two on this date:<br/>We know the rules were not followed \"at all times\" - the Metropolitan Police handed out 126 fines to 83 people for breaking Covid rules during the Downing Street gatherings. <br/>On the specific date he was being asked about, the Met issued fines - for breaches of the rules on indoor gatherings of two or more people. <br/>Mr Johnson also told MPs the guidance was followed \"at all times\".<br/>The guidance for working in offices at the time said \"only absolutely necessary participants should physically attend meetings\" and should maintain social distancing. <br/>The photos in the Sue Gray report show Mr Johnson drinking in front of staff members - who are standing close to each other. <br/>The Privileges Committee's initial report said: \"We will consider why Mr Johnson told the House that no rules or guidance had been broken in No. 10 when he knew what the rules and guidance were and was in attendance at gatherings where the rules and guidance were breached.\"<br/>Appearing before the committee, Mr Johnson said: \"The guidance specifically allows for workplace freedoms to decide how to implement it.\"<br/>He argued that thanking staff in person at leaving events was essential for the operation of government.<br/>But there was nothing in the guidance for England from the time that implied that workplace gatherings such as leaving drinks were permitted. <br/>Boris Johnson made these opening remarks to Parliament after a video emerged of members of his staff joking about how to respond to questions about a Christmas party at Downing Street on 18 December 2020 - which involved wine, cheese and a Secret Santa.<br/>Mr Johnson says he did not attend that event.<br/>Mr Johnson's claim revolves around what assurances he was given. <br/>He told the Privileges Committee that he received those assurances from two of his senior communications advisers: Jack Doyle and James Slack and an unnamed No 10 official. <br/>The MPs asked why he had not sought advice from a government lawyer or from the head of the civil service, Simon Case.<br/>The committee has published evidence showing that Mr Case denied giving Mr Johnson assurances \"at any time\" that Covid rules and guidance \"were followed at all times in No 10\".<br/>And he said he was unaware of anyone else having given him these assurances. <br/>Boris Johnson said this in Parliament in response to the publication of the Sue Gray report. This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold."}, {"_id": "6488981d51ac3398be9f64f3", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65852054?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Chris Mason: What Sunak\u2019s Atlantic Declaration is \u2013 and isn\u2019t", "lead": "There's an economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally.", "author": "By Chris Mason", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:57.718035", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31A0/production/_130040721_8522bcc601bc8160927c836f48d16ea347783658.jpg", "body": "The Conservative manifesto in 2019 read like this: \"Our goals for British trade are\u2026 ambitious.

And it has. <br/>It is worth exploring how it has changed, how that is remoulding international relations and the consequences for the UK.<br/>Covid, the threat posed by China, and the war in Ukraine have been catalysts for a collective fretting from many of the relatively rich democracies over economic security.<br/>Translated: how to get hold of components or energy without relying on now hostile states. <br/>This Declaration, at least partially, attempts to address this. <br/>There is concern about military security too, which prompted the  AUKUS pact between the UK, the US and Australia.<br/>But the economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors is America's Inflation Reduction Act - a massive stimulus to address economic security and base green industries of the future in previously left behind American areas. <br/>It is so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally. <br/>The Biden Administration's motivation is this: the economy needs to adapt given climate change, China and Russia - so let's make America less dependent on others and ensure those jobs of the future are in America.<br/>Labour say they'd do something similar.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box."}, {"_id": "6488981e51ac3398be9f64f5", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65766235?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Why row about Boris Johnson's Covid WhatsApp messages matters", "lead": "A stand-off over Boris Johnson's submissions to the Covid inquiry spells trouble for the government.", "author": "By Nick Eardley", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:58.424115", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/85F5/production/_129939243_johnson_reuters.jpg", "body": "In less than two weeks' time, one of the most important inquiries in recent British history will start holding public hearings.<br/>Senior government ministers - who made life-or-death decisions - will be among those giving evidence. <br/>The inquiry is supposed to help the government and the public work out what ministers got right and wrong - before, during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>But, already, there is an almighty row over what the inquiry should have access to.<br/>This isn't just about process.

It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. It's his job is to look at constitutional issues like this. <br/>He told me: \"If the inquiry requests documents and info - then whoever it has asked should comply.\"<br/>He said this included the government.                             <br/>Caroline Nokes - another select committee chair - said Baroness Hallett was unlikely to roll over and there would be \"less pain for the government if they hand [the messages] over quickly\".<br/>Former Conservative health secretary Matt Hancock is among those who have made clear they are happy to share unredacted messages in full.<br/>Boris Johnson's allies have also made clear he is happy to send more information - and he says he has given his WhatsApp messages and notebooks in full to the Cabinet Office.<br/>He has also said he will bypass the Cabinet Office by providing WhatsApps dating from April 2021 onwards directly to the inquiry. <br/>So where does this leave the government? <br/>Potentially in a tricky place. <br/>It has now launched a legal battle with the inquiry looking into how it functioned during a public health crisis that changed all of our lives. <br/>If it loses, that would be an embarrassing defeat. Questions would be asked about using public money to fight the case. <br/>If it wins, it's quite possible the Covid inquiry will be seriously undermined. <br/>Will bereaved families who have demanded full transparency accept this? Where would such a ruling leave inquiry chair Baroness Hallett, who has made her position clear? <br/>Cabinet minister Mel Stride has questioned the need for \"irrelevant\" documents to be provided to the inquiry - saying they would not add value.<br/>He told the BBC the government would be \"robust and open and candid\" in its dealings with the inquiry.<br/>But he drew a distinction with information that was \"unambiguously, entirely irrelevant\".<br/>He added: \"It seems to me to request lots and lots of that kind of data is not something which is adding any value\". <br/>With the government and the inquiry now locked in a legal battle, this row looks set to drag on."}, {"_id": "6488981e51ac3398be9f64f6", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65753234?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Scottish independence: Is it still a priority for young Scots?", "lead": "Polls suggest Scots aged under 24 are more likely to back independence than the average person.", "author": "By Calum Leslie", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:58.659391", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16682/production/_129887719_gettyimages-1493827267.jpg", "body": "All eyes were on one of the biggest bands in the world when they headlined Radio 1's Big Weekend in Dundee.<br/>But it's something The 1975's frontman Matty Healy said - rather than sang - that's made some headlines.<br/>No, he didn't completely confirm his relationship with rumoured girlfriend Taylor Swift.<br/>Instead, during his set at the festival this weekend he said Scotland \"should definitely just be doing its own thing\" - something he also brought up at a gig in January.<br/>The country voted to stay in the UK back in 2014 but in truth the talk about Scottish independence has never really gone away.<br/>Dundee is a good place to start - it's where more people supported Scottish independence than anywhere else in the 2014 referendum.<br/>And it's where tens of thousands of young people gathered this weekend to listen to music from the likes of The 1975 and Lewis Capaldi.<br/>Polls suggest Scots aged under 24 are more likely to back independence than the average person.<br/>When Newsbeat asked people at Big Weekend to name a politician, most gave the same answer - Nicola Sturgeon.<br/>But now Ms Sturgeon has stood down, are young Scots still the independence generation or are they worried about other issues?<br/>Someone who agrees with Matty Healy, and was also at Big Weekend, is SNP member Luke Smith.<br/>The 18-year-old says he was in \"total shock\" when Ms Sturgeon stood down as first minister earlier this year.<br/>One of the things she was best known for was her desire to make Scotland independent.<br/>\"You know the world hasn't ended,\" Luke says. <br/>\"We're still the largest party, we're still ahead in the polls, so we've still got that support.\"<br/>New SNP leader Humza Yousaf made history as the first Muslim to lead a country in western Europe when he took over from Ms Sturgeon as first minister.<br/>South Asian Scots recently told Newsbeat they hope the new leader gives them a voice.<br/>Mr Yousaf has focused on lots of issues since he came to power but has also promised they \"will be the generation that delivers independence for Scotland\".<br/>And Luke, who lives in North Berwick, isn't worried about him achieving the SNP's goal of independence.<br/>\"I think it's early days.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled."}, {"_id": "6488981f51ac3398be9f64fa", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65694014?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "Parliaments,Brexit", "title": "Chris Mason: Johnson Partygate row dredges up stench of chaos", "lead": "The former PM continues to loom large over the Tory brand despite Rishi Sunak's efforts to move on.", "author": "By Chris Mason", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:23:59.594047", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EEB1/production/_129850116_e87a7747-ae3e-43ea-bd8a-08c3e8cb5459.jpg", "body": "You hear occasional grumbles about repeats on the BBC.<br/>Well, here's another one.<br/>It involves Boris Johnson, Covid-19 rules and the police.<br/>One set of taxpayer-funded lawyers working for Mr Johnson -

For MPs from the party, the data on voting intention highlights their thin support among younger generations.<br/>A YouGov poll found only 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019, compared to 67% in the over-70s category.<br/>In recent polling, done at this month's local elections, only 8% of the 18 to 24 group said they would vote Conservative.<br/>\"For the 29 to 49-year-olds, that figure was 10%,\" Mr Hancock tells the event.<br/>That 10% figure, Mr Hancock says, \"is catastrophic for the electability of the Conservative Party, not just now, but for a decade\".<br/>\"We need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about,\" he says.<br/>As a TikTok enthusiast with 184,000 followers on the platform, Mr Hancock claims to have an antenna for what young people are looking for in politics.<br/>Curbing climate change, providing more affordable housing, and technological innovation are what young people care about - not some \"divisive culture war\", Mr Hancock says.<br/>Even though he's been suspended as a Tory MP over his appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity, Mr Hancock is well received here.<br/>But does his analysis really reflect the hopes and fears of younger generations?<br/>At the event, we speak to five people under the age of 30, and tellingly, all of them say housing is their biggest worry.<br/>Eve Redmond, a 23-year-old renter who recently moved to London, says: \"I don't think I'll get on the property ladder in the next 10 to 15 years.<br/>\"I do think housing is a particularly important political issue for young people under the age of 30, millennials like me.\"<br/>Joe Lynch, the 18-year-old chairman of Romford Young Conservatives, agrees.<br/>\"We need more affordable housing,\" he says. \"If we can do that as a party, more young people can flock to us.\"<br/>He says the creeping Americanisation of British politics has damaged the Conservative brand.<br/>Some young people, he says, \"think we're all Make American Great Again lunatics, but that's not the case at all\".<br/>The perception among young people of being \"the nasty party\" troubles Nathan Stone, 20.<br/>He says the war against woke - a term that has come to symbolise conservative resistance to social changes - has been \"taken to the extremes\" lately.<br/>He says some of the ideas expressed at this week's National Conservatism Conference - an event organised by a right-wing American think tank - are \"not really going to appeal to younger people\".<br/>In his comments, Mr Hancock savages the \"Conservative Corbynistas\" in his party, who \"preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left\".<br/>\"Looking at what's going on at other conferences, sometimes it felt like 'I'm a Conservative get me out of here',\" he says.<br/>With Mr Hancock standing down as an MP at the next election, he soon will be out of there. And yet, he still believes the liberal wing of his party has the answers to today's political questions.<br/>They will need answers if they are to bridge the generational gulfs exposed at recent general elections. In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent. That's what we need to do.\""}, {"_id": "6488982051ac3398be9f64fd", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-65676875?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Scotland", "subCategories": "Scotland Politics,Scotland Business,Edinburgh, Fife & East,Glasgow & West,Highlands & Islands,NE, Orkney & Shetland,South,Tayside & Central", "title": "What happens next in the Margaret Ferrier case?", "lead": "The MP has been suspended from the Commons for 30 days - making a by-election extremely likely.", "author": "By Mary McCool", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:00.655326", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11ABA/production/_129387327_ferrier.jpg", "body": "A crunch by-election looks likely in Scotland after MPs voted overwhelmingly to suspend Margaret Ferrier.<br/>The MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West broke pandemic rules by speaking in parliament while awaiting the results of a Covid test in September 2020. <br/>After learning she had tested positive, she took a train home to Glasgow rather than isolating. <br/>Her suspension could lead to a by-election - so what happens next and what does it mean for her constituency?

Europe, the Middle East, and the South Atlantic also saw significant increases in turbulence.<br/>Prof Williams said the increased turbulence was due to greater wind shear - or differences in wind speed - in the jet stream, a strong wind system blowing from west to east, about five to seven miles above the Earth's surface. It exists largely due to a difference in temperature between the world's equator and poles. <br/>While satellites can't see the turbulence, they can see the structure and the shape of the jet stream, allowing it to be analysed.<br/>Radar can pick up turbulence from storms, but clear-air turbulence is almost invisible and hard to detect. <br/>Turbulent flights are not only uncomfortable, but can also cause injuries for those on the flight. Severe turbulence is very rare, but clear-air turbulence can come out of the blue, when passengers are not belted in.<br/>\"Nobody should stop flying because they're afraid of turbulence, but it is sensible to keep your seat belt fastened all the time, unless you're moving around, which is what the pilots do,\" said Prof Williams. \"That is almost a guarantee that you will be safe even in the worst turbulence.\"<br/>There are also financial consequences. The aviation industry loses between $150m (\u00a3120m) and $500m (\u00a3400m) in the US alone annually due to effects of turbulence, including wear-and-tear on aircraft, said the researchers.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\""}, {"_id": "6488982151ac3398be9f6500", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65839060?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "El Ni\u00f1o planet-warming weather phase has begun", "lead": "Storms, droughts and record high temperatures lie ahead as US scientists confirm El Ni\u00f1o has arrived.", "author": "By Matt McGrath", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:01.913247", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B287/production/_130030754_gettyimages-1248304400.jpg", "body": "A natural weather event known as El Ni\u00f1o has begun in the Pacific Ocean, likely adding heat to a planet already warming under climate change.<br/>US scientists confirmed that El Ni\u00f1o had started.

It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

We are seeing both a larger area burned, and more severe fires.\"<br/>Spring in Canada has been much warmer and drier than usual, creating a tinder-dry environment for these vast fires. <br/>In Halifax, in the eastern province of Nova Scotia, temperatures last week reached 33C, around 10 degrees higher than normal for the time of year.<br/>Parts of the country, including Alberta and Saskatchewan, have been in drought since 2020.<br/>\"The vegetation in the forests is exceptionally dry,\" says climate scientist Daniel Swain at UCLA, which has meant that a higher fraction of lightning strikes has resulted in forest fires. <br/>Experts link the high temperatures to record-breaking spring heat seen in other parts of the northern hemisphere, including Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria and Siberia.<br/>Last year scientists concluded that high temperatures exacerbated by climate change made drought in the northern hemisphere more likely.<br/>Wildfires also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, those gases that warm our atmosphere. <br/>Emissions from the Canada wildfires in May reached 54.8 million tonnes, which is more than double the past records for that month since estimates began in 2003, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.<br/>A storm system and swirling low-pressure weather has been pushing hazy, smoggy air into parts of Canada and the US, hundreds of miles away from fires.<br/>Those weather conditions may ease in the next few days, meaning the skies could begin to clear, but for areas closer to the fires, the smoke is likely to continue.<br/>The Canadian government says the risk of wildfires is expected to recede in Quebec and Ontario in July, but the potential is expected to expand next month into the Yukon in north-western Canada.<br/>And the heat and dry weather are projected to last throughout the summer, meaning the risk of fire is unlikely to decrease soon.<br/>Scientists predict wildfires will become more frequent and intense in future because of the combined effects of land use and climate change.<br/>But Prof Scheller says \"there will always be year-to-year variation\". <br/>While wildfire frequency varies from region to region, the number of acres burned by these conflagrations has risen notably in recent decades in North America.<br/>That trend is expected to continue for decades as climate change worsens, causing higher temperatures and drier conditions, says Prof Scheller."}, {"_id": "6488982251ac3398be9f6502", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65834167?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "Crocodile found to have made herself pregnant", "lead": "Researchers have found the first case of a crocodile who made herself pregnant.", "author": "By Pallab Ghosh", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:02.299005", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1528F/production/_130017668_screenshot2023-06-07at12.03.22.png", "body": "The first case of a crocodile who made herself pregnant has been identified at a zoo in Costa Rica.<br/>She produced a foetus that was 99.9% genetically identical to herself.<br/>The phenomenon of so-called \"virgin birth\" has been found in species of birds, fish and other reptiles, but never before in crocodiles.<br/>The scientists say the trait might be inherited from an evolutionary ancestor, so dinosaurs might also have been capable of self-reproduction.<br/>The research has been published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters.<br/>The egg was laid by an 18-year-old female American crocodile in Parque Reptilania in January 2018. The foetus inside was fully formed but stillborn and so did not hatch.<br/>The crocodile who laid the egg was obtained when she was two years old and was kept apart from other crocodiles for its entire life. Because of this, the park's scientific team contacted Belfast-born Dr Warren Booth, now working at Virginia Tech in the US.  He has been studying virgin births, known scientifically as parthenogenesis, for 11 years.<br/>Dr Booth analysed the foetus and found that it was more than 99.9 % genetically identical to its mother - confirming that it had no father.<br/>He told BBC News that he wasn't surprised by the discovery.<br/>''We see it in in sharks, birds, snakes and lizards and it is remarkably common and widespread''.<br/>He speculated that the reason that parthenogenesis has not been seen in crocodiles is because people have not been looking for instances of them.<br/>''There was a big increase in reports of parthenogenesis when people started keeping pet snakes. But your average reptile keeper doesn't keep a crocodile,\" he said.<br/>One theory is that it happens in species capable of parthenogenesis when numbers dwindle, and they are on the verge of extinction. And Dr Booth told BBC news that this may have happened to some species of dinosaurs when their numbers dwindled due to environmental changes.<br/>''The fact that the mechanism of parthenogenesis is the same in so many different species suggests that it is a very ancient trait that has been inherited throughout the ages.

Aimee's blood sugar levels also worsened and her blood fat levels - lipids - went up.<br/>This was a short-term study on just one set of twins, but the results highlight growing fears among some scientists about the possible impact of so-called ultra-processed foods on our health, which BBC Panorama has been investigating.<br/>Prof Tim Spector, is a professor of epidemiology at King's College London, who studies trends in disease and oversaw the test. <br/>He told BBC Panorama: \"In the last decade, the evidence has been slowly growing that ultra-processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn't thought. <br/>\"We're talking about a whole variety of cancers, heart disease, strokes, dementia.\" <br/>The term ultra-processed foods - or UPF - was only coined 15 years ago but it makes up about half the things we now eat in the UK. <br/>From sliced brown bread to ready meals and ice cream, it is a group of foods made with varying - but often substantial - levels of industrial processing. Ingredients used, such as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, do not typically feature in home cooking. <br/>\"Ultra-processed foods are among the most profitable foods companies can make,\" says Prof Marion Nestle, a food politics expert and professor of nutrition at New York University.<br/>As our consumption of ultra-processed foods go up - the UK is one of the biggest consumers per head in Europe - so have rates of diabetes and cancer.<br/>Some academics think the link is not coincidental. <br/>Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health?<br/>Ultra-processed convenience foods contain chemicals that UK regulators say are safe, but Panorama investigates emerging scientific evidence of a link between some of these chemicals and cancer, diabetes and strokes.<br/>Watch on BBC iPlayer now, or on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Monday 5 June (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 23:10 in Wales) <br/>In January, one of the most comprehensive studies on ultra-processed food - by Imperial College's School of Public Health - was published in The Lancet medical journal.  <br/>The study of 200,000 UK adults found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods may be linked to an increased risk of developing cancer overall, and specifically ovarian and brain cancers. <br/>And, as of last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now cautioning against the long-term use of artificial sweeteners - citing potential health risks. <br/>It follows dozens of studies linking increasing consumption of UPF to increased risk of developing serious illnesses.<br/>But proving that specific ingredients cause human harm can be challenging - there are a range of other factors in our lifestyles that can cause these diseases. For example: lack of exercise, smoking or sugary diets.<br/>Common ultra-processed foods:<br/>The first investigations into mortality and consumption of ultra-processed food started in France at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord, as part of the ongoing study into the eating habits of 174,000 people.<br/>\"We have 24-hour dietary records during which they tell us all the foods, the beverages and so on, that they are eating,\" explains Dr Mathilde Touvier who heads up the study.<br/>The ongoing research has already published results showing UPF may drive an increased burden of cancer.<br/>More recently, they have been looking into the impact of one specific ingredient - emulsifiers - which act as a glue in ultra-processed foods to hold everything together.<br/>Emulsifiers are the Holy Grail for the food industry - they improve the appearance and texture of food, and help to extend the shelf life far beyond that of less-processed food.<br/>They're everywhere, in mayonnaise, chocolate, peanut butter, meat products. If you eat, you're likely to be consuming emulsifiers as part of your diet. <br/>BBC's Panorama was given exclusive access to Dr Touvier's early results.<br/>They are yet to be peer reviewed - a crucial verification step for scientific studies - but she said they are still concerning. <br/>\"We observed significant associations between emulsifier intake and increased risk of cancer overall - and breast cancer notably - but also with cardiovascular diseases,\" she says.<br/>This means that a pattern has been observed between consuming ultra-processed food and disease risk, but further research is needed.<br/>Despite the growing body of evidence, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) - which regulates the food industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has yet to issue any regulation restricting emulsifiers.<br/>When Panorama asked the FSA about the growing body of evidence that these additives could cause harm it said: \"We have not been presented with any evidence - by this programme or otherwise - of any specific emulsifiers which are believed to pose a risk to health.\"<br/>But the FSA said it planned to hold a public consultation. <br/>Could the food industry itself be playing a role in pushing back on regulation?<br/>The BBC Panorama team spent the past eight months investigating.<br/>\"Food companies are not public health agencies... their job is to sell products,\" food politics expert Prof Nestle told the BBC. <br/>She said the food industry has been known to fund research, sponsor experts and disparage existing studies to prevent regulation.<br/>The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is a body that receives funding from some of the world's largest food companies.<br/>It says its mission is to \"provide science that improves human health\" - but it has previously published studies globally undermining regulation and public guidance on healthy diets. In 2012, the European Food Safety Agency was so worried about potential conflicts of interest, it insisted anyone associated with ILSI either had to resign from the institute or leave the agency.  <br/>Prof Alan Boobis, emeritus professor at Imperial College London, is an unpaid director of ILSI Europe and a former vice president of its board of directors. But he also heads up a group of UK scientists, known as the Committee on Toxicity which provides advice on the risk of chemicals in food to the FSA.  <br/>More than half the members of the committee have recent links to the food or chemicals industries. And over the past 10 years, the committee hasn't supported a single restriction on the use of any chemical additive in our food. <br/>Prof Boobis told Panorama his advice wasn't slanted to favour industry, and he had always been \"totally committed to conducting and identifying the very best scientific research... whoever is funding it.\" <br/>The Food Standards Agency said it had a \"clear code of conduct\u2026 for declarations of interest\" and that it had \"no evidence\" bias has affected its decisions.<br/>ILSI said: \"[We] operate within a framework of the highest principles of scientific integrity.\" <br/>One of the most controversial additives in UPF is the sweetener aspartame. <br/>Two-hundred times sweeter than sugar, it has been heralded as a great low-calorie alternative - turning once unhealthy sugary drinks, ice cream and mousses into products marketed as \"healthy\".<br/>There have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.  <br/>Then, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of \"type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality\".   <br/>In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position. <br/>The Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results \"did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public\". <br/>Six years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.<br/>He discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame. <br/>And that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.  <br/>A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took \"the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations\".<br/>A spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: \"Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"<br/>The FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame. And the government says it is aware of the growing concerns around UPF and has ordered a review into the evidence on ultra-processed foods. <br/>Watch Panorama - Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health? - on BBC iPlayer and listen to 5Live listeners have their say with Nicky Campbell, Is ultra processed food okay?"}, {"_id": "6488982351ac3398be9f6505", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65804939?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "England,N.

Ordinary solar panels have a capacity of about 400W, so if you count both rooftops and solar farms, there could be as many as 2.5 billion solar panels.,\" says Dr Rong Deng, an expert in solar panel recycling at the University of New South Wales in Australia.<br/>According to the British government, there are tens of millions of solar panels in the UK. But the specialist infrastructure to scrap and recycle them is lacking.<br/>Energy experts are calling for urgent government action to prevent a looming global environmental disaster.<br/>\"It's going to be a waste mountain by 2050, unless we get recycling chains going now,\" says Ute Collier, deputy director of the International Renewable Energy Agency. <br/>\"We're producing more and more solar panels - which is great - but how are we going to deal with the waste?\" she asks.<br/>It is hoped a major step will be taken at the end of June, when the world's first factory dedicated to fully recycling solar panels officially opens in France. <br/>ROSI, the specialist solar recycling company which owns the facility, in the Alpine city of Grenoble, hopes eventually to be able to extract and re-use 99% of a unit's components. <br/>As well as recycling the glass fronts and aluminium frames, the new factory can recover nearly all of the precious materials contained within the panels, such as silver and copper, which are typically some of the hardest materials to extract. <br/>These rare materials can subsequently be recycled and reused to make new, more powerful, solar units.<br/>Conventional methods of recycling solar panels recover most of the aluminium and glass - but ROSI says the glass, in particular, is of relatively low-quality. <br/>The glass recovered using those methods can be used to create tiles, or in sandblasting - it can also be mixed with other materials to make asphalt - but it cannot be used in applications where high-grade glass is required, such as the production of new solar panels.  <br/>The new ROSI plant will open during a boom period for solar panel installations. <br/>The world's solar energy generation capacity grew by 22% in 2021. Around 13,000 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are fitted in the UK every month - most of them on the roofs of private houses. <br/>In many cases, solar units become relatively uneconomical before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. New, more efficient designs evolve at regular intervals, meaning it can prove cheaper to replace solar panels that are only 10 or 15 years old with updated versions. <br/>If current growth trends are sustained, Ms Collier says, the volume of scrap solar panels could be huge.<br/>\"By 2030, we think we're going to have four million tonnes [of scrap] - which is still manageable - but by 2050, we could end up with more than 200 million tonnes globally.\"<br/>To put that into perspective, the world currently produces a total of 400 million tonnes of plastic every year. <br/>The reason there are so few facilities for recycling solar panels is because there has not been much waste to process and reuse until recently. <br/>The first generation of domestic solar panels is only now coming to the end of its usable life. With those units now approaching retirement, experts say urgent action is needed.<br/>\"Now is the time to think about this,\" says Ms Collier. <br/>France is already a leader among European nations when it comes to processing photovoltaic waste, says Nicolas Defrenne. His organisation, Soren, partners with ROSI and other firms, co-ordinating the decommissioning of solar panels all over France.<br/>\"The biggest one [we decommissioned] took three months,\" Mr Defrenne recalls. <br/>His team at Soren has been experimenting with different ways of recycling what they collect: \"We're throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\"<br/>At ROSI's high-tech plant in Grenoble, the solar panels are painstakingly taken apart to recover the precious materials inside - such as copper, silicon and silver.<br/>Each solar panel contains only tiny fragments of these precious materials and those fragments are so intertwined with other components that, until now, it has not been economically viable to separate them. <br/>But because they are so valuable, extracting those precious materials efficiently could be a game-changer, says Mr Defrenne. <br/>\"Over 60% of the value is contained in 3% of the weight of the solar panels,\" he says.<br/>The team at Soren are hopeful that, in the future, nearly three-quarters of the materials needed to make new solar panels - including silver - can be recovered from retired PV units and recycled - to help speed up production of new panels. <br/>Currently there is not enough silver available to build the millions of solar panels which will be required in the the transition from fossil fuels, says Mr Defrenne: \"You can see where you have a production bottleneck, it's silver.\" <br/>Meanwhile British scientists have been trying to develop similar technology to ROSI. <br/>Last year, researchers at the University of Leicester announced they had worked out how to extract silver from PV units using a form of saline. <br/>But so far, ROSI is the only company in its field to have scaled up its operation to industrial levels.<br/>Moreover, the technology is expensive. In Europe, importers or producers of solar panels are responsible for disposing of them when they become expendable. And many  favour crushing or shredding the waste - which is far cheaper. <br/>Mr Defrenne acknowledges that intensive recycling of solar panels is still in its infancy. Soren and its partners recycled just under 4,000 tonnes of French solar panels last year. <br/>But there is potential to do a lot more. And he's making that his mission. <br/>\"The weight of all the new solar panels sold last year in France was 232,000 tonnes - so, by the time those wear out in 20 years, that's how much I'll need to collect every year.  <br/>\"When that happens, my personal goal is to ensure France will be the technological leader of the world.\"<br/>Listen to The Climate Question on BBC Sounds"}, {"_id": "6488982351ac3398be9f6507", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65648361?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "Can \u2018enhanced rock weathering\u2019 help combat climate change?", "lead": "'Enhanced rock weathering' uses tiny volcanic rocks to capture the greenhouse gas carbon from the atmosphere.", "author": "By Jonah Fisher", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:03.886373", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14E4/production/_129784350_mediaitem129784349.jpg", "body": "In a quarry surrounded by the din of heavy machinery Jim Mann crouches down and picks up a handful of tiny black rocks. <br/>\"This is my magic dust,\" he says with a smile, gently rubbing them between his fingers.<br/>He's holding pieces of basalt. It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.

Countries agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.<br/>Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires. <br/>But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.<br/>Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. <br/>Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. <br/>By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's \"more likely than not.\"<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average. <br/>Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas. <br/>For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world. <br/>Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure. <br/>Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.<br/>And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time. <br/>\"We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.<br/>\"I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,\" he told a news conference. <br/>The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed. <br/>\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas<br/>\"However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" he said.<br/>There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up. <br/>The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon with global implications. <br/>For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a event which has dampened climate warming to some extent. <br/>But the extra heat that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.<br/>However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.<br/>\"It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Ni\u00f1o that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,\" Prof Scaife told reporters. <br/>\"But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Ni\u00f1o and that might be the one that does it. \"<br/>The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters. <br/>Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"_id": "6488982451ac3398be9f6509", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65339214?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Science", "subCategories": "", "title": "Earth Day: How to talk to your parents about climate change", "lead": "You want to do more about climate change, but how do you persuade the people who call the shots?", "author": "By Georgina Rannard", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:04.302838", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/48A1/production/_129439581_gettyimages-1402625152.jpg", "body": "You want to go vegan to help the planet, but you're not paying for the shopping. You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday.<br/>Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem.<br/>It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.<br/>Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:<br/>Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. <br/>Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. <br/>Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.<br/>\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. <br/>\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. <br/>Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. <br/>Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.<br/>Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"<br/>How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.<br/>Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. <br/>\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.<br/>Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" <br/>\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  <br/>She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.<br/>Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.<br/>Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.<br/>\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.<br/>Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.<br/>\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.<br/>\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains.

It's an important summary of six key pieces of research completed over the past five years. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the critical messages.<br/>The sober tones of this study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make clear that there is very little chance of keeping the world from warming by more than 1.5C. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid that. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s, despite all the political speechmaking.<br/>\"It has always been clear in the IPCC and in climate science, that it's not very likely that we always will stay below 1.5C,\" said Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team.<br/>Dr Geden and his colleagues now argue that coming back down as quickly as possible after overshooting this mark is where the focus should be. <br/>Overshooting is risky, as the report acknowledges, because it might trip tipping points that can't be uncrossed, such as the melting of permafrost that would in turn release vast amounts of warming gases.  <br/>Coming back from overshooting will need expensive, unproven technology to pull CO2 from the air, something known as carbon capture.<br/>It also means that it's even more urgent to get as quickly as possible to net zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere does not increase. Every increment of global warming and every year that goes by really matters. <br/>While the report doesn't definitively say it, there are some clear indications that there's no future for coal, oil and gas on a liveable planet.<br/>It highlights how renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar are now cheaper and that sticking with fossil fuels may be more expensive in many places than switching to low carbon systems.<br/>\"The message in terms of urgency, I think, is stop burning fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible,\" Dr Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors told BBC News.<br/>\"It is not because we are lacking some important piece of technology or some important knowledge. It is because so far, the sense of urgency has been lacking in the places where the important decisions are made.\"<br/>While it is easy to think that scientific reports on climate change are all about governments and energy policy, the IPCC has been moving to highlight the fact that the actions that people can take make by themselves make massive difference to the overall picture. <br/>\"We could cut 40 to 70% of projected 2050 emissions with end-use measures,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.<br/>This includes shifting to plant-based diets, avoiding flights, building more walkable and bikeable cities,\" she told BBC News. <br/>The report nudges governments towards reforming their transport, industry and energy systems so that making these low carbon choices becomes much easier and cheaper for individuals.<br/>It's amazing to think that the decisions we make around the world over the next seven years will echo down the centuries.<br/>The report warns that with sustained warming of between 2 and 3C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost \"almost completely and irreversibly\" over multiple millenia.<br/>Many other thresholds will be crossed at low levels of heating, impacting things like the world's glaciers. <br/>To stop this runaway train of warming, governments need to up their commitments before 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, in order to keep warming in or around 1.5C by 2100. <br/>\"I think our climate system, but also our social systems and our ecosystems, all show us that it's bloody urgent, so that we can still change the world to make it a better place for all of us,\" said Dr Otto.<br/>The real strength of the IPCC is that their reports are agreed with governments - and as such the reports are approved by their representatives in the presence of the scientists who research and write them.<br/>But the future of fossil fuels is becoming more and more a political question. <br/>Last November in Sharm el-Sheikh, a number of countries tried but failed to get the UN to agree to phase out oil and gas as well as coal. <br/>This argument is not going away - with the EU now openly supporting such a move.<br/>This new IPCC report will be central to it when countries meet again at COP28 in Dubai later this year.

These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.<br/>\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.<br/>Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.<br/>The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.<br/>\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. <br/>Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. <br/>Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\" <br/>The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.<br/>Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. <br/>It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. <br/>By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.<br/>Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. <br/>\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.<br/>\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.<br/>\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"<br/>The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. <br/>And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. <br/>\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.<br/>\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"<br/>The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". <br/>The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. <br/>They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. <br/>But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.<br/>Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.<br/>Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. <br/>\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well."}, {"_id": "6488982451ac3398be9f650c", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-65035041?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "Africa,Asia,Australia,Europe,Latin America,Middle East,US & Canada", "title": "UN warns against 'vampiric' global water use", "lead": "A new report warning of \"endemic\" water scarcity is released ahead of a three-day water summit.", "author": "By Marita Moloney", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:04.947089", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C7B8/production/_129082115_gettyimages-670191292.jpg", "body": "A United Nations report has warned of a looming global water crisis and an \"imminent risk\" of shortages due to overconsumption and climate change.<br/>The world is \"blindly travelling a dangerous path\" of \"vampiric overconsumption and overdevelopment\", the report says.<br/>Its publication comes before the first major UN water summit since 1977.<br/>Thousands of delegates will attend the three-day gathering in New York which begins on Wednesday.<br/>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says water, \"humanity's lifeblood\", is being drained by \"unsustainable water use, pollution and unchecked global warming\".<br/>The report, published by UN Water and Unesco, warns that \"scarcity is becoming endemic\" because of overconsumption and pollution, while global warming will increase seasonal water shortages in both areas with abundant water and those already strained.<br/>Richard Connor, the lead author of the report, said that about 10% of the global population \"currently lives in areas that are high or critical water stress\". <br/>\"In our report, we say that up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year,\" he told the BBC.<br/>According to the most recent UN climate report, published Monday by the IPCC expert panel, \"roughly half of the world's population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least part of the year\".<br/>Mr Connor told reporters that \"uncertainties are increasing\" when it comes to global water supply. <br/>\"If we don't address it, there definitely will be a global crisis,\" he said.<br/>UNDP Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari told the BBC that resources would need to be managed more carefully in the future. <br/>\"There is enough water on the planet if we manage it more effectively than we have managed it over the last few decades,\" she said. <br/>\"I think we will have to find new governance models, new finance models, new models of using water and reusing water than ever before.

It was one of several songs on a cassette labelled \"For Paul\" that Lennon had made shortly before his death in 1980. <br/>Lo-fi and embryonic, the tracks were largely recorded onto a boombox as the musician sat at a piano in his New York apartment.<br/>Cleaned up by producer Jeff Lynne, two of those songs - Free As A Bird and Real Love - were completed and released in 1995 and 96, marking the Beatles' first \"new\" material in 25 years.<br/>The band also attempted to record Now And Then, an apologetic love song that was fairly typical of Lennon's later career, but the session was quickly abandoned.<br/>\"It was one day - one afternoon, really - messing with it,\" Lynne recalled.<br/>\"The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish.\"<br/>Sir Paul later claimed George Harrison refused to work on the song, saying the sound quality of Lennon's vocal was \"rubbish\".<br/>\"It didn't have a very good title, it needed a bit of reworking, but it had a beautiful verse and it had John singing it,\" he told Q Magazine.<br/>\"[But] George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it.\"<br/>There were also said to have been technical issues with the original recording, which featured a persistent \"buzz\" from the electricity circuits in Lennon's apartment.<br/>In 2009, a new version of the demo, without the background noise, was released on a bootleg CD. Fans have speculated that this recording may not have been available in 1995, suggesting it was stolen from his apartment, along with other personal effects, after his death.<br/>In the intervening years, Sir Paul has repeatedly talked about his desire to finish the song.<br/>\"That one's still lingering around,\" he told a BBC Four documentary on Jeff Lynne in 2012. \"So I'm going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days.\"<br/>It would seem that technology has now afforded the musician a chance to achieve that goal.<br/>The turning point came with Peter Jackson's Get Back documentary, where dialogue editor Emile de la Rey trained computers to recognise the Beatles' voices and separate them from background noises, and even their own instruments, to create \"clean\" audio.<br/>The same process allowed Sir Paul to \"duet\" with Lennon on his recent tour, and for new surround sound mixes of the Beatles' Revolver album to be created last year.<br/>\"He [Jackson] was able to extricate John's voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\" Sir Paul told Radio 4's Martha Kearney. <br/>\"We had John's voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI. They tell the machine, 'That's the voice. This is a guitar.

"body": "Regulators in the US have asked a judge to block Microsoft from completing its $69bn (\u00a356bn) purchase of Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard.<br/>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the deal, which would be the largest in the history of the video games industry, could \"substantially lessen competition\" in the sector.<br/>The move comes after the UK blocked the deal over concerns it would hurt competition, but the EU approved it.<br/>A trial in the US will begin in August.<br/>The FTC said in a court filing that a \"preliminary injunction is necessary to... prevent interim harm\" while the regulator determines whether \"the proposed acquisition violates US antitrust law\".<br/>Microsoft's proposed takeover of Activision has split global regulators, and in order for the deal to go through the parties need approval from regulatory bodies in the UK, the EU and the US.<br/>The European Commission has approved the acquisition, saying that Microsoft's offer of 10-year free licensing deals - which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>In December last year, the FTC had asked an in-house administrative judge to block the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.<br/>William Kovacic, former FTC chair and non-executive director at the UK's CMA, said the FTC had expressed concerns that Microsoft and Activision might close their deal despite UK opposition, and so asked a judge to halt it.<br/>\"The EU's decision to take a settlement was a bit of a surprise,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme<br/>Mr Kovacic said there was still a chance the takeover could be completed, but added \"the chance is diminished\".<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to play catch-up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases - which is the main way of accessing games at the moment.<br/>Additional reporting by Kath Paddison"}, {"_id": "6488982751ac3398be9f6513", "url":

its film to be used in a new campaign video by former president Donald Trump.<br/>The clip, featuring a narration voiced by Damon from the film Air, was posted on Mr Trump's social media platform Truth Social.<br/>The audio was used over footage of Trump as a young boy and as president.<br/>But the studio said it did not consent to or endorse its usage for Mr Trump's political campaign.<br/>The studio said: \"Any use of material from Air by the Trump campaign where approval or consent is required, we do not grant such consent.\"<br/>The film, released earlier this year but set in the 1980s, follows the story of the game-changing partnership between Nike's fledgling basketball division and rising star Michael Jordan.<br/>Together, the renowned basketball player and the sports brand created the hugely successful Air Jordan sneakers.<br/>The film was produced by Damon and Affleck's firm Artists Equity, which was formed last year with RedBird Capital.<br/>\"We had no foreknowledge of, did not consent to and do not endorse or approve any footage or audio from Air being repurposed by the Trump campaign as a political advertisement or for any other use,\" Artists Equity said.<br/>\"We hereby expressly give notice that in the case of any use of material from Air by the Trump campaign where approval or consent is required, we do not grant such consent.\"<br/>Mr Trump and his campaign team have not yet responded to Artists Equity's statement.<br/>Mr Trump will appear in court in Miami on Tuesday to face dozens of charges accusing him of illegally retaining classified information.<br/>It could result in the first criminal prosecution of a former US president.<br/>Mr Trump, who last year declared his candidacy for a second presidential term, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. <br/>In the campaign video, released over the weekend, Damon can be heard saying \"money can buy you almost anything\", as Trump is shown on screen. <br/>It then transitions to another line taken from the film where his character says: \"It can't buy you immortality... that you have to earn.\"<br/>His character continues: \"Once they've built you as high as they possibly can, they're going to tear you back down... it's the most predictable pattern, we build you into something that doesn't exist and that means you have to be that thing, all day, every day.<br/>\"And I'm going to tell you the truth: You're going to be attacked, betrayed, exposed and humiliated... and you'll survive that.\"<br/>Many Hollywood stars criticised Mr Trump's policies when he was in the White House, with some musicians also requesting their music not be used in campaign messaging. <br/>The Rolling Stones threatened legal action three years ago, while Neil Young sued the then president for using his songs. <br/>Adele, REM, Brian May of Queen, Sir Elton John and the estate of Prince have also objected to the former US president's use of their music."}, {"_id":

Tory shot Meg.\"<br/>Megan told the courtroom Lanez had offered her $1m to keep quiet about what happened, and called her afterwards to apologise, claiming he was \"just too drunk\".<br/>Through tears, she said she had regrets about coming forward, saying speaking out had been \"torture\".<br/>Outside the court, Lanez' supporters stood opposite crowds of fans carrying \"We stand with Megan\" signs.<br/>And as Megan arrived at the building, his side heckled her by shouting: \"Why are you lying on that boy?\"<br/>Accusations of lying have dogged the Grammy-winning rapper throughout the case, because her story changed early on.<br/>She initially told police she'd been hurt by stepping on broken glass.<br/>It wasn't until later, on Instagram, when she first said that Tory had shot her. <br/>She then told an interviewer she'd needed surgery to remove bullets from her feet which had missed her bones and tendons.<br/>Megan, 27, said she lied to officers at the time because she didn't want to \"get in more trouble\". <br/>It sparked a long war of words between her and Lanez - they both released tracks about the case.<br/>In his song Money Over Fallout, Lanez accused Megan of trying to frame him, while Megan said she was the one \"speakin' facts\" in her track Shots Fired.<br/>The dispute spilled out into the wider hip-hop world, with artists like 50 Cent and even Drake getting involved.<br/>Megan frequently defended herself on Twitter and said she'd been painted as aggressive and a \"snitch\".<br/>She suggested misogynoir - misogyny against black women - could be why she was targeted.<br/>Megan criticised Drake when he released Circo Loco, a collab with 21 Savage that appeared to reference the shooting case.<br/>But she did receive support from fellow artists, like JoJo and Kehlani. <br/>And a group of prominent black women, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, released an open letter backing Megan.<br/>In Da Club rapper Fiddy eventually apologised for sharing memes casting doubt on Megan's version of events.<br/>He said he'd changed his mind after hearing evidence from the trial.<br/>Lanez has always denied the charges against him - felony negligent discharge of a firearm, assault with a semi-automatic firearm, and carrying a loaded and unregistered firearm.<br/>The 30-year-old Canadian has filed various appeals - and his lawyers could launch other motions after his sentence.<br/>Since the guilty verdict, Megan has tried to reclaim the narrative around the shooting, and spoken about the effect \"false narratives\" and \"conspiracy theories\" had on her.<br/>In an Elle Magazine feature, she said the guilty verdict \"was a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them\".<br/>\"We can't control what others think, especially when the lies are juicier than the truth,\" she said.<br/>\"But as a society, we must create safer environments for women to come forward about violent behaviour without fear of retaliation.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

Marcus Mumford took on California; while Annie Lennox delivered a mesmerising, synth-driven take on Ladies of the Canyon.<br/>The Scottish star also recalled how a roommate had introduced her to Mitchell's music when she was just 19.<br/>\"It blew my mind\u2026 and started me on a path I never expected to happen,\" Lennox said. \"The thing is, back in the day, there were so few of us women doing this thing we're doing. We take it for granted, don't we?\"<br/>Critics uniformly described the concert as a joyful celebration of Mitchell's life and work. Many marvelled at how her voice had recovered and matured since her aneurysm.<br/>\"There was a renewed ease in her movement across melodies, and a pearly purity in her tone,\" wrote Lindsay Zoladz in the New York Times. <br/>\"To hear Mitchell hit certain notes again in that inimitable voice was like glimpsing, in the wild, a magnificent bird long feared to have gone extinct.\"<br/>\"Mitchell fans know that her voice has changed - has lowered and gotten grainier - since the high-and-pure days of Blue, but it's a gift to hear how much (more) emotional wisdom her singing has accrued as she nears 80,\" agreed Mikael Wood in the LA Times. <br/>\"Her vocals sounded pure on a slow-and-low version of Both Sides Now, which seemed to bleed wisdom when she wrote it more than half a century ago but now feels like some kind of ancient rune.\"<br/>\"Mitchell's performance feels ego-free,\" added The Guardian's Matthew Cantor. \"She laughs and cracks jokes between songs and further extols the virtues of her fellow performers, never seeming to take the evening too seriously. <br/>\"That sets the tone for a joyful show, though the momentousness of the occasion leaves more than a few audience members - and even some on stage - tearful.\"<br/>Some of those tears, however, were tears of laughter.<br/>Mitchell recalled the last time she had played the Gorge, on tour with Van Morrison and Bob Dylan in the late 1990s.<br/>She said Morrison had been upset that he'd never been invited to spend time with Dylan, even though she had. \"Bob's rude,\" she placated him, \"He loves to be an enigma.\"<br/>The musicians then decided to run on stage during Dylan's set and force themselves into one of his songs. But when Mitchell stepped up to the microphone, she forgot the words.<br/>\"I said to the guitar player, 'You got it,' and he sang the fourth verse,\" she told the crowd, to peals of laughter. \"I tried frantically to remember what the fifth verse was. I couldn't remember that one either, so I made one up.\"<br/>\"Bob turned around and did a double take and gave me a look. He was grinning from ear to ear.\"<br/>Afterwards. Morrison scolded her for being \"disrespectful\", but she argued that he'd misunderstood. <br/>\"Bob loves to see me [mess] up,\" she said, using an unprintable expletive.<br/>The only sign of Mitchell's extended absence from the stage came during Shine, when the audience held up their phones with the torches turned on.<br/>\"Where'd they get those lights?\" Mitchell asked Carlile.<br/>\"Cellphones,\" she responded.<br/>\"Cellphones? Really?\" Mitchell said, seemingly inspired. \"That was a real spectacle... You look like a fallen constellation... Thank you for that.\"<br/>As the set drew to a close Mitchell picked up a guitar to play Just Like This Train and If - a remarkable moment, given that she had to teach herself to play again by watching old YouTube videos.<br/>But she ended the night with a cover of Frank Sinatra's Young At Heart - whose closing lyrics couldn't have been more appropriate. <br/>\"And if you survive to 105 / Look at all you'll derive / Out of being alive / And here is the best part / You have a head start/ If you are among the very / Young at heart.\"<br/>As Mitchell had said earlier in the concert: \"Vive La Old Age.\"<br/>You may also be interested in:"}, {"_id": "6488982951ac3398be9f651d", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-65878227?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "Newsbeat", "subCategories": "", "title": "Xbox showcase 2023: Is Microsoft back in the game?", "lead": "Microsoft had a lot to prove in some people's eyes -

the Triple-A RPG from Elder Scrolls studio Bethesda that got its very own one-hour showcase.<br/>Regarded as Microsoft's biggest release in quite some time, the planet-hopping RPG promises players a whole galaxy to explore.<br/>Bethesda showed off various mechanics, such as the game's different playstyles and ship crafting system.<br/>People were impressed by Starfield's sheer size - The Guardian said it was a \"supermassive black hole of a game\" - though some fans worried they wouldn't get time to play it.<br/>Director Todd Howard said the level of detail in the game meant it would be locked at 30 frames per second on both versions of the Xbox.<br/>And some will have mixed feelings about the news that the Elder Scrolls developer's resurrected one of its \"most annoying\" characters for its space odyssey.<br/>It would be unreasonable to expect any showcase to be filled with back-to-back big reveals, and quite a few expansions to existing games were announced.<br/>Fallout 76: Atlantic City, Overwatch 2: Invasion and Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom were all shown.<br/>A Monkey Island add-on for popular online pirate-em-up Sea of Thieves was also announced -

A new streaming series shows what became of the characters.<br/>The Full Monty film opened with a shot of a derelict Sheffield factory, and ended with a group of former employees hauling themselves off the scrapheap to stage a strip show in a working men's club.<br/>Twenty-six years on, the new Disney+ series opens with a shot of the same working men's club. It's now derelict too.<br/>A quarter of a century may have passed, but not much has changed.<br/>And despite the 1997 film's uplifting ending, it turns out that most of the six friends have only narrowly avoided dereliction themselves. <br/>They are led by lovable rogue Gaz, played by Robert Carlyle. The actor says that after years of industrial decline, when the film came out there was a sense of optimism in the UK, thanks to New Labour, Cool Britannia and Britpop. \"It seemed to be that things can only get better.\"<br/>That didn't last long, though, Carlyle continues. \"The past 25 years have been really tough for people. Twenty-five years, it seems, of austerity that's really chipped away at these characters and their lives.<br/>\"It's chipped away the infrastructure in the country as well. And I think the show reflects that.\"<br/>Gaz is now a porter on a psychiatric ward, while best mate Dave (played by Mark Addy) is a caretaker at the school where his wife Jean (Lesley Sharp) is headteacher. Both fertile settings for storylines about a crumbling state.<br/>Meanwhile, Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) and Horse (Paul Barber) have been left behind by modern life, and Lomper (Steve Huison) runs a caf\u00e9 called Big Baps with his husband - although that name soon gets cancelled.<br/>Only Guy (Hugo Speer) seems to have prospered, now the privately-financed pantomime villain.<br/>However, he disappears half-way through the series because the actor was himself cancelled after Disney investigated \"allegations of inappropriate conduct\" on set. The actor denied that and said he \"didn't believe I'd done anything wrong\".<br/>The gang are joined by William Snape - who played Gaz's son Nathan in the film - and Talitha Wing, who has been cast as Gaz's daughter Destiny.<br/>At 26, Wing is the same age as the film. She familiarised herself by watching it with her grandparents. \"I thought we'd find different bits funny,\" she says.<br/>\"But we all actually were laughing at the same bits. So the humour and people coming together in times of hardship, I guess, is something that transcends time and generations, and is a story that everyone can understand.<br/>\"Even though I might not have been around at the time that it was going on, I feel like you can take the message and apply it to whatever is going on [today]. And unfortunately in some instances, not that much has changed.\"<br/>The eight-part series has been co-written by Simon Beaufoy - who was nominated for an Oscar for the original - and Alice Nutter.<br/>They have been able to put a wide range of issues \"in a package and still make it funny\". Carlyle says. \"That's the genius of Simon's writing. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.\"<br/>With the main characters now in their mid-50s to mid-70s, the South Yorkshire-set comedy-drama resembles what might emerge if Ken Loach directed Last of the Summer Wine.<br/>In a three-star review, The Telegraph's Michael Hogan said the new version \"firmly wears its politics on its sleeve - with mixed success\".<br/>\"The issues will be all too recognisable, especially to those in neglected communities,\" he wrote.<br/>\"If the optimism of the original... has gone, that's the point - this is a sobering reminder of how far we haven't come.\"<br/>Collider's Chase Hutchinson described it as \"a slightly baggy series elevated by the charm of flawed characters just trying to find their way in the world\".<br/>He concluded that \"the overall experience is a mirthful yet melancholic one worth riding along with\".<br/>While having eight episodes does make the series \"slightly baggy\" (there are major plots about a Britain's Got Talent-winning dog, a lost racing pigeon and a Job Centre siege), it does provide more time for characters like Jean.<br/>\"In the 90 minutes that was the film, naturally and rightly the story had to be about that group of men, who were all trying to live with being made redundant,\" Sharp says.<br/>\"What's fantastic about revisiting it is that instead of having 90 minutes, you've got eight hours to explore in detail what has happened subsequently to all of those characters. And yes, that includes a lot of really vibrant, whip smart women - young and older. <br/>\"So I think it's great that the original film, which was male centric, is now being ameliorated by the presence of some really interesting older and younger women.\"<br/>While revisiting a beloved film is a surefire way to attract eyeballs, it also comes with expectations.<br/>\"Revisiting anything can be fraught with complication,\" Sharp accepts. \"But because the film had been so loved and because Simon obviously wanted to continue telling the story of those characters, it felt like it was an enormous opportunity.\"<br/>One plot line that gets relatively little screen time is stripping. \"Well, nobody really needs to see that,\" smiles Addy. \"It's about so much more.<br/>\"That was our starting block and it's interesting to see where these characters have gone from there.\"<br/>Much of the film's appeal, though, came from the idea of stripping, if not the act itself - as a clever way to give the men a liberating and cheeky opportunity to shed society's limitations and regain control of their lives.<br/>Its feel-good power was such that the film has spawned a number of celebrity charity spin-offs - see The Real Full Monty on Ice - as well as inspiring amateur fundraisers.<br/>\"There are still men who get together and do the Full Monty for charity,\" Carlyle notes. \"And I think that's an amazing thing. If The Full Monty has done nothing [else] and it was only that, then it is worth it.\"<br/>The actor originally feared the film would bomb because it was such a tough shoot. \"You'd go home at night thinking, what is this? Is this funny? Is this anything?\" he says.<br/>\"I thought, this is never going to work. Of course, the finished article proved me wrong.\"<br/>This time, filming was \"relatively easy\", he says. \"It really was beautiful to see the guys again, because you look in each other's faces and you see life, you know, in the lines in their face. And that was lovely.<br/>\"And the thing is, The Full Monty has been like a huge big warm shadow that's followed me my whole career. There's only about four or five other people in the world that understand that. And it's those guys. It was fantastic to be back doing all that again.\"<br/>The Full Monty is on Disney+ from Wednesday 14 June."}, {"_id": "6488982a51ac3398be9f651f", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-65791955?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "primaryCategory": "England", "subCategories": "Regions,London", "title": "Royal Academy Summer Exhibition: Who makes the cut?", "lead": "The Academy has taken public submissions since 1769 - but even legendary artists have been rejected.", "author": "By Jacob Evans", "datePublished": "test", "dateScraped": "2023-06-13 18:24:10.392425", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11E8D/production/_130075337_e6540599-cfc4-4654-9d63-e3329bcb1627.jpg", "body": "The Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition has for more than 250 years given amateur artists the chance to have their work displayed at its prestigious London headquarters. How difficult is it to make the grade - and which now famous artists failed to persuade the Academy of their genius?<br/>The exhibition, which has run uninterrupted since 1769 and featured the likes of David Hockney, Grayson Perry and Thomas Gainsborough, is described by the Academy as \"the world's largest open submission exhibition\".<br/>It presents an unparalleled opportunity for amateur artists to have their work publicly displayed and then purchased, although entries are capped at 16,500 and competition is fierce - this year, more than 11,000 people submitted work but less than 10% were successful.<br/>The 2023 exhibition is being co-ordinated by Royal Academician David Remfry, and has the theme \"Only Connect\".<br/>The 80-year-old told the BBC: \"My work was first accepted for the summer show in 1972 and I remember the joy of it.\"<br/>However, he says he too fell victim to the rigorous selection process: \"There were quite a few years after that when I wasn't so fortunate.\"<br/>This year 11,204 entries came from the public, with 998 artists making the cut.<br/>There will be 1,613 artworks on display, combining the creations of Royal Academicians, invited artists and the successful public submissions.<br/>All of the entries are judged by the Summer Exhibition committee, co-ordinated by Mr Remfry and chaired by the president of the Royal Academy, Rebecca Salter.<br/>A spokesperson told the BBC that members of the committee serve in rotation, with the aim of giving each year \"a distinctive character\".<br/>The process starts each January and it costs \u00a338 to apply. The exhibition is open to anyone, from the brazenly amateur to the more seasoned artist, although there is a cap of 16,500 submissions. <br/>The judges choose about 4,000 pieces from these 16,500 digitally submitted entries, and those who make the shortlist are invited to deliver their artwork to the Royal Academy for the second round. This is judged in person by the committee members, who narrow the list down again to about 1,000 successful entries.  <br/>Acceptance can prove lucrative, with a total of about \u00a370,000 in prize money up for grabs across a number of categories. All the artworks are also available to buy, with some having fetched over \u00a310,000 in previous years.<br/>The Academy has famously rejected a number of now-acclaimed artists over the years, such as British landscape painter John Constable, whose work later sold for over \u00a320m, and French artist Edouard Manet, whose paintings have fetched over \u00a340m.<br/>In 2018, renowned street artist Banksy submitted an artwork under the pseudonym, Bryan S Gaakman - an anagram of \"Banksy anagram\" - and was rejected. The piece was later accepted after he resent it under his name.<br/>However, some people spend years trying to feature in the exhibition without success.<br/>Alison Aye is one of them, suffering her 21st rejection this year.<br/>She first submitted an entry in 1993 and says the 30th anniversary of that rejection \"is a really nice round-off\".<br/>Last year, her plight caught the attention of comedian Joe Lycett, who smuggled her entry into the gallery as part of a BBC documentary.<br/>Lycett dubbed Ms Aye \"the queen of the rejected\" - a title the 56-year-old has fully embraced.<br/>Ms Aye, from Bromley in south-east London, has reached the second stage once but now says that \"if I got accepted, I don't know if I would be happy - I like this sort of concept of rejection\".<br/>She says when she first started applying she \"took it quite personally, especially because I went to art college, and I know a lot of people who get accepted\".<br/>By now though the deflation is \"very fleeting\" and being turned down is \"a sort of a badge of honour\".<br/>Ms Aye says for a few years there used to be an exhibition for rejected artists, but she didn't even manage to make that.<br/>As to whether she'll apply again next year, she says: \"It's such a good selling place if you get in. I think it's always worth the gamble.\"<br/>The Summer Exhibition opens on Monday 13 June and runs until 20 August.<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But at points, Keough wondered if the film would be completed.<br/>\"You have two females making their first feature with a completely indigenous cast of, quote unquote, no value in terms of the marketplace and no movie stars,\" Keough explains.<br/>\"We see this a lot because Gina and I have a production company and we see the money that's given to men versus women, first-time filmmaker or not. And it's really an issue still. At the end of the day, we had wonderful financiers who understood the vision and came together and supported us, but prior to that it was really depressing, you know.\"<br/>Gammell adds: \"We'd be finishing a week of shooting and we were making phone calls trying to get the next week of shooting paid for.<br/>\"And we were really lucky that we got through it, and we only just managed to get through it. It was incredibly tough.\"<br/>The film is now getting released in the UK as well as elsewhere in Europe and the USA, with an overall score of 91% on movie review site Rotten Tomatoes, with Empire calling it \"restrained but promising stuff from Keough and Gammell, who exhibit strong world-building and lightness of filmmaking touch\".<br/>Keough has suffered personal losses this year, with the death in January of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, who suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of 54, three years after her son Benjamin, Keough's brother, died. Keough and her grandmother Priscilla Presley reached a settlement over Presley's estate in May.<br/>She started acting as a teenager, with her first prominent role in 2010's The Runaways, a Joan Jett biopic starring Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning. She also starred in 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. <br/>Keough's profile has an actress has risen further with the release of Daisy Jones & The Six, based on a novel set in the LA music scene of the 1970s - but she says she always wanted to direct and write as well.<br/>\"With acting, I just got really lucky,\" she says. \"I booked my first audition and that lit a fire under me to continue. But had I had the opportunity, at the age of 18, to direct, maybe it would have gone in a different direction.<br/>\"I love writing too,\" she adds. \"I'll write for anyone who would have me if they don't have deadlines. I'm a bit of a stream of consciousness kind of gal.\"<br/>War Pony started during a break in filming 2016's American Honey, an independent film by British director Andrea Arnold which Keough starred in. While shooting in South Dakota, she met two extras in the movie, Bill Reddy and Franklin Sioux Bob. <br/>Keough and Gammell later went on to visit them at their home on the Pine Ridge Reservation, and a friendship developed, before the idea of making a film. Reddy and Sioux Bob are credited as co-writers, and the narrative of War Pony is based upon their life experiences. <br/>\"They are the storytellers here, and Riley and I are, I think are the vessels that help them capture the story. But it's very much their story,\" Gammell says.<br/>Franklin Sioux Bob believes that unlike other creative projects suggested to Native Americans living on Pine Ridge Reservation, he believed this one was authentic.<br/>\"A lot of things go through our reservation, just like this scenario, and it's mainly one-sided. They came, they saw, they exploited it, they left, and this wasn't the case.  People will go, and the difference is Riley and Gina came back, they gave us their word and they consistently came back. These are my two friends, it's not just a work relationship,\" he explains.<br/>\"Native Americans are starting to become trendy in film, but this is different too because even when we started this film years ago, we had no idea it would ever even come to this point.\"<br/>War Pony openly shows the poverty and lack of opportunity many people living on a reservation experience, which Keough condemns as a result of \"the indigenous people of our country having to live like a capitalist\".<br/>\"They have to live in non-traditional ways in order to fit into their own country,\" she says.<br/>\"One of the things Gina and I admired most about these boys is how creative they have to be. There's not much job opportunity, they have to be creative and hustle and come up with new ideas, just to survive. Then there's just their resilience and ability to live this way that's also very traumatic and chaotic.<br/>\"You don't get this in school in America, unless you're raised in an area that's in close proximity to a reservation, but you don't really know where indigenous people are in the country, what their life looks like. It's so far removed. And isolated, on purpose.\"<br/>\"It's the broken ideals of that 'American Dream' that I think affects them profoundly,\" Gammell adds.<br/>After War Pony, Keough says that she and Gammell want to direct together again, but she explains that \"nothing yet has totally grabbed us\". <br/>\"I think that for us, the standard War Pony set in terms of how much we care about who we collaborate with, it needs to grab us in the same way emotionally.

After I got off the show, I couldn't go home, because there were people sitting outside my house,\" she said, alleging that she had not been offered security or assistance after being besieged by fans and photographers.<br/>However, Fremantle Television, which produced the show, said participants were provided with a choice of independent legal advisors, as well as a dedicated welfare officer and aftercare support.<br/>The contracts Ferguson mentions were not made with X Factor itself, but with external companies she worked with at the start of her career.<br/>Ferguson, who said her time on X Factor \"amounts to servitude\", stressed that she still felt \"traumatised\" by the experience.<br/>\"A lot of people are like, 'Oh why is she still going on about it?' But what they're not realizing is the aftermath.<br/>\"You just want that acknowledgement of this is real, this happened to you and we are sorry. I don't want money, I just want them to acknowledge what happened.\"<br/>X Factor was produced by Simon Cowell's production company Syco and Freemantle TV and broadcast on ITV."}]
