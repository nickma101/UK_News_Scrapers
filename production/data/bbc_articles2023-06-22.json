It is thought that, if the vessel is still intact, it may have just a few hours of oxygen remaining, creating a race against time to find the sub before it is too late.<br/>However, that timeline is not necessarily rigid. Dr Ken LeDez, a hyperbaric medicine expert at Memorial University in St John's, Newfoundland, has told BBC News that, depending on conditions, some of those aboard could survive longer than expected. <br/>\"It depends on how cold they get and how effective they are at conserving oxygen,\" he said, adding that shivering will use up a lot of oxygen, while wrapping up in a huddle can help to conserve heat. <br/>He said running out of oxygen is a gradual process. \"It's not like switching off a light, it's like climbing a mountain - as the temperature gets colder and metabolism falls [it depends] how fast you ascend that mountain,\" he said. <br/>While admitting that we do not know the full situation inside the submersible, Dr LeDez said conditions could be different person-to-person, and that although it is a \"disturbing conversation\", some could survive longer than others. <br/>On Wednesday, Rear Admiral John Mauger from the US Coast Guard said there were a number of unknowns in the search and rescue mission. <br/>\"We do not know the rate of consumption of oxygen per occupant on the sub,\" Rear Adm Mauger told the BBC. <br/>Dr LeDez also said that running out of oxygen is not the only danger those on board face. <br/>The vessel may have lost electrical power, which is likely to have a role in controlling the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide inside the vessel. <br/>As the oxygen level falls, the proportion of carbon dioxide being breathed out by the crew will be rising, with potentially fatal consequences. <br/>\"As levels of carbon dioxide build up, then it becomes sedative, it becomes like an anaesthetic gas, and you will go to sleep.\"<br/>Too much of the gas in a person's bloodstream, known as hypercapnia, can kill them if not treated. <br/>Former Royal Navy submarine captain Ryan Ramsey says he looked at videos online of the inside of Titan and could not see a carbon dioxide removal system, known as scrubbers.<br/>\"That for me is the greatest problem of all of them,\" he says.<br/>At the same time, the crew are at risk from hypothermia, where the body gets too cold.<br/>According to Capt Ramsey, if the sub is on the seabed, the water temperature will be about 0C. If it has also lost electricity, it will not be generating any power and therefore cannot generate heat. <br/>But hypothermia \"could be their friend\", said Dr LeDez.<br/>\"There is a possibility if they cool down enough and lose consciousness they could live through it - rescuers know this,\" he said, adding that the body will automatically try to adapt to survive.<br/>However on the flip side, hypothermia, the lack of oxygen and the build-up of carbon dioxide within the sub mean the crew's ability to make contact with the search and rescue mission, such as by banging on the hull at regular intervals to try and attract attention, will dwindle. <br/>\"If they're unconscious, they're not going to be able to do much to help themselves,\" says Dr LeDez.<br/>While the Coast Guard has warned there is probably little oxygen left, the crew may be able to conserve their supplies - at least for a while. <br/>Mr Ramsey says slowing their breathing would also help but admits this could be difficult considering the stress they would be under. <br/>Dr LeDez says they could also spread out carbon dioxide-absorbing granules or reduce their power use if they still have electricity.<br/>In terms of food and water, the Coast Guard said the crew had some \"limited rations\" on board but couldn't say how much.<br/>Despite all these challenges, Dr LeDez urges against cancelling the search-and-rescue operation too soon, saying they might be able to survive even when oxygen levels are very low. <br/>\"If anybody can survive in it, you know, it's these individuals,\" he says. \"It just depends on them having power and depends on them having light to be able to find things and make these controls, but absolutely, they could still be alive.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Oliver Slow.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Experts had warned about safety of missing sub<br/>Sub rescuers expand search area as oxygen fears mount<br/>Sounds a glimmer of hope in sub search - but what next?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That was met with surprise by analysts who had expected it to fall.<br/>The shock figure was driven by higher prices for flights and second-hand cars but supermarket food prices also continued to rise rapidly.<br/>So-called \"core\" inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as direct energy and food prices, along with alcohol and tobacco prices, continued to rise last month at its fastest rate for 31 years.<br/>Economists said this made the UK stand out from other countries such as the US and Germany where inflation is falling.<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared to back further interest rate rises saying it would not \"hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy\".<br/>The government's target is to halve the inflation rate to 5% by the end of the year. The official, long-term target set for the Bank is 2%.<br/>Rob Morgan, from investment firm Charles Stanley, said: \"Getting the inflation genie back into the bottle is proving troublesome for the Bank of England.<br/>\"With price momentum continually running above expectations alongside strong wages data, the Bank has no choice but to continue on a path of raising interest rates several more times.\"<br/>When interest rates rise, a range of loans can get more expensive. More than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate mortgage deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments. <br/>The increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.<br/>This comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.<br/>If the rate goes up to 5%, those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a347 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a330 jump.<br/>Eight out of 10 mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage. Their monthly payments may not change immediately, but house buyers or anyone seeking to remortgage face a sharp rise in repayments when they move on to a new deal. <br/>The so-called \"mortgage bomb\" has become a huge economic and political issue. An average two-year fixed deal, which was 2.29% in November 2021, is now above 6%.<br/>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a politically independent economics-focused think tank, says rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable incomes fall by more than 20%.<br/>Renters are also feeling the impact. \"It is likely that at least part of the increases in rents we are seeing is due to high interest rates hitting landlords' borrowing costs,\" the IFS said.<br/>Rents have been growing faster than wages in the UK for nearly two years, according to exclusive data given to the BBC by property portal Zoopla. <br/>Meanwhile, savers should benefit from a rise in interest rates, but MPs on the Treasury Committee have criticised banks and building societies for failing to pass this on in full to loyal savers who have instant-access savings accounts.<br/>How are interest rate rises affecting you?

with death rates below historical averages. <br/>In the third year, death rates rose in many countries as they opened up again.<br/>Some of the largest rebounds we found were in countries like Germany, New Zealand and Norway, who had fared better in the first two years of the pandemic (and well overall). <br/>Norway had far fewer deaths than Sweden in the first year of the pandemic but over the three years the two countries look more similar. <br/>It is hard to read straight across from Scandinavian countries to the UK, cautions Prof Sridhar, arguing \"we'd never look like either Sweden or Norway\", and describing them as \"healthier, wealthier and more equal\" countries that are very different to the UK.  <br/>It would take many inquiries to tease apart the effect of all the possible reasons behind every nation's pandemic outcomes: preparedness, population health, lockdown timing and severity, social support, vaccine rollout and health care provision and others. <br/>But some argue that there are lessons for the UK that need to be learned even before we think about future pandemics. <br/>The UK's heavy pandemic death toll \"built on a decade of lacklustre performance on life expectancy\" says Veena Raleigh, of the King's Fund, a health think tank. She argues that government action to improve population health and turn that around has \"never been more urgent\".<br/>We collected data on deaths in five-year age groups and population estimates/projections from Eurostat, the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland, the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency, the Centre for Disease Control, United States Census Bureau and Stats NZ. <br/>We calculated the death rate in each age group and combined them to form an age-adjusted death rate using the 2013 European Standard Population. <br/>Some nations did not have the full set of age bands. For example, US figures used 10-year age bands between five and 24 and above 55. Broader age bands can exaggerate excess mortality figures like the ones we calculated, in the order of a percentage point.<br/>Additional journalism by Callum Thomson, Isabella Worth, Jana Tauschinski, Liana Bravo and Wesley Stephenson <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But 60 years later, I'm still here!\"<br/>For others, the day has also brought up a lot of memories of when they first arrived here.<br/>Joycelyn Styles, who arrived in 1962 aged 12, vividly remembered what a shock the climate was and says she has still not quite got used to it.<br/>\"It was cold and miserable then and it's cold and miserable now,\" she laughed, tongue in cheek. <br/>But while there was a lot of light for this generation, there has also been shade. <br/>Ms Grandison told me of one of her earliest experiences of discrimination in this country, which is still vivid in her mind.<br/>\"Before I did nursing, I applied for a job in the West End - not knowing anything about racism, because of course we came from the mother country,\" she said.<br/>\"My [maiden] name was 'Brookes'. I applied for the job, I went for the interview, and the lady put me in a room and she never came back to me. I sat there for about six hours, and then the shop was closing, and I left.<br/>\"Because my name was 'Brookes', they thought when I applied that I was an English person.\"<br/>Inequality has been pervasive for this generation - not just in those early years, but also in recent ones. <br/>In the last five years, the name \"Windrush\" has become synonymous with injustice. The Windrush scandal affected thousands of people from former British colonies who moved to the UK before immigration laws changed in 1971. <br/>They were given the permanent right to live and work in the UK, but not the documentation to prove this. <br/>This meant they were later denied employment, housing and benefits  to which they were entitled. Many were also deported.<br/>Johnny Samuels, from Coventry, came to the UK in 1964, aged eight. <br/>After an injury left him out of work in 2008, he was told he could not claim benefits. <br/>Mr Samuels was also threatened with deportation, and detained three times while trying to return to the UK from trips abroad. <br/>\"To tell you the truth, I had a breakdown,\" he said. \"The pain is still there - even though I've received my passport, after more than 55 years.\" <br/>In a statement, the Home Office told BBC News that that it has \"paid or offered more than \u00a375m in compensation\" to victims.<br/>\"We know there is more to do, and will work tirelessly to make sure such an injustice is never repeated,\" it added. <br/>For Mr Samuels, the anniversary is tainted by his experience.<br/>\"I have very much mixed feelings, because for one, it took so many years for some recognition of some sort - it's not there yet - of what the Windrush generation did, and are still doing to date, <br/>\"And also of the negative things that we met, like [signs reading] 'No Irish, No Dogs, No Blacks'.

That's a job I'd like. But I'm also loving the job I do now.\"<br/>Despite his obvious enthusiasm to succeed Mr Stoltenberg as the next head of Nato, he appears to have failed to get the backing of key allies.<br/>US President Joe Biden described Mr Wallace as \"very qualified\" for the job when he met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Washington recently.<br/>But in private, the US is believed to be one of the nations trying to persuade Mr Stoltenberg to stay - at least for another year. This was echoed by Mr Wallace in comments to The Economist.<br/>The war in Ukraine has re-focused diplomatic attention on Nato's role in the 21st century and whether it can deter Russian aggression. <br/>Mr Wallace proved popular with a number of countries on the alliance's eastern flank because of his leadership in supplying weapons to Ukraine. <br/>But others have argued for continuity in a time of war, or that the job should be reserved for a former head of government. <br/>Mr Stoltenberg, who has been the alliance's top boss for nine years, has neither confirmed or denied his intentions to continue in the job.<br/>He told reporters last week: \"I am responsible for all decisions that this alliance has to take except for one. And that is about my future. That is for the 31 allies to decide.\"<br/>Another contender for the role is Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who - if elected - would be the first female Nato chief.<br/>In his interview with the Economist, Mr Wallace said whoever takes on the role would need to deal with \"a lot of unresolved issues in Nato,\" including differing demands from US and French leadership.<br/>France believes Nato's secretary general should come from within the European Union. <br/>With less than a month to go until the Nato summit in Lithuania, it looks increasingly likely that Mr Stoltenberg will be asked to extend his tenure again.<br/>Nato was formed in 1949 by 12 countries and its original goal was to challenge Soviet expansion in Europe after World War Two. <br/>More recently, Russia has used the expansion of Nato as a pretext for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv is not a member, but has received support from alliance members.<br/>On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was disappointed his country had not been invited to join Nato at next month's summit in Vilnius, adding that Ukraine would be the strongest member of Nato's eastern flank.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ben Wallace: We need to invest in defence properly<br/>Orban casts doubt on Nato's Ukraine membership plan<br/>What is Nato and why is Finland joining?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And it was more than a decade before she would stand outside the US Supreme Court to announce to her triumphant supporters that the nationwide right to abortion had been undone. <br/>But back then, in 2008, the SFLA headquarters were in Arlington, Virginia, and the closest town where Hawkins and her husband could afford to buy a house was 90 minutes away.<br/>At first, she tried the commute, leaving home at 5am and returning at 8pm. But the drives became too much, gas too expensive. <br/>So she bought a cheap loveseat from Ikea, figuring she could put in 30 hours of work over two days before driving home for a night. She used a nearby Gold's Gym for showers, the new couch for naps. When Hawkins found the office was also inhabited by cockroaches, she bought an eye mask and started sleeping with the lights on to keep them away. <br/>\"It was terrible, terrible,\" her husband Jonathan said of that period, which was just two years into their marriage.<br/>But Kristan Hawkins was relentless. And she had a job to do, she was going to see the end of Roe v Wade, overturning the national right to abortion that had been protected for nearly half a century.<br/>Last June, she was successful. Pro-choice advocates say that her activism since then has already helped cut off abortion access for around 20 million women, and pushed the country into a public health crisis. <br/>But Hawkins has a new, more ambitious goal: she wants to make abortion unthinkable and unavailable across the US. <br/>In the year after Roe was overturned, Hawkins has gone into overdrive, growing the size and reach of SFLA and using that power to push state legislatures to pass increasingly severe bans.<br/>\"That's the momentum thing, right? Like, ok, all of America is watching, push the gas pedal down on everything, right now,\" she said. \"More, more, more, more, more.\" <br/>Hawkins, now 38, is bolder and more unyielding than her predecessors, reflective of a new generation of activists moving towards their ultimate goal: a federal abortion ban, beginning at conception. <br/>\"She's representative of the rightward shift in the movement\u2026 and how far the movement can go,\" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a leading expert on the US abortion debate. \"Kristan is really important to understanding what comes next.\"<br/>Hawkins' plans are at odds with public opinion - a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion - and even some Republicans say she is going too far, too fast. <br/>But Roe's reversal, too, was once considered a longshot. And now, one year after its demise, Hawkins believes she will lead the anti-abortion movement to another improbable win. <br/>Most anti-abortion advocates have an origin story, a moment they say set them on a pro-life mission. <br/>Kristan Hawkins' moment came when she was 15. At home in West Virginia, she started volunteering at a crisis pregnancy centre, the type of facility that dissuades women from having abortions by providing pro-life counselling, ultrasounds and material supplies like diapers and wipes.<br/>Before she was allowed to start work, Hawkins had to learn what abortion was, to understand what it looked like. Someone at the clinic gave her a VHS tape of the Silent Scream, a controversial 1984 anti-abortion propaganda film that purported to show a foetus on ultrasound experiencing distress during an abortion at 12 weeks. The film, denounced as a fraud by abortion rights activists, runs counter to findings from leading scientists who say a foetus does not have the capacity to feel pain until at least 24 weeks gestation.<br/>But Hawkins was horrified. She was also incredulous. In her view, she had just encountered the greatest human rights atrocity of our time: the routine killing of \"preborn babies\" - the term she uses to describe foetuses. So why wasn't everyone trying to stop it?<br/>\"I remember that first day at the pregnancy centre, walking out and saying 'Oh my God, how is life going on as normal when this is happening?'\" she said during an interview in May. \"That changed everything.\" <br/>After a summer at the clinic, Hawkins started a community anti-abortion group called Teens for Life. She joined the local Right to Life chapter, she joined the local Republican chapter. \"I was the youngest one there by like four decades,\" she said. <br/>By 2006, after college graduation and short stints at the Republican National Committee and the Department of Health and Human Services, Hawkins was recruited to run Students for Life, then a fledgling organisation with groups on 180 campuses. She was 21. <br/>Seventeen years later, Hawkins remains obsessive, prone to sending colleagues texts and emails at all hours. Her daily schedule, typed into her iPhone, is a nightmare, more than two dozen meetings and commitments blocked off in overlapping intervals. Her days are, occasionally, interrupted by calls from a health coach. \"They're trying to get me to drink water,\" she said. \"I always joke that Students for Life is built on Diet Mountain Dew.\"<br/>She and Jonathan live in an RV with their four children so the entire family can join her on her frequent SFLA excursions. Jonathan, a former teacher, provides homeschooling.<br/>\"I just go with the flow, that's all you can do,\" Jonathan said during a family outing at the Pittsburgh Zoo last month. <br/>\"I think you're sick of the word abortion,\" Kristan said to him later that day. \"When I say it sometimes, I swear I can see you twitch.\"<br/>Watching her with followers and donors, Hawkins is sarcastic and often turns to humour, a sometimes unexpected habit from a woman pushing to outlaw abortion entirely. She also swears a lot and fidgets when she talks. She doesn't have friends, she said, \"in the traditional sense\". <br/>\"Like, I don't have girlfriends I go for brunch with\u2026 what would I talk about besides ending abortion?\" <br/>Hawkins' mission, born that day at the pregnancy centre, has proven to be all consuming, something she is well aware of. She has tried to teach her team the principle of DBW - Don't Be Weird - which is code for: don't freak people out.<br/>\"You have to know when to display your passion,\" she said. \"If you carry around a pocketbook of graphic images of children who've been aborted and whip that out at the dinner table, some people are going to be pretty mad at you.\" <br/>On a swampy June day in Washington, between clusters of teenagers on school trips and tour groups in matching t-shirts, six Students for Life members made their way to Capitol Hill, ready to lobby. <br/>They all wore red, half in SFLA branded clothing - \"The Pro-Life Generation VOTES\" emblazoned on their chests like a cheery warning. One wore a pair of dangly earrings, tiny gold feet meant to match the size of a foetus's foot at 12 weeks. \"It's a picture into their humanity,\" she said. <br/>Groups like this can be found at state legislatures and on college campuses across the US on any given week. Under Hawkins, SFLA has grown into more than 1,400 campus groups in 50 states, overseen by 80 paid staff. Since 2006, more than 160,000 anti-abortion activists have completed SFLA training. Experts say Hawkins' particular power lies in her ability to get people to turn out - SFLA activists are now staples at anti-abortion demonstrations across the country. <br/>\"We launched SFLA to be this post-Roe generation,\" she said. \"We were going to have that trained army.\" <br/>And after Roe's reversal last year, that army has mobilised, helping to steer dozens of anti-abortion bills through state legislatures. So far, 13 Republican-controlled states have outlawed abortion. Bans in at least six other states are in limbo pending legal challenges. <br/>Nearly one-third of American women of reproductive age now live in states where abortion is unavailable or severely restricted, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group. Over the past year, stories have emerged about the apparent consequences of these bans - a 10-year-old rape victim denied an abortion in her home state of Ohio, 13 women in Texas who say they were denied abortions despite life-threatening pregnancy complications - further galvanising support for abortion access.<br/>\"What SFLA and other anti-abortion groups promote is the worst, most damaging, most criminalising policy,\" said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice-president at NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"She [Kristan] is the embodiment of the extremeness of the movement.\" <br/>\"You're making it unsafe to be pregnant in the United States,\" she said. <br/>But where the anti-abortion movement goes now that Roe has been overturned is a matter of debate.  <br/>Hawkins and most other leaders still share a unifying philosophy: a foetus is a rights-holding person. They share an objective too: a federal abortion ban. But there is disagreement on what that ban would look like and how, exactly, to get there.<br/>\"The movement is really fragmented,\" said University of California's Mary Ziegler. \"There is no consensus.\" <br/>SFLA has pushed what they call an \"early abortion model\", drafting and championing legislation that bans abortion at conception or, at the latest, after early cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy. <br/>Hawkins' organisation, in other words, has abandoned the incrementalism that shaped earlier iterations of the anti-abortion movement, a strategy still favoured by some of SFLA's peers. <br/>Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America (SBA) is one such group. A powerful and long-established presence in the anti-abortion lobby, SBA's leader Marjorie Dannenfelser has said she will oppose any presidential candidate who does not embrace a 15-week national ban, a benchmark supported by 44% of Americans, according to a recent poll.<br/>That isn't good enough for Hawkins. Candidates must pledge support for a federal ban at six weeks if they want SFLA's support. <br/>It's a tension Hawkins acknowledges. \"Marjorie is the insider\u2026and I'm the person who comes in and is like, '[Screw] it, we're just doing what we know is right',\" Hawkins said, using an expletive. \"We're not fighting.\"<br/>Hawkins is also more outspoken, more outwardly conservative, on other abortion-related issues. She opposes exceptions for rape and incest. And she opposes several forms of birth control, including oral contraceptives, a position another anti-abortion leader privately called \"unhelpful\". <br/>\"What has changed is they are willing to say the quiet part out loud,\" said Elisabeth Smith, state policy director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a pro-choice group. \"They are willing to be publicly extreme.\" <br/>Hawkins' uncompromising approach worries some Republicans, too. Politicians have been forced to choose between disappointing Hawkins and her allies and alienating a much more moderate electorate. <br/>\"Republicans are politically in a much more defensive position than the Democrats because they keep talking about restrictions that are not supported by most Americans,\" said John Feehery, a former Republican congressional aide. <br/>A predicted red wave at the 2022 midterms seemed to collide with a surge of support for abortion rights, carrying Democrats to unexpected victories in a series of high-profile races. Last year, pro-choice voters swept all six abortion-related ballot measures, including in conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky. <br/>\"Women are watching Republicans post-Roe, and anything short of a compassionate strategy to win back suburban women and swing voters will severely set back the pro-life movement and the party as a whole,\" Nancy Mace, one of the few House Republicans who has publicly called for more flexibility on abortion, told the BBC in a statement. <br/>But Hawkins does not see the Republican party as her problem. She has little patience for politicians she deems insufficiently pro-life, threatening primary challenges against Republicans who do not support early bans. <br/>Merv Riepe, a Nebraska state senator who voted against a six-week ban this year, \"is going to be retired pretty soon\", Hawkins said. <br/>The three female Republican senators in South Carolina who opposed an outright ban face the same threat. Two supported a six-week ban, but that was not sufficient for Hawkins. Each of them was sent a plastic infant-size spine from SFLA earlier this year, with a note suggesting they grow a backbone.<br/>\"I think that's the difference between us and other pro-life organisations,\" Hawkins said. \"I don't really care if so-and-so in Washington, DC, isn't happy with me. It doesn't even earn me any points in my demographic.\"<br/>That approach - aggressive, uncompromising - has fuelled her dominance among anti-abortion activists, now lurching to the right in the absence of Roe. <br/>\"The movement as a whole is moving towards asking for more extreme bans,\" said Zelly Martin, a researcher at University of Texas' propaganda lab, who specialises in the US abortion debate. \"They feel like now that we don't have Roe protecting abortion why would we pull back? And I think Kristan Hawkins is a big part of that.\"  <br/>Just how far Hawkins will get - how close to abolishing abortion she will come - remains an open question. <br/>\"I don't see a point in American history where Americans are going to want an absolute ban on abortion,\" Ziegler said. \"There is no sign of that.\"<br/>But Hawkins and others are exploring ways to bypass both public opinion and political resistance, Zieger said. One, perhaps the most feasible, would be to ask the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to recognise foetal personhood under the Constitution. <br/>It seems improbable, but those are odds Hawkins is used to. <br/>Last month, in Northville, Michigan, Hawkins stood in a small first-floor conference room, neat rows of potential donors sitting in front of her. She began her speech with an anecdote from early in her career. <br/>A pro-life mentor had offered Hawkins some unsolicited advice: stop saying \"when\" Roe v Wade is overturned. By assuming Roe's demise, he cautioned, she sounded \"too immature, too naive\". <br/>Hawkins ignored him. She told her staff to double down, boost their messaging that promised to send Roe to the \"ash heap of history\". <br/>\"I always tell our team: winners envision the win.\" <br/>Thousands gather for first post-Roe March for Life<br/>How abortion became 'winning issue' in US election<br/>US Supreme Court preserves abortion drug access<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The dam acted as a flood defence to places downstream, mainly to the south and south-west.<br/>BBC Verify monitored the four canal entrances using satellite imagery, and by 15 June, all had become disconnected as the reservoir water level kept dropping.<br/>Further images reveal the reservoir, which previously held 18 cubic kilometres of water, had dried up significantly.<br/>Shallower parts of the reservoir were exposed first, revealing some of the original shape of the Dnipro River prior to the dam's construction in 1956.<br/>Images show the canals still contain water further away from the reservoir. It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry.<br/>Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (584,000 hectares) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government.<br/>Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security.<br/>\"[The canals] primarily irrigate summer planted crops\u2026 like corn, soy beans, some sunflower. But they also irrigate some wheat, which is a winter crop, and then a lot of vegetables and fruit like melons,\" she said. <br/>While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water.<br/>Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become.<br/>Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator for the UN, previously told the BBC there would be a \"huge impact on global food security\" as a result of the destruction of the dam, describing the area as \"a breadbasket not only for Ukraine but also for the world\".<br/>Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries, which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain.<br/>Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area.<br/>\"Now the water level has dropped, the water simply does not reach the [canal] systems. To raise it, we need to rebuild the dam,\" according to Mykola Solskyi, Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.<br/>Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels.<br/>\"There's now a whole downstream catchment of the river that is not controlled,\" said Jaap Flikweert, a flood and coastal management advisor at engineering consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV. \"In the wetter periods flood waves will just come through.\"<br/>Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level.<br/>\"I expect those tens of thousands of people who were evacuated will have to stay away for a while as long as those solutions are not in place.

The Financial Times warns that \"stubborn inflation\" is piling pressure on the Bank of England to take \"tough action\" on interest rates.<br/>According to the paper, some economists have said that yesterday's data was \"so dire\" that the Bank \"might surprise\" with an interest rate rise of half a percentage point to 5% today, or signal a larger move at its next Monetary Policy Committee meeting in August. <br/>The Daily Mail says senior Conservatives and economists have turned on the Bank of England over what it calls the \"rates crisis\" and the paper says the Monetary Policy Committee is preparing to \"heap more misery on homeowners\". <br/>It reports that Rishi Sunak's pledge to halve inflation this year is now in jeopardy and government sources have admitted that the ambition to cut taxes this autumn are also at risk.<br/>The Times says that while Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly given his full backing to the Bank, economists advising him are now questioning whether it has failed in its response, by under-estimating inflationary pressures. The paper sums up the situation with the headline: \"Triggering recession could tame inflation\". <br/>The i warns that \"mortgage pain\" will deepen, as an expected 13th rate rise in a row sparks recession fears. Brokers tell the paper that \"panicked\" borrowers are pleading for help, as experts say the base rate may now hit 6 percent next year. <br/>According to the Daily Telegraph, a recession is \"inevitable\", owing to the Bank of England's failure to control what the paper calls \"rampant inflation\". A founding member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Charles Goodhart, says the Bank's inflation challenge is a \"nasty dilemma\". <br/>The mission to save five men on board the Titanic tourist sub is also on the front pages. \"Rescue robot is the last chance of survival,\" says the Daily Express. The Sun talks of prayers being said for a \"Titanic miracle\". <br/>The Daily Mirror highlights the banging sounds that have been detected from beneath the sea. \"Holding on to hope,\" says the paper's headline.<br/>The Guardian leads on a report that security guards at a Del Monte pineapple farm in Kenya - which supplies British supermarkets - have been accused of assaulting and killing people suspected of trespassing to steal fruit. Del Monte tells the Guardian that it takes the allegations very seriously and has launched a \"full and urgent\" investigation. <br/>Anyone who has ever smoked could be offered an NHS lung cancer test, from middle age, according to the Daily Telegraph. It says the government is understood to be in talks about funding a rollout of scanning units to boost survival rates. The paper reports that results from pilot schemes have found that such checks could spot three quarters of cases of lung cancer at an early stage.   <br/>And several papers carry special reports to mark 75 years since the arrival of the first people from the Caribbean to help Britain after the war.

But you can't do that when interest rates go up to deal with inflation,\" one minister said to me.<br/>And, ministers add, both privately in candid terms and publicly rather more carefully, it would be counterproductive anyway: it wouldn't help squash inflation.<br/>In other words, what a bind.<br/>All of which has been tempting me into the archive.<br/>Let me take you to Northampton, in October 1989. It's for a speech by the chancellor at the time, John Major.<br/>You can easily imagine some of his words then being used by Jeremy Hunt, the current chancellor, now.<br/>\"The problem is inflation. I have no doubt that the central task before us is the reduction and the elimination of rising prices. Not only does this objective remain the same, but so do the policies needed to achieve it,\" Sir John said, in what was his first speech as chancellor.<br/>But he was also rather more blunt than today's generation of politicians are usually willing to be.<br/>He also said: \"I understand the difficulties that many face with high interest and mortgage rates. But they - and the resulting slowing of the economy that we must see - are the means by which we will cure the problem. They are not the problem.\"<br/>And he added: \"So inflation must go. Ending it cannot be painless. The harsh truth is that if the policy isn't hurting, it isn't working.\"<br/>Sir John spoke then, very candidly, about a timeless economic and political trade-off, between inflation and interest rates.<br/>Granted interest rates were then under the direct control of the government. They are now decided by the independent Bank of England, which is tasked with keeping to an inflation target set by the government.<br/>But the trade-offs remain and privately, ministers acknowledge that. And if interest rates go too high, the risk is a recession, a year or so out from a general election.<br/>One minister told me that interest rates had been close to zero for so long that people had collectively forgotten that that couldn't possibly last forever.<br/>Another added that it was about time that savers could get some returns on their savings, even if, for now at least, those returns remain below inflation.<br/>Plenty I speak to in government privately are exasperated by what they see as a knee-jerk instinct for government intervention, including from some on their own side.<br/>But politicians can never be blind to the public mood - and the realities of economic pain.<br/>The chancellor will meet mortgage providers later this week and we can expect to hear from the prime minister on all this again too.<br/>Labour has set out its approach. The Liberal Democrats want a Mortgage Protection Fund to help homeowners on the lowest incomes. <br/>Oh and one final thought: Rising interest rates have an impact too on the biggest borrower of all: this government, and its successors.<br/>That rising cost of borrowing will affect millions of households.

Inflation isn't just stubborn, or sticky. It is, on the latest numbers, stuck. These figures should be falling by now, and they are in other countries such as the US and Germany.  <br/>My inbox was deluged with instant takes at 7am ranging from \"unfortunate\" to \"challenging\" to \"disaster\".<br/>Over the past 18 months the Governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC workers should not ask for excessive pay rises and companies should not hike prices too much either. <br/>Core inflation, a measure of underlying and ongoing inflationary pressure that strips out month to month volatility, is, however, going up, even as it is in decline elsewhere in other major economies. The polite requests have not worked.<br/>The response of Karen Ward, a respected City economist who serves on the chancellor's council of advisers that the Bank of England \"has to create a recession\" partly to \"nip in the bud\" a spiral of wages going up and in turn pushing up prices, and then pushing up wages again.<br/>\"It's only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think 'Well, maybe I won't put through that price rise', or workers, when they're a little bit less confident about their job, think 'Oh, I won't push my boss for that higher pay,'\" she told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>She said out loud what the Treasury cannot say out loud but has implied in repeated interviews - people have to feel the pain for interest rate rises to work. The Chancellor again said he would support the Bank of England in its decisions - making clear his support for further rate rises. But any hope of a controlled economic descent with plenty of distance ahead of an election late next year, now looks fraught.<br/>But it is not just about the specific decision on Thursday, but about the path of interest rates for the next two years. The markets are pretty openly questioning whether the Bank is in full command over where inflation is going. Financial markets and banks are effectively pushing up fixed term mortgage rates, without waiting for actual Bank of England decisions.<br/>But the unflattering international comparison also shows a limit to how much the government can blame everything on \"global factors\". Continental Europe was particularly hit by surging energy prices in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, the rest of the world by food prices, and the US by a worker shortages. The UK still suffers from a cocktail of all three.<br/>And the government's own post Brexit policies on trade and workers may have lessened competitive pressures that would in the past have brought inflation down more rapidly.<br/>Wednesday's number shows that the already tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.

In this war, would the Kremlin go nuclear?<br/>President Joe Biden isn't ruling it out.<br/>\"I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons,\" the US president said this week. He believes the danger is \"real\".<br/>I don't know whether President Biden reads the Russian magazine Profile. If he does, you can understand why he's worried. <br/>Last week, Profile published an article by prominent Russian foreign and defence policy expert Sergei Karaganov. The hawkish Mr Karaganov is honorary chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy. In short, he's well-connected to those in power here.<br/>His argument goes like this. In order to \"break the West's will\", Russia \"will have to make nuclear deterrence a convincing argument again by lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons\".<br/>\"The enemy must know that we are ready to deliver a pre-emptive strike in retaliation for all of its current and past acts of aggression in order to prevent a slide into global thermonuclear war.<br/>\"But what if they do not back down? In this case, we will have to hit a bunch of targets in a number of countries in order to bring those who have lost their mind to reason.\"<br/>Since last year, we've grown used to nuclear sabre-rattling from Moscow. <br/>And President Putin has confirmed that Russia has already stationed a first batch of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, a move the Russian leader says is designed to remind anyone \"thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat on us\".<br/>But arguing the pluses of a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the West? That's a whole new level.<br/>Clearly, not everyone in Russia is on board with such an idea.<br/>Today's edition of the business daily Kommersant features an article entitled \"Nuclear War is a bad way of resolving problems\".<br/>Understatement of all time, maybe. But what's fascinating about this piece is that it suggests the debate in Russia about when or whether to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine has burst into the public domain. And the hawks don't have it all their way. <br/>Penned by another group of Moscow-based foreign and defence policy experts, the Kommersant article explains why they believe Sergei Karaganov has got it wrong. Dangerously wrong. <br/>\"The idea that the use of nuclear weapons can halt escalation and resolve strategic problems that conventional military means have failed to is extremely dubious and, most likely, mistaken,\" write Alexei Arbatov, Konstantin Bogdanov and Dmitry Stefanovich from the Centre for International Security - part of a think tank within the Russian Academy of Science. <br/>\"In modern history, there are many examples of military operations leading to unforeseen consequences. But these were without nuclear weapons being used. A nuclear strike would raise the conflict to a whole new level of unpredictability and raise the stakes of confrontation many times over.<br/>\"The radioactive ruins that playing 'nuclear roulette' would most likely lead to are the worst foundation for a bright future. Fans of sensationalist ideas and dangerous gambling would be best to remember that.\"<br/>Which brings us to another question we've been asking since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine: what on Earth is going on? <br/>It's possible that Mr Karaganov's proposal for a pre-emptive nuclear strike was so shocking that other Russian academics felt they just couldn't stay silent.<br/>If so, it shows that although the Russian media landscape is now heavily controlled by the state, even within current confines, there is still room on some platforms for limited debate and discussion on certain topics. Especially such crucial topics as nuclear war.<br/>Or it may be that this whole debate is designed to grab the West's attention, to make President Putin look like good cop to Mr Karaganov's bad cop. <br/>After all, the Kremlin leader himself hasn't called for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the West. And so - the argument goes - better sit down and make peace with him, before hardliner Karaganovites win the day and press the nuclear button.<br/>One thing's clear: with anti-Western rhetoric in Russia rising, and with the Ukrainian army's counter-offensive under way, the nuclear question isn't going away. <br/>Putin confirms first nuclear weapons moved to Belarus<br/>Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?<br/>Zelensky admits slow progress in Ukraine offensive<br/>On the front line as Ukraine attacks Russian trenches<br/>Do Russians really hate the West?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I really don't want to have to sell it, I would feel terrible for the family, but where am I supposed to find that sort of money?\".<br/>Rachelle and her husband, who both work full-time, are also worried about the mortgage on their own home which comes up for renewal early next year.<br/>\"I have worked since I was 16 years old and we had got to a place where we could live comfortably and go on nice holidays but now I feel like we have gone back to worrying about every penny,\" she says.<br/>Richard, 61, from Cambridge, had to use all of his \u00a350,000 of savings to get the costs down when his fixed-rate mortgage ended last month.<br/>The IT worker is now on a tracker mortgage, which cost \u00a31,000 in fees to switch to.

I'm so far out of my comfort zone.\"<br/>An hour later, he was walking on air. The audience received him so enthusiastically that he played Islands In The Stream twice. <br/>He later declared the festival one of his \"top five experiences\".<br/>A variation of that scene happens at Glastonbury every year. A song unexpectedly takes flight, and the artist and audience meet in a magical space between excitement, euphoria and exhaustion.<br/>It's almost impossible to predict... but there's no harm in trying, so I sat down with BBC Radio 1's Arielle Free to identify this year's potential \"Glastonbury moments\".<br/>You can listen to playlists on Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube, and argue with us about the choices on social media (not really, for goodness sake, who has the time?)  <br/>Mark: Which of the headliners are you most excited about?<br/>Arielle: That's so hard. Arctic Monkeys are a band I literally grew up with and have loved since their MySpace days - but I feel like I have to say Elton John, because I might never get to see him live again. Plus I keep hearing lots of exciting rumours about special guests. I think he's going to go all out.<br/>Mark: He's already said it'll be a completely different set to his current tour, but he traditionally finishes with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and I think that'll be a hugely emotional moment, because this could be his last ever show in the UK. I can hear that \"ah-ah-ahhhh\" chorus ringing out across the fields long after he's left the stage.<br/>Arielle: I saw him at Bestival and he was on stage at 11am doing his own soundcheck. He cares about the performance more than anything else, so it can't fail to be emotional.<br/>Mark: Any guesses on the special guests?<br/>Arielle: Let's be honest, we're all hoping for a bit of Harry Styles, aren't we!<br/>Mark: You chose RU Mine as the Arctics' big song. Why that one?<br/>Arielle: If there's a song that epitomises why I love Arctic Monkeys. it's that one. It's high energy. It's sexy. If they kick off with that one, we're in.<br/>Mark: The Last Dinner Party have got a huge buzz around them. They were signed to Island Records with just one single and they're already supporting Florence + The Machine on tour. There's a definite sonic similarity there. They're first on the bill at the Woodsies stage on Saturday morning, but I think the tent will be rammed.<br/>Arielle: Thank you for putting them on the list because I hadn't heard of them. I was like, \"The Last Dinner Party? That sounds like a site-specific theatre group.\"<br/>Mark: To be honest, I think they might be. They look like Wednesday Addams dressed like the cast of Bridgerton. <br/>Arielle: On Saturday, I'm hosting the West Holts stage, which means I get to see Gabriels, who are my favourite band at the moment.<br/>Mark: I saw them on The Park stage last year when no-one really knew who they were, and it was like a religious service. People walked away converted, telling everyone they'd seen the best band of their lives.<br/>Arielle: They give me goosebumps. I've seen them five times, and Jacob [Lusk, frontman] is one of the most incredibly charismatic, engaging, overwhelming performers. And I'll tell you one thing: Gold Leopards.<br/>Mark: OK...<br/>Arielle: Gold leopards. That's all I'm allowed to say!<br/>Arielle: Lizzo's set is going to be one of those ones where everyone just throws their arms around each other and has fun.<br/>Mark: She's such a force of positivity.<br/>Arielle: I remember when Adele headlined. There was a grandma, her daughter and the granddaughter all singing Rolling In The Deep in unison at the top of their voices. I think this will be the same. <br/>Mark: We've chosen Good As Hell, but it could just have easily been Juice or About Damn Time or Special.<br/>Arielle: I remember when Lizzo played the West Holts stage in 2019, she said she'd had a 13-year gap between Glastonbury performances, because she first played in the unsigned artist's tent. And now, however many years later, she'll be on the main stage, she'll bring her flute, she'll bring her dancers. I get really emotional when I see artists achieve their dreams like that. I'll probably cry.<br/>Mark: We need to talk about Rick Astley on Saturday morning. I think people will come along just to hear Never Gonna Give You Up and, honestly, he could just play that on repeat for an hour and we'd all be happy. The crowd's going to go bananas.<br/>Arielle: Carly Rae Jepsen's the same. You can hear everyone singing Call Me Maybe already.<br/>Mark: I've told the BBC I'm not working for that hour she's on stage. I'm turning my phone off and diving into the mosh pit.  <br/>Arielle: She's massively underrated as a vocalist. I can't wait to hear her play I Really Like You.<br/>Mark: Thank you for choosing the Nia Archives track. What a song.<br/>Arielle: I've had it as my tune of the week on Radio 1 this week and it has divided the crowd. I don't know if people are really attached to the original by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, or the remix by A-Trak, but a lot of people have been, like, \"Don't ruin a classic\". Also, I'm on the radio from four 'till seven AM, so it might not be appropriate for that time of day.<br/>Mark: It's pretty loud.<br/>Arielle: She's doing her own stage at Glastonbury - Nia Archives Presents on Saturday night. That'll be amazing.<br/>Mark: I'm really interested in Fred Again. I'm not sure he's that well-known but he's second on the bill on The Other Stage.<br/>Arielle: Oh, I don't know. He's just headlined Coachella. He also headlined Parklife [in Manchester] recently, and apparently every other stage was empty. Even other huge DJs just felt the wrath of going up against Fred Again. He's so fast and technical. It's like watching a Formula One race for like an hour.<br/>Mark: I've got to ask about your single, Technicolor Kenny. It's a summer anthem that's been two years in the making...<br/>Arielle: It's been a long, long slog getting it over the line, but it's finally there. The short version of the story is I was on the way to my brother's wedding and the radio in our car was stuck on this yacht rock station. We heard I Believe In Love by Kenny Loggins three times - and I was like, \"That would make such a good dance track\". So I made an edit and sent it to Annie Mac, because she's my hero, just to get some feedback, and she played it on the radio without even telling me. And here we are!<br/>Arielle: When Guns N' Roses are on the Pyramid Stage, I'll be running to watch Loyle Carner headline West Holts. For him, it's going to be such a special moment.<br/>Mark: Did you see his show at Wembley this year? It was such a compelling and thoughtful show. His album [Hugo] is all about his relationship with his father, and how that developed over a series of driving lessons, and the staging really brought that story to life. He even had the car on stage... It was really moving.<br/>Arielle: I did see him last time he played West Holts, at about four in the afternoon. He brought on his mum, Jorja Smith, Ezra Collective. He's very loyal... Loyal Carner! He loves raising people up and his new track with Enny is so good. I really hope he brings her on stage. She's such an incredibly gifted rapper. <br/>Mark: That song has such a laid-back summer vibe. And as much as we've talked about singalongs and dancing, there's that flipside to Glastonbury where the sun's going down, and you lie back and let the music wash over you. I think Lana Del Rey will be the perfect antidote for people who've maybe gone a little too hard during the day.<br/>Arielle: Wizkid's Essence is such a summer tune. I've never seen him and I think he's going to be amazing.<br/>Mark: There was a great review of his US tour, where they said he's entered his \"rock star era\", full of \"shirtless serenades and rabid fans\". I'm almost more interested in seeing that than Arctic Monkeys, who are on at the same time.<br/>Arielle: I don't know what I'm going to do about that. I'll just have to deal with the consequences of whatever decision I make.<br/>Arielle Free is hosting Glastonbury coverage on BBC iPlayer this weekend.<br/>Elton created a 'brand new show' for Glastonbury<br/>Glastonbury warning as highs of 27C possible<br/>The green energy powering Glastonbury Festival<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This week, he'll make his debut at Glastonbury.<br/>Eli Crossley, who's just 16, will be one of the youngest performers ever to play the festival when he takes to the stage with his band, Askew.<br/>And he's doing so in spite of a progressive muscle wasting disease that means he's been using a wheelchair since last year.<br/>If the magnitude of the event is playing on his mind, it doesn't show.<br/>\"I've got three exams left, and then we've got this small concert,\" he laughs over the phone from his home in London, a week before the festival.<br/>Eli has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a progressive and life-limiting condition that gradually makes his muscles become weaker. <br/>His big break came about almost by accident when, earlier this year, he appeared on BBC Breakfast to discuss his condition.<br/>The teenager was showing off a new piece of technology called the Smart Suit that, it is hoped, will help him continue to move his upper body when he grows older.<br/>Asked how comfortable the device was to wear, he replied: \"It's very comfortable and I hope it will help me in fulfilling my dream of playing Glastonbury.\"<br/>His mum, Emily Reuben, joins us on the call. \"I don't think anyone thought you were going to mention Glastonbury,\" she laughs.<br/>\"It just sort of came out and the whole thing went viral. I was impressed. You put your dreams out there.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>How a smart suit could help Eli Crossley keep playing guitar<br/>It didn't take long for social media to take up the cause, petitioning festival organiser Emily Eavis to give Eli and his band a slot.<br/>After an initial flurry of activity, however, the requests died down. Then, a parent at Eli's school saw Askew performing in an end-of-term talent show. <br/>That parent just happened to be Jon Turner of Island Records. The following morning, calls were placed to Eavis and her husband Nick Dewey, and the cogs turned.<br/>\"They saw the video of Eli and said, 'Yes, we'd absolutely love to have him',\" Ms Reuben recalls.<br/>That evening she posted a cryptic message on WhatsApp to the group's parents: \"Major news incoming.\" Soon afterwards, Eli started making calls to his bandmates Alfie, 15, and Freddie, Jay and Will, all 16.<br/>\"I didn't believe him at all,\" says Will, who plays guitar. \"I thought it was a little joke.\"<br/>Then the news sank in...<br/>\"Will is fairly new to the band and he said, 'But I've never played a gig before',\" Eli recalls. <br/>\"And I was like, 'Yeah, well you're playing Glastonbury now, mate.'\"<br/>\"We've never played anything this big,\" says second guitarist Jay, admitting to a degree of nervousness. <br/>\"We've only really played in front of our parents and in small bars and stuff. We never thought we'd be here. \"<br/>Asked how he feels about the show, even Eli's bravado falters temporarily.<br/>\"I'm terrified about it, but really excited at the same time.\"<br/>But the band have already got the support of one famous fan, actor Eddie Marsan, who implored festivalgoers to catch their set.<br/>\"Eli is not only a remarkable young man, he's a phenomenal musician,\" he wrote on Twitter. <br/>\"I saw his band Askew play in Paris and their set was incredible. They're going to blow Glastonbury away.\"<br/>The group will play at 17:30 BST on Friday on the small and secretive Rabbit Hole stage - an underground venue where punters have to answer a riddle before they can enter.<br/>Their half-hour set will mix originals like Rosemary and Last with covers of Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love and Supersonic by Oasis - \"a few crowd pleasers to make sure everybody stays put\", as Eli puts it - before they're set free for the rest of the weekend.<br/>Eli is determined to see Royal Blood on the Pyramid Stage, while his mum has made it clear she'll be watching Sir Elton John on Sunday night.<br/>After that, she will go back to the day job of running Duchenne UK, the charity she set up after Eli was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy 13 years ago. At the time, she was told her three-year-old might not live to see 20.<br/>Along with co-founder Alex Johnson, she has raised more than \u00a317m, which has been used to fund clinical trials across the UK, as well as partially funding 34 posts for doctors and nurses, creating guidelines for care for Duchenne patients and research into how technology can help them. Both women received OBEs from King Charles last weekend.<br/>It was part of their research that led to Eli's initial appearance on BBC Breakfast, discussing the motor-assisted suit that will help him continue playing guitar when his arm muscles begin to waste away.<br/>She says the suit will mean \"being able to brush your teeth, give your mum a hug [or] put your arm up in class. All the little things that are actually the really big things\".<br/>With help from the Postcode Lottery, they have 10 prototypes in development, and hope to make the suit widely available within three years - helping not just children with muscular dystrophy, but other conditions including spinal injuries.<br/>\"She's an inspiration not just to me, but to many people around the world,\" says Eli. <br/>Clearly, his mum feels the same way about her son.<br/>\"I just can't believe it. We never in our wildest dreams thought that dream of his would ever come true,\" she says.<br/>\"These boys work really hard and they rehearse a lot.

It was a really big part of me becoming a lot more body confident than I was in my early teens.<br/>\"I think for me I keep in mind they're not actually judging me on my size or appearance, it's more to do with just how confident and happy you are to be on stage.\"<br/>Even though Abigail, who's from Northumberland, enjoys strutting her stuff in her swimsuit, she thinks it's important that pageants remain accessible to all contestants. <br/>\"If Miss England wants to bring back swimwear I think it should be a photoshoot or an optional fashion show,\" she says.<br/>\"So that girls, who maybe for religious reasons or just don't feel comfortable in swimwear, aren't missing out on the rest of the experience.\"<br/>That's something 18-year-old Fatima Bobra from Leicester agrees with. <br/>She's previously competed in a Miss Teen Great Britain competition and proudly wore her hijab in every round.<br/>Fatima feels \"the best idea\" would be to scrap the idea of a swimwear round.<br/>\"To some extent, it's obviously what is traditional in a beauty pageant, something that's been around for years,\" she says.<br/>\"But now I think that it is time for a change.<br/>\"I think [Miss England] should make the rules so that girls that are Muslim, or just aren't comfortable showing their bodies, are able to wear modest swimwear.<br/>\"It would be a game changer and would break down another barrier for Muslim women.\"<br/>But some contestants would prefer the debate to be focusing on women's achievements rather than their bodies and clothing. <br/>For 27-year-old aerospace engineer and reigning Miss England, Jessica Gagen, the competition is all about \"female empowerment\". <br/>\"A role model's qualities don't boil down to what they look like,\" she says.<br/>Jessica says competitions that come under the beauty pageant umbrella are \"more of a role model contest\" these days.<br/>She feels the contests \"celebrate beauty in its many different forms, its shapes and sizes\".<br/>\"And the girls entering are doing so to boost awareness surrounding campaigns that they're passionate about,\" she says.<br/>\"They encourage all different women to get involved as a form of female empowerment and female representation.\"<br/>Jessica, who lives in Liverpool, did take part in the swimwear photoshoot last year, but says she's now \"fed up\" about the lack of conversations around the contestant's campaigns. <br/>And she says a swimwear round should not \"be made compulsory\".<br/>\"I don't believe anyone should be forced to show more than what they're comfortable doing.<br/>\"My campaign was all about getting girls into engineering careers and boosting the profiles of STEM careers.<br/>\"I've got a degree in aerospace engineering which never really gets talked about, yet here we are again talking about the topic of bikinis and women's bodies.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>'I'm going make-up free in the Miss England final'<br/>Beauty queen with rare condition reaches finals<br/>'Why is she representing the UK?'<br/>'I won a beauty pageant with science'<br/>First hijab-wearing Miss England finalist<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Those are the ingredients that have made the Final Fantasy series stand the test of time.<br/>However, after a mixed reception to the previous game, this latest release, which launched on Thursday, has some work to do.<br/>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida explains: \"Because the Final Fantasy 15 story wasn't as well received as past titles, we needed to focus on regaining players' trust, and show them again that this series is all about the story.\"  <br/>That story, clearly inspired by fantasy shows like Game of Thrones, encourages players to think about looking after the planet better. A theme that has been present throughout the franchise's history. <br/>How those messages are interpreted should be up to the player, although according to Naoki Yoshida: \"I look at games as entertainment, I hope that through this entertainment players can take something away.<br/>\"Talking about the environment and those issues is also very important, but I think what Final Fantasy 16 also focuses on is that there is darkness in the world and darkness in ourselves. We have to accept that darkness to overcome it and move on to tomorrow.  <br/>\"But I'm not in a position to say this is what players should feel, because everyone will take away something different. But if they do feel something then that makes us very proud and happy.\"<br/>Most games stay clear of overt messaging on social or political issues so they don't alienate potential players who may hold differing opinions.<br/>Aoife Wilson, who reviewed the title for Eurogamer YouTube Channel, says the series' ecological themes are plain to see: \"I think generally in most Final Fantasy games when you boil it down the story is saying something about protecting the planet, and being wary of of mining it for selfish reasons. <br/>\"What I really like about 16, however, is that it tries harder than previous titles to say all that through a very human perspective.\"<br/>The first game, for the Nintendo Entertainment System, came out in 1987 and since then around 173 million copies of titles in the franchise have been sold.<br/>An example of the Japanese roleplaying-game genre (JRPG), the series is unique because each title's setting is independent from each other (bar some small overlaps in places). Beloved characters, locations and worlds live and die in one game. It's as if The Sopranos swapped out Tony for a new character every series and ditched New Jersey for a different location. <br/>It's a risky approach which asks players to forget their attachment to previous characters and invest emotionally in new ones each time. However the series is sticking with it. <br/>According to Wilson, it's a way to try and keep the series current: \"It means you don't have to have played six to be able to play seven, for example. <br/>\"They're all self contained, but they do share little similarities and have nods to previous games for fans as well. I often think that's the reason they have been so successful, the fact that the games are constantly having to reinvent themselves.\"<br/>Final Fantasy games are not for everyone. They require patience and reward players for their investment. Attacks need to be learnt and mastered - bashing buttons at random will only take you so far in this franchise. <br/>The scripts are over the top, some story arcs are a little traditional and Final Fantasy 15 was criticised for having four male characters as its primary focus. There is an attempt at more diversity this time around with a female character Jill in a central role, a queer relationship is featured however the main protagonists are still predominantly white. <br/>With lots of competition in the role-playing game space at the moment (Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Hogwarts Legacy are this year's top selling games, for example), Final Fantasy 16 does have its work cut-out to attract players who aren't already fans of the series. <br/>However, its tone, distinct aesthetic and enjoyable set-piece battles give it clear points of difference.<br/>Wilson says that this release is the first in the series for some time that she fells has a chance to cut-through: \"When I was writing my review for Final Fantasy 16, I was asking myself 'who do I recommend this game to?'<br/>\"I think, interestingly, for the first time in a long time this is a title that I can recommend to pretty much anyone with an interest in games. I can do that without too many caveats or explainers and I think that's a very good sign for the series.<br/>\"Honestly with recent entries in the series it has been difficult to do that. Fifteen was fine, had some nice moments, but when it launched it didn't feel like a game that was finished. It had some of the right ingredients but it all didn't come together.\"<br/>This version has a darker tone than previous entries. The departure will seek to make the series more appealing to new players, who will be more used to this feel than some of the gothic and modern mash-ups we've seen in the past.  <br/>A JRPG fan once told a friend about a classic of the genre that it \"really comes into its own after about 80 hours of gameplay\". Not everyone has the desire to stick with a game for that long before seeing the best of it. <br/>Saying the same of Final Fantasy 16 isn't fair, however it is a title that requires some serious time investment to get the best out of it. The success of similar releases like Zelda, Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy recently suggests though that it should not be a barrier to success.

We are in a moment that is equal to World War Two with respect to climate,\" she said.<br/>This week the International Energy Agency warned annual investments in clean energy in developing nations will need to triple from $770bn in 2022 to as much as $2.8tn by the early 2030s if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/>One proposal is that institutions like the World Bank offer cheaper loans for climate action projects.<br/>It is much more expensive to build flood defences in Barbados or Angola than it is in the Netherlands or the UK, Ms Mottley points out. <br/>The same goes for erecting wind turbines or installing solar farms.<br/>That is because low-income countries are charged high interest rates - often two or even three times the rates developed nations face.<br/>Yet the risks of individual projects don't vary anywhere near as much as that. <br/>Another suggestion is that institutions like the World Bank should agree to guarantee loans for climate action in developing nations. That would encourage the private sector to lend at lower interest rates.<br/>Experts say these initiatives could generate hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of loans for climate projects in low-income countries.<br/>Another proposal involves the creation of an auction in which developing nations would bid for cheap finance for climate projects.<br/>This \"Climate Mitigation Trust Fund\" would be funded by tens of billions of dollars' worth of SDRs and overseen by the IMF and the UN.<br/>The winners would be the projects that reduce global warming fastest.  <br/>It is not expected that a final decision will be made on these proposals, but Ms Mottley is confident that progress will be made.<br/>We tell our children we shouldn't put off to tomorrow what we need to do today, Ms Mottley says.<br/>\"I find myself actually repeating a lot of things that we would say to children, in order to inform global behaviour today,\" she continues.  \"That tells us a lot.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It was described as \"movingly low-key\" by Variety.<br/>Netflix employed trans writer Thomas Page McBee to incorporate the Viktor gender transition plotline into the show and the soft-touch approach worked with audiences around the world. <br/>Nielsen Media Research - which evaluated views across all platforms - says that the series chalked more than 10.5 billion hours of streaming, making it the 13th most viewed original show of the year.  <br/>Page's Viktor instantly became one the best known trans men in fictionalised broadcasting - one of the least represented groups in the industry.<br/>According to the 2022-2023 Where We Are On TV report by LGBT advocacy group Glaad, only 11 of the 596 LGBT characters portrayed across 100 global TV, film and streaming platforms were trans men. <br/>Page says he's aware that he is one of the most high-profile trans men in the world and takes this seriously. <br/>\"I'm in this unique position,\" he says, \"and I absolutely have to use my privilege and my platform to do what I can, in whatever way, to help my community.\"<br/>When he wrote his memoir, Pageboy, he chose a lyric from a song by transgender musician Beverly Glenn-Copeland for the opening lines.   <br/>\"This world has many ends and beginnings,<br/>A cycle ends, will something remain?<br/>Maybe a spark, once so bright, will bloom again.\"<br/>The words resonated with Page.<br/>\"At so many points I'd find myself thinking, 'I was never a girl. I'll never be a woman. What am I going to do? I just want to be a 10-year-old,'\" he tells the BBC.<br/>\"Then I started realising, 'Oh, that's because that's the last time I felt like myself, the last time I felt like I looked like myself and was in my body and knew who I was and had this spark,' you know?<br/>\"It's now coming back. That spark.\"<br/>It was in December 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 global pandemic, that Page publicly came out as a trans man via his Instagram account. In a post that quickly gathered more than three million likes, Page wrote that he felt lucky to be making the announcement.<br/>\"There were years and years of turmoil about it,\" he says, \"of getting really close and then pulling away, talking myself out of it.\"<br/>Some of that reluctance was a hangover from the years of hiding his identity, on advice from film executives who shaped his early career. In his book he describes the Hollywood he encountered as a 20-year-old star of breakout independent movie Juno, as \"plastic, empty, homophobic\". <br/>In Juno, he played a teenager who goes through an unplanned pregnancy. The role won Page an Oscar nomination and global fame.<br/>\"The success of Juno coincided with people in the industry telling me no-one could know I was queer,\" he writes in Pageboy, \"that it wouldn't be good for me\u2026 So I put on the dresses and the makeup. I did the photo shoots.\" <br/>He describes the level of discomfort, gender dysphoria, as crushing. <br/>\"I had to avoid my reflection. I couldn't look at pictures, because I was never there. It was making me sick.\"<br/>At the same time gossip writers printed columns questioning his identity. Page says he's not sure pieces like that would be published now, in the age of social media.<br/>\"The articles you're referencing came out in 2008. I imagine if those came out now about someone, I mean, they would probably be eviscerated for writing something like that.\" <br/>So does he believe a young trans person could come to Hollywood now, with no connections, and have a successful career?<br/>Page pauses before conceding, \"I'm not 100% sure. In some ways, potentially.\" <br/>Then he pauses again, \"But now, we're also in a time of such extreme hateful rhetoric against trans lives. There's still so far to go.\"<br/>Community is the answer to polarising online debates about transgender people, he insists, and he wants to connect with young LGBT people from around the world, through his work.<br/>We asked trans men who use the BBC languages services to send video questions for Elliot. One came from Adam, a 24-year-old pilot in India, whose family put him through conversion therapy and refused to let him leave the house for more than a year.  <br/>\"This is not just my story,\" Adam says. \"This is the story of trans people around the world. So my question is, what message do you have for trans people going through tough times?\"<br/>Page is visibly moved when he watches the video.<br/>\"My message is just to hold on and to love yourself with all your might and to know that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you,\" he says. \"Reach out for support where you can find it. In person or online. Seek out narratives that offer some kind of representation, some kind of comfort. Just a reminder that you're not alone.\"<br/>Changing the narrative on trans representation in the media is something he says he hopes to do with his film company Page Boy Productions, as well as his own acting roles in the future.<br/>He hopes that his platform can help change people's sometimes limited perceptions of manhood. <br/>\"Being aggressive is encouraged in men,\" he says. \"I hope those expectations of what it means to be a man, what masculinity means, can be redefined and healed.\"<br/>He says he isn't sure how his personal life will turn out.<br/>\"I'm not too interested in having kids, to be honest. But, I guess you never know,\" he says smiling. \"I do feel like I'm really living my life for the first time. I'm just happy. Just getting to wake up and walk my dog and hang out with friends and feel like I'm in, really in, my body for the first time.\"<br/>Oscar-nominated actor Elliot Page speaks to the BBC's gender and identity correspondent Megha Mohan about his childhood, Hollywood, trans rights and his relationship with his body.<br/>In Conversation is a collaboration between BBC Three and the BBC World Service.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said his warnings were ignored and called a meeting with OceanGate bosses but was fired, according to the documents.<br/>The company sued him for revealing confidential information, and he countersued for unfair dismissal. The lawsuit was later settled but we don't know the details of the settlement. <br/>The BBC tried to contact Mr Lochridge but he is not commenting. <br/>Separately, a letter sent to OceanGate by the Marine Technology Society (MTS) in March 2018 and obtained by the New York Times, stated \"the current 'experimental' approach adopted by OceanGate... could result in negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)\".<br/>A spokesman for OceanGate declined to comment on the safety issues raised by Mr Lochridge and the MTS.<br/>The Titan submersible, described as \"experimental\" by the company, was built from an unusual material for a deep sea vessel. <br/>Its hull - surrounding the hollow part where passengers sit - was made from carbon fibre, with titanium end plates and a small window at one end.<br/>\"Typically, the part of deep-sea submersible housing the humans is a titanium sphere around 2m in diameter,\" said Dr Nicolai Roterdam, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth.<br/>To withstand the immense pressures of the deep you need super-strong materials, to resist the weight of water above that's pressing down on you.   <br/>Carbon fibre is cheaper than titanium or steel and is extremely strong, but it is largely untested for deep sea vessels like the Titan.<br/>In an interview with Oceanographic last year, OceanGate's CEO Rush Stockton said: \"Carbon fibre is used successfully in yachts and in aviation, but it has not been used in crewed submersibles.\" <br/>In the court documents, Mr Lochridge claimed the hull had not been properly tested - where it's placed under extreme pressures and analysed to look for potential problems. <br/>He claimed that trials on a smaller scale model of the sub had revealed flaws in the carbon under pressure testing.   <br/>Mr Lochridge also raised the issue of the Titan's glass viewport. He claimed the company that made the material would only certify its use down to 1,300m.<br/>A December 2018 statement from OceanGate said the Titan had completed a 4,000 meter dive which \"completely validates OceanGate's innovative engineering and the construction of Titan's carbon fiber and titanium hull\".<br/>In a 2020 interview with GeekWire, Mr Rush said tests were conducted which revealed that the Titan's hull \"showed signs of cyclic fatigue\". <br/>In a May 2021 court filing, the company said Titan had undergone more than 50 test dives, including to the equivalent depth of the Titanic, in deep waters off the Bahamas and in a pressure chamber.<br/>The shape of the Titan is also unusual.<br/>The hull of a deep-diving sub is usually spherical, which means it receives an equal amount of pressure at every point, but Titan's hull is tube-shaped, so the pressure would not be equally distributed.<br/>\"Titan is quite a different deep-sea submersible compared to those used in research,\" said Dr Roterman.<br/>\"Whether or not this design with composite materials represents a structural weakness would be for engineers to determine, however,\" she added.<br/>In the court documents, Mr Lochridge also said he had urged OceanGate to get the submarine inspected and certified. <br/>Subs can be certified or \"classed\" by marine organisations - for example by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) or DNV (a global accreditation organisation based in Norway) or Lloyd's Register. <br/>This essentially means that the vehicle must meet certain standards on aspects including stability, strength, safety and performance.<br/>The process involves reviewing the design and construction, assessing testing and trials to be certified. And once the sub is in service it needs to be checked periodically to ensure it still meets these criteria. <br/>But certification of subs isn't mandatory. <br/>Titan was never certified or classed - as the company wrote a blog post about it in 2019.<br/>It said the way that Titan had been designed fell outside the accepted system - but it \"does not mean that OceanGate does meet standards where they apply.\" <br/>It added that the classing agencies \"slowed down innovation\u2026 bringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation\". <br/>A CBS reporter who went on the Titan in 2022 quoted a waiver people signed before boarding as stating it was \"an experimental submersible vessel that has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body which could result in physical injury, emotional trauma or death.\"  <br/>Any sub that dives over 4,000m is a one-off vehicle - not something mass-produced - and requires innovation and novel design to survive at these depths. <br/>But that doesn't mean this falls outside the classing system.   <br/>Take for example the sub called the Limiting Factor. This vessel, designed by Triton submarines, has repeatedly travelled to the very deepest places in the ocean - performing many dives to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which lies 11km down.<br/>It's a truly unique and cutting-edge vessel - but the team behind it collaborated with the DNV classing agency from design, through to construction and testing. And the Limiting Factor is fully certified to repeatedly - and safely - dive to any depth in the ocean.<br/>Additional reporting by Thomas Spencer.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The overall area of sea being scoured was about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles), twice the size of the US state of Connecticut.<br/>\"You always have hope,\" Capt Frederick said, adding: \"This is a search and rescue operation 100%.\"<br/>There were currently five surface vessels involved in the search, he said, with a further five heading to the area. <br/>Meanwhile the two remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) searching underwater would be joined by several more on Thursday morning.<br/>\"We're searching where the noises were detected. In the morning we'll continue to search there and put additional ROVs down where the search was originally taking place,\" he said.<br/>One of the vessels on its way to help search efforts is French ship L'Atalante which has a robot that can reach the seabed 3,800m (12,500ft) down, and has the capacity to lift the Titan sub to the surface.<br/>Earlier on Wednesday Rear Admiral John Mauger from the US Coast Guard said the sub is believed to have an emergency life-support system onboard to provide oxygen - but supplies were running out.<br/>\"One of the factors that makes it hard to predict how much oxygen is left is that we do not know the rate of the consumption of oxygen per occupant on the sub,\" he told the BBC.<br/>On board the 21-foot vessel is British businessman Hamish Harding, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, former French navy diver Paul-Henry Nargeolet and the CEO of OceanGate - which operates the submersible - Stockton Rush.<br/>However Oisin Fanning, who has been on a deep sea voyage to the Titanic wreck before and knows some of those on board the missing submersible, told the BBC the crew would understand how to maximise their oxygen supply.<br/>Mr Fanning said those on board will have gone through rigorous training beforehand and \"will immediately look to conserve oxygen straight away\".<br/>Dr Ken LeDez, a hyperbaric medicine expert at Memorial University in St John's, Newfoundland, told the BBC it was possible the crew could survive even as oxygen supplies dwindle, depending on the crew's fitness and the conditions in the submersible.<br/>While it's impossible to know the exact conditions inside, Dr LeDez said the crew will likely be facing increasing levels of carbon dioxide and could also be dealing with cold temperatures, along with the declining levels of oxygen.<br/>A combination of these factors could lead to hypothermia and a loss of consciousness, he said. But these conditions aren't necessarily deadly and their metabolisms slowing down because of the cold could help them survive longer, he added.<br/>\"They're very smart... very accomplished people in there,\" he said. \"If anybody can survive\" in it, \"it's these individuals.\"<br/>What we know so far about the search for the missing Titanic sub<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Sounds a glimmer of hope in sub search - but what next?<br/>Experts had warned about safety of missing sub<br/>British father, his son and explorer among missing<br/>Titan sub: Narrow, dimly lit tube with curtained-off toilet<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said no-one was injured in the incident.<br/>Asked about his appetite for exploration, he said: \"My view is that these are all calculated risks and are well understood before we start.\"<br/>Last weekend, he said on Facebook that the mission was \"likely to be the first and only in 2023\" because of poor weather conditions in Newfoundland, Canada, where the missions set off from.<br/>Later, his stepson Brian Szasz said in a now-deleted post on Facebook that his stepfather \"has gone missing on (the) submarine.\"<br/>Friend David Mearns, a marine scientist and expedition leader, described Mr Harding as a \"very charming guy\" who was attracted to \"extreme adventures\".<br/>Patrick Woodhead, founder of British tour operator White Desert Antarctica, said Mr Harding was an \"incredible\" aviation explorer, and that his thoughts and prayers were with Mr Harding's wife, Linda, and his sons.<br/>Terry Virts, a retired Nasa astronaut, said his friend was the \"quintessential British explorer\" who loved adventure and exploring, but was not an \"adrenaline junkie\".<br/>\"Some people watch Netflix, some people play golf, and Hamish goes to the bottom of the ocean, or into space, and he's set world records flying around the planet,\" he told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.<br/>Mr Harding - along with Paul-Henry Nargeolet who is also on board - is a member of the Explorers Club, a little known century-old exploration group whose members have included Sir Edmund Hillary and Amelia Earhart. <br/>Its president, Richard Garriott de Cayeux, said Mr Harding's excitement over the expedition had been palpable during a meeting at last week's Global Exploration Summit.<br/>British businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, is from one of Pakistan's richest families. He was travelling with his son, Suleman, a 19-year-old student, on the sub.<br/>He lives with his wife, Christine, and other child, Alina, in Surbiton, south-west London, but the family were spending a month in Canada prior to the dive.<br/>Shahzada is vice-chairman of Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corporation, which is a large fertiliser firm. <br/>He works with his family's Dawood Foundation, as well as the SETI Institute - a California-based research organisation which searches for extra-terrestrial life.<br/>Shahzada is also a supporter of two charities founded by King Charles - the British Asian Trust and the Prince's Trust International.<br/>A Palace spokesperson said the King has asked to be kept fully up to date with the rescue operation and his \"thoughts and prayers are with all those onboard\".<br/>In a statement, Shahzada's family said he was interested in \"exploring different natural habitats\", and had previously spoken at both the United Nations and Oxford Union.<br/>He studied in Philadelphia, USA, and the University of Buckingham in England, where he graduated in 1998.<br/>A family statement described teenager Suleman as a \"big fan of science fiction literature and learning new things\", and having an interest in Rubik's cubes and playing volleyball. <br/>He recently graduated from ACS International School Cobham in Surrey, according to local media reports.<br/>Mr Nargeolet, 77, a former French Navy diver, was also on board. <br/>Nicknamed Mr Titanic, he has reportedly spent more time at the wreck than any other explorer and was part of the first expedition to visit it in 1987, just two years after it was found. <br/>The 77-year-old is director of underwater research at a company that owns the rights to the Titanic wreck.<br/>According to a company profile, Mr Nargeolet has supervised the recovery of thousands of Titanic artefacts, including the \"big piece\", a 20-tonne section of the boat's hull. <br/>Family spokesman Mathieu Johann said he hoped Mr Nargeolet's composure and military career would reassure the crew on board, even if the outcome of the operation did not depend on him.<br/>Shortly before boarding the sub, Mr Nargeolet said he had been looking forward to an expedition next year to recover objects from the wreck, he added.<br/>Stockton Rush, 61, is the chief executive of OceanGate, the firm which runs the Titanic voyages, and the company confirmed he is on board.<br/>He is an experienced engineer who has previously designed an experimental aircraft and worked on other small submersible vessels.<br/>Mr Rush founded the company in 2009, offering customers a chance to experience deep sea travel, and made global headlines in 2021 when it began offering trips to the site of the Titanic wreck.<br/>For $250,000 (\u00a3195,600), his company offers passengers the opportunity to get an up-close glimpse of what remains of the famous ship.<br/>Participants travel some 370 miles (595km) on a larger ship to the area above the wreck site, then do an eight-hour dive to the Titanic on a truck-sized submersible known as Titan.<br/>Speaking to the New York Times in 2022, he defended the business model, and said the ticket price was a \"fraction of the cost of going to space and it's very expensive for us to get these ships and go out there\".<br/>A 2017 feature written for the website of Princeton University, where he studied, reported Mr Rush goes on every OceanGate dive.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What we know so far <br/>Rescuers scan ocean for Titanic sub as clock ticks<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

There are five people on board.<br/>Researchers aboard the Polar Prince - its mothership on the surface - lost contact with the crew shortly after the Titan began its dive. There is limited oxygen on board, and it is estimated that supplies are set to run out by around 10:00 GMT (06:00 EDT) on Thursday.<br/>Undersea noises have now been detected in the search area, but it is not known where they are coming from or what they mean.<br/>US, Canadian and French agencies are working together to locate the submersible, and the tour firm OceanGate says it is exploring all options to get it back safety. Here is what we know so far. <br/>A Canadian search plane picked up underwater noises on Tuesday and Wednesday. Deep-sea experts say it is hard to determine what these noises might be without seeing the data. <br/>But it is possible they could be short, sharp, relatively high frequency noises - made from within the vessel by hitting a hard object against the end of the sub.<br/>The US Coast Guard says it does not know what the noises are at this point. It says the US navy is analysing the data, but so far it remains inconclusive.<br/>The US Coast Guard has sent ROVs - remotely operated vehicles - to search under the surface in the area where sounds have been detected. But so far, they have yielded negative results, it said.<br/>More ROVs are expected\u00a0to be deployed with extra-depth capability. You can read more about the equipment being used in our visual guide.<br/>The coastguard adds that the search area has been expanded to an area approximately twice the size of the US state of Connecticut, and a sub-surface search area of around 2.5 miles (4km) deep.<br/>Planes are continuing to search from the air, in case Titan has returned to the ocean's surface but somehow lost communications.<br/>A French vessel equipped with a deep-sea underwater robot should arrive in the area by Wednesday afternoon, local time.<br/>Prof Alistair Greig, a submarine expert from University College London, says one of the big problems is that rescuers do not know whether to look on the surface or the seabed - it is very unlikely to be in between.<br/>He's worked through a couple of scenarios. One is that it released a \"drop weight\" after an emergency, in order to bring it to the surface. <br/>\"If there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found,\" he said.<br/>Another possibility is that the hull was compromised resulting in a leak. \"Then the prognosis is not good,\" he says. <br/>The wreck of the Titanic sits 3,800m (12,500ft) beneath the surface of the Atlantic. If the submersible has gone down to the seabed and can't get back up under its own power, the options are very limited.<br/>We know there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers. The vehicles designed for navy submarine rescues can't get anywhere near as deep as would be needed.<br/>According to OceanGate, the company that owns it, Titan is one of only five manned submersibles in the world capable of reaching the depth required.<br/>The US Navy does have an ROV that can operate at that depth and used it to locate and recover a crashed fighter jet from a depth of 3,780m (12,400 feet) in the South China Sea last year.<br/>In that case, the US military used the ROV to attach rigging around the aircraft and connect it to a lifting hook that was lowered from a crane on the rescue vessel on the surface.<br/>The five people on board are: <br/>You can read more about them all here.<br/>OceanGate Expeditions charges guests $250,000 (\u00a3195,270) for a place on its eight-day expedition to see the wreck of the Titanic.<br/>The site is about 600km (370 miles) off the coast of Canada's Newfoundland, and lies in two parts, with the bow and the stern separated by about 800m (2,600ft). A huge debris field surrounds the broken vessel.<br/>A full dive to the wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes eight hours and each trip is meant to include a scientific objective, including studying the wreck's decay. <br/>The inaugural dive took place in 2021, according to the company's website. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: In 2022, the BBC filmed inside the Titanic sub with the company's boss Stockton Rush<br/>The Titan is extremely small and narrow, measuring just 670 cm x 280 cm x 250 cm (22ft x 9.2ft x 8.3ft) and can carry a crew of just five people - a pilot and four passengers, who have to sit on the floor and have limited room to move around.<br/>Aside from taking divers to the wreck of the Titanic, it's used for site survey and inspection, research and data collection, film and media production, and deep sea testing of hardware and software.<br/>According to the company, the Titan is \"outfitted with state-of-the-art lighting and sonar navigation systems plus internally and externally mounted 4K video and photographic equipment\". <br/>The BBC's US partner CBS sent one of its reporters on a voyage with the same company last year to see the wreck of the Titanic.<br/>Stockton Rush then gave him a tour of the submersible, where he revealed the vessel only has one button and is run using a video game controller. <br/>It is not unusual for off-the-shelf game controllers to be used in real-life vehicles. However, the Washington Post reports that the one seen in the CBS report appeared to be an old model. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Who is involved in search efforts<br/>The Polar Prince first arrived near the Titanic wreck on Sunday morning and the Titan was launched at 08:00 local time - it was expected to resurface at 15:00. Contact was lost one hour and 45 minutes into its descent, at about 09:45.<br/>The Coast Guard said they were notified of the problem at about 17:45 - eight hours later. The agency's command centre in Boston then began coordinating search efforts.<br/>The Titanic wreck site is approximately 600km (370 miles) off the coast of Newfoundland.<br/>What questions do you have about what's happened?

The sub's air supply is expected to run out at about 11:00 BST (10:00 GMT) on Thursday.<br/>The Titanic wreck lies some 435 miles (700km) south of St John's, Newfoundland, and about a dozen ships are at the scene or on the way to help the rescue mission but changeable weather and poor visibility are hampering efforts.<br/>Prof Alistair Greig, a submarine expert from University College London, says one of the big problems is that rescuers do not know whether to look on the surface or the seabed - it is \"very unlikely\" to be in between - and warns searching each poses challenges.<br/>If the sub can't send distress signals for any reason, Prof Greig says: \"It's about the size of a large transit van and it's painted white so trying to see that from the air... is going to be a real challenge.\"<br/>US and Canadian agencies, navies and commercial deep-sea firms are all helping the rescue operation, which is being run from Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>The Polar Prince has been joined by seven ships to search an area of more than 25,000 sq km with the aid of military planes and sonar buoys.<br/>Some of those ships are carrying unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that will be needed to scour the sea floor.<br/>Vessels involved in Titan search operation<br/>Polar Prince (on site) - Research vessel that launched the Titan submersible<br/>Deep Energy (on site) - Commercial cable-laying ship with two ROVs that can operate down to 3,000m (10,000ft)<br/>Atlantic Merlin (on site) - Canadian offshore supply vessel with 4,000m winch system.

The vehicles designed for navy submarine rescue certainly can't get down to anywhere near the depth of the Titanic.\"<br/>But ocean recovery expert David Mearns says that if an ROV can locate the Titan then it should be able to recover it. \"A world-class ROV with twin manipulators can actually grab hold of [the Titan] or attach a lift line to it and slowly haul it to the surface,\" he adds. <br/>The US has previously used ROVs and a US Navy Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System - a special winch system designed to provide reliable deep ocean lifting capacity for the recovery of large and heavy undersea objects - in salvage operations at the depth of the Titanic, including to locate and recover a crashed fighter jet from a depth of 3,780m (12,400 feet) in the South China Sea last year. <br/>In that case, the US military used the ROV to attach rigging around the aircraft and connect it to a lifting hook that was lowered from a crane on the rescue vessel on the surface.<br/>What it's like on board the Titanic tourist sub<br/>What we know so far <br/>British father, his son and explorer among missing<br/>Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

So, naturally, I was excited,\" Dr Guillen, who at the time was science editor at America's ABC network, told BBC Radio 4.<br/>He recollects that - together with diving partner Brian and Russian pilot Viktor - they went down in a small Russian submersible lowered from the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh research ship.<br/>After touring Titanic's bow where \"everything had gone well\", the crew decided to head to the stern area some distance away. <br/>The Titanic sank on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg. Before going down, the British passenger liner split into two parts. <br/>\"As we approached the stern area - flying over what's called the debris field - we were caught up... in a very fast-moving underwater current. So we ended up getting stuck in the propeller,\" says Dr Guillen, describing it as \"huge\". <br/>\"All of a sudden, there was just a crash. We just felt this collision, and all of sudden debris... just huge chunks, rusted chunks of the Titanic started falling on top of us.\"<br/>Dr Guillen, a physicist and now a best-selling author, remembers that \"it was pretty clear to us almost immediately we were stuck\".<br/>He says the pilot, who used to fly Russian Mig fighter jets, was trying to jostle the sub out.<br/>\"It's like you get your truck, your car stuck in the mud: you try to go forward, backward, forward, backward. Just to try to dislodge yourself.<br/>\"We all fell silent. We didn't want to disturb or distract Viktor. And we knew we were in a crisis. So we just kept quiet.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The BBC followed a \"citizen scientists\" who paid for one of the Titan dives<br/>The sub eventually managed to get out \"through the skill of Viktor\", says Dr Guillen.<br/>\"We were just fortunate. There was a better part of an hour we were stuck. And I already pretty much had said my goodbyes in my mind.<br/>\"I'll never forget this thought that came to my head: this is how it's going to end for you.<br/>\"But in the end, we sensed that something changed... there was a sense that we were floating.\"<br/>The journalist recollects that all this was happening in complete darkness, as the pilot turned off the spotlight. <br/>\"We didn't want to say anything. I was like 'My gosh, is it possible that we are out of this?' <br/>\"Then I turned to Viktor, and I said: 'OK?' That was all. <br/>\"He only spoke broken English. And I'll never forget [how] he said this in a very low growling Russian accent: 'No problem.'\"<br/>\"I breathed a sigh of relief.\"<br/>Dr Guillen said it took them about two-and-a-half hours to get back to the surface, and people aboard the launching ship had been aware of a \"crisis\" situation. <br/>He says that back in 2000, there were only two countries that had subs able to withstand enormous water pressure - France and Russia.<br/>Comparing the 7.8m-long (26ft) Russian Mir sub he was in to the missing vessel Titan, he says: \"Our sub was nothing like this luxurious sub. I've seen pictures of the interior of Titan - it's like a mansion.\"<br/>Inside the tight vessel, there were \"two benches on either side - that was me and my diving buddy, and in the middle - the pilot\".<br/>\"I have a fear of water. It was already difficult for me to do this,\" admits Dr Guillen - but says he simply could not turn down the opportunity to report from Titanic's wreck. <br/>Before the dive, the crew had been instructed on what to expect in the sub.<br/>\"We were briefed on a true story that had happened when another gentleman had been caught in the sub in a crisis,\" says the American journalist.<br/>\"And his first instinct was to go to the hatch. Because your first instinct when you're trapped down there is, you stand up, you reach for the hatch, which is right overhead... thinking you're going to escape that way.<br/>\"This gentleman did that in a panic, and of course doomed himself because as soon as he does that, all it takes is one crack; the water comes in - it's under such enormous pressure: it's just like a razor blade - it cuts you in half. <br/>\"I was very concerned about someone doing this in the sub. So I immediately became vigilant,\" he recalls, adding that he was not panicking - but was \"ready to gang-tackle anybody else in the sub who might panic\".<br/>\"That helped distract me from the crisis we were in - it kind of gave me a purpose, a reason to not think about anything else,\" he says.<br/>\"And then - being a scientist - I immediately started taking an inventory in my mind: OK, how much our oxygen gonna last, what could we possibly do.<br/>\"I thought to myself how we could get out of this, and I reached a point that I really had to concede the really stark fact that there was no way out,\" he says, describing the conditions as \"very hostile\".<br/>\"That's when that voice came to my head - this is how it's going to end for you. And just experienced almost like a supernatural peace.\"<br/>When asked about the missing Titan submersible, Dr Guillen is unable to contain his emotions.<br/>\"My heart is breaking for these five poor souls down there,\" he says in tears. \"I know exactly what they are experiencing. There are just no words for it. <br/>\"I know what they are going through.

Last year, it made 10 dives although not all of these were to the Titanic wreck.<br/>Once detached from its launch and recovery platform, the sub's four electric thrusters help it reach speeds of around 3 knots (3mph; 4km/h). <br/>The sub itself is extremely narrow, measuring just 670 cm x 280 cm x 250 cm (22ft x 9.2ft x 8.3ft), and can carry a crew of just five people - a pilot and four passengers. <br/>While it is bigger than competitors, passengers are required to sit on the floor with limited room to move around. <br/>At the front of the vessel is a large domed porthole offering a viewing point, which the company claims is the \"largest viewport of any deep-sea manned submersible\". <br/>The walls of the sub are also heated as conditions can become extremely cold at such depths. Wall-mounted lamps are the only source of light on board. <br/>Unusually though, it includes a private toilet for customers at the front of the sub. A small curtain is pulled across when it is in use and the pilot turns up some onboard music. <br/>However, the company's website does recommend \"you restrict your diet before and during the dive to reduce the likelihood that you will need to use the facilities\".<br/>The ship is equipped with powerful external lights which are used to illuminate the wreck of the Titanic. <br/>Several 4k cameras are also attached to the exterior, and an exterior laser scanner and sonar are used to map the ship. Inside, the crew can view the ruined vessel on a large digital display screen, while reviewing data collected on several tablets. <br/>The Titan has around 96 hours of oxygen reserves onboard, but this will be affected by the breathing rate of the crew. <br/>Much of the interior, the company admits, consists of several pieces of \"off-the-shelf technology\" which it says \"helped to streamline the construction, and makes it simple to operate and replace parts in the field\".<br/>GPS is not an option when submersibles dive to depths as deep as the Titan does. <br/>Instead, a special text messaging system allows the crew to receive instructions from the team on the surface vessel above.<br/>Onboard, the pilot steers based on these instructions with a modified video game controller. <br/>Mr Rush, speaking to CBS News last year, said piloting the sub \"shouldn't take a lot of skill\". <br/>A full dive to the Titanic wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes eight hours.<br/>But when CBS correspondent David Pogue took a trip on the Titan in 2018, communications with the sub broke down and it was lost at sea for more than two hours before communications were restored. <br/>The Titan has to grapple with the enormous pressure exerted by the ocean at such depths. <br/>According to OceanGate's website, it has a system for monitoring the vessel's hull in real time.<br/>It has sensors to analyse the effects of changing pressure on the sub as it dives, in order to assess the integrity of the structure.<br/>Before the sub begins its dive, a support team locks the crew inside by closing the hatch from the outside and sealing it shut with 17 bolts. <br/>OceanGate says it is an experimental vessel, and when CBS travelled onboard the correspondent had to sign a waiver accepting that it \"has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body, and could result in physical injury, disability, emotional trauma or death\".<br/>In a press release in 2019, the company explained why the Titan had not been classed by an independent body. \"Bringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation,\" it said.<br/>In a promotional video, OceanGate Expeditions software security expert Aaron Newman tells prospective clients that travelling on the sub is \"not a ride at Disney, you know\". <br/>\"There's a lot of real risk involved, and there's a lot of challenges,\" he says.<br/>But in 2018, submersible experts expressed \"unanimous concern\" over the experimental approach taken by Oceangate when building the Titan and warned of potential \"catastrophic\" issues with its design.<br/>In a letter to Mr Rush unearthed by the New York Times, the Marine Technology Society said the company was making \"misleading\" claims about its design exceeding established industry safety standards. <br/>OceanGate makes clear on its website that paying customers do not need any past diving experience to board the Titan. The company says any training needed to take part is provided online before departure. <br/>Customers are required to be at least 18 years old, capable of sitting in confined quarters for extended periods of time and able to climb a ladder. <br/>All passengers are provided with a safety briefing and a vessel orientation session, according to OceanGate.<br/>After that, the company says \"you can choose how you'd like to be involved on the expedition\", offering customers the chance to work with communications teams or assisting the pilot with navigation.<br/>Rescuers scan ocean for Titanic sub as clock ticks<br/>British father, his son and explorer among missing<br/>What it's like on board the Titanic tourist sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It was lost on a deep-sea voyage to the Titanic wreck three days ago.<br/>Underwater operations have been relocated to investigate the noises, the US Coast Guard has said, but so far they haven't found anything.<br/>And with oxygen supplies expected to run out at about 10:00 GMT on Thursday, the next few hours are critical.<br/>The US Coast Guard says noises were heard on Tuesday and Wednesday but it does not yet know what the noises are. It says the US navy is analysing the data, but so far it remains inconclusive.<br/>Some media reports have suggested the noises were heard at 30-minute intervals. <br/>Deep-sea experts who spoke to the BBC say it is hard to determine what these noises might be without seeing the data, and Rear Adm John Mauger - who is leading the search - has also confirmed the source of them is unknown.<br/>But it is possible they could be short, sharp, relatively high-frequency noises, made from within the sub by hitting a hard object against the end of it.<br/>Frank Owen, from the Submarine Institute of Australia, says he is confident - based on the information available - the sounds are coming from inside the vessel.<br/>\"If there was a 30-minute interval, it's very unlikely to be anything but human related,\" he told the BBC.<br/>The men on board include British businessman Hamish Harding, 58, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, his son Suleman, 19, and Stockton Rush, 61, the chief executive of OceanGate, which runs the voyages at a cost of $250,000 (\u00a3195,270) per head.<br/>But Mr Owen says the noises \"smack of advice\" coming from the fifth man inside - 77-year-old Paul-Henry Nargeolet, a former French navy diver and renowned explorer.<br/>\"He would know the protocol for trying to alert searching forces\u2026 on the hour and the half-hour, you bang like hell for three minutes,\" Mr Owen said.<br/>Banging on the vessel's hull every half hour is standard naval protocol around the world for stricken vessels aiming to send word of their location to rescuers, Mr Owen told LBC News.<br/>The decision to relocate the search indicates authorities are thinking similarly.<br/>But in previous maritime searches - like those for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in 2014, and the Russian submarine Kursk in 2000 - underwater noises were heard too, and yielded no results.<br/>And Rear Adm Mauger has said there are a lot of metal objects at the Titanic site that could have been causing the noises.<br/>The other ray of hope is that these sounds were picked up by the sonar buoys - listening devices dropped from aircraft or ships - at all, Mr Owen says.<br/>The Titanic lies 12,500ft (3,800m) beneath the ocean surface, where the buoys sit.<br/>All forms of electromagnetic radiation, including radio and radar, are mostly useless underwater, but sound can travel fast over great distances.<br/>It is possible that noises from deep ocean layers could get through to the sonar buoys, Mr Owen says, but it is more likely that the sounds are coming from the same ocean layer.<br/>\"It is very difficult to hear noise below the [top] layer because the sound gets refracted by this drop in temperature.<br/>\"But when it's in that isothermal layer... between the surface and 180m... the sound behaves really quite straight.\"<br/>Mr Owen says if the sounds are indeed coming from the sub, rescuers should be able to locate it pretty quickly.<br/>\"[They can] lay a pattern of buoys around that area, so they can get cross-bearings.\"<br/>\"The sonar buoys' receiver is able to plot that sort of information really very quickly... it would take a very short time to find.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: How tapping sounds can reach rescue efforts<br/>Experts say that if one sonar buoy has picked up the sounds, they could locate them to about 1-2km (0.6-1.2 miles). And if more have picked them up, it could be possible to narrow the search area down to 100m.<br/>However, the underwater vehicles which have been sent to find the origin of the noise have so far not found anything, the Coast Guard said at a news conference on Wednesday.<br/>There are two remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) currently searching and several more were expected by Thursday morning, the Coast Guard said.<br/>It would be what happens after the sub is located that could really slow things down, experts say.<br/>How deep the vessel is or what problems it faces are both still unknown.<br/>\"It is quite possible that the submersible is actually on the surface somewhere and hasn't yet been found,\" David Russell - a former Royal Navy officer who helped search for the Kursk - told the BBC.<br/>If the sub is in the top layer of the ocean, a retrieval could be fairly quick. <br/>But if it is at deeper levels, and needs help resurfacing, that would be a complex task.<br/>\"We're then talking about bringing it back to the surface using some form of sophisticated drones to attach wires and ropes to the vessel, then to pull it up or put it on to a crane,\" Mr Russell said. <br/>\"We've done that kind of thing before, though never - as far as I'm aware - at this kind of depth.\"<br/>But an operation like that would probably require equipment that Mr Owen says isn't available in the area yet.<br/>US and Canadian agencies, navies and commercial deep-sea firms are all helping the rescue operation, which is being run from the US city of Boston in Massachusetts. <br/>Scouring the search zone are military planes, a submarine and a number of ships - some equipped with underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicle).<br/>However, those are more useful for gathering information rather than in the event of any retrieval, Mr Owen says.<br/>\"You need heavy duty equipment to bring something up like that,\" he adds.<br/>\"Even the bringing the extra cable down that you're going to hook on needs a huge winch of its own, because you're talking about probably 5-6km of wire.\"<br/>Titan sub: Narrow, dimly lit tube with curtained-off toilet<br/>Ships racing to boost desperate search for sub<br/>British father, his son and explorer among missing<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Clearly those are no longer getting a response,\" Mr Pogue said, adding that Titan had got lost for about three hours during the expedition he was on last year. <br/>He described being initially hesitant about going aboard the sub at all because some of the components appeared \"off the shelf, sort of improvised\". <br/>\"You steer this sub with an Xbox game controller, some of the ballast is abandoned construction pipes.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Mike went to see the Titanic before and says we're all aware of the risks, it's not a lark<br/>Mr Pogue said he had been reassured by Titan's inventor and Stockton Rush, the chief executive of OceanGate, that the carbon-fibre main capsule had been co-designed with Nasa and the University of Washington and was \"rock solid\". <br/>Mr Reiss said that the Titan is \"a beautifully designed craft\" but that problems can arise due to the nature of the expedition.<br/>\"This is not to say this is a shoddy ship or anything, it's just that this is all new technology and they're learning it as they go along. <br/>\"You have to just remember the early days of the space programme or the early days of aviation, where you just make a lot of mistakes on the way to figuring out what you're doing.\"<br/>Titanic's wreck lies some 435 miles (700km) south of St John's, Newfoundland, though the rescue mission is being run from Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>Among those aboard the submersible is the British billionaire businessman and explorer Hamish Harding, according to his family. <br/>Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, were also on board, their family said in a statement.<br/>French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet is thought to be on board, according to a Facebook post by Mr Harding before the dive started<br/>Mr Rush, the head of OceanGate is also being widely reported to be on the vessel.<br/>In a statement on Monday, OceanGate said its \"entire focus [was] on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families\".<br/>The company added that it was \"deeply thankful\" for the \"extensive assistance\" it had been given from government agencies and companies involved in deep sea operations.<br/>The Titanic, which was the largest ship of its time, hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912.

Several private vessels are assisting.<br/>A commercial pipe-laying ship, Deep Energy, with remote submersibles has also arrived at the site.<br/>Oceanographer and world-renowned shipwreck hunter, David Mearns, told the BBC that he was hopeful Deep Energy's subs could reach the 3,800m (12,500ft) depth of the Titanic wreck to search for the missing vehicle.<br/>Mr Mearns knows two of the passengers on board personally - Mr Harding, 58, and Mr Nargeolet, 77. <br/>Mr Harding is a renowned explorer who has flown to space and holds three Guinness World Records. At the weekend, he said he was \"proud to finally announce\" that he was part of the mission.<br/>Mr Nargeolet is a former French navy officer and diver, and also director of underwater research at a company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic wreck.<br/>Titanic's wreck lies some 435 miles (700km) south of St John's, Newfoundland, in Canada, though the rescue mission is being run from the US city of Boston in Massachusetts.<br/>The US Coast Guard said research ships the Polar Prince - which was the support ship on Sunday's tourist expedition - and Deep Energy are continuing to search the ocean's surface. <br/>A Canadian P3 Aurora aircraft is carrying out sonar searches of the area, which as of Tuesday morning was of more than 10,000 sq miles (26,900 sq km), the Coast Guard added.<br/>On Tuesday, France's sea ministry diverted the Atalante, a vessel equipped with a subsea robot, to assist with the search. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: In 2022, the BBC filmed inside the Titan sub with the company's boss Stockton Rush<br/>The missing craft is tour firm OceanGate's Titan submersible, which CBS journalist David Pogue travelled aboard last year to reach the wreckage of the Titanic. <br/>He has told the BBC that when the support ship is directly above the sub, short text messages are able to be sent between the two.<br/>Otherwise, communication via GPS or radio systems is not available as neither work underwater. <br/>Mr Pogue said it was also not possible for those aboard the sub to escape by themselves because they are sealed inside by bolts applied from the outside. <br/>A submersible vessel is different from a submarine. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a submarine can launch itself into the ocean from a port independently, while a submersible has very limited power reserves so needs a mother ship that can launch it and recover it.<br/>Added to this is the fact that visibility is quickly lost below the surface of the water as light cannot penetrate far. <br/>The OceanGate website lists three submersibles it owns, and only the Titan is capable of diving deep enough to reach the Titanic wreckage. <br/>The vessel weighs 23,000lb (10,432 kg) and, according to the website, can reach depths of up to 13,100ft. <br/>Tickets cost $250,000 (\u00a3195,000) for an eight-day trip, including dives to the wreck at a depth of 3,800m.<br/>On social media at the weekend, Mr Harding said because of the \"worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023\".<br/>He later wrote: \"A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.\"<br/>OceanGate said it had \"been unable to establish communications with one of our submersible exploration vehicles\", but that its \"entire focus [was] on the crew members in the submersible and their families\". <br/>\"We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep-sea companies in our efforts to re-establish contact with the submersible,\" it added.<br/>The company bills the eight-day trip on its carbon-fibre submersible as a \"chance to step outside of everyday life and discover something truly extraordinary\".<br/>It sets sail from St John's in Newfoundland, with each full dive to the wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly taking around eight hours.<br/>According to its website, one expedition is ongoing and two more have been planned for June 2024. <br/>The Titanic, which was the largest ship of its time, hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. Of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 died.<br/>Its wreckage has been extensively explored since it was discovered in 1985.<br/>Do you have information about this story?

The inflation rate target is 2%.<br/>But, so far, the impact has been limited and is likely to take more time to feed through.<br/>Prices rose by 8.7% in the year to May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the same as the previous month but down from its peak of 11.1%.<br/>There is particular concern over the core inflation rate - a measure which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy - which has been going up.<br/>As a result, uncertainty remains about what will happen in the coming months, but many economists believe there could be more rate rises to come.<br/>The Bank has to balance the risk of damaging the economy, which has shown little sign of growth, with its battle to slow price rises.<br/>The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide interest rate policy. <br/>Mortgages<br/>Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey.<br/>When interest rates rise, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments. <br/>The increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.<br/>This comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.<br/>Three-quarters of mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage. Their monthly payments may not change immediately, but house buyers - or anyone seeking to remortgage, estimated to be 1.8 million people this year - will have to pay a lot more now than if they had taken out the same mortgage a year or more ago. <br/>The so-called \"mortgage bomb\" has become a huge economic and political issue. An average two-year fixed deal, which was 2.29% in November 2021, is now above 6%<br/>As people roll off cheap fixed-rate deals onto products with much higher rates, their monthly repayments can become hundreds of pounds more expensive.<br/>The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a politically independent economics-focused think tank, says rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable incomes fall by more than 20%.<br/>You can see how your mortgage may be affected by rising rates with our calculator below.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

The deals being offered now are better than anything seen for years.<br/>Analysts say that people should shop around for a better savings rate, with many paid little or nothing in interest in many accounts. Major banks have been under pressure from MPs to pass on rate rises.<br/>But although this means savers get a higher return on their money, interest rates are not keeping up with rising prices. <br/>This means the value of cash savings - its buying power - is falling in real terms. <br/>The Bank has been putting rates up to combat rising prices - known as inflation.<br/>Prices have been going up quickly worldwide, as Covid restrictions eased and consumers spent more. <br/>Many firms experienced problems getting enough goods to sell. Oil and gas costs were higher than they had been - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. <br/>Although many elements of inflation are global, there are concerns that some are domestic, such as rising wages.<br/>Since the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. Rates were at 0.1% in 2021.<br/>The UK is affected by prices rising across the globe. So there is a limit as to how effective UK interest rate rises will be.<br/>However, other countries are taking a similar approach, and have also been raising interest rates.<br/>The US central bank has announced big rate rises which have taken its key rate to levels not seen for 16 years, although it held them at its last meeting. <br/>The European Central Bank recently raised its main interest rate in Europe by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25%.<br/>Other central banks around the world have also raised rates, as inflation continues to cause problems in a host of major economies. <br/>Why Is UK inflation so high?<br/>Is this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?<br/>Why does the Bank of England change interest rates?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

At the same time, the war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.<br/>The war also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. <br/>This effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of salad and other vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.<br/>Alcohol prices in restaurants and pubs also rose. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>The Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is well above that. <br/>The traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. <br/>This makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. <br/>When people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.<br/>Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. <br/>In May, the Bank increased interest rates for the 12th time in a row, taking the main rate to 4.5%. <br/>But when inflation is caused by factors such as global energy prices, action from the Bank of England may not be enough to slow it down. <br/>Many people's pay isn't keeping up with rising prices. <br/>The average weekly salary in the UK, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3603 in April, up from \u00a3598 in March, according to official figures.<br/>But when you take inflation into account, regular pay actually fell by 1.3% in the three months to April, compared with the same period the year before. <br/>Unions say wages should reflect the cost of living and many workers have been striking over pay. <br/>However, the government argues big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. <br/>Lower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they don't rise as quickly.<br/>When the Bank announced its May interest rate decision, it said headline inflation would \"fall sharply from April\", while warning food price inflation was likely to fall back more slowly than previously expected.<br/>It predicts inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.<br/>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.<br/>In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. <br/>Other countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.<br/>Many of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials and the fallout from Covid.<br/>The annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 6.1% in May, down from 7% in April.<br/>The European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. Its benchmark rate is now 3.5%, the highest it has been for 22 years.<br/>Inflation has also been falling in the US. It was 4% in the 12 months to May, down from 4.9% in April, the 11th consecutive monthly drop. <br/>The US central bank has increased its key interest rate to 5.25%, up from near 0% a year ago - and the highest level since 2007. <br/>However, it left rates unchanged in June, saying it wanted time to assess the impact of the rate rises made so far.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is independent from the government.<br/>It describes its key job as ensuring the UK has secure banknotes, stable prices, a safe banking sector and a resilient financial system. <br/>The Bank has a target to keep inflation - the official measure of how quickly prices are rising - at 2%. <br/>The headline CPI inflation rate has fallen back from a high of 11.1% in October 2022, but in May 2023 the rate was 8.7% - still more than four times the target.<br/>In addition, \"core\" inflation - which excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - rose to 7.1% in May. That was up from 6.8% in April and is the highest level since 1992.<br/>The Bank's traditional response to rising inflation is to increase the UK's official interest rate. <br/>This influences the saving and borrowing rates charged by high street banks to individuals and businesses. <br/>In May, the Bank put up interest rates for the 12th time in a row, increasing them to 4.5%, their highest level for almost 15 years.<br/>Increasing interest rates can mean people are more likely to save money and less likely to borrow it. <br/>In theory, this means they will buy fewer things, especially if they are having to pay more for things like mortgages, which should help prevent prices rising as quickly.<br/>It also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand. <br/>Alternatively, if the Bank cuts interest rates, there is less incentive to save money and borrowing becomes cheaper. <br/>This can encourage businesses to borrow and people to go out and spend more, boosting the economy.<br/>The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets eight times a year to set rates. <br/>Its nine members vote on whether to increase, reduce or hold interest rates. <br/>Minutes of the meeting at which the decision was taken are also published. <br/>Four times a year, the Bank also publishes a Monetary Policy Report, which sets out the economic analysis and inflation projections that the MPC uses to make its interest rate decisions.<br/>The Bank of England also buys and sells government bonds.<br/>Bonds are a bit like an \"I owe you\" from the government, which uses them to raise money to help meet its spending commitments.  <br/>In the period from the 2009 financial crisis until 2021, the Bank of England bought \u00a3875bn of government bonds. This was done through a process called quantitative easing, which was designed to reduce overall government borrowing costs, lower interest rates and stimulate spending in the economy.<br/>The Bank also announced an emergency bond-buying programme to try to stabilise the economy after September 2022's mini-budget caused turmoil on financial markets.<br/>Once that intervention ended, the Bank said it would go ahead with a plan - first announced in August 2022 - to sell off some of the government bonds it holds.<br/>The Bank also:<br/>Andrew Bailey took over as governor in 2019, having already worked at the Bank for more than 30 years. <br/>He was the Bank's chief cashier from January 2004 until April 2011, which meant his signature appeared on billions of UK banknotes.<br/>As well as being responsible for overseeing the Bank, the governor also chairs three important committees that help it work towards its targets: the Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The last year has been one of considerable upheaval in the sector, after many years of ultra-low rates.<br/>The interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers peaked after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but has risen again during the early summer.<br/>That's because wages and prices look like they are rising faster and for longer than thought, and so the Bank of England could keep raising the base rate to 5.5% or more. It is currently 4.5%.<br/>If the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will face higher repayments.<br/>House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.<br/>The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggested that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.<br/>There are still plenty of options depending on your circumstances.

Savings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, in which you only pay interest on the mortgage amount, minus the amount you've saved.<br/>Some borrowers want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total, for longer.<br/>A broker can guide you through the different options.<br/>A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.<br/>But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you.<br/>In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage lenders, has said they must treat customers fairly.<br/>Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help.<br/>Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:<br/>Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period.<br/>Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments.<br/>Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time.<br/>A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely.<br/>Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.<br/>Again, this will show on your credit file. <br/>Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.<br/>Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be.<br/>There are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years.<br/>But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice.<br/>Governments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments.<br/>For people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but only in the form of a loan (which has its own interest rate).<br/>Borrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.<br/>There are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.<br/>The devolved governments run some mortgage support schemes, but the criteria can be complex and they tend to be when people are at risk of homelessness.

It is not only anxious homeowners - tenants are worried their landlords, facing higher rates of their own, will put up their rent.<br/>Here are five reasons for the current commotion.<br/>If forecasts were to be believed, we should be seeing a significant slowdown in price rises. The rate of inflation shows the pace at which prices are going up, and so charts the rising cost of living.<br/>The latest official data spooked markets and lenders though, as it suggested inflation was going to stay higher for longer than anticipated. It also pointed to a theory that higher prices were becoming more embedded in the UK economy.<br/>The premier, if rather blunt, tool to tackle high inflation is for the Bank of England to put up interest rates. With the benchmark rate now expected to peak at 5.5%, rather than the current 4.5%, the cost to lenders would be greater, and so - in turn - they have put up the interest rate they charge for mortgages.<br/>Mohamed El-Erian, former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and president of Queens' College at Cambridge University, says the blame lies with central banks who suggested high inflation would only be temporary. <br/>\"It turned out inflation was persistent and therefore central banks were late and society as a whole was late to adjust to higher inflation,\" he told the BBC.<br/>Two years ago there was a rush from property buyers as tax concessions from ministers to keep the housing market moving during Covid were wound down.<br/>Lower or zero rates on stamp duty, and the equivalent tax in Scotland and Wales, made \"a hot market even hotter\", according to analysts. The pandemic led many people to reconsider where they lived, and stamp duty cuts made them move more quickly.<br/>Many of those buyers got two-year fixed mortgages, which are now due to expire.<br/>The peak for homeowners rolling off fixed mortgage deals is July to October this year, with more than 400,000 expected to do so, according to figures from the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. <br/>The timing isn't great. The rates being offered for a new deal now are considerably higher than back then. That could add hundreds of pounds to a monthly mortgage repayment.<br/>Anil and Jessica Jhamat, from Solihull, are having to find an extra \u00a3550 a month. They bought their home during the stamp duty holiday, which allowed them to purchase \"a house we wouldn't otherwise have been able to afford\".  <br/>\"We assumed interest rates would stay low, otherwise we'd have taken out a five-year fix,\" Mr Jhamat said. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\"<br/>The pharmacist and his wife, a digital manager, also have to find \u00a31,000 a month in childcare fees for their one-year-old son. \"Where we are now, we've lost what we saved [in stamp duty]. Essentially we're back to square one,\" he said.<br/>A mortgage repayment is the highest monthly outgoing for many people, so decisions over which product to choose are made with lots of thought and advice.<br/>The trouble is lenders are currently withdrawing their mortgage products with hardly any notice. That makes for a frenzied situation.<br/>On Thursday, HSBC gave notice to brokers that it was going to pull its deals four hours later. After being inundated with applications, it withdrew them within three hours, only to then temporarily reopen the channel for applications on Friday. <br/>At times like this, big lenders do not want their deals to be significantly cheaper than their rivals, and they only want as many applications as they can cope with.<br/>Justin Moy, founder at Chelmsford-based mortgage broker EHF Mortgages, said: \"These last-minute communications just add to the stress of the situation. Decisions on rate changes and repricing must give everyone the opportunity to react in a controlled manner, especially when the increases are hefty and make a real difference to a borrower.\"<br/>Homeowners who decide the best thing to do is sit on their hands and wait for things to settle down could face a nasty shock.<br/>When a fixed term comes to an end - usually after two or five years - then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). That rate is higher, which is why most people go on to another fixed deal instead, although not everyone has that option as, for example, they may have missed payments in the past.<br/>Brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

We tell our clients how important it is to choose a lender that treats its customers fairly when their rates come to an end,\" says Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.<br/>Many people have been shocked by the rise in mortgage rates since December 2021, because they had grown so accustomed to ultra-low interest rates for the previous decade or more.<br/>A variety of economic, and pandemic, reasons kept interest rates down - at times at historic lows.<br/>Anyone who has bought a first home during that time would never have faced such a situation as now. Rates have been much higher in previous decades, but people are now borrowing more as house prices have soared.<br/>Lenders tested applicants' finances for their ability to cope with higher rates. That is now more reality than theory, and will lead some people to question whether they stretched themselves too far. Analysts say the availability of jobs, and a relative lack of unemployment, has saved many from having to sell up.<br/>The impact is felt by tenants too. Higher costs for landlords will push up rental prices, and would lead to fewer homes being available to rent if they decide to leave the sector.<br/>Read more here<br/>Additional reporting by Jemma Dempsey<br/>Mortgage calculator: Will my payments rise?<br/>Rent prices: Have they gone up in your area?<br/>More pain for renters as landlords look to sell up<br/>How an interest rate rise affects you<br/>HSBC reopens mortgage offers after criticism<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Dr Ken LeDez, a hyperbaric medicine expert at Memorial University in St John's, Newfoundland, has told BBC News that, depending on conditions, some of those aboard could survive longer than expected. <br/>\"It depends on how cold they get and how effective they are at conserving oxygen,\" he said, adding that shivering will use up a lot of oxygen, while wrapping up in a huddle can help to conserve heat. <br/>He said running out of oxygen is a gradual process. \"It's not like switching off a light, it's like climbing a mountain - as the temperature gets colder and metabolism falls [it depends] how fast you ascend that mountain,\" he said. <br/>While admitting that we do not know the full situation inside the submersible, Dr LeDez said conditions could be different person-to-person, and that although it is a \"disturbing conversation\", some could survive longer than others. <br/>On Wednesday, Rear Admiral John Mauger from the US Coast Guard said there were a number of unknowns in the search and rescue mission. <br/>\"We do not know the rate of consumption of oxygen per occupant on the sub,\" Rear Adm Mauger told the BBC. <br/>Dr LeDez also said that running out of oxygen is not the only danger those on board face. <br/>The vessel may have lost electrical power, which is likely to have a role in controlling the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide inside the vessel. <br/>As the oxygen level falls, the proportion of carbon dioxide being breathed out by the crew will be rising, with potentially fatal consequences. <br/>\"As levels of carbon dioxide build up, then it becomes sedative, it becomes like an anaesthetic gas, and you will go to sleep.\"<br/>Too much of the gas in a person's bloodstream, known as hypercapnia, can kill them if not treated. <br/>Former Royal Navy submarine captain Ryan Ramsey says he looked at videos online of the inside of Titan and could not see a carbon dioxide removal system, known as scrubbers.<br/>\"That for me is the greatest problem of all of them,\" he says.<br/>At the same time, the crew are at risk from hypothermia, where the body gets too cold.<br/>According to Capt Ramsey, if the sub is on the seabed, the water temperature will be about 0C. If it has also lost electricity, it will not be generating any power and therefore cannot generate heat. <br/>But hypothermia \"could be their friend\", said Dr LeDez.<br/>\"There is a possibility if they cool down enough and lose consciousness they could live through it - rescuers know this,\" he said, adding that the body will automatically try to adapt to survive.<br/>However on the flip side, hypothermia, the lack of oxygen and the build-up of carbon dioxide within the sub mean the crew's ability to make contact with the search and rescue mission, such as by banging on the hull at regular intervals to try and attract attention, will dwindle. <br/>\"If they're unconscious, they're not going to be able to do much to help themselves,\" says Dr LeDez.<br/>While the Coast Guard has warned there is probably little oxygen left, the crew may be able to conserve their supplies - at least for a while. <br/>Mr Ramsey says slowing their breathing would also help but admits this could be difficult considering the stress they would be under. <br/>Dr LeDez says they could also spread out carbon dioxide-absorbing granules or reduce their power use if they still have electricity.<br/>In terms of food and water, the Coast Guard said the crew had some \"limited rations\" on board but couldn't say how much.<br/>Despite all these challenges, Dr LeDez urges against cancelling the search-and-rescue operation too soon, saying they might be able to survive even when oxygen levels are very low. <br/>\"If anybody can survive in it, you know, it's these individuals,\" he says. \"It just depends on them having power and depends on them having light to be able to find things and make these controls, but absolutely, they could still be alive.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Oliver Slow.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Experts had warned about safety of missing sub<br/>Sub rescuers expand search area as oxygen fears mount<br/>Sounds a glimmer of hope in sub search - but what next?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Some 7,000 women and girls were enslaved and subjected to brutal abuses.<br/>Among them was the young woman whom prosecutors said the accused, named as Nadine K, and her husband used as a slave from 2016, when they moved to the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.<br/>They had travelled to Syria to join IS a year earlier and later moved back there with the woman, who was in her early 20s at the time. <br/>In March 2019, Nadine K and her family were captured by Kurdish forces in Syria.

Economists are divided on how sharp the hike will be, with US-based investment bank Morgan Stanley suggesting an 11.5-point increase to 20%, while Goldman Sachs expects the rate could hit 40%.<br/>Other economists believe the rise will be steep, but possibly more gradual.<br/>President Erdogan's problem is that Turkey's inflation rate remains stubbornly high and its central bank's reserves have fallen to critically low levels, after it spent billions of dollars trying to prop up the lira.<br/>Economists widely advocate raising interests to tackle high inflation, but Turkey's leader sacked three central bank governors in less than two years when they tried to stick to orthodox policies. <br/>Interest rates have come down from 19% two years ago to 8.5% in recent months. Now they are set to rise again, and that will have repercussions for a country already in economic crisis.<br/>\"It is a risk, but it's a difficult circle to square,\" says Ozge Zihnioglu, senior politics lecturer at the University of Liverpool. \"He has to do something for the economy, but a clear shift to orthodox economic policies would hit a large section of society and he wouldn't want to have that impact on local elections [next year].\"<br/>Turkey's economy grew dramatically in the early years of President Erdogan's leadership. But in recent years, he has ditched traditional economic wisdom by blaming high inflation on high borrowing costs and seeking to stimulate economic growth.<br/>In the past five years, the Turkish currency has lost more than 80% of its value and foreign investment has plummeted. Turks are now trying to move foreign cash out of local banks.<br/>Mehmet Kerem Coban of Kadir Has University said Turkey's economic model needed capital to survive because its reserves had melted away.<br/>Mr Erdogan has been in power in Turkey for more than 20 years. He defeated his opposition rival last month in elections that international observers said suffered from an \"unlevel playing field\" that gave the incumbent president an unjustified advantage.<br/>During the election campaign, he maintained his mantra that interest rates would stay low as long as he was in power, guaranteeing that there would be no change in economic policy. The opposition promised to reverse his focus on low interest rates.<br/>And yet within days of his re-election, he signalled a change. <br/>First, he appointed former banker and economist Mehmet Simsek as finance minister. Although a former member of Erdogan's government, Mr Simsek has made clear Turkey's only economic choice is to return to \"rational ground\" and \"compliance with international norms\".<br/>Next, he appointed Hafize Gaye Erkan, 44, as Turkey's first female central bank chief. A well-known figure on Wall Street, she has never had a role in Turkey before and was chief executive of US bank First Republic before its collapse.<br/>Mr Erdogan said last week that his position on interest rates had not changed, but \"we accepted that [Mr Simsek] should take the necessary steps rapidly and effortlessly with the central bank\".<br/>Emerging markets specialist Timothy Ash believes Ms Erkan will have to \"front-load rate hikes\", rather than introduce them gradually. The risk, he warned on Twitter, was that she would share the same fate as a predecessor, \"always playing catch-up with the market and waiting in the ante-room of the presidential palace to plead for rate hikes\".<br/>What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We are in a moment that is equal to World War Two with respect to climate,\" she said.<br/>This week the International Energy Agency warned annual investments in clean energy in developing nations will need to triple from $770bn in 2022 to as much as $2.8tn by the early 2030s if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/>One proposal is that institutions like the World Bank offer cheaper loans for climate action projects.<br/>It is much more expensive to build flood defences in Barbados or Angola than it is in the Netherlands or the UK, Ms Mottley points out. <br/>The same goes for erecting wind turbines or installing solar farms.<br/>That is because low-income countries are charged high interest rates - often two or even three times the rates developed nations face.<br/>Yet the risks of individual projects don't vary anywhere near as much as that. <br/>Another suggestion is that institutions like the World Bank should agree to guarantee loans for climate action in developing nations. That would encourage the private sector to lend at lower interest rates.<br/>Experts say these initiatives could generate hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of loans for climate projects in low-income countries.<br/>Another proposal involves the creation of an auction in which developing nations would bid for cheap finance for climate projects.<br/>This \"Climate Mitigation Trust Fund\" would be funded by tens of billions of dollars' worth of SDRs and overseen by the IMF and the UN.<br/>The winners would be the projects that reduce global warming fastest.  <br/>It is not expected that a final decision will be made on these proposals, but Ms Mottley is confident that progress will be made.<br/>We tell our children we shouldn't put off to tomorrow what we need to do today, Ms Mottley says.<br/>\"I find myself actually repeating a lot of things that we would say to children, in order to inform global behaviour today,\" she continues.  \"That tells us a lot.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Among them was the widely debunked idea that vaccines cause autism.<br/>The controversy has focused attention on Mr Kennedy's anti-vaccine views - something he's mostly avoided talking about on the campaign trail.<br/>Peter Hotez is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and a professor at Baylor College of Medicine. He's also been a guest on Mr Rogan's podcast, but on Twitter called the interview with Mr Kennedy \"just awful\". <br/>The doctor says that prompted a wave of abuse. It also spawned offers by Mr Rogan and others to donate large sums of money to charity if Dr Hotez debates Mr Kennedy about vaccines. <br/>Mr Kennedy tweeted: \"Let's finally have the respectful, congenial, informative debate that the American people deserve.\" <br/>Dr Hotez has so far turned down the offers. In interviews he has said he's willing to appear again on Mr Rogan's show but that he does not want to argue with Mr Kennedy.<br/>Mr Kennedy belongs to America's most famous political family, though he made his own name through legal work for environmental causes. <br/>For years he's also been a major figure in the anti-vaccine movement. In 2005 he published an article in Rolling Stone and Salon, claiming a link between vaccines and autism. It was later withdrawn by both news organisations after criticism and fact-checking.<br/>His profile has been on the rise along with the rest of the anti-vaccine movement, which seized on the Covid pandemic to advance its agenda.<br/>In 2021, Mr Kennedy was named as one of the main spreaders of anti-vaccine falsehoods - one of a so-called \"disinformation dozen\" - in a CCDH report. <br/>Children's Health Defense has sued the BBC and other organisations, alleging that violations of US anti-trust laws resulted in censorship of the group's views<br/>Despite the heightened profile for his foundation, Mr Kennedy has not put his vaccine views at the centre of his campaign for president. <br/>During a nearly two-hour speech to kick off his campaign in April, he criticised Covid lockdowns, government spending, corporate power and Donald Trump. But he only briefly mentioned vaccines and didn't dwell on his anti-vaccination activism.<br/>Likewise, his campaign web site highlights his positions on the environment and civil liberties, rather than the issue that supercharged his popularity on social media and prompted several other Kennedy family members to disavow his campaign.<br/>One simple explanation for the omission is that Mr Kennedy's stances on vaccines are not very popular in his own political party.<br/>Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a non-profit that works against disinformation, told the BBC that \"being an anti-vaxxer is still a minority pursuit in the United States\".<br/>\"So he's sticking to a more general anti-establishment schtick,\" he says. \"He's working really hard to keep people from knowing he's a hardcore anti-vaxxer.\"<br/>Mark Schmitt, a research director at New America, a left-leaning think tank, said Democratic voters \"overwhelming say\" they are in favour of vaccines, including the Covid jab. <br/>Mr Schmitt notes that the picture among Republicans is more mixed, although generally more favourable than not. He credits name recognition with Mr Kennedy's popularity among Democrats. <br/>Mr Kennedy, the 69-year-old son of assassinated Senator Robert F Kennedy, is challenging incumbent Joe Biden. While his campaign is viewed as a long shot, several recent opinion polls suggest he has the support of around 20% of Democratic voters.<br/>\"He's saying, I'm someone fresh but recognisable, I'm not from the establishment but you know my family,\" says Mr Ahmed. <br/>The BBC contacted Spotify, which hosts the podcast, and Mr Kennedy for comment. <br/>Anti-vaccine Kennedy to challenge Biden in 2024<br/>Four claims from Joe Rogan's podcast fact-checked<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The army didn't help us when they started burning [the houses], they could have come in five or 10 minutes\u2026 They gave the settlers the chance to do this,\" said Mr Abdullah.<br/>Another resident said she was visiting the doctor in nearby Ramallah when her children phoned and started screaming.<br/>\"My children were hiding in the basement\u2026 they told me settlers are attacking us, smashing the windows.  The settlers threw Molotov cocktails to burn the house while they were inside. They sneaked out from the balcony while half the settlers were roaming around the house,\" she said.<br/>\"Thank God the youth rushed to help\u2026 Thank God my children are safe,\" she added.<br/>In a statement the Israeli military condemned the violence and said: \"Security forces entered the town in order to extinguish the fires, prevent clashes and to collect evidence. The Israeli civilians exited the town and the Israel Police has opened an investigation into the event.\"<br/>The attacks in Turmusaya followed a night of settler violence elsewhere in the West Bank.<br/>Residents in the village of Al-Lubban Al-Sharqeya said Israeli soldiers and police stood by as a large group of settlers burned a petrol station, orchards, a cement factory and dozens of cars.<br/>Settlements are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.<br/>Attacks by settlers in the West Bank have drawn mounting international concern, particularly following a deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Hawara earlier this year. <br/>In an apparent reference to Wednesday's violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"We will not accept any challenge against the police and the security forces in these places and anywhere.

But there is no way I could say for sure, especially about a person with no ties to reality, who in the 21st Century, launched a full-scale war against their neighbour.\" <br/>I also asked for his reaction to President Putin telling an international conference in St Petersburg last week that he was a disgrace to the Jewish people. Mr Zelensky lost many of his relatives in the Holocaust, including his grandfather, and it was clear that he was taken by surprise by the question.<br/>He took a deep breath, put his head down and a few seconds later said he wasn't quite sure how to answer the question. <br/>\"It's like he doesn't fully understand his words. Apologies, but it's like he is the second king of antisemitism after Hitler. <br/>\"This is a president speaking. A civilised world cannot speak that way.

And it was more than a decade before she would stand outside the US Supreme Court to announce to her triumphant supporters that the nationwide right to abortion had been undone. <br/>But back then, in 2008, the SFLA headquarters were in Arlington, Virginia, and the closest town where Hawkins and her husband could afford to buy a house was 90 minutes away.<br/>At first, she tried the commute, leaving home at 5am and returning at 8pm. But the drives became too much, gas too expensive. <br/>So she bought a cheap loveseat from Ikea, figuring she could put in 30 hours of work over two days before driving home for a night. She used a nearby Gold's Gym for showers, the new couch for naps. When Hawkins found the office was also inhabited by cockroaches, she bought an eye mask and started sleeping with the lights on to keep them away. <br/>\"It was terrible, terrible,\" her husband Jonathan said of that period, which was just two years into their marriage.<br/>But Kristan Hawkins was relentless. And she had a job to do, she was going to see the end of Roe v Wade, overturning the national right to abortion that had been protected for nearly half a century.<br/>Last June, she was successful. Pro-choice advocates say that her activism since then has already helped cut off abortion access for around 20 million women, and pushed the country into a public health crisis. <br/>But Hawkins has a new, more ambitious goal: she wants to make abortion unthinkable and unavailable across the US. <br/>In the year after Roe was overturned, Hawkins has gone into overdrive, growing the size and reach of SFLA and using that power to push state legislatures to pass increasingly severe bans.<br/>\"That's the momentum thing, right? Like, ok, all of America is watching, push the gas pedal down on everything, right now,\" she said. \"More, more, more, more, more.\" <br/>Hawkins, now 38, is bolder and more unyielding than her predecessors, reflective of a new generation of activists moving towards their ultimate goal: a federal abortion ban, beginning at conception. <br/>\"She's representative of the rightward shift in the movement\u2026 and how far the movement can go,\" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a leading expert on the US abortion debate. \"Kristan is really important to understanding what comes next.\"<br/>Hawkins' plans are at odds with public opinion - a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion - and even some Republicans say she is going too far, too fast. <br/>But Roe's reversal, too, was once considered a longshot. And now, one year after its demise, Hawkins believes she will lead the anti-abortion movement to another improbable win. <br/>Most anti-abortion advocates have an origin story, a moment they say set them on a pro-life mission. <br/>Kristan Hawkins' moment came when she was 15. At home in West Virginia, she started volunteering at a crisis pregnancy centre, the type of facility that dissuades women from having abortions by providing pro-life counselling, ultrasounds and material supplies like diapers and wipes.<br/>Before she was allowed to start work, Hawkins had to learn what abortion was, to understand what it looked like. Someone at the clinic gave her a VHS tape of the Silent Scream, a controversial 1984 anti-abortion propaganda film that purported to show a foetus on ultrasound experiencing distress during an abortion at 12 weeks. The film, denounced as a fraud by abortion rights activists, runs counter to findings from leading scientists who say a foetus does not have the capacity to feel pain until at least 24 weeks gestation.<br/>But Hawkins was horrified. She was also incredulous. In her view, she had just encountered the greatest human rights atrocity of our time: the routine killing of \"preborn babies\" - the term she uses to describe foetuses. So why wasn't everyone trying to stop it?<br/>\"I remember that first day at the pregnancy centre, walking out and saying 'Oh my God, how is life going on as normal when this is happening?'\" she said during an interview in May. \"That changed everything.\" <br/>After a summer at the clinic, Hawkins started a community anti-abortion group called Teens for Life. She joined the local Right to Life chapter, she joined the local Republican chapter. \"I was the youngest one there by like four decades,\" she said. <br/>By 2006, after college graduation and short stints at the Republican National Committee and the Department of Health and Human Services, Hawkins was recruited to run Students for Life, then a fledgling organisation with groups on 180 campuses. She was 21. <br/>Seventeen years later, Hawkins remains obsessive, prone to sending colleagues texts and emails at all hours. Her daily schedule, typed into her iPhone, is a nightmare, more than two dozen meetings and commitments blocked off in overlapping intervals. Her days are, occasionally, interrupted by calls from a health coach. \"They're trying to get me to drink water,\" she said. \"I always joke that Students for Life is built on Diet Mountain Dew.\"<br/>She and Jonathan live in an RV with their four children so the entire family can join her on her frequent SFLA excursions. Jonathan, a former teacher, provides homeschooling.<br/>\"I just go with the flow, that's all you can do,\" Jonathan said during a family outing at the Pittsburgh Zoo last month. <br/>\"I think you're sick of the word abortion,\" Kristan said to him later that day. \"When I say it sometimes, I swear I can see you twitch.\"<br/>Watching her with followers and donors, Hawkins is sarcastic and often turns to humour, a sometimes unexpected habit from a woman pushing to outlaw abortion entirely. She also swears a lot and fidgets when she talks. She doesn't have friends, she said, \"in the traditional sense\". <br/>\"Like, I don't have girlfriends I go for brunch with\u2026 what would I talk about besides ending abortion?\" <br/>Hawkins' mission, born that day at the pregnancy centre, has proven to be all consuming, something she is well aware of. She has tried to teach her team the principle of DBW - Don't Be Weird - which is code for: don't freak people out.<br/>\"You have to know when to display your passion,\" she said. \"If you carry around a pocketbook of graphic images of children who've been aborted and whip that out at the dinner table, some people are going to be pretty mad at you.\" <br/>On a swampy June day in Washington, between clusters of teenagers on school trips and tour groups in matching t-shirts, six Students for Life members made their way to Capitol Hill, ready to lobby. <br/>They all wore red, half in SFLA branded clothing - \"The Pro-Life Generation VOTES\" emblazoned on their chests like a cheery warning. One wore a pair of dangly earrings, tiny gold feet meant to match the size of a foetus's foot at 12 weeks. \"It's a picture into their humanity,\" she said. <br/>Groups like this can be found at state legislatures and on college campuses across the US on any given week. Under Hawkins, SFLA has grown into more than 1,400 campus groups in 50 states, overseen by 80 paid staff. Since 2006, more than 160,000 anti-abortion activists have completed SFLA training. Experts say Hawkins' particular power lies in her ability to get people to turn out - SFLA activists are now staples at anti-abortion demonstrations across the country. <br/>\"We launched SFLA to be this post-Roe generation,\" she said. \"We were going to have that trained army.\" <br/>And after Roe's reversal last year, that army has mobilised, helping to steer dozens of anti-abortion bills through state legislatures. So far, 13 Republican-controlled states have outlawed abortion. Bans in at least six other states are in limbo pending legal challenges. <br/>Nearly one-third of American women of reproductive age now live in states where abortion is unavailable or severely restricted, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group. Over the past year, stories have emerged about the apparent consequences of these bans - a 10-year-old rape victim denied an abortion in her home state of Ohio, 13 women in Texas who say they were denied abortions despite life-threatening pregnancy complications - further galvanising support for abortion access.<br/>\"What SFLA and other anti-abortion groups promote is the worst, most damaging, most criminalising policy,\" said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice-president at NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"She [Kristan] is the embodiment of the extremeness of the movement.\" <br/>\"You're making it unsafe to be pregnant in the United States,\" she said. <br/>But where the anti-abortion movement goes now that Roe has been overturned is a matter of debate.  <br/>Hawkins and most other leaders still share a unifying philosophy: a foetus is a rights-holding person. They share an objective too: a federal abortion ban. But there is disagreement on what that ban would look like and how, exactly, to get there.<br/>\"The movement is really fragmented,\" said University of California's Mary Ziegler. \"There is no consensus.\" <br/>SFLA has pushed what they call an \"early abortion model\", drafting and championing legislation that bans abortion at conception or, at the latest, after early cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy. <br/>Hawkins' organisation, in other words, has abandoned the incrementalism that shaped earlier iterations of the anti-abortion movement, a strategy still favoured by some of SFLA's peers. <br/>Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America (SBA) is one such group. A powerful and long-established presence in the anti-abortion lobby, SBA's leader Marjorie Dannenfelser has said she will oppose any presidential candidate who does not embrace a 15-week national ban, a benchmark supported by 44% of Americans, according to a recent poll.<br/>That isn't good enough for Hawkins. Candidates must pledge support for a federal ban at six weeks if they want SFLA's support. <br/>It's a tension Hawkins acknowledges. \"Marjorie is the insider\u2026and I'm the person who comes in and is like, '[Screw] it, we're just doing what we know is right',\" Hawkins said, using an expletive. \"We're not fighting.\"<br/>Hawkins is also more outspoken, more outwardly conservative, on other abortion-related issues. She opposes exceptions for rape and incest. And she opposes several forms of birth control, including oral contraceptives, a position another anti-abortion leader privately called \"unhelpful\". <br/>\"What has changed is they are willing to say the quiet part out loud,\" said Elisabeth Smith, state policy director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a pro-choice group. \"They are willing to be publicly extreme.\" <br/>Hawkins' uncompromising approach worries some Republicans, too. Politicians have been forced to choose between disappointing Hawkins and her allies and alienating a much more moderate electorate. <br/>\"Republicans are politically in a much more defensive position than the Democrats because they keep talking about restrictions that are not supported by most Americans,\" said John Feehery, a former Republican congressional aide. <br/>A predicted red wave at the 2022 midterms seemed to collide with a surge of support for abortion rights, carrying Democrats to unexpected victories in a series of high-profile races. Last year, pro-choice voters swept all six abortion-related ballot measures, including in conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky. <br/>\"Women are watching Republicans post-Roe, and anything short of a compassionate strategy to win back suburban women and swing voters will severely set back the pro-life movement and the party as a whole,\" Nancy Mace, one of the few House Republicans who has publicly called for more flexibility on abortion, told the BBC in a statement. <br/>But Hawkins does not see the Republican party as her problem. She has little patience for politicians she deems insufficiently pro-life, threatening primary challenges against Republicans who do not support early bans. <br/>Merv Riepe, a Nebraska state senator who voted against a six-week ban this year, \"is going to be retired pretty soon\", Hawkins said. <br/>The three female Republican senators in South Carolina who opposed an outright ban face the same threat. Two supported a six-week ban, but that was not sufficient for Hawkins. Each of them was sent a plastic infant-size spine from SFLA earlier this year, with a note suggesting they grow a backbone.<br/>\"I think that's the difference between us and other pro-life organisations,\" Hawkins said. \"I don't really care if so-and-so in Washington, DC, isn't happy with me. It doesn't even earn me any points in my demographic.\"<br/>That approach - aggressive, uncompromising - has fuelled her dominance among anti-abortion activists, now lurching to the right in the absence of Roe. <br/>\"The movement as a whole is moving towards asking for more extreme bans,\" said Zelly Martin, a researcher at University of Texas' propaganda lab, who specialises in the US abortion debate. \"They feel like now that we don't have Roe protecting abortion why would we pull back? And I think Kristan Hawkins is a big part of that.\"  <br/>Just how far Hawkins will get - how close to abolishing abortion she will come - remains an open question. <br/>\"I don't see a point in American history where Americans are going to want an absolute ban on abortion,\" Ziegler said. \"There is no sign of that.\"<br/>But Hawkins and others are exploring ways to bypass both public opinion and political resistance, Zieger said. One, perhaps the most feasible, would be to ask the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to recognise foetal personhood under the Constitution. <br/>It seems improbable, but those are odds Hawkins is used to. <br/>Last month, in Northville, Michigan, Hawkins stood in a small first-floor conference room, neat rows of potential donors sitting in front of her. She began her speech with an anecdote from early in her career. <br/>A pro-life mentor had offered Hawkins some unsolicited advice: stop saying \"when\" Roe v Wade is overturned. By assuming Roe's demise, he cautioned, she sounded \"too immature, too naive\". <br/>Hawkins ignored him. She told her staff to double down, boost their messaging that promised to send Roe to the \"ash heap of history\". <br/>\"I always tell our team: winners envision the win.\" <br/>Thousands gather for first post-Roe March for Life<br/>How abortion became 'winning issue' in US election<br/>US Supreme Court preserves abortion drug access<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry.<br/>Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (584,000 hectares) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government.<br/>Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security.<br/>\"[The canals] primarily irrigate summer planted crops\u2026 like corn, soy beans, some sunflower. But they also irrigate some wheat, which is a winter crop, and then a lot of vegetables and fruit like melons,\" she said. <br/>While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water.<br/>Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become.<br/>Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator for the UN, previously told the BBC there would be a \"huge impact on global food security\" as a result of the destruction of the dam, describing the area as \"a breadbasket not only for Ukraine but also for the world\".<br/>Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries, which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain.<br/>Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area.<br/>\"Now the water level has dropped, the water simply does not reach the [canal] systems. To raise it, we need to rebuild the dam,\" according to Mykola Solskyi, Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.<br/>Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels.<br/>\"There's now a whole downstream catchment of the river that is not controlled,\" said Jaap Flikweert, a flood and coastal management advisor at engineering consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV. \"In the wetter periods flood waves will just come through.\"<br/>Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level.<br/>\"I expect those tens of thousands of people who were evacuated will have to stay away for a while as long as those solutions are not in place.

Clashes between the majority Meitei and Kuki communities have left more than 100 dead and over 400 wounded. <br/>Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and taken shelter in some 350 camps. Some 40,000 security forces - army soldiers, paramilitaries, police - are struggling to quell the violence. Only a quarter of the more than 4,000 weapons looted by mobs from police armouries have been voluntarily returned since the violence began. <br/>The level of mistrust between the warring communities has sharpened, with both accusing security forces of being partisan. More than 200 churches and 17 temples have been destroyed or damaged by mobs. Homes of local ministers and legislators have been attacked and set on fire.  <br/>Normal life has been strangled: a night curfew continues in most of the 16 districts; schools are shut and internet services have been suspended. A main highway for ferrying supplies has been blocked by protesters. There are sporadic killings and arson. The federal government's proposal for a peace panel to broker a truce has received a tepid response. <br/>\"This is the darkest moment in Manipur's history,\" says Binalakshmi Nepram of Northeast India Women Initiative for Peace. \"In two days [when the violence began], homes were burnt and people were lynched, burnt and tortured. Manipur has not seen this kind and type of violence in its modern history.\"<br/>Eight states in India's restive and remote north-eastern region are home to some 45 million people belonging to more than 400 communities. More than a dozen peace talks trying to mediate between groups across the region have been dragging on for years. Nestling along the border with Myanmar, Manipur is no stranger to ethnic violence. <br/>With some 33 ethnic tribes, the state is extremely diverse - and sharply divided. It is home to some 40 insurgent groups. Meitei, Naga and Kuki rebels have waged prolonged armed campaigns, frequently targeting Indian security forces, in protest against controversial anti-insurgent laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which grants search and seizure powers to the security forces. Meitei, Naga and Kuki militias have also fought one another over conflicting homeland demands.<br/>The majority Meiteis make up more than half of Manipur's estimated 3.3 million people. Some 43% of the people are Kukis and Nagas, the two predominant tribal communities, who live in the rolling hills. Most Meiteis follow the Hindu faith, while most Kukis adhere to Christianity. <br/>Previous ethnic - and religious - clashes in Manipur have claimed hundreds of lives. \"This time, the conflict is strictly rooted in ethnicity, not religion,\" says Dhiren A Sadokpam, editor of The Frontier Manipur.<br/>May's large-scale violence was sparked by a controversy over affirmative action: Kukis protested against the demand seeking tribal status for the Meiteis. But this does not entirely explain the explosive ethnic violence that has engulfed Manipur. <br/>The underlying tensions in the region stem from a complex interplay of various factors, including a long-standing insurgency, a controversial recent war on drugs, illegal migration from troubled Myanmar through porous borders, pressure on land, and a lack of employment opportunities, which make the young vulnerable to recruitment by rebel groups. <br/>Adding to the volatility, say experts, is the alleged complicity of politicians in the drug trade over decades and the nexus between politicians and militancy. <br/>The Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP-led) government of Manipur, under Chief Minister N Biren Singh, who is a Meitei, has launched a controversial \"war on drugs\" campaign targeting farming of poppy. Since 2017, the government claims to have destroyed more than 18,000 acres of poppy fields, the majority of them in Kuki-inhabited areas. (Manipur has battled a drug-addiction crisis and is among four north-eastern Indian states bordering Myanmar, the world's second-largest opium producer.)<br/>Mr Singh's campaign appears to have exacerbated divisions between a section of Kukis and the government. He has cautioned that villages growing poppy - mostly Kuki homelands - would be derecognised and stripped of welfare benefits. <br/>In March, he told a news channel that his government had gone all out against \"some Kukis who were encroaching everywhere, protected forests, reserved forests, doing poppy plantations and doing drugs business\". The same month, Kukis held mass protests in hill districts against what they called the BJP government's \"selective targeting\" of the community. Mr Singh's government accused Kuki insurgent groups of inciting the community. <br/>There is also a lot of pressure on land in Manipur - about 60% of the population lives on just 10% of the state's land in Imphal, a valley. The Meiteis resent the fact that they and other non-tribal people are not allowed to buy land or settle in the hill districts. They also want to prevent unrestricted entry of \"outsiders\" - settlers from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar - whose numbers they believe have sharply risen over the years. <br/>A Kuki tradition of migrating across extensive territories - as land ownership exclusively passes down to the eldest son of the village chief - has led to new villages being set up by other male members of the family and put further pressure on land. <br/>\"This mistrust between people here has been weaponised,\" Ms Nepram says. \"Rather than putting out the conflict, small ethnic groups have been armed and trained by Delhi [to fight insurgency] over decades as well as by those who are into guns, drugs and human trafficking.\"<br/>That's not all. There's a dispute over two hills in the state, with conflicting claims of ownership from the Meiteis and Kukis. The Meiteis regard the hills as sacred, whereas the Kukis perceive the land beneath the hills as their ancestral territory which is facing encroachment. <br/>\"For the past five years there has been growing animosity and anger between the two communities, some related to indigenous faith and practices and others related to encroachment,\" says Bhagat Oinam of Jawaharlal Nehru University.<br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for maintaining a studied silence on the violence. The majority of ministers and legislators from the governing BJP have gathered in Delhi, the capital, to devise strategies for resolving and managing the situation. <br/>Kukis have demanded Delhi impose direct rule, and sought a separate administration for the community, a demand that carries the potential for backlash from the Nagas, who might also pursue a similar demand. \"Let us live in peace in our own land with our own people. Let us rule ourselves. After what has happened that is how we define peace,\" says Mary Haokip of the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum and a Kuki. <br/>Ten of the 60 elected lawmakers in Manipur's assembly are Kukis, as are three ministers in Mr Singh's 10-member cabinet. \"There exists some political and administrative connection between the two communities. However, the growing alienation between them seems to be driving them further apart,\" says Kaybie Chongloi, a Kuki journalist. <br/>The lack of trust has resulted in a significant divide, leaving lawmakers and ministers from the ruling party, representing both communities, unable to find common ground. \"This is not only a civil war but also a [fight] against the government,\" says Alex Jamkothang, a Kuki villager who lost his brother in the violence, in an interview with BBC Hindi.<br/>Giving autonomy to tribal groups could be a way to defuse the crisis, says Subir Bhaumik, author of Insurgent Crossfire: North-East India. He cites the example of the north-eastern state of Tripura where a third of the population are recognised as tribespeople and collectively govern two-thirds of the state's land area through an 'autonomous district council'.<br/>Others like Ms Nepram seek a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including panels for reparations for homes burnt and lives lost in the conflict. Still others fear that Manipur will degenerate into a full-blown civil war unless there is a serious initiative for an \"inter-faith, inter-ethnic dialogue\". \"Nothing of this sort is being attempted,\" Mr Bhaumik says. <br/>Clearly, peace in Manipur has always been precarious. Much of the peace in recent years was not organic, says Mr Sadokpam. \"It was what we call an imposed peace in a heavily militarised zone.\" For the moment, there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel as both sides appear to be digging in for a long confrontation. People remember clashes between Nagas and Kukis in the early 1990s which dragged on for a year before ebbing. <br/>\"I don't think this is going to end soon. This will go on until both sides get fatigued - or one side gains dominance,\" says a senior government functionary in Imphal, who refused to be named. \"This is going to be a long haul.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

In this war, would the Kremlin go nuclear?<br/>President Joe Biden isn't ruling it out.<br/>\"I worry about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons,\" the US president said this week. He believes the danger is \"real\".<br/>I don't know whether President Biden reads the Russian magazine Profile. If he does, you can understand why he's worried. <br/>Last week, Profile published an article by prominent Russian foreign and defence policy expert Sergei Karaganov. The hawkish Mr Karaganov is honorary chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy. In short, he's well-connected to those in power here.<br/>His argument goes like this. In order to \"break the West's will\", Russia \"will have to make nuclear deterrence a convincing argument again by lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons\".<br/>\"The enemy must know that we are ready to deliver a pre-emptive strike in retaliation for all of its current and past acts of aggression in order to prevent a slide into global thermonuclear war.<br/>\"But what if they do not back down? In this case, we will have to hit a bunch of targets in a number of countries in order to bring those who have lost their mind to reason.\"<br/>Since last year, we've grown used to nuclear sabre-rattling from Moscow. <br/>And President Putin has confirmed that Russia has already stationed a first batch of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, a move the Russian leader says is designed to remind anyone \"thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat on us\".<br/>But arguing the pluses of a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the West? That's a whole new level.<br/>Clearly, not everyone in Russia is on board with such an idea.<br/>Today's edition of the business daily Kommersant features an article entitled \"Nuclear War is a bad way of resolving problems\".<br/>Understatement of all time, maybe. But what's fascinating about this piece is that it suggests the debate in Russia about when or whether to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine has burst into the public domain. And the hawks don't have it all their way. <br/>Penned by another group of Moscow-based foreign and defence policy experts, the Kommersant article explains why they believe Sergei Karaganov has got it wrong. Dangerously wrong. <br/>\"The idea that the use of nuclear weapons can halt escalation and resolve strategic problems that conventional military means have failed to is extremely dubious and, most likely, mistaken,\" write Alexei Arbatov, Konstantin Bogdanov and Dmitry Stefanovich from the Centre for International Security - part of a think tank within the Russian Academy of Science. <br/>\"In modern history, there are many examples of military operations leading to unforeseen consequences. But these were without nuclear weapons being used. A nuclear strike would raise the conflict to a whole new level of unpredictability and raise the stakes of confrontation many times over.<br/>\"The radioactive ruins that playing 'nuclear roulette' would most likely lead to are the worst foundation for a bright future. Fans of sensationalist ideas and dangerous gambling would be best to remember that.\"<br/>Which brings us to another question we've been asking since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine: what on Earth is going on? <br/>It's possible that Mr Karaganov's proposal for a pre-emptive nuclear strike was so shocking that other Russian academics felt they just couldn't stay silent.<br/>If so, it shows that although the Russian media landscape is now heavily controlled by the state, even within current confines, there is still room on some platforms for limited debate and discussion on certain topics. Especially such crucial topics as nuclear war.<br/>Or it may be that this whole debate is designed to grab the West's attention, to make President Putin look like good cop to Mr Karaganov's bad cop. <br/>After all, the Kremlin leader himself hasn't called for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the West. And so - the argument goes - better sit down and make peace with him, before hardliner Karaganovites win the day and press the nuclear button.<br/>One thing's clear: with anti-Western rhetoric in Russia rising, and with the Ukrainian army's counter-offensive under way, the nuclear question isn't going away. <br/>Putin confirms first nuclear weapons moved to Belarus<br/>Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?<br/>Zelensky admits slow progress in Ukraine offensive<br/>On the front line as Ukraine attacks Russian trenches<br/>Do Russians really hate the West?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said his warnings were ignored and called a meeting with OceanGate bosses but was fired, according to the documents.<br/>The company sued him for revealing confidential information, and he countersued for unfair dismissal. The lawsuit was later settled but we don't know the details of the settlement. <br/>The BBC tried to contact Mr Lochridge but he is not commenting. <br/>Separately, a letter sent to OceanGate by the Marine Technology Society (MTS) in March 2018 and obtained by the New York Times, stated \"the current 'experimental' approach adopted by OceanGate... could result in negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)\".<br/>A spokesman for OceanGate declined to comment on the safety issues raised by Mr Lochridge and the MTS.<br/>The Titan submersible, described as \"experimental\" by the company, was built from an unusual material for a deep sea vessel. <br/>Its hull - surrounding the hollow part where passengers sit - was made from carbon fibre, with titanium end plates and a small window at one end.<br/>\"Typically, the part of deep-sea submersible housing the humans is a titanium sphere around 2m in diameter,\" said Dr Nicolai Roterdam, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth.<br/>To withstand the immense pressures of the deep you need super-strong materials, to resist the weight of water above that's pressing down on you.   <br/>Carbon fibre is cheaper than titanium or steel and is extremely strong, but it is largely untested for deep sea vessels like the Titan.<br/>In an interview with Oceanographic last year, OceanGate's CEO Rush Stockton said: \"Carbon fibre is used successfully in yachts and in aviation, but it has not been used in crewed submersibles.\" <br/>In the court documents, Mr Lochridge claimed the hull had not been properly tested - where it's placed under extreme pressures and analysed to look for potential problems. <br/>He claimed that trials on a smaller scale model of the sub had revealed flaws in the carbon under pressure testing.   <br/>Mr Lochridge also raised the issue of the Titan's glass viewport. He claimed the company that made the material would only certify its use down to 1,300m.<br/>A December 2018 statement from OceanGate said the Titan had completed a 4,000 meter dive which \"completely validates OceanGate's innovative engineering and the construction of Titan's carbon fiber and titanium hull\".<br/>In a 2020 interview with GeekWire, Mr Rush said tests were conducted which revealed that the Titan's hull \"showed signs of cyclic fatigue\". <br/>In a May 2021 court filing, the company said Titan had undergone more than 50 test dives, including to the equivalent depth of the Titanic, in deep waters off the Bahamas and in a pressure chamber.<br/>The shape of the Titan is also unusual.<br/>The hull of a deep-diving sub is usually spherical, which means it receives an equal amount of pressure at every point, but Titan's hull is tube-shaped, so the pressure would not be equally distributed.<br/>\"Titan is quite a different deep-sea submersible compared to those used in research,\" said Dr Roterman.<br/>\"Whether or not this design with composite materials represents a structural weakness would be for engineers to determine, however,\" she added.<br/>In the court documents, Mr Lochridge also said he had urged OceanGate to get the submarine inspected and certified. <br/>Subs can be certified or \"classed\" by marine organisations - for example by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) or DNV (a global accreditation organisation based in Norway) or Lloyd's Register. <br/>This essentially means that the vehicle must meet certain standards on aspects including stability, strength, safety and performance.<br/>The process involves reviewing the design and construction, assessing testing and trials to be certified. And once the sub is in service it needs to be checked periodically to ensure it still meets these criteria. <br/>But certification of subs isn't mandatory. <br/>Titan was never certified or classed - as the company wrote a blog post about it in 2019.<br/>It said the way that Titan had been designed fell outside the accepted system - but it \"does not mean that OceanGate does meet standards where they apply.\" <br/>It added that the classing agencies \"slowed down innovation\u2026 bringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation\". <br/>A CBS reporter who went on the Titan in 2022 quoted a waiver people signed before boarding as stating it was \"an experimental submersible vessel that has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body which could result in physical injury, emotional trauma or death.\"  <br/>Any sub that dives over 4,000m is a one-off vehicle - not something mass-produced - and requires innovation and novel design to survive at these depths. <br/>But that doesn't mean this falls outside the classing system.   <br/>Take for example the sub called the Limiting Factor. This vessel, designed by Triton submarines, has repeatedly travelled to the very deepest places in the ocean - performing many dives to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which lies 11km down.<br/>It's a truly unique and cutting-edge vessel - but the team behind it collaborated with the DNV classing agency from design, through to construction and testing. And the Limiting Factor is fully certified to repeatedly - and safely - dive to any depth in the ocean.<br/>Additional reporting by Thomas Spencer.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That was met with surprise by analysts who had expected it to fall.<br/>The shock figure was driven by higher prices for flights and second-hand cars but supermarket food prices also continued to rise rapidly.<br/>So-called \"core\" inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as direct energy and food prices, along with alcohol and tobacco prices, continued to rise last month at its fastest rate for 31 years.<br/>Economists said this made the UK stand out from other countries such as the US and Germany where inflation is falling.<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared to back further interest rate rises saying it would not \"hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy\".<br/>The government's target is to halve the inflation rate to 5% by the end of the year. The official, long-term target set for the Bank is 2%.<br/>Rob Morgan, from investment firm Charles Stanley, said: \"Getting the inflation genie back into the bottle is proving troublesome for the Bank of England.<br/>\"With price momentum continually running above expectations alongside strong wages data, the Bank has no choice but to continue on a path of raising interest rates several more times.\"<br/>When interest rates rise, a range of loans can get more expensive. More than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate mortgage deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments. <br/>The increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.<br/>This comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.<br/>If the rate goes up to 5%, those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a347 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a330 jump.<br/>Eight out of 10 mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage. Their monthly payments may not change immediately, but house buyers or anyone seeking to remortgage face a sharp rise in repayments when they move on to a new deal. <br/>The so-called \"mortgage bomb\" has become a huge economic and political issue. An average two-year fixed deal, which was 2.29% in November 2021, is now above 6%.<br/>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a politically independent economics-focused think tank, says rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable incomes fall by more than 20%.<br/>Renters are also feeling the impact. \"It is likely that at least part of the increases in rents we are seeing is due to high interest rates hitting landlords' borrowing costs,\" the IFS said.<br/>Rents have been growing faster than wages in the UK for nearly two years, according to exclusive data given to the BBC by property portal Zoopla. <br/>Meanwhile, savers should benefit from a rise in interest rates, but MPs on the Treasury Committee have criticised banks and building societies for failing to pass this on in full to loyal savers who have instant-access savings accounts.<br/>How are interest rate rises affecting you?

The deals being offered now are better than anything seen for years.<br/>Analysts say that people should shop around for a better savings rate, with many paid little or nothing in interest in many accounts. Major banks have been under pressure from MPs to pass on rate rises.<br/>But although this means savers get a higher return on their money, interest rates are not keeping up with rising prices. <br/>This means the value of cash savings - its buying power - is falling in real terms. <br/>The Bank has been putting rates up to combat rising prices - known as inflation.<br/>Prices have been going up quickly worldwide, as Covid restrictions eased and consumers spent more. <br/>Many firms experienced problems getting enough goods to sell. Oil and gas costs were higher than they had been - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. <br/>Although many elements of inflation are global, there are concerns that some are domestic, such as rising wages.<br/>Since the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. Rates were at 0.1% in 2021.<br/>The UK is affected by prices rising across the globe. So there is a limit as to how effective UK interest rate rises will be.<br/>However, other countries are taking a similar approach, and have also been raising interest rates.<br/>The US central bank has announced big rate rises which have taken its key rate to levels not seen for 16 years, although it held them at its last meeting. <br/>The European Central Bank recently raised its main interest rate in Europe by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25%.<br/>Other central banks around the world have also raised rates, as inflation continues to cause problems in a host of major economies. <br/>Why Is UK inflation so high?<br/>Is this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?<br/>Why are interest rates going up?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

By the time they come back to us the mortgage deal could be gone.\"<br/>He said the past week had been the most difficult since starting the job 14 years ago, with lenders partially to blame. <br/>He said lenders would historically give two or three days' notice before pulling a deal, but recently many had been removed within hours. <br/>\"Lenders, I like to think, could do better. As brokers now we're trying to start a petition to say we need a minimum of 48 hours' notice [before deals are pulled].\"<br/>Almost a quarter of fixed-term mortgages in Wales are expected to end this year, data shared with Wales Live shows. <br/>About 36,000 of these - 12% of all 291,000 fixed-term mortgages in Wales - are set to expire in the second half of this year. <br/>One of those is Nicholai Rider, 45, from Denbigh, who said if interest rates continued to rise his family faced either selling their home or going into debt to make ends meet. <br/>He and his wife bought their three-bedroom house in 2021 after finding out they were expecting a second child. <br/>In order to find a home within their budget they opted to buy a property which needed major renovation works, but the rising cost-of-living meant the heating was switched off for most of the winter. <br/>Their current fixed-rate mortgage deal runs until December. <br/>Mr Rider said he expected their mortgage repayments to rise between \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 a month depending on whether they locked in a rate now by paying a penalty fee.<br/>\"It feels like gambling.

But Prime Minister Mr Sunak hit back, citing \"the global macroeconomic situation\" and saying it had spent \"tens of billions\" supporting people with the cost of living.<br/>Interest rates are widely expected to rise by 0.25% to 4.75% on Thursday but some suggest they could now go up to 5%. Rising rates mean homeowners are facing big increases in mortgage payments.<br/>Influential think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned higher rates would result in a drop of more than 20% in disposable income for 1.4 million mortgage holders.<br/>Karen Ward, a member of chancellor Jeremy Hunt's economic advisory council, said the Bank had \"been too hesitant\" in its interest rate rises so far and called on it to \"create a recession\" to curb soaring prices. <br/>\"It's only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think 'Well, maybe I won't put through that price rise', or workers, when they're a little bit less confident about their job, think 'Oh, I won't push my boss for that higher pay,'\" she told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>But Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, a wholesale food supplier said increasing interest rates was \"not the right thing to do\".<br/>\"It's stifling the economy.

It has been steadily raising interest rates since the end of 2021. This makes it more expensive to borrow money and theoretically encourages people to borrow less and spend less, meaning price rises should ease.<br/>Homeowners - a third of adults in the UK - are facing large increases in repayments when fixed-term deals come to an end.

Inflation isn't just stubborn, or sticky. It is, on the latest numbers, stuck. These figures should be falling by now, and they are in other countries such as the US and Germany.  <br/>My inbox was deluged with instant takes at 7am ranging from \"unfortunate\" to \"challenging\" to \"disaster\".<br/>Over the past 18 months the Governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC workers should not ask for excessive pay rises and companies should not hike prices too much either. <br/>Core inflation, a measure of underlying and ongoing inflationary pressure that strips out month to month volatility, is, however, going up, even as it is in decline elsewhere in other major economies. The polite requests have not worked.<br/>The response of Karen Ward, a respected City economist who serves on the chancellor's council of advisers that the Bank of England \"has to create a recession\" partly to \"nip in the bud\" a spiral of wages going up and in turn pushing up prices, and then pushing up wages again.<br/>\"It's only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think 'Well, maybe I won't put through that price rise', or workers, when they're a little bit less confident about their job, think 'Oh, I won't push my boss for that higher pay,'\" she told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>She said out loud what the Treasury cannot say out loud but has implied in repeated interviews - people have to feel the pain for interest rate rises to work. The Chancellor again said he would support the Bank of England in its decisions - making clear his support for further rate rises. But any hope of a controlled economic descent with plenty of distance ahead of an election late next year, now looks fraught.<br/>But it is not just about the specific decision on Thursday, but about the path of interest rates for the next two years. The markets are pretty openly questioning whether the Bank is in full command over where inflation is going. Financial markets and banks are effectively pushing up fixed term mortgage rates, without waiting for actual Bank of England decisions.<br/>But the unflattering international comparison also shows a limit to how much the government can blame everything on \"global factors\". Continental Europe was particularly hit by surging energy prices in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, the rest of the world by food prices, and the US by a worker shortages. The UK still suffers from a cocktail of all three.<br/>And the government's own post Brexit policies on trade and workers may have lessened competitive pressures that would in the past have brought inflation down more rapidly.<br/>Wednesday's number shows that the already tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.

Economists are divided on how sharp the hike will be, with US-based investment bank Morgan Stanley suggesting an 11.5-point increase to 20%, while Goldman Sachs expects the rate could hit 40%.<br/>Other economists believe the rise will be steep, but possibly more gradual.<br/>President Erdogan's problem is that Turkey's inflation rate remains stubbornly high and its central bank's reserves have fallen to critically low levels, after it spent billions of dollars trying to prop up the lira.<br/>Economists widely advocate raising interests to tackle high inflation, but Turkey's leader sacked three central bank governors in less than two years when they tried to stick to orthodox policies. <br/>Interest rates have come down from 19% two years ago to 8.5% in recent months. Now they are set to rise again, and that will have repercussions for a country already in economic crisis.<br/>\"It is a risk, but it's a difficult circle to square,\" says Ozge Zihnioglu, senior politics lecturer at the University of Liverpool. \"He has to do something for the economy, but a clear shift to orthodox economic policies would hit a large section of society and he wouldn't want to have that impact on local elections [next year].\"<br/>Turkey's economy grew dramatically in the early years of President Erdogan's leadership. But in recent years, he has ditched traditional economic wisdom by blaming high inflation on high borrowing costs and seeking to stimulate economic growth.<br/>In the past five years, the Turkish currency has lost more than 80% of its value and foreign investment has plummeted. Turks are now trying to move foreign cash out of local banks.<br/>Mehmet Kerem Coban of Kadir Has University said Turkey's economic model needed capital to survive because its reserves had melted away.<br/>Mr Erdogan has been in power in Turkey for more than 20 years. He defeated his opposition rival last month in elections that international observers said suffered from an \"unlevel playing field\" that gave the incumbent president an unjustified advantage.<br/>During the election campaign, he maintained his mantra that interest rates would stay low as long as he was in power, guaranteeing that there would be no change in economic policy. The opposition promised to reverse his focus on low interest rates.<br/>And yet within days of his re-election, he signalled a change. <br/>First, he appointed former banker and economist Mehmet Simsek as finance minister. Although a former member of Erdogan's government, Mr Simsek has made clear Turkey's only economic choice is to return to \"rational ground\" and \"compliance with international norms\".<br/>Next, he appointed Hafize Gaye Erkan, 44, as Turkey's first female central bank chief. A well-known figure on Wall Street, she has never had a role in Turkey before and was chief executive of US bank First Republic before its collapse.<br/>Mr Erdogan said last week that his position on interest rates had not changed, but \"we accepted that [Mr Simsek] should take the necessary steps rapidly and effortlessly with the central bank\".<br/>Emerging markets specialist Timothy Ash believes Ms Erkan will have to \"front-load rate hikes\", rather than introduce them gradually. The risk, he warned on Twitter, was that she would share the same fate as a predecessor, \"always playing catch-up with the market and waiting in the ante-room of the presidential palace to plead for rate hikes\".<br/>What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The service, which offers shipping perks, access to streaming movies and more, costs $139 a year or $14.99 monthly in the US and \u00a395 per year in the UK. <br/>The FTC said Amazon used website designs that pushed customers into agreeing to enrol in Prime and have the subscription automatically renew as they were making purchases. <br/>The company attempted to make it difficult for users to opt out of auto-enrolment because \"those changes would also negatively affect Amazon's bottom line\", the agency alleged in the complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle. <br/>It also said Amazon put customers seeking to cancel through a cumbersome \"four-page, six-click, fifteen option\" process, which the FTC said was known internally as \"Iliad\" in a nod to the Greek epic about the \"long, arduous Trojan War\". <br/>Though Amazon altered the cancellation process shortly before the lawsuit was filed, the FTC said the company's tactics broke laws aimed at protecting shoppers.<br/>\"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said.<br/>The FTC is seeking a court order to force Amazon to change its practices, as well as financial penalties in an unspecified amount.<br/>Amazon said it had been in the middle of discussing the issues with the agency when the lawsuit was filed without notice. <br/>\"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,\" the company said. <br/>The FTC has repeatedly warned online firms against using \"dark patterns\" to manipulate shoppers.<br/>It had been investigating Amazon's Prime programme since 2021.<br/>It said the company had attempted to delay the probe on multiple occasions, including by refusing to deliver documents in a timely manner. <br/>Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Insider Intelligence analyst said the FTC was \"making an example of Amazon\".<br/>\"It's quite common for companies to make it more difficult to cancel an account than it is to create one,\" she said.<br/>Ms Khan, who was appointed to her post by President Joe Biden, made her name critiquing US competition policy related to Amazon.<br/>She has promised to move more aggressively to police online shopping and the power of America's tech giants. <br/>The lawsuit marks the third action from the FTC involving Amazon in recent weeks.<br/>The company agreed to pay $25m last month to settle charges it had violated child privacy laws by keeping recordings children made on Alexa. <br/>It agreed to pay another $5.8m to resolve claims that Ring, the doorbell company Amazon purchased in 2018, had violated privacy protections by giving staff unrestricted access to customer videos and failing to implement precautions against hackers. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It said people aged between 30 and 39 would typically pay about \u00a3360 more.<br/>Overall, 60% of those with a mortgage - 8.5 million adults - are set to spend more than a fifth of their incomes on mortgage payments, the IFS said.<br/>\"This is a substantial increase. In March 2022, only 36% of mortgagors were in this position. It also higher than in 2007-08,\" it added.<br/>But the think tank pointed out while a third of all adults aged 20 and over have a mortgage, many are on fixed rate deals so have been shielded by rate rises, although around a quarter of such deals are due to finish by the end of this year, exposing people to higher costs.<br/>\"For some the rise will be substantially larger: almost 1.4 million - 690,000 of whom are under 40 - will see their disposable incomes fall by over 20%,\" the IFS said.<br/>The Bank of England has been hiking interest rates since December 2021 in a bid to slow the rate prices are rising at. The Bank's base rate, which is used by lenders to set interest rates on mortgages, loans and credit cards, but also for savings accounts, is currently 4.5%.<br/>In theory, raising interest rates makes it more expensive for people to borrow and they have less money to spend, meaning households will buy fewer things and then price rises will ease.<br/>But inflation has not been falling as fast as hoped, and there have been calls for the Bank to be more aggressive with interest rates.<br/>In recent weeks, lenders have been pulling deals and putting up rates at short notice in expectation of interest rates being hiked again. <br/>On Wednesday, the average rate on a two-year fixed deal rose to 6.15%. In March 2022 it was 2.65%.<br/>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), which campaigns for people on low-incomes, said its research had found almost three-quarters of low-income households with a mortgage reported going in some cases without showers or had experienced \"food insecurity\" in the past month. <br/>Alfie Stirling, JRF chief economist, said there was a \"strong case\" for the Bank to \"take a pause for breath\" and avoid raising rates until the impact of previous hikes had been fully felt.<br/>\"Rising interest rates won't prevent the UK becoming poorer, they merely reflect a choice over how and where the economic pain is felt; taking some of the hit away from faster price increases, towards those with debts, and ultimately hitting pay growth and job creation for us all,\" he said.<br/>\"It is a balancing act, which if misjudged, risks converting a medium-term price shock into a horrendous new normal for those who can least afford it.\"<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ruled out the government introducing major financial support to mortgage holders over fears it would \"make inflation worse, not better\".<br/>But he said he would meet lenders later to ask what help they could give to households struggling.<br/>Ewan Cameron bought a flat in London two years ago and has just managed to secure a new fixed deal, but not before he had two mortgage offers pulled. <br/>He has now got to find an extra \u00a3400 a month to pay for his home, and is considering renting out the spare room to help pay for it.<br/>\"I remember speaking to a friend who bought at roughly the same time and he locked into a five year mortgage, we both joked about who would end up on the better end of the spectrum in a couple of years' time - he's certainly the one laughing and I'm certainly the one paying the price,\" he said.<br/>The IFS said the UK's benefits system currently provides \"relatively little support for low income mortgagors compared to what's on offer for low income renters\".<br/>It said this meant there was \"not much of a safety net for those who are particularly likely to struggle with rate rises\".<br/>As well as different age groups being impacted by higher borrowing costs, the think tank said there were also differences in where people lived.<br/>For example, it said average rises ranged from just over \u00a3150 in Northern Ireland to \u00a3390 per month in the South East and \u00a3520 in London.<br/>It pointed out that it was not just homeowners under pressure, with renters seeing \"very large increases\" in recent months.<br/>\"It is likely that at least part of the increases in rents we are seeing is due to high interest rates hitting landlords' borrowing costs,\" the IFS said.<br/>Data shared with the BBC has shown rent now typically accounts for 28.3% of income, compared with 27% on average for the past 10 years.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.  <br/>Some, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.<br/>Singling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills. <br/>More than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU. <br/>Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit. <br/>But the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.<br/>Most of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes. <br/>But in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.<br/>So while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.<br/>But here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU. <br/>And official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.<br/>However, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.  <br/>The remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic. <br/>The government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.<br/>But meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros. <br/>Every consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343. <br/>The changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.<br/>Meanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform. <br/>That is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages. <br/>Such employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers. <br/>Then there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum. <br/>Economists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.  <br/>But with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time. <br/>The current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope. <br/>Bread to loo roll: UK prices compared to Europe<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

At the same time, the war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.<br/>The war also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. <br/>This effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of salad and other vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.<br/>Alcohol prices in restaurants and pubs also rose. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>The Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is well above that. <br/>The traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. <br/>This makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. <br/>When people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.<br/>Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. <br/>In May, the Bank increased interest rates for the 12th time in a row, taking the main rate to 4.5%. <br/>But when inflation is caused by factors such as global energy prices, action from the Bank of England may not be enough to slow it down. <br/>Many people's pay isn't keeping up with rising prices. <br/>The average weekly salary in the UK, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3603 in April, up from \u00a3598 in March, according to official figures.<br/>But when you take inflation into account, regular pay actually fell by 1.3% in the three months to April, compared with the same period the year before. <br/>Unions say wages should reflect the cost of living and many workers have been striking over pay. <br/>However, the government argues big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. <br/>Lower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they don't rise as quickly.<br/>When the Bank announced its May interest rate decision, it said headline inflation would \"fall sharply from April\", while warning food price inflation was likely to fall back more slowly than previously expected.<br/>It predicts inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.<br/>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.<br/>In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. <br/>Other countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.<br/>Many of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials and the fallout from Covid.<br/>The annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 6.1% in May, down from 7% in April.<br/>The European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. Its benchmark rate is now 3.5%, the highest it has been for 22 years.<br/>Inflation has also been falling in the US.

They want to do the same to Ukraine's economy.\"<br/>\"President Zelensky's government is determined to drive reforms to become more open, more transparent and ready for investment.\"<br/>When asked about the conference in a BBC interview, Mr Zelensky said: \"On the larger scale we are speaking about the transformation of Ukraine. This is Ukraine not only with its energy and agriculture and industrial complexes, but with its reforms we can see. This is the digitalisation of our country.\"<br/>He also thanked the UK government and the people for their support of Ukraine since the start of a full-scale invasion by Russia in February 2022.<br/>In the immediate term Ukraine needs $14bn from international donors to get through this year.<br/>Ms Bjerde says this will go towards \"essential social expenditures\" such as pension payments, healthcare and salaries for doctors and teachers. It will also help fund urgent repairs that are needed to infrastructure such as roads and the power system that are crucial for the battered economy to function.<br/>Despite the difficulties that many economies around the world are suffering as a result of the war in Ukraine Ms Bjerde is hopeful that the funding will be forthcoming. \"I think there's been a huge level of commitment shown to Ukraine, and I think that will continue. Ukraine is just too important.\" <br/>The billions of dollars poured in so far have \"helped arrest what otherwise would have been even more devastating humanitarian impacts on the country\", she says, adding that Ukraine will also need to help itself.<br/>That may prove difficult given that agriculture is a crucial source of income for Ukraine. It is a major global source of crops including wheat, sunflower and corn. Despite a deal to facilitate some exports, which is set to expire next month, output is expected to fall to around 45 million tonnes from 53 million in 2022.<br/>Some of that is because damaged infrastructure makes it harder to get goods out of Ukraine.<br/>Those challenges have been highlighted in a survey from the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine (AmCham Ukraine). It shows that 49% of companies have suffered damage to their buildings. It also found that 32% of companies have had staff killed, and 27% staff had injured during 15 months of fighting. <br/>Nonetheless it also found 63% of companies intend to invest in new projects, plants or facilities and 74% want to create jobs for Ukrainians in existing projects. <br/>AmCham Ukraine's President Andy Hunder pointed to some of the issues that will be addressed at the conference in London. He told the BBC that \"the majority of businesses in Ukraine don't plan to make claims for war damages until proper and clear compensation mechanisms are developed and eventually implemented\". <br/>The two-day meeting of business leaders and politicians will also look at if a war insurance scheme can be put into place to encourage some of the private sector investment that the World Bank says is vital to rebuilding the economy.<br/>In a separate survey it found firms have seen an average 53% drop in sales compared with pre-war 2021. It reported that larger companies have suffered more disruption that smaller firms.<br/>Whilst big companies including Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Unilever have seen their buildings damaged some have already started spending money on rebuilding in Ukraine.<br/>For that to continue Mr Hunder says  \"comprehensive war risk insurance for investors has a key role to play to secure investment in Ukraine's rebuilding and recovery\".<br/>Major US financial firms Blackrock and JP Morgan are helping Ukraine's government secure private sector investment for rebuilding. That will be key to providing the jobs and innovation that will drive Ukraine's recovery according to the World Bank's Ms Bjerde. <br/>\"Even if the war was to end today, there will be an adjustment period, the economy has changed a lot. Poverty in Ukraine has gone up, the dynamics and the demographics have changed.

We just don't have it. We are an old group and have never deceived anyone, if we say that we do not have information, then we do not have it,\" the hackers claimed.<br/>Zellis would only refer us to its previous statement, which said: \"We can confirm that a small number of our customers have been impacted by this global issue and we are actively working to support them.\"<br/>The company says that as soon as it became aware of the hack it took immediate action and disconnected the computer server on which the MOVEit software was installed.<br/>The firm says it has brought in an expert external security team to help it respond to the attack and has notified the relevant UK data authorities. <br/>Cyber-security experts are puzzled by Clop's claims which further muddy an already complex situation.<br/>Threat researcher Brett Callow, from Emsisoft, said Clop could be covering up the fact it stole the data as part of a sale deal with another hacking group.<br/>But Clop claimed \"we didn't sell anything to other hackers\".<br/>Other experts say there are many possibilities. <br/>\"Clop has no real reason to say they don't have the data,\" said SOS Intelligence boss Amir Had\u017eipasi\u0107 .<br/>\"If they are telling the truth then it makes me think that some other hackers may have got in and stolen the data before Clop and if Clop don't have the data then this situation is less predictable.

Amazon has appealed the citations.<br/>The Senate investigation follows the increased scrutiny Amazon has faced over its treatment of workers since the pandemic, when a global outcry over conditions sparked walkouts in Europe, regulatory investigations, and a push by workers to unionise at several US warehouses. <br/>In the UK, hundreds of Amazon workers in Coventry are currently on strike, but their union recently withdrew its bid for recognition, accusing the shopping giant of \"dirty tricks\".<br/>Mr Sanders, a self-described socialist who has unsuccessfully sought to be the Democratic presidential nominee, is known for his championship of progressive causes.<br/>He has previously criticised Amazon over its tax practices and wages, a campaign that Amazon said played a role in its decision to increase its minimum hourly pay for US workers in 2018 to $15 (\u00a311.75).  <br/>In a letter to Amazon notifying the company of the investigation, he wrote: \"The company's quest for profits at all costs has led to unsafe physical environments, intense pressure to work at unsustainable rates, and inadequate medical attention for tens of thousands of Amazon workers every year.\"<br/>As head of the Senate committee charged with overseeing labour laws, Mr Sanders organised a hearing in Washington earlier this year which required Starbucks founder Howard Schultz to publicly respond to claims that the company had illegally retaliated against baristas voting to unionise.<br/>The move by Mr Sanders could also lead to a hearing in which Amazon is forced to testify.<br/>Starbucks chief under fire for union crackdown<br/>Amazon staff vote for six months of strikes<br/>Union accuses Amazon of 'dirty tricks' in UK fight<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

A small rise in percentage terms can still have a significant effect on people's finances.<br/>If a first-time buyer had a mortgage on the same property, that would take up 26% of pay, it said.<br/>The chunk of income taken up by rent varies in different regions. Even in London, where rent has previously taken up a bigger proportion of wages, the cost still accounts for 40% of gross earnings - the highest in the UK.<br/>Rents have been rising significantly for the last year. Although those on a fixed rent would not have seen a difference, those signing up to new contracts, or moving to a different property are likely to have seen big increases.<br/>The pressure of rising mortgage rates faced by landlords, as well as higher demand for properties than the number made available, have combined to raise the costs for tenants.<br/>The typical rise has been at more than 10%, compared with a year earlier, for 15 months in a row.<br/>In April, rent in London was 13.5% higher than a year ago, in Scotland it was 13.1% higher, and the North West of England saw a 10.5% increase.<br/>\"The impact of higher rents is not uniform with those on low incomes bearing the brunt, with increasing signs of stress,\" Mr Donnell said.<br/>Those trying to move from renting to buying their own home also face greater difficulty in securing a mortgage. Financial information service Moneyfacts said the number of deals available for someone offering a 5% deposit was down from 347 at the start of June last year to 199 now.<br/>There's more on your renting rights and where to go for help here.<br/>Mr Ward is among those renters feeling the squeeze, even though he is in a relatively well-paid job.<br/>He said he and his girlfriend's \u00a31,750 a month budget was regarded as low by agents, so they felt they were being priced out of London.<br/>He said that the situation was all the more \"absurd\" because of the competition for properties. The couple are now considering getting a visa to work overseas, for a better quality of life.<br/>One of the major reasons for higher rents is that there are lots of tenants chasing a smaller number of properties to rent.<br/>Zoopla said that there are 20% to 40% fewer homes to rent in most regions than there were before the pandemic. Meanwhile there are many more tenants than has been seen on average over the last five years.<br/>This was likely to become more acute as demand traditionally picks up during the summer months.<br/>Edinburgh and Glasgow feature high on the rental league table, partly because they score highly on quality of life and strong job markets, but there's more going on behind those numbers.<br/>The cities' universities have gone on a recruiting spree for foreign students, putting pressure on the rental market.<br/>And the alliance of SNP with Scottish Green ministers in the Scottish government have risked distorting the market with rent controls. <br/>A freeze in rents and evictions was introduced last September and lasted until March. Also to help households facing rising costs, there's now a 3% cap on rent increases until next March. Further and more permanent rent controls are expected in Holyrood legislation later this year, being drawn up by Green MSP and minister for tenants' rights Patrick Harvie.<br/>However, there is no constraint on the rents at which landlords can advertise new tenancies. So according to property professionals, newly-advertised rents have risen, as landlords seek to protect their income against the impact of future constraints once tenants have moved in.<br/>Zoopla's rental sector survey, published every three months, tracks the rents that landlords request when listing a property, but analysts also adjust the numbers to reflect the rent that is eventually agreed.<br/>Homeowners have been hit by rising interest, and mortgage rates, and that has spilled over into the buy-to-let market - which often sees even higher mortgage rates.<br/>Up to a third of landlords who have hefty mortgages are facing the biggest impact of rising interest rates, which are going up further than previously expected.<br/>Last week estate agency Savills said landlords were making their lowest profits for 16 years as interest rates rose.<br/>In a recent report, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that higher rates, and stricter laws, were pushing some landlords to consider selling up. That would create a further squeeze on availability and could, in turn, increase the cost of renting further.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox here.<br/>What are your rights when you're renting?<br/>Warning rising mortgage costs to hit renters<br/>More pain for renters as landlords look to sell up<br/>Five reasons why mortgages are getting us down<br/>How an interest rate rise affects you<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Ms Teresi had taken her cue from the country singer Kid Rock, who weeks earlier produced a video of him shooting Bud Light cans with a submachine gun.<br/>The protests are part of a conservative reaction to the brand's seeming support for transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who had shown off a personalised can of the beer in a social media post sponsored by the company.<br/>Bud Light, made by Anheuser-Busch, is now one of the latest US companies caught up in America's culture wars, joining a long list that has included Disney, the National Football League, Nike, Target and fast-food chain Chick-fil-A. <br/>\"Clearly, consumers have had it with corporate America trying to push values down on the people they supposedly are serving,\" said Will Hind, the executive director of Consumers' Research, a firm that has spearheaded campaigns targeting American Airlines and Levi's. \"People now act fairly swiftly when they see companies going 'woke' in ways that are noxious.\" <br/>Boycotts can be found on both sides of the political spectrum. <br/>Brands including sports apparel firm Under Armour and food company Goya faced backlash after their respective CEOs spoke out in support of former President Donald Trump. <br/>Whether or not these campaigns are effective, however, is up for debate. <br/>In Bud Light's case, it was unseated from its position as the best-selling beer in the US, with sales in the month leading up to 3 June down by nearly 25%. An analysis released by JP Morgan in May projected that Anheuser-Busch's earnings for the year would drop 26%, with sales not recovering fully until the 2024 fiscal year. <br/>Originally a slang term denoting awareness of social injustice and inequity, the word \"woke\" is used by right-wing Republicans as a pejorative umbrella that covers a variety of topics, from climate change to support for minorities. <br/>Evan Nierman, a PR crisis manager and author of a book entitled The Cancel Culture Curse, told the BBC that similar boycotts had had \"devastating\" financial impacts on US companies. <br/>\"The immediate financial impacts of boycotts are self-evident,\" he said. \"They could produce even greater losses when you calculate long-term damage to their reputation and loss of loyal consumers.\" <br/>Surveys suggest that Americans put considerable stock in a brand's stance on issues. <br/>One survey released by PR and marketing agency Method Communications in April suggests that 67% of Americans say their purchases are affected by a brand's stance, while 42% say they have stopped shopping with a particular brand because of its position on an issue. More than one-third of respondents say they pay attention to a firm's views on social issues. <br/>Some brands, experts say, face temporary losses only to emerge in a better position, championed by their supporters. <br/>Among them is Nike, which in 2018 saw detractors burning shoes and destroying other products in response to the company's support for quarterback Colin Kaepernick's racial justice protests. <br/>More recently, it angered some Americans with a campaign to promote leggings and sports bras using Dylan Mulvaney, the same activist at the heart of the Bud Light controversy. <br/>\"There were all kinds of bonfires that erupted about Nike for their stance. But it stuck to its guns, and you know what? Sales went up,\" said Tony D'Angelo, a public relations professor at Syracuse University. <br/>\"They made a commitment, and while that might disqualify them from some customers and some markets, it carved out a position for them in others,\" he added. <br/>While sales initially dipped in 2018, they rapidly bounced back. Within 12 months, stock prices were up over 60%. The company ended its most recent fiscal year with gross profits of $22bn (\u00a317bn) - a nearly 3% year-on-year increase. <br/>According to experts, the key factor that could ultimately determine how a brand weathers a woke-related boycott is how they respond to the initial fall-out. <br/>Bud Light, for example, came under intense criticism for its response to the Dylan Mulvaney controversy. After remaining silent on the issue for several days, CEO Brendan Whitworth said in a statement that the firm \"never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people\".<br/>\"We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer,\" the statement added. <br/>The response was widely seen as a blunder by experts in brand strategy and crisis communications. Mr D'Angelo characterised the brand's response as \"waffling\". <br/>\"You have to make a commitment,\" he said. \"If you waffle, then people are going to rightly question what they really stand for. That's exactly the position that you don't want to be.\" <br/>Mr D'Angelo's comments were echoed by Jordan McCauley, a member of Atlanta's LGBTQ+ community and founder of CelebrityPR, a firm that works with brands. <br/>\"Brands need to pick a position and stick to it. What hurt Bud Light was they seemed to flip-flop,\" he said. \"If they really supported Dylan Mulvaney, they would have stood up for her... to everyone who protested. But they backed down. Both sides then see this as two-faced and inauthentic.\" <br/>When asked by the BBC for comment on the boycott and its response, an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson said only that \"for the year\", Bud Light remains the top beer brand in the US in volume and dollar sales. <br/>Observers believe that boycotts of brands or firms are likely to increase in the coming years, partly as a result of the debate over \"woke\" ideology playing a key part in the upcoming 2024 US election. <br/>Mr Nierman said the country was likely to experience a \"boycott fever\". <br/>\"We absolutely should expect to see more campaigns,\" he said. \"They give everyday citizens the power to become activists, and to make a massive collective impact.\" <br/>Bud Light loses top spot in US after boycott<br/>Why Bud Light and Disney are under attack<br/>DeSantis warns 'buckle up' as he gets Disney power<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These days pilots have a lot more assistance from tech in the cockpit. <br/>Project Dragonfly, conducted on an Airbus A350-1000, extended the plane's autonomy even further.<br/>The project focused on three areas: improved automatic landing, taxi assistance and automated emergency diversion.<br/>Perhaps the last of those is the most dramatic. <br/>Malcolm Ridley, Chief Test Pilot of Airbus's commercial aircraft, reassured us that the risk of being involved in an air accident is \"vanishingly small\".<br/>However, aircraft and crew need to be ready for any scenario, so Project Dragonfly tested an automatic emergency descent system.<br/>The idea is this technology will take over if the pilots need to focus on heavy decision-making or if they were to become incapacitated. <br/>Under its own control, the plane can descend and land, while recognising other aircraft, weather and terrain.<br/>The system also allows the plane to speak to air traffic control over the radio with a synthetic voice created through the use of artificial intelligence. <br/>It is a lot for the plane's systems to take on. <br/>One of the challenges was teaching the system to understand all of the information and create a solution, says Miguel Mendes Dias, Automated Emergency Operations Designer. <br/>\"The aircraft needs to, on its own, recover all the information. So it needs to listen for the airport messages from air traffic control. <br/>\"Then it needs to choose the most suitable airport for diversion,\" he said. <br/>Project Dragonfly performed two successful emergency descents.<br/>During the test flights, French air traffic controllers fully understood the situation and the aircraft landed safely. <br/>\"It was really an amazing feat,\" says Mr Mendes.<br/>Thankfully, almost all landings are much less dramatic, and Project Dragonfly looked at the more usual kind as well. <br/>Most big airports have technology which guides the aircraft on to the runway, called precision approach. <br/>But not every airport in the world has that tech, so Airbus has been looking at a different way to land. <br/>Project Dragonfly explored using different sensors to help an aircraft make an automated landing.<br/>It included using a combination of normal cameras, infrared and radar technology.<br/>The team also gathered data from around the world, so all sorts of weather conditions could be modelled.<br/>As well as giving the plane more information, the extra sensors give the pilot extra clarity, when monitoring the landing.<br/>For example, infrared cameras are useful in cloudy conditions, as the closer you get to objects the more heat an infrared sensor can pick up.<br/>The tech \"will make the pilot comfortable in the fact that he's really aligned and on the good path to go to the runway,\" says Nuria Torres Mataboch, a computer vision engineer on the Dragonfly project.<br/>Project Dragonfly also looked at taxiing. Although this might seem like a basic task, it can be the most challenging part of the job, especially at the world's busiest airports.<br/>In this case, the pilot was in control of the aircraft.<br/>The technology provided the crew with audio alerts. So when the aircraft came across obstacles it issued an alert. It also advised pilots on speed and showed them the way to the runaway. <br/>\"We wanted something that would assist and reduce the pilots' workloads during the taxi phase,\" said Mr Ridley.<br/>What do pilots make of such developments? Some do not want the technology pushed too far. <br/>\"I don't know if any pilot is particularly comfortable with the computer being the sole arbiter of whether or not a flight successfully lands,\" said Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, he is not convinced that self-flying planes will be able to deal with complex scenarios that come up.<br/>\"Automation can't replace the decision making of two well-trained and rested pilots on the flight deck,\" he said from his base at Sydney airport. <br/>Mr Lucas used the example of the Boeing 737 Max, where an automated system led to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Airbus is quick to point out that further automation will only be introduced when safe and that the objective is not to remove pilots from the cockpit.<br/>But could passenger planes be pilot-free one day?<br/>\"Fully automated aircraft would only ever occur if that was clearly and certainly the safe way to go to protect our passengers and crew,\" says Mr Ridley.<br/>You can watch more on this story on BBC Click.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry.

A love of music has shaped both her life and her approach to design, she says.<br/>\"This morning I went up to my design studio and they were playing heavy rock. I looked up at the girls and said, 'Soz, I'm changing it.'\"<br/>Choosing the right music to create the right \"buzz\" for clients who come to visit her west London studio is of the utmost importance to Kelly Hoppen.<br/>Music sets the mood for them, but it also helps her get creative. \"It has to be a certain music for me to get into the zone to design,\" she explains.<br/>In fact, it's often through discussion of music that the decisive creative breakthroughs with clients are made.<br/>\"I say to them, 'If you wanted your room to sound like a piece of music, what would it be?'\" she says. \"Some don't understand the question, but others say, 'Oh, 100%, Say A Little Prayer for You by Burt Bacharach.' And I get that! <br/>\"I can't explain why, but music is design to me.\"<br/>In a career that spans five decades, Hoppen, 63, has established herself as one of the UK's best-known interior designers. She is famed for her neutral palette, Zen-like greys which are meant to create a relaxing ambience. <br/>Many of her celebrity customers have been musicians, including Victoria Beckham, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and, most recently, Boy George.<br/>Her job is to figure out what they really want, which isn't always straightforward. Boy George visited her home and explained the decor he was after.<br/>\"I said, 'I'm absolutely convinced you don't [want that],\" recalls Hoppen.<br/>But by speaking to him she found out the deeper feelings he was looking for, which gave her clues on how to express his personality in home decor - which is very different to his flamboyant stage persona, she points out.<br/>It's the part of the job she loves, getting into a client's head like a psychologist, she says.<br/>The language of music is part of her method for \"getting the information\" she needs.<br/>Hoppen was born in South Africa, where her mother is from, but with her British father the family moved to London when she was two.<br/>They went back to visit her grandparents during holidays, and her grandmother's elegant home was another design inspiration for her.<br/>In the mid-1970s, aged 16, she decided to \"run away\" back to South Africa on her own. <br/>Her parents had divorced and she was living with her father after falling out with her mother. When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour. (\"But in my own home? Nope.\") <br/>Apart from her design consultancy, her business empire also includes her best-selling books, which explain some of her design secrets.<br/>The jobs that come into her studio tend to be from high net-worth clients, or companies that cater to them. Her customers have not been particularly affected by the cost of living crisis, she says.<br/>She is aware of \"the divide\" that exists between her clientele's design needs, and the day-to-day concerns of most people.<br/>But she is equally passionate about improving home design for those on smaller budgets, she says, and has built a large following on Instagram, sharing ideas about how to do it.<br/>Interior design doesn't have to involve spending money, she says. You can create impact by small things like changing cushions, or rehanging pictures.<br/>\"I'm such a geek about it, if I could go into everyone's homes and help with the changes, I would. I'd love to be that magician.\"<br/>People have come to appreciate their homes more now as \"sanctuaries\" since the pandemic and lockdowns, Hoppen believes.<br/>And one thing that music and good interior design at home have in common, she's realised, is that they both have the power to influence your mood and have a positive effect on your mental health.<br/>You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And she sells her own Isabella Vrana label.<br/>Over her eight years in the business, Ms Vrana says she has seen huge changes in demand for second-hand clothes. <br/>\"It wasn't such a normal thing when I started so I've definitely seen an increase in people buying second hand to try and be more sustainable,\" she says.<br/>Plus there's the quality of well-made vintage clothes. \"These items are lasting decades and they're being worn as well. Take a vintage pair of jeans - I've got jeans with dry cleaning labels from the 1990s and they're still going so strong,\" she says.<br/>\"I think people are realising that you might be investing a bit more of an upfront cost, but then it is really paying off long-term.\"<br/>Adam Jay, marketplace chief executive at the clothing resell app Vinted, says the growth in demand for second-hand clothing as been \"phenomenal\".<br/>Vinted now has over eight million registered members in the UK, up from 1.2 million in 2021.<br/>There are the obvious reasons why people are attracted to second-hand clothing. <br/>Buying new clothes and footwear can be expensive at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living. <br/>The rate at which prices are rising for clothing and shoes hit 6.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.   <br/>Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for generating between 8-10% of global emissions, according to the United Nations, from growing cotton to using oil to create synthetic materials such as polyester.<br/>But for fashion and sustainability vlogger Rosie Okotcha \"thrifted fashion is very cool now because its my personal style, no-one else can get it\".<br/>She credits TikTok and Instagram with driving the trend for second-hand clothing, in particular with \"Gen Z\" shoppers - that's people who were born in between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.<br/>That is reflected in the sort of styles people are buying. <br/>According to Depop, \"Y2K\" is a popular trend on its app including oversized denim, colourful crochet and vintage t-shirts. There's also demand for one-of-a-kind and customised items, as well as clothing that is handmade or reworked from existing pieces.  <br/>But while the internet might be fuelling the trend, there is vintage fashion to be found in the High Street charity shop.<br/>Ms Okotcha says that part of her mission is to try to \"break down the stigma that there is something wrong with shopping second hand because it is actually really fantastic fun and great for the planet\".<br/>While it might seem inevitable that the popularity of apps might have ended up re-routing clothing donations away from the High Street, the Charity Retail Association (CRA) says that's not the case.<br/>Charity shop sales rose by 15.1% between January and March compared with the same three months last year.  <br/>\"There is plenty of second-hand clothing to go around, so we see the growth of online selling platforms as complementary to the work of charity shops,\" says the CRA.<br/>Ms Vrana agrees that there is plenty of room for competition, and she plans to continue.  <br/>\"There's definitely money to be made,\" she says. <br/>\"You can definitely support yourself through doing this full-time, which I'm really grateful for because sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because I enjoy it so much.\" <br/>Shein faces US calls for probe into Uyghur claims<br/>Making prom affordable during cost of living crisis<br/>The apps getting your wardrobe back under control<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Savita Patel, a California-based independent journalist, speaks to those supporting and opposing the bill becoming a law.<br/>Sukhjinder Kaur*, a nurse at a hospital in California, works long and tiring hours serving patients. But whenever it's break time, things become oppressive. <br/>She is a Dalit (a community that is placed at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste hierarchy) and says she often faces casteist insults from her South Asian colleagues.<br/>Dalit rights activists say scores of caste-oppressed Californians face housing, educational, professional, and social discrimination. <br/>In March, Senator Aisha Wahab, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, authored and introduced the SB-403 bill -  legislation that seeks to add caste as a protected category in the state's anti-discrimination laws alongside gender, race, religion and disability.<br/>The bill was passed by the state's senate in May with a 34-1 vote. If it goes through in the state assembly, California will become the first US state to ban caste discrimination.<br/>\"Nurses from upper castes pass slurs about chamars [a pejorative term for Dalits] being dirty and polluting,\" says Ms Kaur, who is among those who are in favour of the law. <br/>In February, Seattle became the first city in the US - and outside South Asia - to outlaw caste discrimination, generating momentum for the legislation in California. It is being propelled by the same broad multi-faith, inter-caste, multi-racial coalition of over 40 American and international Dalit and human rights activists and organisations, led by California-based Equality Labs.<br/>California has a large South Asian diaspora and is home to some of the world's biggest tech companies.<br/>The state is home to more than half of the 500,000-plus Sikh population in the US and gurudwaras (Sikh temples) in California have been mobilising momentum to outlaw caste discrimination. <br/>Two of the community's largest advocacy groups - The Sikh Coalition and Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund - support the bill. Among Sikhs, it is the Ravidasia community - the largest Dalit community in the state with approximately 15,000-20,000 members - which is advocating for the bill at grassroots level.<br/>Renu Singh, who follows the Ravidasia tradition and is also a women's rights activist, has been urging women to speak about their own experiences of caste discrimination and those they see around them so that lawmakers understand the gravity of the issue.<br/>Data from an Equality Lab study shows that one in four caste-oppressed people from the South Asian American diaspora have faced physical and verbal violence; one in three has faced discrimination in education, and two out of three have experienced workplace discrimination.<br/>It was the first extensive study of caste distribution and its effects in the US and had over 1,500 respondents. The findings, published in 2018, say that those from \"lower castes\" fear retaliation and worry about being \"outed\" and hence \"hide their caste\".<br/>However, a significant section of the Indian diaspora rejects caste discrimination claims.<br/>Deepak Aldrin, a San Francisco-based Dalit activist is not in favour of the bill. \"I've lived here for 35 years. No Hindu has ever asked me what caste I belong to,\" he says.<br/>The bill is meeting strong opposition from many Indian-American individuals, religious and professional groups, who argue that even though it does not specifically name their religion, it will \"discriminate against Hindus, their places of worship and even make them less hiring worthy\". <br/>They say the existing laws in California are sufficient to address any discrimination and are mobilising the community to urge their lawmakers to disallow the legislation to proceed.<br/>Many businesses and Hindu temples under HinduPACT - an American Hindu grassroots advocacy initiative - have appealed to California lawmakers to reject the bill. Its convenor Ajay Shah says that the legislation is \"deeply flawed, ill-intentioned and targets children and youth from the Indian subcontinent and those who follow the Hindu dharma [Hinduism].\"<br/>Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, says this bill is already creating an \"undesirable\" awareness about caste. She says she has been \"hearing inappropriate queries from workers, especially in tech, who are being asked about their caste by non-South Asians\". She says if this becomes a pattern, it can be grounds for ethnicity-based harassment.<br/>The foundation has sued the state in a federal court for an \"unconstitutional definition of caste\" and has also challenged the addition of caste to its non-discrimination policy, saying that it \"singles out one community for ethnic profiling and additional policing\".<br/>Those opposing the bill say they are also perplexed as to how the state plans to identify an individual's caste since it's a very complex issue, .<br/>The bill, Ms Wahab explains, does not include details for identifying caste, similar to other protected categories.<br/>\"There is no language on how caste will be determined. This is simply an anti-discrimination bill. When somebody takes a matter up to the courts, that is usually when subject matter experts are engaged, the type of discrimination potentially that has taken place [is investigated].\"<br/>Ms Wahab says she has received \"death threats\" after proposing the bill. She now faces a recall campaign and a possible re-election. She adds that the \"visceral reaction\" to the bill is \"disheartening\" and has urged Californians to read the bill.<br/>\"Whether you're upper caste or lower caste, it does not matter, it will protect you as well,\" she says.<br/>*Some names have been changed to protect identity.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

It was made in a laboratory on an industrial estate just a few miles down the road.<br/>I'm in Huber's Butchery and Bistro in Singapore, which is the only restaurant in world to have so-called cultivated meat on the menu.<br/>Feedback from customers has been \"phenomenal\", according to the restaurant's owner.<br/>The meat's creator - California-based Eat Just - says it is ethical, clean and green - with no compromise on taste. Billions of dollars are being poured into the industry, but huge question marks hang over its viability as anything beyond a novelty.<br/>Ever since the first lab-grown burger - which cost a mere $330,000 (\u00a3263,400) to create - was unveiled in London in 2013, dozens of companies around the world have joined the race to bring affordable cultivated meat to the market.<br/>So far, only Eat Just has managed to get its product approved for public sale after regulators in Singapore - the only country in the world to allow lab-grown meat to be sold - gave its chicken the green light in December 2020.<br/>But it is still nowhere near being widely available. Cultivated chicken nuggets were briefly on the menu at a private members' club in 2021. <br/>That partnership lasted a few months and this year Huber's has started offering a chicken sandwich and a chicken pasta dish to the general public - albeit only once a week with limited dining slots available.<br/>\"Cultivated meat is real meat, but you don't have to slaughter an animal,\" says Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Eat Just, who spoke to the BBC from San Francisco. \"This way of eating makes sense for the future,\" he says.<br/>Unlike plant-based substitutes, cultivated meat is literally meat. The process involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats.<br/>The cells are allowed to divide and grow, before being placed in a large steel bioreactor, which acts like a fermentation tank.<br/>After four to six weeks, the material is 'harvested' from the bioreactor. Some vegetable protein is added, then it is moulded, cooked and 3-D printed to give it the necessary shape and texture.<br/>The resulting strips of deep fried chicken on my plate of orecchiette pasta certainly tasted like the real deal, if a bit processed. Perhaps the sort of chicken you would eat in a fast-food restaurant.<br/>\"It's meat - it's perfect!\" says Caterina, an Italian student who came here especially to try the cultivated chicken. Normally, for sustainability reasons, she would not eat meat but Caterina says she would eat this.<br/>Her only quibble? Serving the chicken with pasta, which typically does not happen in Italy.<br/>Another diner from Singapore says he was surprised by how much it resembled real meat.<br/>\"It's legit\", he says. \"I wouldn't know where it came from. My only concern would be the cost.\"<br/>The chicken pasta dish I ordered was S$18.50 ($13.70; \u00a311), but that is vastly discounted relative to the current cost of producing the meat. <br/>Eat Just will not say exactly how much it spends on making its cultivated chicken, but at the moment the company's production capacity only yields 2kg (4.4lb) or 3kg per week in Singapore.<br/>When you compare that to the 4,000kg - 5,000kg of conventional chicken sold weekly - at Huber's alone - it gives you a sense of the scale of the task ahead. Put simply, they will need to increase production enormously to avoid making a loss on each piece of chicken.<br/>Eat Just says it has already achieved a 90% reduction in costs since 2018 and the company offered me a tour of its new multi-million dollar production facility in Singapore, which it hopes will open next year.<br/>The pair of shiny steel 1,320 gallon (6,000 litres) bioreactors certainly represent a sign of intent, but in reality they are a tiny fraction of the millions of tonnes of chicken that would need to be produced to match the price of slaughtered chicken.<br/>The industry is urging for patience, but many scientists have already seen enough.<br/>\"The narrative presented by these companies is very strong\", says Ricardo San Martin, co-director of the Alt: Meat Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.<br/>\"But that narrative must be contrasted with the science\", he says. \"Run the numbers, look at every scientific paper written by people who have no skin in the game, and you'll see the answer is clear.\"<br/>\"Can you do this, at scale, at a reasonable cost? No. Can you talk about saving the world with this? Again, no. These companies have to be honest - it's wishful thinking\", he says.<br/>Not only are there doubts about scaling up production, there is also uncertainty over the industry's green credentials, which have been questioned by scientists.<br/>In theory, reducing the world's reliance on land and livestock for meat production should reduce carbon emissions, but at the moment the advanced technology needed to create cultivated meat is so energy intensive that it cancels out any benefits. <br/>One study by the University of California, Davis even estimated that the process produces between 4 and 25 times as much carbon dioxide as regular beef. However, East Just has called the study \"flawed\".<br/>When asked by the BBC whether the whole project might end in failure, Josh Tetrick from Eat Just replied: \"For sure\".<br/>But he remains undeterred: \"Making meat in this way is both necessary and highly uncertain,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not straightforward. It's complicated. It's not guaranteed and it might not work out. But the other option for us is not to do anything. So we decided to take a bet and go for it.\"<br/>Plenty of investors have decided to make that same bet. As of this year, an estimated $2.8bn has been spent on developing cultivated meat.<br/>However, if cultivated meat is to become anything more than a niche alternative for the well-off in the developed world, then relying on investments from private businesses may not be enough.<br/>Governments, Mr Tetrick says, are going to need to put \"significant public money\" into cultivated meat for it to rival conventionally slaughtered meat. <br/>\"This is like the transition to renewable energy... It's a lifetime project - maybe a multiple lifetimes project,\" he says.<br/>At the moment though no country outside Singapore has authorised the sale of cultivated meat, let alone committed to serious investment.<br/>According to Ricardo San Martin from UC Berkeley, both private and public funding for cultivated meat companies will dry up if they do not \"look in the mirror\" soon and present realistic forecasts to investors.<br/>\"Unless there is a clear path to success at some point in the future, investors and governments will not want to spend money on something that is not scientifically proven\".<br/>Italy to ban lab-grown meat to protect heritage<br/>Lab-grown chicken safe to eat, say US regulators<br/>Singapore approves lab-grown 'chicken' meat<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

varying in size from under 20 employees to 200 - have already signed the pledge, which is divided into five \"pillars\".<br/>They include creating a maternity leave and return to work plan for employees and helping them \"maintain an emotional connection with the workplace so they do not feel anxious about being on maternity leave and their subsequent return to work\".<br/>Susannah believes current maternity leave practices often fall short of where they should be.<br/>She says: \"Although there are laws in place, the statistics and stories show that the measures currently in place to protect jobs and provide financial support are not working as well as they could as they're not reflective of the society we live in, what mothers want and the profound experience of motherhood.<br/>\"Our aim with the Maternity Pledge is to help keep mothers in the workplace if they want to be and through that we hope to see more women in leadership roles.\"<br/>Pregnant employees of firms that sign up are also given a \"matrescence pack\", which Susannah says covers \"the parts of motherhood which tend to be glossed over in pregnancy but can affect mental health\". <br/>It addresses issues such as breastfeeding problems and the affect of matrescence on relationships with partners.<br/>Companies already signed up to the pledge seem to be fully on board with its goals.<br/>Colchester-based PR company founder Megan Dorian says she is glad to be part of the project.<br/>\"When I launched Orange PR and Marketing when my first-born daughter was just over a year, I knew a priority for the business was to create an inclusive culture that not only supported but embraced parents in their journey,\" she says. <br/>\"There is still a stigma around women taking a career 'break' - it's certainly not a break - to have a baby and then return to work, and I am a big advocate for breaking this down.\"<br/>Another supporter is London-based Jenny Jones, chief operating officer of advisory, legal and accountancy firm Dragon Argent.<br/>\"Becoming a mother was the hardest transition I've ever had to make,\" she says. <br/>\"Going from being confident in your job and your life in general to being at home looking after a very small, fragile person 24/7 was tricky to say the least.  <br/>\"Supporting all our present and future parents through the often unspoken challenges of balancing parenthood and careers matters to us, which is why we signed The Maternity Pledge.\"<br/>Susannah says everyone benefits if companies support new mothers' return to work with as much flexibility and care for their wellbeing as possible.<br/>\"Maternity leave can work better for businesses and mothers if communication, support and empathy is improved,\" she says.<br/>\"Most women want to work - and with the cost of living, nearly all women need to work - so it's really important to keep women in a workplace where they feel valued and fulfilled.\"<br/>Tory MP: I'm dismayed by abuse for maternity leave<br/>'Maternity leave is hard and lonely'<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose -

If I have to give up being a blacksmith, then I will,\" the 39-year-old says.<br/>The craftsman is not alone. Many are facing similar financial dilemmas as they contemplate rising mortgage costs. <br/>The Bank of England has been steadily raising interest rates for the last year and a half, as it tries to tackle soaring prices. <br/>After figures last week showed inflation not coming down as quickly as expected, many now predict the central bank will continue to raise rates from their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.<br/>That in turn had an immediate impact on the mortgage market. Lenders began raising their rates. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.49% and the average five-year fixed is currently 5.17%.<br/>And within a week hundreds of mortgage deals were removed from the market as lenders reassessed their offers.<br/>\"Carnage\" is how Craig Fish from Lodestone brokers in London described the situation. <br/>\"I'm currently on hold to NatWest - 30 minutes and counting - to discuss a possible new mortgage as they have just announced they are withdrawing rates at 10.30pm tonight. Do the lenders think the future is this uncertain?\" he said earlier this week.<br/>Jo Wilder, 28, works for Cardiff Council and pays \u00a3700 a month for a studio apartment she has been renting for the past 18 months. She now wants to buy her own home - a process that is taking longer than she hopes, as she watches rates rise. <br/>Despite having a healthy 20% deposit and a mortgage in principle, she says there are \"not really any properties on the market\".<br/>Repayments on a three-year fixed-rate deal at 4.5% would be between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 but she is worried about interest rates going up.<br/>\"It's not ideal. I'm just going to have to wait it out and hope rates come down. It really is very stressful,\" she says.<br/>Jo had hoped getting her own place would mean a drop in monthly outgoings but with rising food prices she no longer thinks that will be the case.<br/>\"It is disheartening,\" she adds. \"The way things are going I think it is actually going to be the same price, which is pretty daunting to be honest.\"<br/>In Bedfordshire, Anthony Jones and his wife have a 14-month-old daughter - they want to upsize and have been trying to sell since last August. <br/>The couple's five-year fixed deal has ended and they are now on a tracker mortgage, leaving them \u00a3200 worse off a month, at a little over \u00a31,200.<br/>\"It's a bit of a nightmare,\" says Anthony. \"We're looking at upsizing and all of a sudden are having to question the affordability of it.\"<br/>The 33-year-old says when they first put their house on the market there had been \"a lot of interest initially, then all of a sudden we had people saying 'our mortgage offer has been pulled' and 'we can't afford it anymore'.\"<br/>The couple have reduced the asking price from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3275,000, but say they cannot accept less because otherwise they will not have the deposit for their second home.<br/>\"Our daughter has grown so quickly, we need a garden and bigger bedrooms and more storage. The lack of space is even causing arguments between me and my partner,\" says Anthony.<br/>Read more here<br/>The upheaval for people going through the application process comes as Bank of England figures this week showed a decline in the number of mortgages being approved. <br/>The number of net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 48,700 in April from 51,500 in March.<br/>Mortgage broker London & Country is now seeing a trend for people fixing for one or two years, rather than the previous most popular five-year term, on the basis that interest rates will have fallen by the time they come to look for their next deal.<br/>Spokesman David Hollingworth says people who are refinancing should start searching for a new product six months before the end of their current deal.<br/>Some may want to consider taking out new mortgages over a longer term - something a lot of first-time buyers do to \"give themselves breathing space\", he says.<br/>If it is a struggle to meet payments on an existing mortgage there is also the option of extending the term, but Mr Hollingworth says this is \"not a move to be taken lightly because it will significantly increase the overall interest bill, by tens of thousands of pounds\".<br/>Are you struggling to get a mortgage or one that's affordable?

The service, which offers shipping perks, access to streaming movies and more, costs $139 a year or $14.99 monthly in the US and \u00a395 per year in the UK. <br/>The FTC said Amazon used website designs that pushed customers into agreeing to enrol in Prime and have the subscription automatically renew as they were making purchases. <br/>The company attempted to make it difficult for users to opt out of auto-enrolment because \"those changes would also negatively affect Amazon's bottom line\", the agency alleged in the complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle. <br/>It also said Amazon put customers seeking to cancel through a cumbersome \"four-page, six-click, fifteen option\" process, which the FTC said was known internally as \"Iliad\" in a nod to the Greek epic about the \"long, arduous Trojan War\". <br/>Though Amazon altered the cancellation process shortly before the lawsuit was filed, the FTC said the company's tactics broke laws aimed at protecting shoppers.<br/>\"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said.<br/>The FTC is seeking a court order to force Amazon to change its practices, as well as financial penalties in an unspecified amount.<br/>Amazon said it had been in the middle of discussing the issues with the agency when the lawsuit was filed without notice. <br/>\"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,\" the company said. <br/>The FTC has repeatedly warned online firms against using \"dark patterns\" to manipulate shoppers.<br/>It had been investigating Amazon's Prime programme since 2021.<br/>It said the company had attempted to delay the probe on multiple occasions, including by refusing to deliver documents in a timely manner. <br/>Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Insider Intelligence analyst said the FTC was \"making an example of Amazon\".<br/>\"It's quite common for companies to make it more difficult to cancel an account than it is to create one,\" she said.<br/>Ms Khan, who was appointed to her post by President Joe Biden, made her name critiquing US competition policy related to Amazon.<br/>She has promised to move more aggressively to police online shopping and the power of America's tech giants. <br/>The lawsuit marks the third action from the FTC involving Amazon in recent weeks.<br/>The company agreed to pay $25m last month to settle charges it had violated child privacy laws by keeping recordings children made on Alexa. <br/>It agreed to pay another $5.8m to resolve claims that Ring, the doorbell company Amazon purchased in 2018, had violated privacy protections by giving staff unrestricted access to customer videos and failing to implement precautions against hackers. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We just don't have it. We are an old group and have never deceived anyone, if we say that we do not have information, then we do not have it,\" the hackers claimed.<br/>Zellis would only refer us to its previous statement, which said: \"We can confirm that a small number of our customers have been impacted by this global issue and we are actively working to support them.\"<br/>The company says that as soon as it became aware of the hack it took immediate action and disconnected the computer server on which the MOVEit software was installed.<br/>The firm says it has brought in an expert external security team to help it respond to the attack and has notified the relevant UK data authorities. <br/>Cyber-security experts are puzzled by Clop's claims which further muddy an already complex situation.<br/>Threat researcher Brett Callow, from Emsisoft, said Clop could be covering up the fact it stole the data as part of a sale deal with another hacking group.<br/>But Clop claimed \"we didn't sell anything to other hackers\".<br/>Other experts say there are many possibilities. <br/>\"Clop has no real reason to say they don't have the data,\" said SOS Intelligence boss Amir Had\u017eipasi\u0107 .<br/>\"If they are telling the truth then it makes me think that some other hackers may have got in and stolen the data before Clop and if Clop don't have the data then this situation is less predictable. The files are going to end up somewhere on the darkweb via another hacking group,\" he added.<br/>The hack was first announced on 31 May by Progress Software, the makers of MOVEit.<br/>The criminals found a way to break into MOVEit and were then able to use that access to get into the databases of potentially hundreds of other companies.<br/>Since the initial MOVEit disclosure, however, researchers have found many security issues within the software which means it is possible that the data was stolen in a different way by a different group.<br/>On Friday, the US announced a $10m reward for \"information linking the Clop gang or any other malicious cyber -ctors targeting US critical infrastructure to a foreign government\".<br/>Hacker gang Clop publishes victim names on dark web<br/>What action can those caught up in mass hacks take?<br/>BBC, BA and Boots among victims of mass payroll hack<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

A huge margin of users voted for r/pics to \"only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy\", with 37,331 votes for and -2,239 votes against. Other subreddits saw similar results.<br/>And it isn't just John Oliver that Reddit has to contend with.<br/>Other subreddits are similarly remaining active while changing their communities to fit within Reddit's rules, with r/iPhone now dedicated to \"dashing images\" of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, and moderators of r/scams approving content deliberately slowly, taking up to 14 days to review a post rather than a few minutes.<br/>Reddit communities go dark in protest at changes<br/>Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave<br/>Social media platform Reddit files to go public<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that. Whether they made good long-term economic sense is a different question.\"<br/>Spotify podcast deal with Harry and Meghan ends<br/>Where do Harry and Meghan get their money?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will do the same for clients with electric cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I think the AI risks are more that people will be discriminated [against], they will not be seen as who they are.<br/>\"If it's a bank using it to decide whether I can get a mortgage or not, or if it's social services on your municipality, then you want to make sure that you're not being discriminated [against] because of your gender or your colour or your postal code,\" she said. <br/>On Tuesday, Ireland's data protection authority said it had put Google's planned EU roll-out of its AI chatbot Bard on hold. <br/>It said it had been informed by Google that its ChatGPT competitor would be introduced in the EU this week, but was yet to receive details or information showing how the firm had identified and minimised data protection risks to prospective users.<br/>Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said the DPC was seeking the information \"as a matter of urgency\" and had raised further data protection enquiries about it with Google.<br/>Ms Vestager, who is the European Commission's executive vice president, said AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\".<br/>She insisted a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries should be prioritised before getting more jurisdictions, such as China, on board.<br/>\"Let's start working on a UN approach. But we shouldn't hold our breath,\" she said. <br/>\"We should do what we can here and now.\"<br/>Ms Vestager is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>The current draft of the AI Act seeks to categorise applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>High-risk AI systems include those that are used to evaluate credit scores or access to loans and housing. This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it. No-one can make sure that everyone is on board,\" she said, pointing out that a pause could be used by some as an opportunity to get ahead of competitors. <br/>\"What I think is important is that every developer knows that everyone has signed up for the same guardrails so that no-one takes excessive risks.\"<br/>The European Parliament's proposals for the AI Act seek to restrict the use of biometric identification systems and indiscriminate collection of user data from social media or CCTV footage for purposes such as facial recognition systems.<br/>However, Ms Vestager said: \"We want to put in strict guardrails so that it's not used in real-time, but only in specific circumstances where you're looking for a missing child or there's a terrorist fleeing.<br/>Before the AI Act can become finalised as the world's first rulebook on the use and development of AI systems, the EU's three branches of power: the Commission, Parliament and Council will all have to agree on its final version.<br/>It is not expected to come into effect before 2025. <br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In the worst-case scenario, they say machines might become so intelligent that they take over, leading to the extinction of humanity.<br/>However, the EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern. <br/>In particular she is concerned about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications, adding there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence elections.<br/>Others, including tech pioneer Martha Lane Fox, say we shouldn't get what she calls \"too hysterical\" about AI, urging a more sensible conversation about its capabilities.<br/>Governments around the world are wrestling with how to regulate AI. <br/>Members of the European Parliament have just voted in favour of the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which will put in place a strict legal framework for AI, which companies would need to follow. <br/>Margrethe Vestager says \"guardrails\" are needed to counter the biggest risks posed by AI. <br/>The legislation - which is expected to come into effect in 2025 - categorises applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>Higher-risk systems like those used to evaluate credit scores or decide access to housing would face the strictest controls. <br/>These rules will not apply in the UK, where the government set out its vision for the future of AI in March. <br/>It ruled out setting up a dedicated AI regulator, and said instead that existing bodies would be responsible for its oversight.<br/>But Ms Vestager says that AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\", and wants to build a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries. <br/>US lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the existing voluntary codes are up to the job.  <br/>Meanwhile, China intends to make companies notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>AI has the potential to revolutionise the world of work, but this raises questions about which roles it might displace. <br/>A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe, as certain tasks and job functions become automated. That equates to a quarter of all the work humans currently do in the US and Europe. <br/>The report highlighted a number of industries and roles that could be affected, including administrative jobs, legal work, architecture, and management.<br/>But it also identified huge potential benefits for many sectors, and predicted that AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP. <br/>Some areas of medicine and science are already taking advantage of AI, with doctors using the technology to help spot breast cancers, and scientists using it to develop new antibiotics. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example...

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.<br/>The European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\". <br/>This week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.  <br/>Former UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders. <br/>\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe. <br/>Amazon to pay $25m over child privacy violations<br/>New rules ban subscription traps and fake reviews<br/>Amazon to cut another 9,000 jobs<br/>Amazon to axe 18,000 jobs as it cuts costs<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>In December last year, the FTC had asked an in-house administrative judge to block the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.<br/>William Kovacic, former FTC chair and non-executive director at the UK's CMA, said the FTC had expressed concerns that Microsoft and Activision might close their deal despite UK opposition, and so asked a judge to halt it.<br/>\"The EU's decision to take a settlement was a bit of a surprise,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme<br/>Mr Kovacic said there was still a chance the takeover could be completed, but added \"the chance is diminished\".<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to play catch-up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases -

These days pilots have a lot more assistance from tech in the cockpit. <br/>Project Dragonfly, conducted on an Airbus A350-1000, extended the plane's autonomy even further.<br/>The project focused on three areas: improved automatic landing, taxi assistance and automated emergency diversion.<br/>Perhaps the last of those is the most dramatic. <br/>Malcolm Ridley, Chief Test Pilot of Airbus's commercial aircraft, reassured us that the risk of being involved in an air accident is \"vanishingly small\".<br/>However, aircraft and crew need to be ready for any scenario, so Project Dragonfly tested an automatic emergency descent system.<br/>The idea is this technology will take over if the pilots need to focus on heavy decision-making or if they were to become incapacitated. <br/>Under its own control, the plane can descend and land, while recognising other aircraft, weather and terrain.<br/>The system also allows the plane to speak to air traffic control over the radio with a synthetic voice created through the use of artificial intelligence. <br/>It is a lot for the plane's systems to take on. <br/>One of the challenges was teaching the system to understand all of the information and create a solution, says Miguel Mendes Dias, Automated Emergency Operations Designer. <br/>\"The aircraft needs to, on its own, recover all the information. So it needs to listen for the airport messages from air traffic control. <br/>\"Then it needs to choose the most suitable airport for diversion,\" he said. <br/>Project Dragonfly performed two successful emergency descents.<br/>During the test flights, French air traffic controllers fully understood the situation and the aircraft landed safely. <br/>\"It was really an amazing feat,\" says Mr Mendes.<br/>Thankfully, almost all landings are much less dramatic, and Project Dragonfly looked at the more usual kind as well. <br/>Most big airports have technology which guides the aircraft on to the runway, called precision approach. <br/>But not every airport in the world has that tech, so Airbus has been looking at a different way to land. <br/>Project Dragonfly explored using different sensors to help an aircraft make an automated landing.<br/>It included using a combination of normal cameras, infrared and radar technology.<br/>The team also gathered data from around the world, so all sorts of weather conditions could be modelled.<br/>As well as giving the plane more information, the extra sensors give the pilot extra clarity, when monitoring the landing.<br/>For example, infrared cameras are useful in cloudy conditions, as the closer you get to objects the more heat an infrared sensor can pick up.<br/>The tech \"will make the pilot comfortable in the fact that he's really aligned and on the good path to go to the runway,\" says Nuria Torres Mataboch, a computer vision engineer on the Dragonfly project.<br/>Project Dragonfly also looked at taxiing. Although this might seem like a basic task, it can be the most challenging part of the job, especially at the world's busiest airports.<br/>In this case, the pilot was in control of the aircraft.<br/>The technology provided the crew with audio alerts. So when the aircraft came across obstacles it issued an alert. It also advised pilots on speed and showed them the way to the runaway. <br/>\"We wanted something that would assist and reduce the pilots' workloads during the taxi phase,\" said Mr Ridley.<br/>What do pilots make of such developments? Some do not want the technology pushed too far. <br/>\"I don't know if any pilot is particularly comfortable with the computer being the sole arbiter of whether or not a flight successfully lands,\" said Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, he is not convinced that self-flying planes will be able to deal with complex scenarios that come up.<br/>\"Automation can't replace the decision making of two well-trained and rested pilots on the flight deck,\" he said from his base at Sydney airport. <br/>Mr Lucas used the example of the Boeing 737 Max, where an automated system led to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Airbus is quick to point out that further automation will only be introduced when safe and that the objective is not to remove pilots from the cockpit.<br/>But could passenger planes be pilot-free one day?<br/>\"Fully automated aircraft would only ever occur if that was clearly and certainly the safe way to go to protect our passengers and crew,\" says Mr Ridley.<br/>You can watch more on this story on BBC Click.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.<br/>Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.<br/>Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.<br/>\"I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,\" he said.<br/>The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.<br/>Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.<br/>Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.<br/>While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.<br/>So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Earlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.<br/>Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.<br/>The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.<br/>There is some evidence of that already. <br/>This month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.<br/>The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. <br/>While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.<br/>A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. <br/>Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. <br/>\"When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.\"<br/>But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.<br/>For three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.<br/>It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. <br/>Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.<br/>\"I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,\" he says.<br/>But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.<br/>\"When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?\" he says.<br/>A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.<br/>That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.<br/>But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.<br/>\"If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,\" he says.<br/>If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.<br/>After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.<br/>He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.<br/>\"I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,\" he says.<br/>You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.<br/>Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Why aren't more wiped and reused?", "author": "By Sean McManus", "datePublished": "2023-06-05 23:01:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:52:22.042543", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6FC2/production/_129801682_gettyimages-464612641.jpg", "body": "Millions of storage devices are being shredded each year, even though they could be reused. \"You don't need an engineering degree to understand that's a bad thing,\" says Jonmichael Hands.<br/>He is the secretary and treasurer of the Circular Drive Initiative (CDI), a partnership of technology companies promoting the secure reuse of storage hardware. He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\"<br/>Inside the routine at Elizabeth Holmes' prison<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia. <br/>The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain. <br/>The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals.<br/>There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety. <br/>Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging.

And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810,000) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen.<br/>China bans major US chip maker from key projects<br/>China tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT rival<br/>OpenAI announces ChatGPT successor GPT-4<br/>Students warned against using AI for assignments<br/>'Google killer' ChatGPT sparks AI chatbot race<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Huge arrays of angled solar panels sit atop jet black steel supports, soaking up the sun and shading the vehicles beneath. <br/>Outside the offices of a major car manufacturer in the south of England, there are now more than 2,000 panels in total with a peak capacity of just under 1 megawatt (MW).<br/>That's enough to power hundreds of homes.<br/>\"They are looking stunning,\" declares Guy Chilvers, business development manager at SIG, the firm that supplied the solar canopies.<br/>These structures make car parks more visually appealing, he insists, while admitting, \"I would say that\".<br/>Solar car parks or car ports enable electricity production in open spaces that tend to be positioned conveniently near to energy-guzzling facilities such as hospitals, shopping centres or offices. The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox. Lately, he's quoted for hotels, hospitals and leisure centres. Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Star Jen Shah is serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence there for wire fraud.<br/>The celebrity entrepreneur might have roommates in prison. Inmates are typically housed in dormitory-style two-person bunk beds, and four to eight person cubicles, according to Pink Lady Prison Consultants, a prison consulting group led by formerly incarcerated people. <br/>Life at the federal facility is centred around work and extracurricular programmes, the prison handbook says. <br/>All inmates are expected to work, and earn between 12 cents and $1.15 (\u00a30.90) an hour for their jobs. Many are involved in food service and factory work. <br/>Outside of their work, female inmates can take classes on business skills and foreign languages, watch television, play sports and go to religious services, according to the handbook.<br/>Holmes would be allotted an hour for each meal at the facility, which offers a standard Federal Bureau of Prisons menu, consisting of foods like chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs, tacos and macaroni. <br/>As per the prison handbook, she could speak to her family via video calls. Inmates are also allowed visitors during weekends and holidays, but like other inmates, Holmes would be allowed limited physical contact with her partner and young children.<br/>Rules at the female-only facility are also strict, the handbook says, adding that inmates are \"treated in a mature and responsible manner\" and are \"expected to act accordingly\". <br/>Inmates can face disciplinary measures for a number of actions, including not keeping their cell or room neat, sleeping past the early designated wake-up hour, sharing their phone account with other inmates, and leaving an area during an official inmate rollcall, which happens five times a day. <br/>Holmes' time behind bars will stand in stark contrast to her past life. Once lauded as the \"next Steve Jobs\", the start-up founder was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, making the cover of Forbes and other prominent magazines. <br/>She started Theranos shortly after dropping out of Stanford University. As the leader of the company, she raised millions of dollars from high-profile investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<br/>But the start-up fell apart in 2018 after it was revealed Holmes and other executives had lied about the company's technology. The blood-testing device was purported to be able to run a multitude of tests from just a few drops of blood.<br/>In addition to serving time in prison, Holmes has been ordered to pay $452m to the victims of her fraud.

So his grandparents gave him $200 (\u00a3159) Apple credit for Christmas.<br/>\"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days,\" says Ms Ward. \"After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game.\" <br/>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit. <br/>\"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit,\" says Ms Ward. \"He would do that out of desperation when he had used up his monthly gaming allowance.\"<br/>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense. <br/>\"It's something that I have to police constantly.\"<br/>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.<br/>The content purchased can be purely aesthetic - dance moves, skins or clothing. <br/>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.<br/>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.<br/>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases that are in-game purchase-free.<br/>Gaming companies use behavioural psychology to manipulate users into spending, says Prof Sarah Mills, and the link between gaming and gambling is becoming \"increasingly blurred\", she explains.<br/>Ms Mills is professor of human geography at Loughborough University. Her research found gambling techniques make gamers play for longer and spend more money, and drive repeat buying.<br/>Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive of Parent Zone, an organisation which helps parents navigate the digital world for their children, is more specific about how games incentivise players to part with their money.<br/>By spending players can \"avoid the grind\" - where making an in-game purchase means you avoid hours of monotonous gaming to progress to another level.<br/>\"Fun pain\" is where you risk losing something important if you don't make a purchase.<br/>Meanwhile, \"obfuscation techniques\", like in-game currencies, make it hard to see how much you're really spending.<br/>Another tactic is the use of \"loot boxes\". Players buy a box without knowing what's inside. It could contain a game-changing item - but more often than not the prize is nothing more than a mediocre customisation. <br/>\"Young people recalled senses of shame when they reflected on the amount they spent trying to gain a rare item, even if they were successful,\" says Prof Mills.<br/>And - despite many children saying they dislike in-game purchasing - spending money on microtransactions has become an expectation.<br/>While spending on games has risen, some argue that playing games can benefit young people and fears are exaggerated.<br/>Gaming as a form of play has been found to relieve stress, help develop cognitive skills and combat loneliness.<br/>As a teenager Zhenghua Yang, from Colorado, spent two years in hospital.<br/>\"I played a lot of video games. The single-player games made me feel like a hero. The multiplayer games connected me to other people. I made life-long friends all over the world.\"<br/>In 2014, Mr Yang founded Serenity Forge, a gaming company on a mission to help others. To date, more than 20 million people have played the firm's games.<br/>\"We are in the business of expanding people's horizons,\" says Mr Yang.<br/>Serenity Forge does not use microtransactions but, says Mr Yang, that could change in the future if they found them to contribute to \"meaningful, emotionally impactful games that challenge the way you think\".<br/>The impact of microtransactions, says Mr Yang, depends on the vulnerability of the user.<br/>\"Like a credit card can be dangerous for someone in an inappropriate context, so too can microtransactions. However, credit cards can also serve an important function and in-game purchases can be important to a gamer engaging with their favourite game.\"<br/>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming makes him happy.<br/>\"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the difference between reality and fantasy.\"<br/>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.<br/>\"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission,\" says the 43-year-old, \"but he always asks me before making a purchase.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While it can be difficult for parents to keep track of registered emails, passwords and payment cards across various platforms and devices - there are ways that you can protect your teen and your bank account.<br/>Child accounts and parental controls can be used to disable purchases or set a spending limit. Parents can set up email notifications to flag purchases, and use gift cards rather than credit cards.<br/>Perhaps most importantly, adds Mr Yang, talk to your child.<br/>\"In my experience, friction stems from a lack of parental presence,\" he says. \"I now have two kids and, instead of using games as a babysitting tool, I make sure I'm present in their lives as they consume media.\"<br/>Back in Barbados, Ms Ward has set up screen time limits and passcodes to keep Leif gaming safely. <br/>\"My password is needed to make any purchases and if he wants money added to his account he has to ask me.

In a bid to encourage homeowners to decarbonise their heating, Germany introduced a rebate scheme in January 2023 that offers up to 40% back on the cost of buying and installing a heat pump. <br/>Heat pumps use energy taken from the air, water or ground to provide both heating and cooling. They have been proven to work even in extreme temperatures and can drastically reduce energy bills once installed.<br/>The scheme is just one of a host of heat pump subsidies in place across Europe and part of a broader push to reduce carbon emissions. From 2024, every new heating system installed in Germany must run on 65% renewable energy.<br/>Bastian Distler, a product manager in Ketsch in south-west Germany, was considering upgrading to a heat pump anyway for environmental reasons, but admits that he wouldn't have been able to without the subsidy. Purchase and installation can cost anywhere from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac30,000 (\u00a38,700 to \u00a326,000; $11,000 to $33,000) compared to around \u20ac7,000 for a new gas boiler.<br/>\"I have two little children which makes you question some behaviours and you feel better if you do something good for the environment. But to be very honest, if it had been very, very expensive and it didn't pay off, I probably would not have done it,\" says Mr Distler.<br/>While the scheme is certainly making it easier for Germans to invest in heating system upgrades, heat pump sales were already on the increase. <br/>\"We had a market growth of 53% last year,\" says Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. \"The year before it was around 30% and the year before that around 40%. So we've had a good growth rate for several years now.\"<br/>The dramatic uptick in demand caught many manufacturers off guard, leaving some homeowners waiting up to 10 months before their new heat pumps could be supplied and installed by trained technicians, who are also in short supply.<br/>Manufacturers like Viessmann are scaling up production to solve the shortfall, as well as pouring huge investment into training installers, providing educational materials for would-be buyers, and helping customers navigate often complex subsidy applications.<br/>G\u00fcnther Schlachter, vice president of residential electric solutions at Viessmann, believes that supporting and training installers is key to decarbonising home heating. <br/>\"Our installer... can consult with their customers [and advise against] the cheapest gas or oil option to make use of the subsidies that are now in place for a future-proof solution,\" says Mr Schlachter.<br/>J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss agrees. \"Typically, installers focus on gas. For a heat pump, they need to also understand electrics and refrigeration. So educating the end user is important, but it's more important to educate the person selling the system because 80% of the decision-making process happens with the installer.\"<br/>Most European countries currently face the same issues with supply, installer training and cost, but geography and culture also heavily influence what we expect and demand from our heating systems.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>So perhaps it is not surprising that Europe's coldest countries, with the best insulation, have the highest heat pump penetration. According to the International Energy Agency, 60% of Norway's buildings are fitted with a heat pump, followed closely by Sweden at 43% and Finland at 41%. <br/>In Germany the figure is a little over 4% and in the UK just 1%.<br/>\"Scandinavia is much more advanced because they have higher insulation standards and moved from direct electric heating to heat pumps early because it's saved them from day one,\" says Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association.<br/>Central Europeans also tend to have high expectations of heating and insulation whereas people in the UK have long accepted the need for draught excluders and chunky indoor jumpers.<br/>Southern countries tend to eschew heating in favour of cooling and use instantaneous gas boilers to heat water, whereas Eastern Europeans often rely on solid fuel stoves. <br/>Regardless of where you live or how old your building is, there's an easy way to find out if your home is suitable for a heat pump. <br/>If you can feel comfortable at home when the flow temperature on your boiler is reduced to 55C, then you can install a heat pump straight away without retrofits or insulation upgrades. <br/>Of course, not everyone can choose how their home is heated. Germany has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe, which means the onus is on landlords and housing management companies to upgrade heating to serve the country's approximately 40 million tenants. <br/>The German Heat Pump Association has seen housing providers begin to understand that decarbonisation will soon begin to affect their bottom line. <br/>\"They have the goal of decarbonising their building stock because they realise that if they don't, in 10 or 20 years, they won't be able to rent these flats anymore,\" says Martin Sabel. <br/>Tenants who would prefer to take matters into their own hands may soon be able to access smaller-scale heat pump solutions for heating and cooling individual rooms.<br/>US start-up Gradient hopes to enter the European market in 2023 and is working on producing small, affordable, self-install heat pumps that fit over window sills and can replace existing air conditioning units. <br/>For Viessmann, the long-term vision is to build a holistic low-carbon, low-cost energy system where heat pumps, high-quality insulation, solar energy, rerouted waste heat, other renewables, and smart technology work in tandem to provide a circular system of heating and cooling, charging cars, and meeting other energy needs for homeowners and their wider community. <br/>Germany may still be a long way from that, but heat pumps are a good step on that road. When asked what message homeowners should take home about heat pumps, Thomas Nowak has a simple answer. <br/>\"They work. That's all. Don't trust anybody who tells you they don't.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But that is changing. <br/>Operators are increasingly adopting turbines designed to withstand tropical cyclones. One of the latest examples is a \"typhoon-resistant\" floating wind turbine, which will soon help to power an offshore oil platform in China. <br/>According to the manufacturer, MingYang Smart Energy, this 7.25 megawatt (MW) turbine can survive wind speeds of up to 134mph for 10 minutes. It has been installed at a facility 136km off the coast of the island province of Hainan.<br/>MingYang did not respond to a BBC request for comment but theirs is not the first turbine designed to face down such an onslaught. In 2021, US firm GE received typhoon-certification for its mammoth Haliade-X turbine. It is fixed, not floating, and has a capacity of up to 13MW.<br/>The blistering growth of the wind energy industry is pushing turbines to their limits and some question whether the pace of the rollout is wise.<br/>While components such as turbine blades are remarkably strong, they are not indestructible. And the forces of nature, especially out at sea, are notoriously unpredictable, meaning the pressure is on to prove that wind turbines really are hurricane-ready.<br/>Tropical cyclones - often called typhoons or hurricanes depending on location - are a familiar threat in certain parts of the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico or around much of Southeast Asia.<br/>Such storms can produce wind speeds well in excess of 100mph. The strongest one-minute sustained winds on record, of 215mph, were created by Hurricane Patricia in the Eastern Pacific in 2015. <br/>Despite the meteorological challenges in such regions, the expansion of wind energy is expected there in the coming years and decades.<br/>Today's turbines already put up with some powerful gales. Those positioned off the northeast coast of the UK in the North Sea operate in wind speeds of up to 50mph or so, after which point they are switched off, notes Simon Hogg at Durham University, who holds the \u00d8rsted chair at the university, which is funded by energy firm \u00d8rsted. <br/>Technically, such turbines are designed to survive even higher wind speeds.<br/>Leon Mishnaevsky of the Technical University of Denmark suggests that wind turbine blades are generally quite reliable. These days, they are made from strong but lightweight carbon fibre composites and automated manufacturing processes help to ensure the uniform placement of the fibres, which is important for the blades' robustness, he notes.<br/>Wind turbine makers also perform a range of stress tests on blades to ensure that they are up to scratch.<br/>This can include attaching large \"exciters\" to the blades, which bounce up and down, simulating the repeated stresses of winds on the structure. Giant blades are also sometimes bent to the point of breaking, says Prof Hogg, which helps to confirm the maximum loads they can bear.<br/>But the fallibility of turbines, especially the biggest ones, is becoming more apparent as time goes by. Insurer GCube notes in a recent report that offshore wind losses rose from \u00a31m in 2012 to more than \u00a37m in 2021.<br/>Plus, machines with capacities larger than 8MW can suffer component failures within just two years of installation, the firm says, more than twice as fast as 4-8MW devices.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Some of the most dangerous forces to trouble turbine blades are torsion, or twisting, loads, says Find M\u00f8lholt Jensen, chief executive of Bladena, a firm that specialises in diagnosing and repairing large turbine blades around 60m in length, or longer. <br/>Repeated twisting of blades can induce difficult-to-spot fractures, he says: \"The damage cannot be seen from the outside.\"<br/>The longer the blade, the greater the risk, comments a spokesman for Bladena.<br/>Current testing and industry standards are not sufficient to prove that the largest turbine blades can withstand these stresses, argues Dr Jensen.<br/>New designs could help, though. In Japan, Challenergy has been working on a turbine with tall, vertical blades that spin around a central tower.<br/>While currently much smaller and less powerful than the biggest traditional, three-bladed turbines in operation today, Challenergy's device is intended to cope with very high winds. <br/>When a powerful typhoon called Hin Nam No struck the Philippines and Japan last August, it passed over two of the company's turbines. One of the devices, at Ishigaki City in Okinawa, recorded wind speeds of around 64mph. The turbine continued to operate without any problems, according to Challenergy.<br/>In the US, a research team has taken a cue from nature in their design of an alternative hurricane-resistant turbine. <br/>\"We were inspired by palm trees,\" explains Lucy Pao at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"In high winds they kind of go with the flow, they bend with the wind.\"<br/>She and her colleagues designed a prototype two-bladed wind turbine design with flexible blades. Plus, the rotor faces downwind rather than into the wind, as is common in traditional configurations, helping it to absorb the impact of strong gales.<br/>During tests at an onshore site in Colorado, the blade tips were observed deflecting by up to 600mm, more than half a metre. \"None of them snapped,\" says Prof Pao.<br/>Wind speeds in the area can reach 100mph in the wintertime, she adds.<br/>However, the wind energy industry has almost universally adopted the upwind, three-bladed design so selling a new concept is difficult, Prof Pao explains. Currently, her research in this area is on hold, pending further funding.<br/>She shares the concerns of other observers who question whether wind turbines are really ready for some of the strongest winds nature can hurl at them.<br/>\"The novel materials, they are stronger, they are pretty amazing, but I don't know that they've been tested out as thoroughly as maybe they should be,\" she says.<br/>Then there are the tricky economics of siting turbines in places where winds are especially variable. James Martin is chief executive at Gulf Wind Technology, a company exploring the deployment of turbines in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>In this area, low wind speeds are common for most of the year - with the occasional hurricane blasting its way through. <br/>\"If you design that turbine to be strong enough to withstand the peak wind event, then you'll be carrying a lot of extra cost for the times that you've got light wind,\" notes Mr Martin. He declines to share details of the turbines or technologies his firm is considering.<br/>In the coming years, you can expect to see more and more turbines arriving in regions affected by cyclones, though.<br/>\"We need [turbines] there as much as we need them in any other area of the globe,\" argues Prof Hogg. \"I don't think we should shy away from it.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We each have our own stick and box, and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.<br/>This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.<br/>It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.<br/>Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.<br/>For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling. <br/>This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.<br/>\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.<br/>Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.<br/>Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.<br/>So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.<br/>\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.<br/>Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.<br/>Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply like blinking robots more. An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.<br/>Humans also perceive robots that blink more naturally as more intelligent. And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.<br/>Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.<br/>\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.  <br/>Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"<br/>Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. <br/>Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"<br/>Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.<br/>\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either. <br/>Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.<br/>With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.<br/>They've patented their system of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. <br/>Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\" <br/>The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in longer close-up interactions with humans.<br/>Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation. <br/>These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.  <br/>When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\"\u202f <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Or was it?<br/>Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".<br/>Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.<br/>Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.<br/>Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.<br/>\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"<br/>The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago. This has included Coral returning the favour of assistance, and giving Cherish some meditation lessons.<br/>Cherish says it is good that \"the expectation of money is out of the way\". <br/>\"Instead you really get to the core of things and you discover something, I think, that's greater and sort of priceless.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is the brainchild of Swiss co-founders Gabriele Donati and Karim Varini. They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.<br/>The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.<br/>You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins. <br/>\"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites. <br/>The concept of time banking has been around since the 19th Century. Mr Donati says that he wanted to bring it to a younger, and more digitally-savvy audience.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Another organisation helping to take time banking online is charity Timebanking UK. This offers assistance and software to help communities and organisations across the UK set up their own time-banking schemes.<br/>The platforms allow users to post offers and requests, log hours and leave feedback.<br/>Timebanking UK's chief executive Sarah Bird highlights the built-in safeguarding features, such as users being able to flag any problems. \"So if something goes wrong with the local time bank, we can just jump in there and see if we can fix things,\" she says.<br/>Ms Bird also explains that while time banking does not replace professional services or government programmes, it can underpin them, and engage people who would not usually do traditional volunteering.<br/>She adds that the Department for Work and Pensions allows jobseekers to claim time-banking hours towards their time spent looking for paid employment.<br/>\"Time banking might be the first step that someone will take from long-term unemployment before they go on to maybe volunteer or on a training course, because it's a method of making that person feel more confident about themselves,\" says Ms Bird.<br/>Timebanking UK has also set up similar schemes overseas, in countries including China, Russia, India, South Korea and Thailand.<br/>At Cardiff-based Tempo Time Credits, its time-sharing model is a bit different. Instead of participants earning credits that they can redeem from someone else doing a job for them, they get credits that they can redeem at affiliated businesses, such as local gyms, cinemas, food shops and tourist attractions.<br/>Rachel Gegeshidze, chief executive of Tempo Time Credits, says its online-based system is a way of attracting and rewarding volunteers. It is used by local authorities across the UK to help develop projects aimed at key community improvements, such as addressing loneliness or tackling poverty.<br/>\"It really supports people to do new things and try new experiences... but also, we have programmes to engage tenants in their communities and to improve health and wellbeing,\" she says.<br/>The charity's 2022 Impact Report showed that there were 10,731 active participants and about 1,100 involved organisations. The study also found that 84% of people taking part felt more positive about their future.<br/>Back at TimeRepublik, it says it doesn't wish to be seen as a replacement for cash economies, and that instead it was \"built to coexist\" with them.<br/>Cherish Cullison says that from her experience \"everyone has been very happy about the exchanges and I've met some really interesting people\".<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.<br/>The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.<br/>Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. <br/>One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.<br/>Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where nets draped over rows of apple trees limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. <br/>There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.<br/>Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. <br/>Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.<br/>For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. <br/>But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.<br/>But some researchers are working on hydrophobic nets, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.<br/>Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.<br/>Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.<br/>Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As her research in the Mediterranean has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.<br/>Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. <br/>Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. <br/>It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.<br/>Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to European policies intended to reduce insecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. <br/>The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges. <br/>Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.<br/>Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.<br/>Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.<br/>\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says. <br/>For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains. <br/>To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.<br/>Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. <br/>But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They typically allow the user to monitor his or her heartbeat, and make a contactless payment.<br/>It's a fast-growing tech sector, reported to be seeing global sales rise by 21% a year.<br/>Jiri and Ondrej's smart rings are, however, designed to be more romantic than most - they allow them to see and feel each other's heartbeat. <br/>Each ring is connected by Bluetooth to an app on the wearer's smartphone. And via the app two rings can be linked together.<br/>So every time Jiri presses his wedding ring, it both physically pulses with Ondrej's heartbeat, and displays the heartbeat as a moving red line. And the same in reverse for Ondrej.<br/>As long as their mobile phones are both connected to the internet, they get a real time heartbeat. If either is offline, they get the last recorded one.<br/>\"We were never into gold and diamonds,\" says Jiri. \"We wanted something different, so we liked the idea that this was something new. We feel like pioneers in this.\"<br/>The rechargeable ring, called the HB Ring, is made by Czech firm The Touch. Although the first iteration went on limited sale back in 2016, the company is now seeing an increase in global interest thanks to the wider surge in the smart ring sector.<br/>In addition, the business has this year launched a new parallel product - The Touch Locket. To be worn on a necklace, this has the same technology as the smart rings.<br/>Its target customers include engaged couples who might like the idea of being able to feel their loved one's heartbeat, but don't want to forgo having traditional wedding rings.<br/>Jiri and Ondrej are among the many couples now increasingly using tech in their wedding celebrations. From drones for wedding photography, to digital tools to help with wedding planning tasks, such as managing the budget and seating arrangements, tech has infiltrated many important aspects of the wedding day.<br/>The wedding tech trend is growing as a result of people conducting so much of their lives on their smartphones, says Zoe Burke, the lead editor for UK wedding planning website Hitched.co.uk.<br/>\"I think people just take it for granted now that you'll be able to plan your wedding through your phone. You probably met your partner through your phone,\" she says.<br/>A third of couples in the UK are now said to use WhatsApp to invite guests to their wedding, and 60% announce their engagement on social media.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Some people are even now using artificial intelligence (AI) software to write their wedding vows or speeches. US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you.<br/>Called \"Wedding Writer's Block Assistant\", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI.<br/>Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words.<br/>\"We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,\" says Mr Joshi. \"The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful.\"<br/>The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home.<br/>But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. \"People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,\" she says.<br/>For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones. This also has an environmental benefit.<br/>Rohita Pabla, a wedding planner based in London, says: \"It's about cost saving and being environmentally conscious. More and more couples are thinking about the environment.\" <br/>Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception. <br/>One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring \"gif booths\" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone.<br/>\"Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,\" adds Ms Pabla. \"They want to be the Instagram couple.\" <br/>But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions.<br/>For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person.<br/>\"So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,\" says Ms Pabla. \"But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite.\"<br/>Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to \"make everything easier and much more interesting\". Yet he cautions that at the same time you need to avoid the risk \"of losing the charm and the romance of what real weddings are about, which is essentially bringing friends and family close together\".<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Age is the highest risk factor for disease, whether it's cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or dementia, so if ageing as a whole could be delayed, then so could the risk of onset of these conditions. For him though, it's a sport.<br/>In Mr Johnson's luxurious Venice Beach home, a bedroom has been converted into a clinic where he spends many hours.<br/>He wakes at 5am, eating his first meal an hour later, followed by a second, and final one at 11am. This, combined with a forensically selected 54 pills, a mix of supplements and off-label medication, are all planned based on readings from a catalogue of tests.<br/>His days consist of a torturous exercise regime, monitoring and numerous treatments.<br/>He told me the all-over skin laser treatment he's been having has reduced his skin age by 22 years, the greatest age reduction in any part of his body.<br/>The aesthetics are just a small part of it all though, as he reminds me \"our skin is our biggest organ\". <br/>Mr Johnson was warm, logical and likeable. I left his house wanting to be (a bit) like him. Maybe I am already - I run 5km a day, try to avoid sugar, and test extreme tracking devices for fun.<br/>My colleagues considered Mr Johnson's existence joyless, so his life is clearly not for everyone.<br/>While his routine might seem extreme, every conversation I had still came back to lifestyle.<br/>\"Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity - only about 7% is genetics,\" says Eric Verdin, chief executive of The Buck Institute for Ageing Research.<br/>\"Based on the data [if we live healthily], I would predict that most people could live to 95 in good health. So there's 15 to 17 [extra] years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us,\" he told me.<br/>The big question, which Mr Verdin and others are investigating, is what does a healthy lifestyle mean? Take exercise for example - should that be a daily stroll, or a HIIT class? <br/>The same goes for healthy eating. Is fasting as important as avoiding sugar? And what about a good night's sleep?<br/>You can't underestimate the obsession with sleep I came across. I met many people setting their alarms not to wake up in the morning, but to remind them to go to bed on time for a full eight hours.<br/>Well, we all set the bar at different levels.<br/>Mr Verdin practises what he preaches, his regime consisting of \"a whole lot of exercise, some fasting, good sleep, lots of social connections, very little alcohol\".<br/>His suggestion for others? \"Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24 hours without ingesting any calories as this has a profound effect on your metabolism.\"<br/>The jury is out on how healthy this is for some women though.<br/>Keeping better track of our bodies as they age might help. Health risks could be flagged in advance and any new drugs could be applied just at the right time. <br/>Make it personalised, make it pre-emptive, make it better is the mantra.<br/>It was interesting to see that pretty much all of those working in longevity science wear more than one tracker themselves - commonly a smartwatch and a smart ring (way more convenient for sleep I can tell you - and these people are obsessed with prioritising sleep).<br/>More technology of business:<br/>For my part I've found health tracking illuminating. I am not diabetic, but have been fascinated by the findings of a continuous glucose monitor I wore for a while. <br/>The assumption is progress on longevity will come, albeit in a less sensational form than some may be hoping for.<br/>Experts suggest that a drug might emerge that will initially make a year or two's difference, then a few years more with the next generation, and so on.<br/>But along with such progress will come practical and ethical dilemmas.<br/>One fundamental question is whether ageing can be defined as a disease. This might simplify the approval of drugs by regulators, but risks labelling people over a certain age \"diseased\".<br/>The cost of such treatments may or may not (for developed medical systems anyway) be an issue, depending on what it turns out to be.<br/>Meanwhile, a healthier life is likely to lead to a few extra years of existence, so we may need to work longer.<br/>On my longevity learning mission, my expectations were upturned.<br/>I'd seen the sensationalist headlines, suggesting tech billionaires lounging on their yachts, deliberating over whether they fancied saving the world, going to space, or \"curing\" ageing.<br/>This wasn't the reality I saw. The wealthy have been giving money to medical research for years. This is just a new generation of wealth, and a potential new specialism of medicine. <br/>Plus it's really interesting, and affects us all.<br/>But right now, extending your healthspan involves hard work.

He has already urged lenders to offer the measures which Labour wants to make mandatory. <br/>He is coming under pressure for the government to step in with Covid-style financial help for households.<br/>But he has rejected calls by Tory backbenchers Sir Jake Berry and Jonathan Gullis to bring back a tax break that would cut monthly payments.<br/>He told MPs: \"Those kind of schemes, which involve injecting large amounts of cash into the economy, would be inflationary.\"<br/>The government has also rejected a Liberal Democrat plan for grants of \u00a3300 a month for struggling homeowners, to be funded by a windfall tax on the banks.<br/>Downing Street insists Rishi Sunak is on course to meet his target of halving inflation - the rate prices are rising - this year, even though the rate remains stubbornly high at 8.7%.  <br/>Speaking at an event on Thursday, the prime minister is expected to say he feels a \"deep moral responsibility\" to lower inflation, adding: \"I'm completely confident that if we hold our nerve, we can do so.\"<br/>However, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly admitted \"not all the levers of control are in the government's hands\", with the independent Bank of England responsible for setting interest rates, one of the main tools to tackle inflation.<br/>Instead, Mr Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was doing things like being cautious on offering big public sector pay increases and being conscious that increased government borrowing could fuel inflationary pressures. <br/>Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money and theoretically encourages people to borrow less and spend less, meaning price rises should ease.<br/>The Bank of England is widely expected to increase interest rates by 0.25% to 4.75% at 12:00 BST, although some analysts have suggested the base rate could go up to 5%. <br/>Labour's plan includes guaranteeing that relief measures such as temporary interest-only payments and extending the time period for paying back mortgages are available.<br/>The party is also calling for a six-month grace period for homeowners threatened with repossession as well as guarantees that credit scores will not be affected by asking for help.<br/>Labour says the government should order regulator the Financial Conduct Authority to require lenders to offer all these options.<br/>In a statement, UK Finance, which represents the banking and finance industry, said: \"Over the last year, lenders have helped nearly 200,000 borrowers who cannot meet their full mortgage payments by providing tailored forbearance. <br/>\"This could be a period of reduced payments, a period of zero payments or a temporary switch to interest-only.  <br/>\"Contacting your lender to find out the options available won't impact your credit score, but missing payments will.\"<br/>Interest rates set to rise for 13th time in a row<br/>Warning homeowners face 20% drop in disposable income<br/>What happens if I can't afford to pay my mortgage?<br/>Will soaring mortgage costs push the UK into recession?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It's for a speech by the chancellor at the time, John Major.<br/>You can easily imagine some of his words then being used by Jeremy Hunt, the current chancellor, now.<br/>\"The problem is inflation. I have no doubt that the central task before us is the reduction and the elimination of rising prices. Not only does this objective remain the same, but so do the policies needed to achieve it,\" Sir John said, in what was his first speech as chancellor.<br/>But he was also rather more blunt than today's generation of politicians are usually willing to be.<br/>He also said: \"I understand the difficulties that many face with high interest and mortgage rates. But they - and the resulting slowing of the economy that we must see - are the means by which we will cure the problem. They are not the problem.\"<br/>And he added: \"So inflation must go. Ending it cannot be painless. The harsh truth is that if the policy isn't hurting, it isn't working.\"<br/>Sir John spoke then, very candidly, about a timeless economic and political trade-off, between inflation and interest rates.<br/>Granted interest rates were then under the direct control of the government. They are now decided by the independent Bank of England, which is tasked with keeping to an inflation target set by the government.<br/>But the trade-offs remain and privately, ministers acknowledge that. And if interest rates go too high, the risk is a recession, a year or so out from a general election.<br/>One minister told me that interest rates had been close to zero for so long that people had collectively forgotten that that couldn't possibly last forever.<br/>Another added that it was about time that savers could get some returns on their savings, even if, for now at least, those returns remain below inflation.<br/>Plenty I speak to in government privately are exasperated by what they see as a knee-jerk instinct for government intervention, including from some on their own side.<br/>But politicians can never be blind to the public mood - and the realities of economic pain.<br/>The chancellor will meet mortgage providers later this week and we can expect to hear from the prime minister on all this again too.<br/>Labour has set out its approach. The Liberal Democrats want a Mortgage Protection Fund to help homeowners on the lowest incomes. <br/>Oh and one final thought: Rising interest rates have an impact too on the biggest borrower of all: this government, and its successors.<br/>That rising cost of borrowing will affect millions of households.

That was met with surprise by analysts who had expected it to fall.<br/>The shock figure was driven by higher prices for flights and second-hand cars but supermarket food prices also continued to rise rapidly.<br/>So-called \"core\" inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as direct energy and food prices, along with alcohol and tobacco prices, continued to rise last month at its fastest rate for 31 years.<br/>Economists said this made the UK stand out from other countries such as the US and Germany where inflation is falling.<br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared to back further interest rate rises saying it would not \"hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy\".<br/>The government's target is to halve the inflation rate to 5% by the end of the year. The official, long-term target set for the Bank is 2%.<br/>Rob Morgan, from investment firm Charles Stanley, said: \"Getting the inflation genie back into the bottle is proving troublesome for the Bank of England.<br/>\"With price momentum continually running above expectations alongside strong wages data, the Bank has no choice but to continue on a path of raising interest rates several more times.\"<br/>When interest rates rise, a range of loans can get more expensive. More than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate mortgage deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments. <br/>The increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.<br/>This comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.<br/>If the rate goes up to 5%, those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a347 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a330 jump.<br/>Eight out of 10 mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage. Their monthly payments may not change immediately, but house buyers or anyone seeking to remortgage face a sharp rise in repayments when they move on to a new deal. <br/>The so-called \"mortgage bomb\" has become a huge economic and political issue. An average two-year fixed deal, which was 2.29% in November 2021, is now above 6%.<br/>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a politically independent economics-focused think tank, says rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable incomes fall by more than 20%.<br/>Renters are also feeling the impact. \"It is likely that at least part of the increases in rents we are seeing is due to high interest rates hitting landlords' borrowing costs,\" the IFS said.<br/>Rents have been growing faster than wages in the UK for nearly two years, according to exclusive data given to the BBC by property portal Zoopla. <br/>Meanwhile, savers should benefit from a rise in interest rates, but MPs on the Treasury Committee have criticised banks and building societies for failing to pass this on in full to loyal savers who have instant-access savings accounts.<br/>How are interest rate rises affecting you?

That's a job I'd like. But I'm also loving the job I do now.\"<br/>Despite his obvious enthusiasm to succeed Mr Stoltenberg as the next head of Nato, he appears to have failed to get the backing of key allies.<br/>US President Joe Biden described Mr Wallace as \"very qualified\" for the job when he met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Washington recently.<br/>But in private, the US is believed to be one of the nations trying to persuade Mr Stoltenberg to stay - at least for another year. This was echoed by Mr Wallace in comments to The Economist.<br/>The war in Ukraine has re-focused diplomatic attention on Nato's role in the 21st century and whether it can deter Russian aggression. <br/>Mr Wallace proved popular with a number of countries on the alliance's eastern flank because of his leadership in supplying weapons to Ukraine. <br/>But others have argued for continuity in a time of war, or that the job should be reserved for a former head of government. <br/>Mr Stoltenberg, who has been the alliance's top boss for nine years, has neither confirmed or denied his intentions to continue in the job.<br/>He told reporters last week: \"I am responsible for all decisions that this alliance has to take except for one. And that is about my future. That is for the 31 allies to decide.\"<br/>Another contender for the role is Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who - if elected - would be the first female Nato chief.<br/>In his interview with the Economist, Mr Wallace said whoever takes on the role would need to deal with \"a lot of unresolved issues in Nato,\" including differing demands from US and French leadership.<br/>France believes Nato's secretary general should come from within the European Union. <br/>With less than a month to go until the Nato summit in Lithuania, it looks increasingly likely that Mr Stoltenberg will be asked to extend his tenure again.<br/>Nato was formed in 1949 by 12 countries and its original goal was to challenge Soviet expansion in Europe after World War Two. <br/>More recently, Russia has used the expansion of Nato as a pretext for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

and asked for the protocol to be changed.<br/>He added that he didn't feel comfortable that someone \"a long way from front line\" could make such a decision, which would be better made by people closer to the situation on the ground, he added. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose -

They are not political footballs,\" the statement added. <br/>Labour's motion in the Commons aimed to force the bill back into Parliament, in defiance of the government's plans.<br/>If passed, the motion would have allocated 12 July to try to pass the bill through its final legislative steps in the House of Commons.<br/>However, following a debate, MPs voted by 256 votes to 183 to reject Labour's motion. <br/>A number of Conservatives have previously expressed frustration at the government's decision to pull the bill, but during the debate some attacked Labour for tabling the motion.<br/>Tory Dame Andrea Jenkyns said that, by attempting to reintroduce the bill rather than simply a motion to support it, the opposition party had been \"too clever by half\" <br/>She said she had been prepared to vote with the opposition on the issue, but couldn't \"let an unelected opposition take control\" of Parliament's timetable.<br/>Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: \"If the opposition has genuinely wanted to make this and put pressure on the government to do this, a simple motion that said we would support the bill moving and being adopted would have got everybody in favour of it. By doing this in a way that tries to take over the business he knows very well that this is actually about the politics.\"<br/>Labour's shadow environment minister Alex Sobel said Conservative MPs had supported the bill, \"so why can they not today join us and give us the time to get this through\". <br/>\"Let's work together to do the right thing and put animal welfare before party politics,\" he said. <br/>The SNP's Patricia Gibson described the government as a \"weak, lily-livered husk\" which \"doesn't even have the confidence to deliver its own manifesto commitment\". She added that Scotland was \"shackled to a corpse that can not act\". <br/>Environment minister Trudy Harrison sought to reassure MPs that the government was committed to introducing the animal welfare measures \"successfully and swiftly\" through different bills.<br/>Announcing in May that the bill had been scrapped, environment minister Mark Spencer put the blame mostly on Labour, saying the opposition were \"clearly determined to play political games by widening the scope of this bill\".<br/>Mr Spencer said at the time that the government would use single-issue legislation to keep to commitments on \"cracking down on puppy smuggling\", \"ban live exports for fattening and slaughter\", and tackle pet abduction and livestock worrying.<br/>Livestock worrying is when a dog attacks or chases livestock on agricultural land, which can result in injury or death.<br/>On Tuesday, the government announced plans to consult on a new system of licences to effectively ban the keeping of primates as pets.<br/>The new licensing system, based on the results of a consultation held in December 2020, requires \"zoo-level standards\" of care for any primate kept in captivity in the UK.<br/>Up to 5,000 primates - mammals which include apes, monkeys and lemurs - are living outside licensed zoos in the UK, according to RSPCA estimates.<br/>A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \"The UK is a world leader on animal welfare and we are fully committed to maintaining and enhancing our strong track record to date.<br/>\"We are committed to delivering the Kept Animals Bill measures individually during the remainder of this Parliament and look forward to progressing these.

There was also an overall squeeze on health spending. <br/>Mr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.<br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\" <br/>The British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\". <br/>On Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid. <br/>During the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown. <br/>He said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".<br/>\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.<br/>\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans. <br/>\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"<br/>Earlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics. <br/>He also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.<br/>Labour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-PM Cameron admits mistake over pandemic planning<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Covid inquiry criticises government evidence<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

So where were they?<br/>Most had decided to stay away from the Commons debate, rather than record their verdict against the man who led them to victory at the last general election.<br/>It did not stop the report, written by the Commons privileges committee after a year-long inquiry, passing easily by 354 votes to seven.<br/>Conservative MPs who voted against it included Sir Bill Cash, Nick Fletcher, Adam Holloway, Karl McCartney, Joy Morrissey and Heather Wheeler.<br/>Work and Pensions Minister Mel Stride has told the BBC he had abstained from the vote because its main sanction - a hypothetical 90-day suspension for Mr Johnson, had he not already quit as an MP - was too severe. <br/>Another cabinet minister - Michael Gove - said the same on Sunday.<br/>But what about Rishi Sunak? <br/>We are told the prime minister had longstanding engagements on Monday. <br/>In the afternoon, he had a meeting with Sweden's PM Ulf Kristersson.

He said he did not want to pre-empt their conclusions. <br/>On Sunday evening, having had the weekend to digest the report's findings, he was asked how he would vote. <br/>Several times, he dodged a direct answer and simply said he did not want to influence other MPs, who were not being instructed by party managers - called whips - how they should vote.<br/>So as things stand, we still do not know what the prime minister thinks about the report. We'll keep asking. <br/>In some respects, that uncertainty is convenient for Mr Sunak.<br/>If he had voted to endorse the report, he would have been seen by Boris Johnson's allies as having committed another act of treachery. <br/>Many would never have forgiven him. They could have made life difficult in the coming months. <br/>If he had rejected the report, that would have angered other Conservatives who spoke passionately in defence of the privileges committee in the Commons on Monday.<br/>It would have, in the eyes of opponents, undermined his commitment to integrity, professionalism and accountability, which he made on the steps of Downing Street when he became PM. <br/>But his decision not to vote or comment on the report is not without risk. <br/>You can expect opposition parties to hammer home the argument that Mr Sunak is too weak to deliver judgment on Mr Johnson. <br/>Liberal Democrats have accused him of a \"cowardly cop-out,\" while Labour has called him \"too weak to lead a party too divided to govern\".<br/>Tory MPs face dilemma on Johnson Partygate vote<br/>Chris Mason: A vote about principles and blunt politics<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

dubbed the Partygate scandal. <br/>Its report concluded that Mr Johnson made multiple deliberately misleading statements to Parliament about events at No 10. <br/>Ahead of the report's publication, Mr Johnson announced he was quitting as an MP, branding the committee a \"kangaroo court\". <br/>The report found Mr Johnson had committed further \"contempts\" of Parliament by attacking the committee, increasing the severity of the recommended sanction. <br/>The committee subsequently recommended a 90-day suspension for Mr Johnson - a long ban by recent standards - as well as denying him the parliamentary pass, which he would normally be entitled to as a former MP. <br/>If he had still been an MP, the suspension could have triggered a by-election in his constituency. <br/>Speaking during a Commons debate ahead of the vote, Mrs May said backing the report would be \"a small but important step in restoring people's trust\" in Parliament.<br/>It was \"important to show the public that there is not one rule for them and another for us\", she said. <br/>Mrs May urged her fellow MPs to vote in support of the report \"to uphold standards in public life, to show that we all recognise the responsibility we have to the people we serve, and to help to restore faith in our parliamentary democracy\". <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rishi Sunak is asked several times if he will take part in Boris Johnson Partygate report debate and vote in the Commons.<br/>During the debate, supporters of Mr Johnson spoke out against the report's findings. <br/>Ms Nici, who was Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary, told MPs she could not see any evidence he had knowingly misled Parliament. <br/>She questioned the impartiality of the committee and suggested the process was \"political opportunism\" for people who did not like Mr Johnson. <br/>Former minister Sir Jacob, who was knighted by Mr Johnson in his resignation honours, described the proposed 90-day suspension as \"a vindictive sanction\". <br/>In response to accusations some Johnson allies had attempted to discredit the committee's work, Mr Rees-Mogg said it was \"absolutely legitimate to criticise the conduct of a committee\" and its members. <br/>However, the committee's chairwoman, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said its members had to \"withstand a campaign of threats, intimidation, and harassment designed to challenge the legitimacy of the inquiry\". <br/>She defended her impartiality, after Sir Jacob referenced her previous tweets criticising Mr Johnson, saying she had offered to step aside as chairwoman after the tweets emerged but she said she was assured by the government she should continue in her role. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Harriet Harman answers Jacob Rees-Mogg who raises her \"famous tweets\" about Boris Johnson<br/>Earlier it was not clear whether there would be a formal vote on the report - compelling MPs to go on the record to vote for, against or abstain - but Labour forced one. <br/>It was a free vote for Tory MPs, meaning party managers - known as whips - had not instructed them how to vote. <br/>Commons Leader Ms Mordaunt, who opened the debate, said she would vote in support of the report, adding: \"The integrity of our institutions matter.\"<br/>However, she said \"all members need to make up their own minds and others should leave them alone to do so\". <br/>Sunak not expected to attend Partygate debate<br/>Tory MPs face dilemma on Johnson Partygate vote<br/>Boris Johnson Partygate report at a glance<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose -

A small rise in percentage terms can still have a significant effect on people's finances.<br/>If a first-time buyer had a mortgage on the same property, that would take up 26% of pay, it said.<br/>The chunk of income taken up by rent varies in different regions. Even in London, where rent has previously taken up a bigger proportion of wages, the cost still accounts for 40% of gross earnings - the highest in the UK.<br/>Rents have been rising significantly for the last year. Although those on a fixed rent would not have seen a difference, those signing up to new contracts, or moving to a different property are likely to have seen big increases.<br/>The pressure of rising mortgage rates faced by landlords, as well as higher demand for properties than the number made available, have combined to raise the costs for tenants.<br/>The typical rise has been at more than 10%, compared with a year earlier, for 15 months in a row.<br/>In April, rent in London was 13.5% higher than a year ago, in Scotland it was 13.1% higher, and the North West of England saw a 10.5% increase.<br/>\"The impact of higher rents is not uniform with those on low incomes bearing the brunt, with increasing signs of stress,\" Mr Donnell said.<br/>Those trying to move from renting to buying their own home also face greater difficulty in securing a mortgage. Financial information service Moneyfacts said the number of deals available for someone offering a 5% deposit was down from 347 at the start of June last year to 199 now.<br/>There's more on your renting rights and where to go for help here.<br/>Mr Ward is among those renters feeling the squeeze, even though he is in a relatively well-paid job.<br/>He said he and his girlfriend's \u00a31,750 a month budget was regarded as low by agents, so they felt they were being priced out of London.<br/>He said that the situation was all the more \"absurd\" because of the competition for properties. The couple are now considering getting a visa to work overseas, for a better quality of life.<br/>One of the major reasons for higher rents is that there are lots of tenants chasing a smaller number of properties to rent.<br/>Zoopla said that there are 20% to 40% fewer homes to rent in most regions than there were before the pandemic. Meanwhile there are many more tenants than has been seen on average over the last five years.<br/>This was likely to become more acute as demand traditionally picks up during the summer months.<br/>Edinburgh and Glasgow feature high on the rental league table, partly because they score highly on quality of life and strong job markets, but there's more going on behind those numbers.<br/>The cities' universities have gone on a recruiting spree for foreign students, putting pressure on the rental market.<br/>And the alliance of SNP with Scottish Green ministers in the Scottish government have risked distorting the market with rent controls. <br/>A freeze in rents and evictions was introduced last September and lasted until March. Also to help households facing rising costs, there's now a 3% cap on rent increases until next March. Further and more permanent rent controls are expected in Holyrood legislation later this year, being drawn up by Green MSP and minister for tenants' rights Patrick Harvie.<br/>However, there is no constraint on the rents at which landlords can advertise new tenancies. So according to property professionals, newly-advertised rents have risen, as landlords seek to protect their income against the impact of future constraints once tenants have moved in.<br/>Zoopla's rental sector survey, published every three months, tracks the rents that landlords request when listing a property, but analysts also adjust the numbers to reflect the rent that is eventually agreed.<br/>Homeowners have been hit by rising interest, and mortgage rates, and that has spilled over into the buy-to-let market - which often sees even higher mortgage rates.<br/>Up to a third of landlords who have hefty mortgages are facing the biggest impact of rising interest rates, which are going up further than previously expected.<br/>Last week estate agency Savills said landlords were making their lowest profits for 16 years as interest rates rose.<br/>In a recent report, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that higher rates, and stricter laws, were pushing some landlords to consider selling up. That would create a further squeeze on availability and could, in turn, increase the cost of renting further.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox here.<br/>What are your rights when you're renting?<br/>Warning rising mortgage costs to hit renters<br/>More pain for renters as landlords look to sell up<br/>Five reasons why mortgages are getting us down<br/>How an interest rate rise affects you<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That is likely to include the controversial new Rosebank development west of Shetland.<br/>Sir Keir said: \"Labour will deliver lower bills, good jobs, and energy security for Scotland and the whole UK, as Britain leads the world in the fight against climate change.\"<br/>He said it would be a \"historic mistake\" to wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out and let the opportunities \"pass us by\".<br/>The Labour leader said his party had \"a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs. No cliff edges.\"<br/>One of Labour's initiatives will be to provide more incentives for areas to take part in new clean energy projects. Under Labour's plans, GB Energy - the new publicly-owned firm which it says will be based in Scotland at a location yet to be decided - would play a key role in getting that message across.<br/>It would oversee the return of profits from successful projects to local councils. The councils could then use that income to reduce council tax, pay for improved public services or simply provide rebates on energy bills.<br/>Labour says GB Energy could end up providing up to \u00a3600m per year to local councils to invest in green infrastructure and a further \u00a3400m annually in low interest loans for community projects.<br/>These community loans would be designed to ensure small projects could benefit from the expertise of GB Energy while also generating money for local areas.<br/>Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and the SNP of having abysmal records on renewables.<br/>He said Labour would introduce new rules on \"good work, decent pay and union recognition\" - and create a new incentive.<br/>This would be \"a British jobs bonus that will attract new investment, new jobs, new supply chains into our deprived industrial heartlands and will reward companies that back working people\".<br/>Offshore Energy UK's chief executive David Whitehouse told the BBC that Labour's plans to move away from the reliance of North Sea oil and gas \"would create a cliff edge\" deterring investment and heightening the risk of energy shortages.<br/>Mr Whitehouse said 180 of the North Sea's 283 active oil and gas fields were due to close by 2030, and new licences were \"essential\" or production would \"plummet\" and \"the UK and its skilled workforce will be exposed\".<br/>The GMB union said the UK was going to need oil and gas until 2050 and beyond, and that a ban on new licences \"ignores this reality\".<br/>But Philip Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said the idea that the plans would \"lead to an overnight shutdown of the industry\" was nonsense.<br/>Labour's opposition to new exploration licences represented \"genuine leadership\" he added, and the party was right \"to debunk scare stories being peddled by climate delayers\".<br/>Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, welcomed Labour's latest ideas but warned \"there can be no backsliding on pledges to stop new oil and gas extraction and invest in green growth\".<br/>Environmental groups are particularly vocal about their opposition to the proposed Rosebank development in the North Atlantic.<br/>Industry and government sources say the field could be approved by the UK government's North Sea Transition Authority within weeks.<br/>Norwegian state-controlled oil company Equinor said Rosebank could produce almost 70,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak.<br/>Sir Keir has held private talks with senior energy industry figures in the past week and previously gave direct assurances to Equinor that a Labour government would not revoke any licences.<br/>Instead the party says its focus is on delivering \"cheaper zero carbon power by 2030\" and its \"mission\" includes plans to attract and incentivise investment \"in the UK's industrial heartlands\".<br/>That is likely to provoke comparisons with the approach taken by the US Democratic president Joe Biden whose Inflation Reduction Act has been described by the UK Conservative government's Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch as \"protectionist\". <br/>The Scottish Conservatives' energy spokesman Liam Kerr described Labour's plans as \"ruinous\" for the UK's oil and gas industry, claiming they \"would throw up to 90,000 highly skilled workers in the North East under a bus pretty much overnight\".<br/>The Scottish government said it was committed to \"a planned and fair transition\" away from fossil fuels that did not imperil jobs.<br/>First Minister Humza Yousaf said Labour governments had squandered hundreds of billions of pounds of oil and gas revenues, and only invested a fraction in Scotland.<br/>\"I am not sure anybody will trust a Labour Party on the green economy just two weeks after they dump their \u00a328bn green prosperity fund,\" he added.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

a view contradicted by the party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.<br/>On Friday, at a meeting of the British Irish Council in Jersey, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he was sure Mr Heaton-Harris would \"listen respectfully\" to the DUP's position.<br/>Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said his government could only play a supporting role.<br/>NI secretary 'playing fast and loose' with public<br/>NI Secretary wants money raising options by 30 June<br/>DUP leader hopeful for progress after talks<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose -

To embed rights we should all enjoy in a modern constitution.\"<br/>Mr Yousaf set out how the Scottish Parliament would legislate for an interim constitution after a vote to leave the UK - with this coming into force when Scotland becomes independent.<br/>A constitutional convention would then be established to develop a draft constitution, which would be considered by Holyrood.<br/>The first minister said it would only come into force if the people of Scotland backed it in a referendum.<br/>The SNP leader said his party's preferred route to independence was a legally binding referendum - something the UK government has repeatedly refused to countenance. <br/>He said building a consensus among Scottish voters was the way to break the \"logjam\" over Scotland's future and said he aimed to use the \"power of people\".<br/>The party's strategy will be discussed at an SNP independence convention on 24 June. <br/>Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that his government was focused on the cost of living crisis, the NHS, and growing the economy, but that these issues are \"linked\" to plans for an independent Scotland. <br/>\"We've had over a decade of Westminster-imposed austerity. We have a hard Brexit also being imposed upon Scotland, of course a Brexit we did not vote for, doing untold damage to our economy and to our businesses too,\" he said. <br/>\"So independence gives us the opportunity to take our own future very much into our own hands.\"<br/>A UK Government spokesperson said: \"We want to work constructively with the Scottish government to tackle our shared challenges because that is what families and businesses in Scotland expect.<br/>\"This is not the time to be talking about distracting constitutional change.\"<br/>Scottish Conservative constitution spokesperson Donald Cameron said the plan was \"full of holes\". <br/>\"People want the SNP-Green government to be focused on their real priorities right now such as rising bills, fixing our NHS and strengthening our economy,\" he said. <br/>Scottish Labour constitution spokesperson Neil Bibby said the \"SNP resort to pipe-dreams as the country crumbles under their watch\". <br/>And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton accused the SNP of being \"completely out of touch\".<br/>He added: \"Deploying more civil servants, money and time into independence is an insult to everyone waiting for help with the cost of living crisis, on lifeline ferries or for critical operations and treatments.\"<br/>Sturgeon unveils case for Scottish independence<br/>Sturgeon: I am certain I have done nothing wrong<br/>At a glance: Scottish government independence paper<br/>Five questions on the economics of independence<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That's why I also back the police in tackling this blight in communities which are disproportionately affected, such as among young black males. We need to do everything in our power to crack down on this violence.\"<br/>The Home Office called on officers to use available powers to arrest people who unlawfully obstruct stop-and-searches. It said forces should publish footage from body cameras worn by officers quickly to prevent innocent officers from being \"subject to trial by social media\".<br/>The Home Office also said it was planning to put into law two conditions for using stop-and-search powers. <br/>The department said police should communicate with \"the local community\" when putting in place Section 60 orders - that is, stop-and-searches that can be carried out without requiring \"reasonable grounds\".<br/>Police forces can authorise the use of Section 60 orders in set areas - usually a neighbourhood or sometimes a whole borough - for a defined period of time.<br/>The Home Office also said data on every stop-and-search interaction must continue to be collected for it to publish for transparency and public scrutiny.<br/>The National Police Chief's Council described stop and search as a \"valuable policing tool\".<br/>Dorset Police Chief Constable Amanda Pearson said: \"We know that the use of stop-and-search can have a significant impact on individuals and communities, particularly our black communities and young people. <br/>\"It is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities.\"<br/>But former Metropolitan Police Ch Supt Dal Babu said Ms Braverman's attempt to direct officers on stop-and-search was a \"very troubling\" intervention, and it should be down to local commanders to decide when it is used.  <br/>Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said the home secretary's push was going to do \"immense harm to our communities\".<br/>The policing watchdog has previously called for an end to the overuse of stop-and-searches on people from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds.<br/>In 2022, the Independent Office for Police Conduct said it was a \"legitimate policing tactic\", but it was time to \"break the cycle\" of its disproportionate use, which was causing \"trauma\" and damaging confidence in policing.<br/>Police must end stop-and-search trauma \u2013 watchdog<br/>What is a Section 60 stop and search?<br/>Police forces to trial new stop and search order<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That led to his suspension from the Conservative Party in April last year. <br/>He announced his resignation in an interview with the Mail On Sunday in which the paper reports him as admitting to taking cocaine after drinking \"incredibly potent\" Japanese whisky. <br/>He added in the interview: \"I was set up, but I have been naive and incredibly stupid.\" He went on to deny the harassment claims he is accused of. <br/>His immediate departure means the Conservatives will now face a fourth by-election.<br/>Mr Warburton has represented his constituency as an independent since losing the Tory whip. A writ for a new election is usually issued with three months of the resignation, according to Parliament's website. <br/>Mr Warburton, who had taken the constituency from the Liberal Democrats in 2015, was re-elected in 2017 and 2019. He won with a majority of 19,213 in that last poll.<br/>\"My constituents in Somerton and Frome who elected me three times with overwhelming majorities have for a year been deprived of the voice they need,\" said Mr Warburton.<br/>\"I am so grateful for their many messages of support, and it is with sorrow that I have no choice but to provoke the upheaval of a by-election.\"<br/>He also said in his three-page resignation letter  he had been denied a fair hearing by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) and prevented from \"speaking out\" while it investigated the accusations.<br/>The House of Commons rejected the claim saying ICGS was \"there to ensure all complaints are dealt with in a manner that is fair, thorough, independent and efficient\". <br/>In a statement, a Commons spokesman said: \"We remain committed to ensuring that lasting cultural change can be delivered for all of those in Parliament.\"<br/>Mr Warburton joins Boris Johnson and Nigel Adams who resigned last week triggering by-elections in their constituencies. <br/>Nadine Dorries also announced her resignation, but said her departure would not be immediate as she wanted to stay while she seeks to investigate how she was denied a seat in the Lords on Boris Johnson's resignation honours list. <br/>Labour's national campaign co-ordinator Shabana Mahmood accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of being \"too weak to act himself\" after Mr Warburton resigned \"in disgrace\". <br/>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Time after time the Conservatives have mired themselves in sleaze and scandal neglecting the issues that really matter to people.

Chucked out of the building. Condemned by colleagues. <br/>You would think you'd want to crawl under the duvet and stay there for a good while after a massive public disgrace. Perhaps not Boris Johnson.  <br/>\"He loves oxygen and he doesn't care about Parliament. Everyone is talking about him and he'll be delighted,\" suggests a former ally who knows him well.  <br/>And his remaining die-hard backers claim the verdict of the privileges committee, which investigated whether he deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties at No 10, is a vindictive strike against a politician loved by party members and much of the public. <br/>Is that true? <br/>When it comes to the public, the polls have suggested for many months that claim is tripe - to use Boris Johnson's terminology for the report into his conduct. <br/>He did have an unusual ability to connect with voters. But he long ago fell out of favour with the public. <br/>And what about inside the Conservative Party, that is again indulging in what seems like its favourite hobby, arguing with itself? <br/>I've been talking to activists and MPs from around the country to test that out. Like in any big organisation there are differing views, but repeatedly, different sources describe three distinct groups.<br/>One experienced party member describes the different tribes as Boris Johnson's \"super fans, never fans, and only fans while he was an asset\". <br/>The reference to the Only Fans website - known for its adult content - may be a mischievous hint that perhaps there was a transactional element all along. <br/>The super fans<br/>This is the group for whom Boris Johnson is a political rock star.<br/>Former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries has made her views plain - warning that Conservatives who endorse the privileges committee's findings could be chucked out of their seats. <br/>Another former cabinet minister told me there was such unhappiness the party might even split over how Mr Johnson has been treated. <br/>A different senior backer told me their colleagues were totally underestimating the anger among members and Mr Johnson's magic ability to win, warning that \"people are making a terrible mistake\" which could undermine democracy. <br/>The never fans<br/>The howls of rage from the super fans are matched by massive sighs of relief from the \"never fans\".<br/>One former president of the Conservative National Convention, the top brass of the voluntary party, told me: \"I am so relieved he is gone - and really gone. Boris was never suited to the top job.\" <br/>One Scottish activist said: \"For goodness sake man, just go. If you really care about our party and our country then go quickly and quietly. You made your bed and you were caught lying in it.\"<br/>Even if members do still have affection for Mr Johnson, this activist argues they \"aren't who we need to appeal to\" to win elections, saying the super fans are \"delusional idiots\". <br/>Only fans<br/>The biggest group by far however is those who were content to back Boris Johnson for as long as he was useful. <br/>This is summed up by one activist who backed him as PM: \"It was a transaction. At the time I absolutely realised and knew what his flaws were. <br/>\"But I took the view that you have to decide what is the bigger issue and it was keeping Corbyn out.\"<br/>Another association chair in south-east England said his members absolutely do not want Mr Johnson back, apart from a few die-hards, telling me: \"It's like when someone has had a really exciting but disastrous boyfriend, afterwards, you have a pang occasionally and you miss the excitement but you don't really want them back.\"<br/>An activist in the Midlands who once backed him said: \"Everyone liked him to start with and were willing to take a punt. He has smashed his credibility and his likeability.\" <br/>One MP, in a constituency with one of the highest Brexit Leave votes, told me: \"Practically nobody has got in contact. He's so popular he appears to have rendered my constituents incapable of using their fingers to tap out an email or pick up a phone - it's been staggering.<br/>\"It's like all those X Factor winners, one of their songs comes on and you think, 'oh yeah people actually used to love that'. Then you think 'but why?'.\"<br/>Not so much the rock star any more. <br/>It is impossible to be scientific about the size of each group, but in each of my conversations it is clear the super fans are very definitely a minority. <br/>One source calculates \"you have gone from 70% being supportive of him to only around 20%\", adding: \"The sensible middle ground of members has definitely gone away.\"<br/>Another party chair says only \"10% of the grassroots are pro - who would actually want him back\". There is a desire to move on, not just from the political melodrama, but also the era that Boris Johnson defined.<br/>As one activist says: \"What we need is Boris Johnson to go away. And most people want Covid and Brexit to go away. He represents both of those.\"<br/>A regular peep at the Telegraph letters page would suggest its readers gave up on him months ago. If Boris Johnson is no longer tickling the tummies of the party's most traditional media backer then the notion he's still the Tory darling just does not hold. <br/>There still is the possibility of a vote on the report into his conduct in the Commons on Monday. <br/>Having promised to uphold integrity and accountability it is tricky for the prime minister to sit it out, but that does seem the most likely outcome. One minister joked: \"He is likely to be many miles away.\"<br/>And it's worth noting that Boris Johnson's camp has backed away from turning the vote into another bout of a fight it has already lost. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>His remaining supporters are not going to vote against the committee's findings, which would have been a way of protesting against what they saw as its vicious judgement. <br/>It seems, realising the support might have looked embarrassingly paltry - maybe \"20 votes on a good day\" as one minister said - they now won't turn up at all. <br/>There is evidence of some campaigning to make the vote count at the margins. Tory website the Conservative Post is encouraging MPs to vote against the report, along with circulating some wild claims that the committee ignored the rule of law. <br/>Separately, the Liberal Democrats have been making hay in local media, demanding their Conservative rivals vote to endorse the verdict that Johnson lied. If they don't, you can imagine they'll use that to try and embarrass their opponents. <br/>But neither Labour nor the Lib Dems are at the moment planning to force a vote to endorse the report. It may therefore go through \"on the nod\", where MPs do not have to vote, sparing Tory blushes. <br/>There is a small irony in MPs not even bothering to vote on the departure of the most prominent politician of his generation. Alternatively, it tells you all you need to know. <br/>But however messy his exit, the end of the Johnson era is prompting questions about what he leaves behind. <br/>Rishi Sunak is yet to sketch out a bold, new canvas. His brand - and it very much is a brand - is designed to create an impression of quiet competence rather than create fireworks. <br/>The risk - or maybe the reality - is that's created a sense of quiet drift. <br/>One of the activists I spoke to said this \"is the beginning of whatever will be the story after the election\" - assuming Rishi Sunak will lose - and \"it is going to be brutal and nasty - you can see the various wings in the party already beginning to manoeuvre themselves\".<br/>One of the other members just wants the Conservatives to concentrate on what the public needs: \"I just feel what people want to talk about on the doors is health and the cost of living.\" <br/>As the pressures of rising mortgage costs in particular become horrifyingly clear, the Conservative Party - already well behind in the polls - can ill-afford another week like this.<br/>It is not clear yet how much trouble Boris Johnson wants to cause. Will he use his new newspaper column to sledge Rishi Sunak at every opportunity? Or actually, as he did yesterday, confine himself to writing about battles with his weight?! <br/>That seems vanishingly unlikely. Whatever he chooses to do there is a sense that the Conservative Party is exhausted by it all. Years of drama. Years of fighting. Years of its majority being spent on arguments with each other. <br/>One of the activists I spoke to warned of a spreading sentiment: \"More than half the grassroots are just disillusioned - too apathetic to campaign, too apathetic to vote, some talking about spoiling ballot papers.\"<br/>Whether super fans, never fans, or only fans, Conservatives have to deal with the legacy of Boris Johnson. <br/>But after all the drama, all the political pain and adrenalin mixed in, they may have to confront the horror of apathy too. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.  <br/>Some, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.<br/>Singling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills. <br/>More than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU. <br/>Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit. <br/>But the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.<br/>Most of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes. <br/>But in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.<br/>So while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.<br/>But here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU. <br/>And official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.<br/>However, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.  <br/>The remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic. <br/>The government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.<br/>But meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros. <br/>Every consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343. <br/>The changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.<br/>Meanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform. <br/>That is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages. <br/>Such employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers. <br/>Then there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum. <br/>Economists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.  <br/>But with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time. <br/>The current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope. <br/>Bread to loo roll: UK prices compared to Europe<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The Speaker of the House of Commons then issues a warrant to the clerk of the crown, who then sends the writ to the returning officer in the constituency.<br/>A by-election would then be triggered in the rural constituency, which includes the small towns of Ampthill, Flitwick, Shefford and Woburn. <br/>Mid Beds has been a Conservative seat since 1931, with Ms Dorries doubling her majority in the four elections she has fought and won since first being elected in 2005.<br/>Campaigning has already started, even though at this point it could be regarded as a phoney war, with some of the big guns from the main three parties already visiting.<br/>The Conservatives have sent Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden to Flitwick, and party co-chairman Greg Hands was in Mid Beds the day after her announcement.<br/>Despite the lack of formal resignation from the sitting MP, the party has named its new candidate as Festus Akinbusoye, who has been the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner since his election in 2021.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Inflation isn't just stubborn, or sticky. It is, on the latest numbers, stuck. These figures should be falling by now, and they are in other countries such as the US and Germany.  <br/>My inbox was deluged with instant takes at 7am ranging from \"unfortunate\" to \"challenging\" to \"disaster\".<br/>Over the past 18 months the Governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC workers should not ask for excessive pay rises and companies should not hike prices too much either. <br/>Core inflation, a measure of underlying and ongoing inflationary pressure that strips out month to month volatility, is, however, going up, even as it is in decline elsewhere in other major economies. The polite requests have not worked.<br/>The response of Karen Ward, a respected City economist who serves on the chancellor's council of advisers that the Bank of England \"has to create a recession\" partly to \"nip in the bud\" a spiral of wages going up and in turn pushing up prices, and then pushing up wages again.<br/>\"It's only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think 'Well, maybe I won't put through that price rise', or workers, when they're a little bit less confident about their job, think 'Oh, I won't push my boss for that higher pay,'\" she told the BBC's Today programme.<br/>She said out loud what the Treasury cannot say out loud but has implied in repeated interviews - people have to feel the pain for interest rate rises to work. The Chancellor again said he would support the Bank of England in its decisions - making clear his support for further rate rises. But any hope of a controlled economic descent with plenty of distance ahead of an election late next year, now looks fraught.<br/>But it is not just about the specific decision on Thursday, but about the path of interest rates for the next two years. The markets are pretty openly questioning whether the Bank is in full command over where inflation is going. Financial markets and banks are effectively pushing up fixed term mortgage rates, without waiting for actual Bank of England decisions.<br/>But the unflattering international comparison also shows a limit to how much the government can blame everything on \"global factors\". Continental Europe was particularly hit by surging energy prices in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, the rest of the world by food prices, and the US by a worker shortages. The UK still suffers from a cocktail of all three.<br/>And the government's own post Brexit policies on trade and workers may have lessened competitive pressures that would in the past have brought inflation down more rapidly.<br/>Wednesday's number shows that the already tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.

However, food inflation in Germany, Sweden and Portugal has fallen significantly since March - while the figure for the UK has remained stubbornly high.<br/>In fact, the UK's food inflation in April was higher than the European Union average of 16.4% and higher than all the major European economies.<br/>It was exceeded by Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Hungary.<br/>BBC Verify asked Mr Stride's department which figures he was referring to. We we were told he was talking about the first three months of 2023, when UK food price inflation was 18% and Sweden, Germany and Portugal were all over 20%.<br/>The reason UK food inflation is so high has been the focus of a recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. The ONS is responsible for calculating the UK's inflation figures.<br/>It identified three main reasons behind the price rises:<br/>The good news is that global wholesale food prices (that's the amount producers charge for their produce) have been falling. However, it generally takes time for that to feed through to supermarket prices, so customers have to wait before their bills stop rising.<br/>The ONS says one reason the UK's prices have been rising faster for longer could be down to a reliance on food imports. This suggests European countries that grow more of their own food have seen smaller food prices increases.<br/>The next set of UK inflation figures - covering the year to May - will be published on Wednesday.<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He had just been elected mayor of London, a job that would launch him on the path to Downing Street.<br/>Now he is heading for the exit with all guns blazing, with a scathing attack on the MPs who sought to punish him for misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking.<br/>His reaction to the Privileges Committee report is vintage Johnson - colourful, amusing in parts - the references to \"Mystic Meg\" and nudist colonies - but with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness and anger. <br/>Whether it turns out to be the final raging testament of a man destined for the political wilderness remains to be seen.<br/>He has bounced back from many, mainly self-inflicted, disasters before.<br/>And he is clearly in no mood to settle for comfortable semi-retirement. <br/>He has already earned more than \u00a35m for giving speeches around the world since he quit as prime minister.<br/>He is also about to become a father again, at 58, with wife Carrie expecting their third child. The family have just moved into a \u00a33.8m Grade II listed manor house in Oxfordshire, complete with its own moat.<br/>There are books to write - his memoir of his time in Downing Street is well under way apparently, and talk of business opportunities.<br/>But this may be thin gruel for someone with Boris Johnson's outsize personality.<br/>From his earliest childhood days, when he famously declared he wanted to be \"world king\", Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has had his eyes on life's big prizes.<br/>He came into the world in 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in New York, where his father, Stanley, was studying economics. <br/>One of four children, he spent his early years on the family farm in Somerset, before moving to north London and then Brussels, where Stanley was working for the European Commission.<br/>The Johnson siblings were close and highly competitive with one another. Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs.<br/>He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates.<br/>In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: \"Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. <br/>\"I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\"<br/>Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: \"Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,\" <br/>At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron.<br/>After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. <br/>It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings.<br/>As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. <br/>In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.<br/>Things did not go smoothly.<br/>He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard.<br/>He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. <br/>An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city.<br/>He survived \"Operation Scouse Grovel\", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.<br/>Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered.<br/>He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way.<br/>He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre.<br/>In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021.<br/>It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. <br/>Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician.<br/>His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party.<br/>His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. <br/>In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.<br/>Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a \"career psychopath\".<br/>When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. <br/>However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. <br/>Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.<br/>He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into \"the status of a colony\". <br/>When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job.<br/>He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May.<br/>In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.<br/>After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to \"Get Brexit Done\", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide.<br/>The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall.<br/>His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. <br/>It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted \"it could have gone either way\".<br/>As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic.<br/>He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world.<br/>But his political problems were mounting up.<br/>In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street.<br/>Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. <br/>Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.<br/>Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.<br/>Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.<br/>The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. <br/>He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.<br/>The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.<br/>A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to \"get on with the job\" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.<br/>He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership.<br/>He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. <br/>But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party.<br/>He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards.<br/>But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict.<br/>Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills.<br/>But the road back looks like a long and steep one.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now he's so angry.\"<br/>Angry he certainly has been in recent days. <br/>\"Rubbish\", a \"lie\", \"deranged\", \"absurd\" and \"complete tripe\" are just some of the words he has used to describe the report Westminster has been poring over.<br/>There are pockets of support for Boris Johnson on the Conservative benches, but they have rapidly shrivelled.<br/>\"I do think people who think Boris is immortal are either paranoid or bananas,\" another former minister tells me.<br/>In fact, the best way to ensure the anonymity of a Tory MP when describing what they have said in a private conversation is to say they are a \"former Johnson supporter\" - there are a lot of them.<br/>Here is one who texted me earlier: \"Johnson's followers and goodwill will diminish the more he and his acolytes damage the Party's electoral prospects. <br/>\"The Party is greater than any of its leaders. Leaders are leaseholders not freeholders. Johnson is not the victim here - it will be the British people if Keir Starmer enters Downing Street next year.\"<br/>It is a plea to the party to get over the era of Boris Johnson and unite around Rishi Sunak.<br/>But the reason so many Conservative MPs will only speak so candidly in private is that the business of getting over the era of Mr Johnson is not easy.<br/>One Tory MP acknowledged to me that a big chunk of their electorate voted for them because of Boris Johnson, that he was the \"Heineken Tory\"  - he could reach voters other Conservatives couldn't. <br/>And does Rishi Sunak hold the same appeal to them, I asked. <br/>\"No,\" came the reply.<br/>And there are plenty of Conservative Party members who have a loyalty and ongoing affection for Mr Johnson too - although how dented that might be by this week's report and his reaction to it will be interesting to observe.<br/>In short, the returns are rapidly diminishing for Mr Johnson's most vociferous parliamentary supporters.<br/>He's not coming back, at least in the short term. And he's not instantly easy to defend, either.<br/>Make no mistake, there are those who sympathise with him, including those who have not said so publicly. <br/>\"It is posturing parliament at its worst,\" one told me, having read the Privileges Committee report.<br/>But Boris Johnson has gone, from parliament at least, for now.<br/>Monday's debate and vote on the Privileges Committee report had looked like it might be a damp squib already, shorn as it was of the jeopardy shaping Mr Johnson's future, given he's already left.<br/>Conservative MPs had been told they would have a free vote, but on what is called a one line whip. <br/>In other words, it wouldn't matter if they didn't turn up. <br/>So plenty could avoid awkward conversations with their local associations and voters having voted this way or that, by finding something better to do.<br/>And now the Conservative MP James Duddridge, a former parliamentary aide to Mr Johnson, has told BBC News: \"I've spoken to Boris, he doesn't want there to be a vote. Everyone needs to calm down.\"<br/>Others close to Mr Johnson echo this instinct.<br/>Why would they be saying this? It is a vote he would lose, and badly, and it might expose just how shrivelled that parliamentary loyalty to him now is.<br/>But is this the end for Boris Johnson?<br/>I am reminded of the late Tony Benn's remark, when he said he was leaving the Commons \"to devote more time to politics\".<br/>Mr Johnson was never going to be short of offers of pulpits from which to project - and he's found one already: a column in the Daily Mail and Mail Online.<br/>His real power and influence now will be his capacity to attract attention and disrupt.<br/>And whatever your judgement about his other strengths and weaknesses, they are both things most would agree he is rather good at.<br/>It's a column Downing Street could rather do without.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Like all prime ministerial trips abroad, it wasn't exactly typical.<br/>Here are four things that make travelling with the prime minister a unique experience.<br/>For years the debate raged. Was it legitimate for the prime minister to have a plane they could call their own?<br/>The issue made headlines during Tony Blair's premiership - when, inevitably, the prospect of such a thing was called Blair Force One. In 2006, a plan was announced. But in 2008, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, it was scrapped.<br/>Is a private jet ostentatious? Does it help with the practicalities of being a frequently flying leader? Does it project an image of the UK abroad that you wouldn't get turning up on a chartered plane? <br/>For now at least, the debate is over: the prime minister does have access to his own plane. And I type these words sitting on it, somewhere over the Atlantic.<br/>It is an Airbus A321, with a union flag on the tail fin, and \"United Kingdom\" written down the side. <br/>When you fly on this thing, it is rather different from rolling up at the airport to go on holiday. We leave from a private terminal, we often don't get a boarding pass and usually we take all of our baggage on with us - for a reason I'll get to shortly.<br/>But meanwhile\u2026<br/>You might imagine, in a private jet, the entertainment system would be something else. <br/>There is WiFi, so the prime minister and his team can stay connected and work efficiently, which is something they value. And it helps us reporters too.<br/>On the plane, there are none of those little screens you get in the back of the seat in front of you on some flights, packed with films and playlists and maps showing precisely where you are over the ocean. Instead, we often have what is called a \"huddle\".<br/>A huddle involves the prime minister coming to the back of the plane, where reporters crowd around him, and each ask him a question.<br/>This is how it works: all the reporters get together beforehand, in the airport, to work out what we are going to ask, in what order, to ensure we cover a range of topics. <br/>The conversation is \"on the record\" - to use the jargon - meaning we can quote the words and attribute them to the prime minister. But the huddle is not recorded for television or radio. <br/>A round of on-camera interviews with the prime minister tends to happen later in the trip. Each broadcaster is assigned a strictly agreed amount of time - often seven minutes - to attempt to find things out, hold the government to account and test its arguments. <br/>Interviewing any prime minister is a huge privilege and responsibility: working on your behalf, trying to ask the questions you want asking. I will always ask the brilliant producer I am working with to stand just out of shot counting down the minutes I have left on their fingers. <br/>Journalistically, there is a tension on these trips: we are close to the prime minister and his team throughout. This is useful, in understanding what they are doing and what motivates their decisions. But instinctively reporters want to be detached, independent and disinterested, and being in what can feel like a bubble feels odd in that context.<br/>Oh, and if we are going somewhere on a long-haul flight - for example Indonesia, Japan or the west coast of America, as we've have recently - we end up having to stop to refuel. <br/>And so those trips involved landing in Dubai, Muscat, Almaty and Washington, hanging around for an hour or so, and then taking off again. <br/>There aren't huge queues to check in. Or any queues at all. <br/>There are comfy settees to sit on, there is loads of natural light and a free coffee machine. To say it feels different from when you head off on a family holiday with the kids is to put it gently. Mind you, I don't take laptops, a tripod, and no end of other broadcasting kit with me on holiday either. <br/>Recently, we flew back into Luton Airport in the middle of the night and pulled up at a private terminal. Past the entrance to what was described as the \"VVIP lounge\" (I couldn't see in, I'm afraid) was a glass cabinet proffering stuff from Harrods, including a collection of pink teddies complete with \"recycled polyester filling\". <br/>A large rectangular steel clock hung on the wall. \"We commissioned this clock from Beaumont flying art,\" read the inscription. Also on the wall, a colossal screen, pitching the merits of executive private jets, the kind that only carry a handful of passengers. \"15 hours of peaceful luxury!\" is how they describe the flight on offer.<br/>When the prime minister's plane lands abroad, a diplomatic ritual begins. As the plane pulls up, a smiling delegation greets us. <br/>One of the first people off the plane is the camera journalist assigned to film the prime minister's arrival on behalf of all the broadcasters. There might be a red carpet. There are almost always flags.<br/>The UK ambassador to wherever we are will be there at the bottom of the plane steps. Maybe even some sort of performance will be offered by the hosts - at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport last autumn, it was a troupe of traditional dancers.<br/>And while the prime minister is getting off via the front set of steps, the rest of us are piling off at the back and getting into a seemingly never-ending line of minibuses waiting on the tarmac.<br/>There's no time to wait for a bag in the hold. That's why we take them onto the plane with us.<br/>In next to no time, the motorcade is moving - and moving fast. Police outriders swarm all around us, and junctions are closed, so we can race through.<br/>On the motorway, the fast lane is (temporarily) closed so we can zip by. Passers by can be lining the streets, sometimes, to grab pictures. <br/>On a recent trip to Japan, the press minibus wasn't the nippiest, its engine squealing to keep up with the slick Mercedes of the prime minister a dozen or so vehicles ahead.<br/>What Sunak\u2019s Atlantic Declaration is \u2013 and isn\u2019t<br/>Sunak and Biden announce green funding agreement<br/>Sunak to raise trade issues in US talks with Biden<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

That committee is made up mainly of Tory MPs. The former PM has faced the same procedure as other MPs that get into trouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he has been \"forced out\", remember he has chosen to quit before we even see the black and white of their verdict. <br/>It is also a fact there are some Conservatives who begrudge him his success. It is also true that during his last few months in No 10 there were internal enemies trying to force him out. <br/>But to dress that up as a grand conspiracy is, candidly, a stretch. One of those who knows him best told me his resignation announcement was \"1,000 words that tell you everything about Johnson's mindset - it's your fault not mine\".<br/>Rather than confront what has happened or try to defend himself from the judgement that is coming, Boris Johnson made a political choice this week not to stay and fight. <br/>As ever, the line between farce and tragedy is skinny. While most of the headlines screamed of the shock, the former prime minister's exit from Parliament is entirely on brand. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Boris Johnson's political career... in 72 seconds<br/>The timing on a Friday was unexpected, but no surprise. He never much liked Parliament anyway, even though he managed to find a gong for the Commons' hairdresser. <br/>The idea he would savour being a humble backbencher asking questions about cash for the local hospital or appearing at school fetes was for the birds. And if the Privileges Committee's findings are as savage as expected he would have faced a by-election. <br/>Clues from his track record tell us there is little chance he would have fought if he hadn't been sure he could win. He pulled out of the Tory leadership race in 2016 when Michael Gove's move blew up his status as front-runner. <br/>He didn't run in 2022 despite a dash back from the Caribbean and fevered claims that he had enough support. One former cabinet ally says he is \"more calculating than people think and this will have been a calculation -  if he thought he would win the by-election he would stay\". To win and lose does not match brand Boris. To leave like this absolutely does.<br/>The power of his personality - frankly his fame - means he leaves behind some devastated colleagues and a strand of the public who believe he has been hard done by. <br/>One former cabinet minister says: \"The party wounded itself when it defenestrated Boris and continues to bleed.\"<br/>Some of his hard-core supporters left on the backbenches say his exit is a sad day for democracy and - with some justification believe his leadership is what secured their seats, particularly in parts of the country where the Tories could never have dreamt of doing well before. <br/>Some of his loyal backers do feel like he is the great hero in a tragedy, cast aside unfairly in an epic drama, undone by those who envy his talents. <br/>His exit is arguably a tragedy for those who genuinely believed in and adored him. And there is a political tragedy for the Conservative Party, which many MPs privately believe squandered a once in a generation majority. <br/>2019 gave it one of those rare chances to make radical changes to the country, and while many believe it was thrown away by mismanagement and mistakes, there was of course the unexpected horror of the Covid pandemic too. <br/>For those who deplore Boris Johnson, there is a different kind of tragedy, the damage they believe he did to the UK's reputation. And several of those who have been close to him over the years identify a fourth element of the mess - the fact they believe it was never going to end well. <br/>In the Greek tragedies so beloved of Mr Johnson himself, fate, and inevitability plays an important role. One of them says: \"Boris is a genuine tragedy. This was all inevitable. We knew how it would play out, but we are still surprised and shocked about how dreadful it is. All our hard work pissed away.\" <br/>So what happens next? Some MPs are actually cock-a-hoop despite the colossal mess. One tells me: \"The man-baby has gone - so pleased!\"<br/>But allies talk up his chances of running for another seat some time. One former senior minister tells me \"the question is does he plan to get another seat or even Mid-Beds?\" - the constituency his close ally and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has just left. <br/>Another former cabinet minister says: \"It would be very unwise for him to run again. He has a vociferous 20% in the party who like him but 80% don't. If he ran in a by-election the Lib Dems would murder him.\"<br/>Would party HQ even let that happen? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has changed the personnel in charge there. One senior figure pours a bucket of freezing water over the idea telling me: \"Boris died today.\"<br/>What is not clear yet is whether as that MP suggests the manner of his departure could \"generate so much unrest I fear there will be an election much sooner than thought\".<br/>Mr Johnson has thrown grenades at No 10 - not just the committee that has judged him - suggesting Mr Sunak is not running a \"proper Conservative\" government. <br/>One former ally says the ex-PM has \"gone full circle, returning to his political home - a hut across the water where he can now lob rocks without any sense of responsibility or accountability - and that is ultimately very dangerous for his party and Sunak\". <br/>But if Boris Johnson is unlikely to run for Parliament again, and is happy to dangle the prospect of a return, what else might he do with his time?<br/>You'll find plenty of people in Westminster chattering that he'll return to his first love - writing - but might there be something bigger? <br/>By chance his old newspaper the Telegraph has just come up for sale and - by chance - its former editor Will Lewis has just been made a knight by Mr Johnson. Is there, by chance, the possibility they might be part of a bid to take it over? <br/>It's been suggested to me that is in fact something that has been discussed. It's no secret that Mr Lewis - now Sir Will - would be keen to take it on. <br/>He advised Mr Johnson in No 10 sometimes and the two men worked together at the Telegraph when the former PM was its star columnist who attracted extra subscribers each week. <br/>Going back as a columnist would be one thing for Mr Johnson and not all that surprising. But for him to take a bigger role - as one source whispers, the editor - might be the Conservatives' worst nightmare. <br/>I'm told that conversations are only at the stage of ideas being scribbled down on paper. A formal sale process, let alone any decisions about actual bids, is a long way off.  <br/>But I can't help wondering, what would the consequences be for Downing Street and the Conservatives if their most loyal backer in the press gave a major role to Mr Sunak's bitter rival? Could the next twist in the Boris Johnson story be even wilder than the last? Perhaps. <br/>Some of those who have worked alongside him believe it is more likely to be \"terminal Boris\". A former ally says \"he was obviously once someone with exceptional skills, who came so far, and did so much in the face of incredible opposition\".<br/>But they say, perhaps in sorrow and in anger: \"His career ends with him alone, a victim of his utter inability to tell the truth to anyone, including himself.\"<br/>Maybe he will fade into obscurity. Perhaps he'll be back in Parliament one day. He might make millions speaking and writing or become Rishi Sunak's most powerful opposition. <br/>But his name is now on the list of those unprovable political \"what ifs' so furiously and perpetually debated by political nerds. <br/>What if Mrs Thatcher hadn't been forced out? What if Tony Blair hadn't invaded Iraq? What if Boris Johnson had given a different answer in the Commons when he was first asked what happened under his roof during the Covid lockdowns? <br/>We will never know. But what we do know this weekend is that one era is over. We know Boris Johnson had huge potential to create, but also to destroy - his extraordinary majority, his reputation, and the party he led too. <br/>He must now decide what to do with the power that he still retains. And his old party must decide how much attention it wants to pay. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Councils are required by law to balance their budgets and provide \"best value\" to their constituents. <br/>Woking is the latest council to be put under intervention, with minister Lee Rowley appointing commissioners last week because of the authority's \u00a31.9bn in debt.<br/>Local elections are always in part seen as a test of the public mood nationally - and the message from May's polls is that voters are turning away from the Conservatives.<br/>But it is not always easy to say how much impact local issues have on the way people vote.<br/>\"Generally, people aren't voting on specific local issues\" says Prof Paula Surridge of Bristol University, who researches voting behaviour, \"but when things are particularly bad, that really raises the profile\".<br/>She says voters often don't know much about councils, but \"when your council has been labelled as failing, even if you don't know exactly what they do, you're going to know they're not doing it right\".<br/>Local elections also often see lower turnout levels than national polls. But are voters aware enough to take action when their council's been labelled as failing?<br/>Slough saw a dramatic shift. The sitting Labour administration lost 18 seats, with 16 of them going to the Tories and a few to the Liberal Democrats.<br/>What's so notable about Slough is it heavily defied the national trend. Instead votes flew in the opposite direction, leading to a Labour collapse. <br/>\"Slough is clear, simple and straightforward - an 18 point swing from Labour to Tory. It's so out of line [with the national picture],\" says Prof Sir John Curtice, polling expert at the University of Strathclyde.<br/>Dexter Smith, leader of Slough Conservatives, who now run the town in partnership with the Lib Dems, says the council's failings \"definitely\" had an impact on the results.<br/>He said voters would talk about the council's bankruptcy on the doorstep, but also \"lots of missed bin collections, rather poor performance in a variety of services\".<br/>Max Caller, the former commissioner sent in by the government to Slough, agrees that \"people had an understanding of how bad things were\", with the local press covering the problems extensively.<br/>Slough issued its section 114 notice in July 2021, but Mr Smith claims it didn't have much of an impact on the results in the election most recently after that - May 2022 - because voters hadn't felt the effects of the bankruptcy yet. <br/>But since then, the council selling off \u00a3200m of assets, a new fee for garden waste collection - and the killer, a nearly 10% council tax rise, has made voters take notice, he says.<br/>Because of the dire state of the authority's finances, Slough was given permission by the government to implement the council tax rise without a local referendum. <br/>Most of England had their council tax increased by nearly 5%. Slough Labour planned to raise council tax by nearly 10% again next year.<br/>The Conservatives committed not to doing this, says Mr Smith, and treated the election \"more like a referendum\" on the rise. <br/>Slough Labour did not respond to attempts to contact them for this article.<br/>Mr Smith blames Slough's problems on the \"tax and spend approach by Labour\". But it's not only Labour councils that get into trouble.<br/>Thurrock Council saw the incumbent Conservative administration lose two seats to Labour, who also gained three from independents. It left the Tories with a majority of one. Labour's vote share was up significantly compared to the last time these seats were elected.<br/>Thurrock Council has debts of more than \u00a31bn.<br/>Labour group leader John Kent says \"there's a growing awareness [of the council's problems], it kind of comes in waves\". <br/>These waves peaked when the government intervened and when the council went bankrupt, he says. <br/>\"In my ward we knocked on doors, and people I know are Tories said we're voting for you because of what they've done, they've bankrupted the council,\" he says.<br/>The most recent wave was the council tax increase. <br/>Like Slough, Thurrock put its council tax up by nearly 10%. And again like in Slough, Mr Kent identifies this rise, coupled with the failure to deliver local services, as the reason voters took action.<br/>\"It was the inability of the council to empty the bins \u2026 people in their own minds ally that with the council tax.\"<br/>Thurrock Conservatives declined to be interviewed for this article.<br/>The Essex authority is a less clear-cut case on whether voters punished a failing council, as it still followed the national trend of Conservatives losing seats, although Prof Curtice says it \"probably\" had an impact. <br/>\"The vote figures were down so sharply this could reasonably be that the Tories were being punished. They escaped retribution in terms of seats because of a bad baseline\".<br/>The last time these seats were contested - the baseline Prof Curtice is talking about - was 2019, when the Conservatives were hit by infighting over Theresa May's Brexit deal.<br/>The impact was also \"masked\", Prof Curtice adds, by the fact that Thurrock is among those English councils that only elect a third of their seats three out of every four years, instead of all their seats every four years. <br/>By contrast, Slough moved to all-out elections this year for the first time.<br/>If Thurrock had elected all its councillors in May, both Prof Curtice and Mr Kent agree that Labour would have unseated the Tories as the largest party on the council.<br/>Sandwell and Liverpool councils both saw the incumbent parties lose support, but on a smaller scale.<br/>Prof Curtice does not think voters punished Labour in Sandwell, but says it's more difficult to tell in Liverpool. Labour lost nine seats in the city, but their vote share held up.<br/>Liverpool continues to be dominated by Labour, although the party's share dropped in 2021, the first elections after corruption allegations emerged around former mayor Joe Anderson. He denies any wrongdoing.<br/>Croydon, in south London, is another council with huge debts that has had commissioners sent in during recent years. Last year, voters elected a Conservative mayor - even though the council itself is Labour.<br/>Commissioners have reported good progress at Sandwell and are \"optimistic\" about Liverpool - both areas where the incumbent party's vote has held up.<br/>Progress at Slough on the other hand has \"been very slow\", according to the commissioners, while Thurrock had another commissioner appointed in March after the government said it was \"continuing to fail in its best value duty\".<br/>So perhaps we can conclude that voters do pay attention to local issues - and are prepared to punish failed administrations at the ballot box.<br/>The people paying the price for a bankrupt council<br/>Commissioners will oversee troubled council<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Let me explain. <br/>The inquiry's chair Baroness Hallett is demanding unredacted WhatsApp messages and notebooks from Boris Johnson.<br/>They cover the period of the pandemic when he was prime minister and making key decisions.<br/>She is adamant that it is her job to decide what is and isn't relevant to her inquiry.<br/>The government disagrees - and speaking to people close to the process, I don't think they're going to back down. <br/>They argue that they need to protect the privacy of ministers and others. They say they will not send information that is \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry.<br/>Insiders have told the BBC they will send relevant messages - for example, WhatsApp conversations that led to a policy decision. They would not send messages involving personal conversations. <br/>But they think that decision is for the government - and its lawyers - to make.<br/>So who is going to win?<br/>The more likely answer seems to be the Covid inquiry.<br/>It has legal powers to compel people to produce documents. It also had a pretty broad remit under the terms established by the government. <br/>And some senior Conservatives are now urging the Cabinet Office to back down. <br/>William Wragg is the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee.

We aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years, starting with the USA.\" <br/>In truth the likelihood of such a full fat agreement, on that timeframe in particular, was probably pretty small, and it's been very small for as long as President Joe Biden has been in the White House - a reality acknowledged by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss as well as Rishi Sunak. <br/>And three years on from 2019 was 2022, last year - and there is no such deal.<br/>This is why I asked the prime minister and the president about it: given they are unveiling something of an alternative - the Atlantic Declaration - it is important to scrutinise and highlight the gap between what was in the prospectus for government that gives Mr Sunak his mandate to govern, and what he is now talking up.<br/>Not least because trade deals have been done with others, possible once the UK was outside the European Union.<br/>From Mr Sunak's perspective, the politics of this is straightforward: attempting a free trade agreement, even if President Biden wanted to deliver one and could deliver one, would take longer than either man has between now and facing their electorates in the next 18 months.<br/>So better to work up an arrangement now, even if chunks of it require further negotiation before they happen. <br/>Downing Street argues, in explaining why there has been no such deal with the US, that the world has changed since 2019. And it has. <br/>It is worth exploring how it has changed, how that is remoulding international relations and the consequences for the UK.<br/>Covid, the threat posed by China, and the war in Ukraine have been catalysts for a collective fretting from many of the relatively rich democracies over economic security.<br/>Translated: how to get hold of components or energy without relying on now hostile states. <br/>This Declaration, at least partially, attempts to address this. <br/>There is concern about military security too, which prompted the  AUKUS pact between the UK, the US and Australia.<br/>But the economic elephant in the diplomatic corridors is America's Inflation Reduction Act - a massive stimulus to address economic security and base green industries of the future in previously left behind American areas. <br/>It is so big it has turned heads in boardrooms globally. <br/>The Biden Administration's motivation is this: the economy needs to adapt given climate change, China and Russia - so let's make America less dependent on others and ensure those jobs of the future are in America.<br/>Labour say they'd do something similar. The Conservatives won't - but No10 point to elements in this deal that mitigate against some of its downsides to British businesses.<br/>Downing Street are upbeat about how the last few days have panned out. <br/>Rishi Sunak and his delegation stayed at Blair House, the President's official guesthouse. <br/>Talk to those who have been there and it's a reminder the accommodation on these trips is part of the diplomacy.<br/>The political history at every turn.

It is about promises, people and places.<br/>Who and how many should the country welcome, from where and for how long?<br/>I have been talking to people in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk about it.<br/>The east of England is highly dependent on immigration - and Great Yarmouth overwhelmingly backed Brexit too.<br/>The promises of three successive Conservative prime ministers were washed away by reality.<br/>\"Net migration will be in the order of tens of thousands each year, no ifs, no buts,\" claimed David Cameron.<br/>There were lots of ifs and even more buts - he never got close.<br/>\"We believe sustainable numbers are the tens of thousands,\" repeated Theresa May.

No ifs. No buts.\"<br/>It's a promise that came back to haunt the Conservatives - as the target receded further and further into the distance.<br/>As Thursday's Office for National Statistics data show, net migration is nowhere near that figure. In fact, migration added 606,000 to the UK's population in 2022, the highest number on record and sharply up on recent levels.<br/>There are a range of factors behind that rise, as we report here, and a lively debate over the benefits and disadvantages of immigration.<br/>But for some years now, the focus has not been on immigration per se, but on \"net migration\" - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.<br/>It was David Cameron, who when he became prime minister in 2010, introduced the concept to the wider public. <br/>\"Net migration was not really a metric that people thought about or used in the run up to 2010,\" says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory.<br/>\"It created the idea that management of migration was a technocratic process. The reality is, it's much more complicated than that.\"<br/>Mr Cameron was keen to curb immigration but, he argued, what voters really cared about was not the numbers coming from overseas but the overall growth in the size of the UK's population. <br/>In a 2007 speech, he stressed the \"positive impact on our economy\" of immigration but added that it was \"time for change\".<br/>\"We need policy to reduce the level of net immigration,\" he declared.<br/>Unfortunately for Mr Cameron, his chosen measure was already on an upward trajectory.<br/>And there were question marks about how much control any government could exert over the number of people emigrating from the UK - a key component of net migration.<br/>There was a time when that number was very high, as Britons left for pastures new. As a result, UK net migration was routinely below zero before the 1990s. <br/>But since 1994, immigration to the UK has exceeded emigration every year to date.<br/>The figures show that immigration started to rise more sharply under Tony Blair's New Labour government.<br/>Net migration rose above 200,000 for the first time in 2004, after Mr Blair's government opened up the UK to workers from new EU member states in eastern Europe.<br/>\"Suddenly from being a steady trickle, immigration turned into a flood,\" said Damian Green, the former immigration minister and Conservative MP. \"It became a huge political issue.\"<br/>Analysis by the Migration Observatory in 2011, found government policies were not on track to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.<br/>And yet Mr Green - who was the immigration minister at the time - continued to insist the government was on course to meet its target.<br/>\"It was doable,\" said Mr Green.<br/>\"I remember once seeing a projection in the Home Office that showed if everything stayed the same, by the 2015 election, we'd have net migration down to 116,000. It wasn't completely unrealistic.\"<br/>The promise of net migration in the tens of thousands appeared again in the Conservative Party's 2015 manifesto.<br/>Alongside that manifesto promise was one of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. With the Eurosceptic party UKIP rising in the polls, Mr Cameron was looking exposed on immigration.<br/>A migrant crisis, partly triggered by conflicts in the Middle East, was deepening in Europe, while UKIP was gaining political momentum and a bigger audience for its opposition to \"mass immigration\" ahead of the 2015 general election.<br/>Having won a majority at that election, Mr Cameron announced the Brexit referendum in 2016 and struck a deal to redraw the terms of the UK's EU membership.<br/>Concessions on immigration, including restrictions on benefits to EU migrants, formed the backbone of Mr Cameron's deal, but it wasn't enough to convince enough voters to back Remain.<br/>Instead, the Leave campaign - with its contentious warnings of an influx of migrants from the EU - proved more compelling to the 52% who voted for Brexit.<br/>Richard Tice, a prominent Eurosceptic and leader of Reform UK, said the Conservative MPs who backed Brexit promised they would take control of migration following the referendum.<br/>\"And we believed their promises,\" Mr Tice said. \"The data has shown that actually, they've abandoned those promises.<br/>\"We're brought up to trust what politicians say. But when they continually fail to do it, that trust evaporates.\"<br/>The promise remained unkept under former prime minister Theresa May, who held the line of \"net migration down to the tens of thousands\" in the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto.<br/>Only in its 2019 manifesto, when Boris Johnson succeeded her as Tory leader, did the party ditch the under-100,000 pledge.<br/>Instead, the Conservatives - rather more vaguely - said \"the overall numbers will come down\" and \"we will ensure that the British people are always in control\".<br/>Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister was so short - just 49 days - and she didn't have a chance to set out her stall on migration.<br/>Migration has slipped down the political agenda, with YouGov polling showing immigration and asylum ranking behind the economy and housing as the most important issues facing the country.<br/>So far, the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has mostly focused on curbing illegal immigration and stopping small boats crossing the English Channel.<br/>Unlike his predecessors, Mr Sunak has so far shied away from putting a figure on what net migration should be, only calling the current level \"too high\".<br/>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has similarly refused to set a target for net migration.<br/>\"I'm not putting a specific number on it,\" he said this week. \"The only thing we know about those targets is that they're routinely missed.\"<br/>As Mr Cameron found out the hard way, making commitments on something as difficult to control as the movement of people can create hostages to fortune, and leave promises unfulfilled.<br/>Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migration<br/>Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He has advised that on this occasion further investigation is not necessary and I have accepted that advice. On the basis of your letter and our discussion, my decision is that these matters do not amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code.<br/>As you have recognised, a better course of action could have been taken to avoid giving rise to the perception of impropriety.<br/>Nevertheless, I am reassured you take these matters seriously. You have provided a thorough account, apologised and expressed regret.<br/>It is vital that all those in Government maintain the high standards the public rightly expects. I know you share this view, just as we are committed to delivering on the issues that matter to the British people - from making our streets safer and reducing net migration to stopping the boats.<br/>Yours ever<br/>Rishi Sunak<br/>Dear Prime Minister,<br/>I am writing to provide further information in relation to my receipt and handling of a speeding ticket, which has been the subject of recent media interest.<br/>Around June 2022, while Attorney General, I was found to be speeding. I received notification that I could take a group speed awareness course or receive a fine and three points on my licence, which was clean at the time. I opted to take the course and booked a date in Autumn.<br/>After arriving at the Home Office in September as Home Secretary, I informed officials in my Home Office Private Office (PO) about the course and asked whether it was appropriate given my new role. <br/>This reflected my lack of familiarity with protocol relating to my newly acquired official status as a 'protected person', which means I am required to have a close protection security team overseeing my movements, and with me always in public. <br/>This involves close protection having knowledge of and involvement in many areas of what would otherwise be considered my 'private life', not related to my work as a Minister or Member of Parliament.<br/>In discussions with my Principal Private Secretary (PPS) I was advised that the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET) would be the best source of advice on whether it was appropriate to seek to do the course in a way that protected my privacy, security, and was least disruptive to the course participants and provider. <br/>I readily agreed to this suggestion. Consequently, on 28 September 2022 my PPS discussed this with the Permanent Secretary's Office. <br/>The Permanent Secretary's Office, at the request of the Permanent Secretary, then asked PET for guidance (noting that their own initial view was that this was not a matter for civil servant involvement) and asked if they were aware of any precedents and for any advice. <br/>PET advised it was not an appropriate matter for civil servants to take forward. <br/>My PPS also rightly pointed out that I needed to be mindful to ensure that I did not ask a company to change their rules due to my position, which neither I, nor to the best of my knowledge anyone acting on my behalf, ever sought to do. <br/>My PPS confirmed that I could continue discussing the matter with Special Advisers, and asked them to pick up with me. I made no further requests of officials.<br/>I therefore later engaged with Special Advisers about how we would enable my participation in a way that would maintain my security and privacy. <br/>This was to determine whether there were other options possible within the overall framework and rules of the provider.<br/>My preference at this point, following consultation with my Special Advisers, was to attend a group course in person rather than online due to privacy concerns. <br/>Participation in a speed awareness course is supposed to be private, and Special Advisers raised concerns about the risk of me being covertly recorded while participating online, and the political ramifications of this. PO and the Permanent Secretary's officials also had previously advised that participating online risked generating media interest.<br/>However, Special Advisers raised concerns about the difficulties of ensuring the appropriate security arrangements for an in-person course. <br/>Their concerns included that my protective Security team might need to join me in the room or be unable to undertake appropriate vetting of other course participants owing to third party privacy concerns.<br/>Special Advisers then contacted the course provider to better understand the range of appropriate options that might be available - and consistent with the course provider's rules, policies and practices. <br/>Based on this further information, I concluded that none of these could satisfactorily address the aforementioned security, privacy and political concerns. I therefore opted to take the points and pay the fine, which I did in November.<br/>I accept that I was speeding and regret doing so. At no point did I try to avoid sanction. My actions were always directed toward finding an appropriate way to participate in the speed awareness course, taking into account my new role as Home Secretary and the necessary security and privacy issues that this raised. <br/>My interactions with officials intended to provide appropriate clarification of the options available to me in my role as Home Secretary. Whenever I was informed that a possible option was not available, I accepted that. At no point did I instruct officials to behave contrary to the advice that was provided.<br/>I considered the involvement of my Special Advisers appropriate, given the logistical, security, privacy, media, and therefore political considerations involved. I regret that my attempt to find a way to participate in the course in a manner that would have satisfied these concerns has enabled some to construe a potential conflict of interest. <br/>With hindsight, I acknowledge that the better course of action would have been to take the points and fine upfront.<br/>The Ministerial Code sets out that Ministers must provide a list of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. It does not define what should be included, but it does specify the different types of interests. <br/>These are all framed around the responsibility for avoiding a conflict of interest between Ministers' public duties and their private interests, and tend to relate to ongoing circumstances or relationships. Recognising the importance of integrity and transparency, I approach my declarations with great care and consideration.<br/>The purpose of the form is to declare anything which might interfere, or be perceived to interfere, with a Minister's integrity when making decisions in the public interest. I did not consider that a speeding infringement or attending a speed awareness course, needed to be disclosed. <br/>It is not an ongoing situation with the potential to influence my decisions. In general, minor driving offences tend to be excluded from official forms. For example, barristers are not required to inform the regulator of minor speeding infractions; similarly, these are excluded if you are asked about any criminal history when you apply for a visa to the UK, or in the annual security questions asked of civil servants in the Home Office with heightened security clearance. <br/>I note that PET has, since November 2022, introduced references to fixed penalty notices in their introductory discussions with new ministers, recognising that the position was unclear given these are not currently explicitly covered by Ministerial interest forms. I am grateful for this clarity, and in the future would declare any similar speeding course or fine.<br/>As I outlined, I informed my officials of the speeding and driving course, and the Permanent Secretary's office was involved in the conversations as described above, determining whether it was appropriate for civil servants to engage with the security and logistics of me attending this course. It was never suggested by anyone in my PO or the Permanent Secretary's Office that I needed to disclose the situation on an updated form. <br/>I also understand that, despite being aware of events at the time, at no point did the Permanent Secretary or Cabinet Office suggest that my actions resulted in a conflict of interest or merited any investigation.<br/>I am deeply committed to all the Nolan Principles of Public Life, including honesty, integrity and openness, and I regret that these events have led some to question my commitment. <br/>I have at all times been truthful and transparent, and taken decisions guided by what I believed was right and appropriate given my office, not by any personal motivation. Another principle, of course, is leadership: Ministers must hold themselves \u2014 and be seen to hold themselves \u2014 to the highest standards. I have always strived, and will continue to strive, to do this.<br/>As I say, in hindsight, or if faced with a similar situation again, I would have chosen a different course of action. I sought to explore whether bespoke arrangements were possible, given my personal circumstances as a security-protected Minister. <br/>I recognise how some people have construed this as me seeking to avoid sanction \u2014 at no point was that the intention or outcome. Nonetheless, given the fundamental importance of integrity in public life, I deeply regret that my actions may have given rise to that perception, and I apologise for the distraction this has caused.<br/>I hope this clearly sets out my involvement in this matter and provides you with all relevant information. Should you require any further information, I will of course be happy to provide it.<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>Suella Braverman<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In 2017 and 2019 elections, as well as the EU referendum in 2016, age became the most prominent dividing line in British politics.<br/>A report by the Onward think tank, from 2019, said 83% of Conservative voters were over 45, while 4% were under 24.<br/>At the last election, the tipping point - the age at which people are more likely to vote Conservative than Labour - was 39, according to YouGov.<br/>But recent data analysis suggests younger generations are upending one of the stickiest assumptions in politics.<br/>In research this year, two political scientists from King's College London showed how millennials and Gen Z-ers are not becoming more Conservative as they age.<br/>In analysis of Conservative support by age, the research showed a 40% gap between oldest and youngest in 2020, compared with 10% in the early 1990s.<br/>One important factor is how the life chances of a generation have been shaped by events, such as the financial crash in 2008, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Bobby Duffy, professor of public policy at King's, says decisions by recent Conservative governments have not supported young people, while the increasing focus on culture-war issues has polarised the generations.<br/>\"This generational divide looks like terrible news for future support for the Conservatives, as clearly older generations are dying out and being replaced by these younger generations,\" the professor says.<br/>Still, there are reasons to view predictions of Conservative extinction through a sceptical lens.<br/>\"The Conservatives do face a real challenge, but it may be as much to do with the current offer from this version of conservatism than the underlying principles and values,\" Prof Duffy says. \"Decline is not inevitable for the Tories, but to avoid it, they do need to change.\"<br/>The Conservative Party did not wish to comment.<br/>Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, told the BBC it was important \"not to think about the country in terms of young or old\" and insisted the Tories had \"great young talent\", who appealed to voters of all ages.<br/>While the Tories wait to test that proposition in a general election, their party is being pulled in different political directions after 13 years in power.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Hancock, apparently joking, turns to his pink tie for inspiration.<br/>\"I occasionally wear a tie,\" he says. \"Today was the first time I put on a suit in two weeks, because I'm a normal person, now. I'm not a Conservative MP. It's just like, be normal, like the people who we represent. That's what we need to do.\"<br/>Hancock to stand down at next election<br/>Matt Hancock closes down app after five years<br/>Hancock: It\u2019s a pleasure to be back\u2026 and well-fed<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

<br/>The Commons standards committee recommended in March that the MP - who was elected for the SNP but had been sitting as an independent - should be suspended for 30 days.<br/>Ms Ferrier appealed the judgement, but it was later upheld when MPs voted by 185 to 40 in favour of the suspension on 6 June. <br/>Any MP suspended for more than 10 days will face a recall petition.<br/>If the petition is signed by more than 10% of eligible voters in the constituency within six weeks, the MP is removed from their seat and a by-election called.<br/>South Lanarkshire Council has confirmed the Margaret Ferrier recall petition will be open from 09:00 on Tuesday 20 June to 17:00 on Monday 31 July 2023.<br/>Constituents can sign the document at seven council sites across the area.<br/>Applications to participate by post or by proxy can be organised by contacting the Electoral Registration Office.<br/>The council has also confirmed that the number of Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituents entitled to sign the petition is 81,124 - so 8,113 people would have to sign to remove Ms Ferrier.<br/>If this is successful, it is likely a by-election will not happen until the autumn.<br/>Labour had already selected a candidate for a by-election before the Commons had even voted to suspend her, with the party quietly confident of winning the seat and adding momentum to its campaign ahead of next year's general election. <br/>The recall procedure for MPs was introduced in 2015 in response to the MPs' expenses scandal in the run up to the 2010 general election.<br/>MPs can be recalled under three circumstances:<br/>A petition officer then arranges for the petition to be open for six weeks. <br/>According to House of Commons Library, electors can sign it in person at a signing station or by post or proxy.<br/>If the 10% threshold is reached the petition officer informs the Speaker of the House of Commons - the seat becomes vacant when this notice is given.<br/>Two MPs have been recalled through this process both in 2019 - Labour's Fiona Onasanya of Peterborough and Conservative Chris Davies of Brecon and Radnorshire.<br/>Ms Onasanya, who lied to police over a speeding ticket, had been jailed for three months for perverting the course of justice.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Davies had pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false expenses claim.<br/>A recall petition was held in North Antrim in September 2018 over the DUP's Ian Paisley, but failed to get enough signatures.<br/>The Commons had voted to suspend him for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government and lobbying on its behalf.<br/>This will be the first recall petition held in Scotland.<br/>People can campaign for or against recall petitions and the Electoral Commission has rules in place for spending and donations on such campaigns.<br/>Voters who want to sign the recall petition will need voter ID because of new rules introduced by the UK government.<br/>It had been suggested that some Conservative MPs might vote against the motion to ban Ms Ferrier as they are concerned about the precedent it would set in the case of Boris Johnson.<br/>The former PM's behaviour is being looked at by Westminster's Privileges Committee over whether he misled parliament.<br/>Of the 40 MPs who ultimately opposed her suspension, 32 were Conservatives, two were DUP, two were Alba - Neale Hanvey and Kenny MacAskill - and one was Reclaim.<br/>The Conservatives who backed her included former ministers David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and party grandees Sir Bill Cash and Sir Edward Leigh.<br/>Ferrier was accompanied in the Commons for the vote by Conservative former minister Andrew Selous and SNP MP Carol Monaghan. <br/>At one point, Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski was seen walking to the opposition benches to shake her hand.<br/>Many of her former SNP colleagues had been calling for her to quit as an MP since her lockdown breach first came to light. <br/>Covid train trip MP loses appeal over Commons ban<br/>Figures show voters turned away due to no photo ID<br/>Who is Margaret Ferrier?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods and companies pay tax on their profits.<br/>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens.<br/>But if it can't, it needs to either raise taxes, cut spending or borrow. <br/>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.<br/>So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which it also hopes will help the economy.<br/>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.<br/>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. <br/>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.<br/>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. <br/>The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called \"quantitative easing\".<br/>The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. <br/>When people submit tax returns In January, often paying a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. <br/>So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date.<br/>In the 2022-23 financial year, the government borrowed \u00a3137.1bn. That was up by about 13% from the previous year.<br/>In April, the government borrowed \u00a325.6bn, which was the second-highest borrowing figure for April since records began in 1993.<br/>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently just over \u00a32.5 trillion. <br/>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.<br/>That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. <br/>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level.<br/>But in relation to the size of the economy, today's debt is still low compared with much of the last century, as shown above, and also compared with many leading advanced economies. <br/>The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. <br/>That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s. But it is more noticeable now that interest rates have risen. <br/>Two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: \u00a320bn in June and \u00a318bn in December. The third largest amount came in April 2023, hitting \u00a39.8bn.<br/>During the last financial year, the government put aside \u00a3106.7bn on debt interest - more than it spends on education. <br/>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  <br/>Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?<br/>Most economists and politicians agree that debt cannot keep growing compared to the size of the economy forever, because at some point it becomes impossible to pay the interest.<br/>But there is debate about whether or how fast to cut borrowing. <br/>Growing the economy is another way to bring down the main measure of the total national debt: its size compared to GDP. <br/>Governments often increase borrowing when they face unusually difficult situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, or the current cost-of-living crisis. <br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has blamed the \"twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine\" for driving up government costs.<br/>He has said it is \"vital [that] we stick to our plan to reduce debt over the medium term\".<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises.<br/>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.<br/>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. <br/>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. <br/>It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We are in a moment that is equal to World War Two with respect to climate,\" she said.<br/>This week the International Energy Agency warned annual investments in clean energy in developing nations will need to triple from $770bn in 2022 to as much as $2.8tn by the early 2030s if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/>One proposal is that institutions like the World Bank offer cheaper loans for climate action projects.<br/>It is much more expensive to build flood defences in Barbados or Angola than it is in the Netherlands or the UK, Ms Mottley points out. <br/>The same goes for erecting wind turbines or installing solar farms.<br/>That is because low-income countries are charged high interest rates - often two or even three times the rates developed nations face.<br/>Yet the risks of individual projects don't vary anywhere near as much as that. <br/>Another suggestion is that institutions like the World Bank should agree to guarantee loans for climate action in developing nations. That would encourage the private sector to lend at lower interest rates.<br/>Experts say these initiatives could generate hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of loans for climate projects in low-income countries.<br/>Another proposal involves the creation of an auction in which developing nations would bid for cheap finance for climate projects.<br/>This \"Climate Mitigation Trust Fund\" would be funded by tens of billions of dollars' worth of SDRs and overseen by the IMF and the UN.<br/>The winners would be the projects that reduce global warming fastest.  <br/>It is not expected that a final decision will be made on these proposals, but Ms Mottley is confident that progress will be made.<br/>We tell our children we shouldn't put off to tomorrow what we need to do today, Ms Mottley says.<br/>\"I find myself actually repeating a lot of things that we would say to children, in order to inform global behaviour today,\" she continues.  \"That tells us a lot.\"<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He said his warnings were ignored and called a meeting with OceanGate bosses but was fired, according to the documents.<br/>The company sued him for revealing confidential information, and he countersued for unfair dismissal. The lawsuit was later settled but we don't know the details of the settlement. <br/>The BBC tried to contact Mr Lochridge but he is not commenting. <br/>Separately, a letter sent to OceanGate by the Marine Technology Society (MTS) in March 2018 and obtained by the New York Times, stated \"the current 'experimental' approach adopted by OceanGate... could result in negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)\".<br/>A spokesman for OceanGate declined to comment on the safety issues raised by Mr Lochridge and the MTS.<br/>The Titan submersible, described as \"experimental\" by the company, was built from an unusual material for a deep sea vessel. <br/>Its hull - surrounding the hollow part where passengers sit - was made from carbon fibre, with titanium end plates and a small window at one end.<br/>\"Typically, the part of deep-sea submersible housing the humans is a titanium sphere around 2m in diameter,\" said Dr Nicolai Roterdam, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth.<br/>To withstand the immense pressures of the deep you need super-strong materials, to resist the weight of water above that's pressing down on you.   <br/>Carbon fibre is cheaper than titanium or steel and is extremely strong, but it is largely untested for deep sea vessels like the Titan.<br/>In an interview with Oceanographic last year, OceanGate's CEO Rush Stockton said: \"Carbon fibre is used successfully in yachts and in aviation, but it has not been used in crewed submersibles.\" <br/>In the court documents, Mr Lochridge claimed the hull had not been properly tested - where it's placed under extreme pressures and analysed to look for potential problems. <br/>He claimed that trials on a smaller scale model of the sub had revealed flaws in the carbon under pressure testing.   <br/>Mr Lochridge also raised the issue of the Titan's glass viewport. He claimed the company that made the material would only certify its use down to 1,300m.<br/>A December 2018 statement from OceanGate said the Titan had completed a 4,000 meter dive which \"completely validates OceanGate's innovative engineering and the construction of Titan's carbon fiber and titanium hull\".<br/>In a 2020 interview with GeekWire, Mr Rush said tests were conducted which revealed that the Titan's hull \"showed signs of cyclic fatigue\". <br/>In a May 2021 court filing, the company said Titan had undergone more than 50 test dives, including to the equivalent depth of the Titanic, in deep waters off the Bahamas and in a pressure chamber.<br/>The shape of the Titan is also unusual.<br/>The hull of a deep-diving sub is usually spherical, which means it receives an equal amount of pressure at every point, but Titan's hull is tube-shaped, so the pressure would not be equally distributed.<br/>\"Titan is quite a different deep-sea submersible compared to those used in research,\" said Dr Roterman.<br/>\"Whether or not this design with composite materials represents a structural weakness would be for engineers to determine, however,\" she added.<br/>In the court documents, Mr Lochridge also said he had urged OceanGate to get the submarine inspected and certified. <br/>Subs can be certified or \"classed\" by marine organisations - for example by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) or DNV (a global accreditation organisation based in Norway) or Lloyd's Register. <br/>This essentially means that the vehicle must meet certain standards on aspects including stability, strength, safety and performance.<br/>The process involves reviewing the design and construction, assessing testing and trials to be certified. And once the sub is in service it needs to be checked periodically to ensure it still meets these criteria. <br/>But certification of subs isn't mandatory. <br/>Titan was never certified or classed - as the company wrote a blog post about it in 2019.<br/>It said the way that Titan had been designed fell outside the accepted system - but it \"does not mean that OceanGate does meet standards where they apply.\" <br/>It added that the classing agencies \"slowed down innovation\u2026 bringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation\". <br/>A CBS reporter who went on the Titan in 2022 quoted a waiver people signed before boarding as stating it was \"an experimental submersible vessel that has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body which could result in physical injury, emotional trauma or death.\"  <br/>Any sub that dives over 4,000m is a one-off vehicle - not something mass-produced - and requires innovation and novel design to survive at these depths. <br/>But that doesn't mean this falls outside the classing system.   <br/>Take for example the sub called the Limiting Factor. This vessel, designed by Triton submarines, has repeatedly travelled to the very deepest places in the ocean - performing many dives to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which lies 11km down.<br/>It's a truly unique and cutting-edge vessel - but the team behind it collaborated with the DNV classing agency from design, through to construction and testing. And the Limiting Factor is fully certified to repeatedly - and safely - dive to any depth in the ocean.<br/>Additional reporting by Thomas Spencer.<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Environmental lawyers say the landmark case could affect projects nationwide.<br/>The climate impacts in question - called 'downstream emissions' - are the greenhouse gas emissions released when the oil is used. Ms Finch says these are estimated to be 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over 20 years.<br/>One airline passenger on a return trip from London to Boston, US emits around one tonne of carbon.<br/>\"Planning authorities say that they don't need to consider the climate impacts of the actual burning of the oil - just from the drilling. It's like saying a chocolate cake is low calorie as long as you don't eat it,\" Ms Finch, who campaigns with local organisation Weald Action Group, told BBC News.<br/>Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, causing the planet's temperature to rise.<br/>\"The County Council is required to determine planning applications in accordance with the Development Plan, the National Planning Policy Framework, national policy and other material considerations, as set out in legislation and case law. The Horse Hill planning application was determined on this basis,\" a spokesperson for Surrey County Council said. <br/>Ms Finch's first challenge in the High Court was thrown out.

Do you want pliers involved? Do you want a screwdriver?\" The resulting video was \"the most grotesque thing I have ever seen,\" he said.<br/>McCartney, a former motorcycle gang member who spent time in prison before entering the monkey torture world, ended up running several Telegram groups in which hardcore torture enthusiasts distributed videos. <br/>\"It's no different than drug money,\" he said. \"Drug money comes from dirty hands, this money comes from bloody hands.\"<br/>The BBC also identified two other key suspects who are now being investigated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - Stacey Storey, a grandmother in her 40s from Alabama who was known in the community as \"Sadistic\", and a ringleader known as \"Mr Ape\" - whose real name we cannot reveal for safety reasons.<br/>\"Mr Ape\" confessed in an interview with the BBC that he had been responsible for the deaths of at least four monkeys and the torture of many more. He had commissioned \"extremely brutal\" videos, he said.<br/>Storey's phone was seized by Department of Homeland Security agents, who found nearly 100 torture videos, as well as evidence that she had paid for the creation of some of the most extreme videos produced. <br/>According to police sources, Storey was active in a torture group as recently as earlier this month. Approached by the BBC in Alabama in January, Storey claimed that she had been hacked and declined to comment on the allegations in detail. <br/>\"Mr Ape\", Stacey Storey and Mike McCartney are three of five key targets in the ongoing Homeland Security investigation. They have yet to be charged, but could face up to seven years in prison if prosecuted based on evidence gathered by the DHS.<br/>Special Agent Paul Wolpert, who is leading the DHS investigation, said everyone involved from law enforcement had been deeply shocked by the nature of the alleged crimes.<br/>\"I don't know if anybody would ever be ready for a crime like this,\" he said. \"The same with the attorneys and the juries, and anybody who reads that this is going on. It is going to be a shocker I think.\"<br/>Anybody involved in buying or distributing the monkey torture videos should \"expect a knock on the door at some point\", Agent Wolpert said. \"You are not going to get away with it.\"<br/>Police in Indonesia have arrested two torture suspects. Asep Yadi Nurul Hikmah was charged with animal torture and the sale of a protected species, and sentenced to three years in prison. M Ajis Rasjana was sentenced to eight months - the maximum sentence available for torturing an animal.<br/>Monkey torture videos are still easily accessible on Telegram and now Facebook, where the BBC recently found dozens of groups sharing extreme content, some with more than 1,000 members.<br/>\"We've seen an escalation in this extreme, graphic content, which used to be hidden but is now circulating openly on platforms like Facebook,\" said Sarah Kite, co-founder of animal charity Action for Primates. <br/>Facebook told the BBC it had removed the groups we brought to the company's attention. \"We don't allow the promotion of animal abuse on our platforms and we remove this content when we become aware of it, like we did in this case,\" a spokesperson said.<br/>Ms Kite also called for UK laws to be updated to make it easier to prosecute individuals who pay for torture videos to be made. \"If someone is proactively involved in inflicting that pain by paying for it and providing a list of things they want done to the animal, there should be stronger laws to hold them to account,\" she said.<br/>YouTube told the BBC in a statement that animal abuse had \"no place\" on the platform and the company was \"working hard to quickly remove violative content\". <br/>\"Just this year alone, we've removed hundreds of thousands of videos and terminated thousands of channels for violating our violent and graphic policies,\" the statement said.<br/>Telegram said it was \"committed to protecting user privacy and human rights such as freedom of speech\", adding that its moderators \"cannot proactively patrol private groups\".<br/>The Monkey Haters<br/>You can read the full story on the BBC News website, watch the documentary The Monkey Haters on BBC iPlayer (UK only), on YouTube, or listen to the radio version on BBC Sounds. <br/>Hunting the monkey torturers<br/>Catching the men who sell subway groping videos<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

As we continue to pump vast quantities of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere we are driving up global temperatures.<br/>But other factors are likely also playing a role.<br/>Professor Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says weaker than average winds have reduced the amount of dust from the Sahara Desert in the atmosphere. <br/>Saharan dust blocks and reflects some of the sun's energy out of the atmosphere, moderating sea temperatures.<br/>The trade winds have been unusually light this year and, at the same time, a persistent weather pattern with easterly winds from the continental US may also have helped warm the sea surface.<br/>Another factor could be the effects of a reduction in pollution from shipping.<br/>Regulations reducing the sulphur content of fuel burned by ships were brought in by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2020.<br/>This significantly reduces the amount of aerosol particles released into the atmosphere, the IMO says. <br/>But aerosols that pollute the air can also help reflect heat back into space, so removing them may have caused more heat to enter the waters. <br/>It looks like the impacts of the exceptional temperatures in the North Atlantic are already beginning to be felt.<br/>The eastern tropical Atlantic is the main spawning ground for North Atlantic hurricanes and the Met Office says an Atlantic tropical storm looks likely to form east of the Caribbean by the middle of this week. <br/>Julian Heming, a tropical cyclone expert at the Met Office, says it is very unusual to see a storm developing in that area so early in the season.<br/>Hurricane development is normally supressed during El Ni\u00f1o periods, but the Met Office's forecast suggests an above average season for tropical storms and cyclones in the North Atlantic basin this year because of the high surface temperatures.<br/>The Met Office says we can expect the hot weather to continue.<br/>It says there is a 45% chance - significantly higher than usual - that the UK will have what it describes as a \"hot summer\".<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

He says the sight of molten rocks cascading from Mayon's crater does not scare him one bit as it is his third time in a volcano shelter.<br/>\"Even if you are weary or exhausted, you need to do your obligations in the village, then you come back to your family here in the evacuation centre,\" he says.<br/>State scientists flagged increased activity on Mayon in early June, after they observed more frequent earthquakes and rockfalls from the crater. It is now under the third-highest alert based on a five-tier scale that measures the probability of an explosive eruption.<br/>Technically, Mayon is erupting, albeit at a slow pace.<br/>From a hilltop observatory, volcanologist Paul Alanis looks for visual cues that could upgrade the alert level. Those alerts then determine how many people will need to be evacuated. When Level 3 was declared on 8 June, at least 13,000 people were immediately moved to shelters. Several thousands more were evacuated in the succeeding days.<br/>For what's invisible to the naked eye, Mr Alanis uses a seismometer to measure movements underground.<br/>The most telling sign that Mayon was acting up was the swelling of a dome on its crater that was left by its last lava eruption in 2018, Mr Alanis says. That so-called lava dome appeared to be growing as early as April this year. <br/>There was a sense of anxiety in the observatory last week. <br/>\"At any time, the condition of the volcano could escalate. We had to prioritise to get the people out,\" Mr Alanis tells the BBC.<br/>The volcanologist's job also includes explaining what's happening in Mayon to the provincial governor and disaster response officials so that they can prepare accordingly.<br/>The slow-moving lava flows could mean two things, Mr Alanis says. It's either there's not enough hot gas inside the volcano for an explosive eruption or that the molten rock's path is clogged, preventing gas from escaping to the surface.<br/>\"We need to find other reasons why is that happening. But right now, I can't really tell,\" he says. \"At the moment, there's no technology that can predict when a volcano would erupt.\"<br/>The Philippines has 24 active volcanoes and is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, so-called for its history of volcanic activity.<br/>On the same week as the evacuations, a 5.5 magnitude earthquake that's unrelated to Mayon struck south of the capital, Manila, resulting in the temporary evacuation of office towers and high-rise buildings.<br/>But Mayon is the most fabled of the country's volcanoes, thanks to its near-perfect shape. It's the world's most conical volcano, according to Guinness.<br/>The fiery-red glow of lava on the crater has attracted throngs of tourists. It has also inspired internet memes about Daragang Magayon - a beautiful maiden from local Bicol folklore - and about Filipino Australian beauty queen Catriona Gray, who won the 2018 Miss Universe crown wearing a gown in the colour of Mayon's lava flows.<br/>For Zaira San Pascual, life in the shelter is more difficult because she had to move her late father's wake to the tent village.<br/>The 39-year-old Manila office worker was on the bus to Bicol when her family phoned her to say that they were moving to a shelter. \"How could we do it?\" she remembers asking herself in panic.<br/>Once she settled in, she realised that the situation was not as bad as the ones she experienced when she was a kid.<br/>\"You'll see people smiling, laughing, joking around. It's their coping mechanism, their way of not thinking about how grim their condition is here,\" she says.<br/>In the calm of night, people at the shelter have no choice but to wait and keep themselves entertained. They huddle in small groups to swap jokes on who has become the Marites - neighbourhood gossip - in their tent village. <br/>While evacuation from inside danger zones is mandatory, there are still those who refuse to leave their homes, like 72-year-old Roger Asilo.<br/>Mr Asilo hid behind a tree to avoid being hauled on board a lorry that transferred Guinobatan villagers to shelters.<br/>Over the decades, he feels he has learnt when the volcano is acting up enough for him to pack his bags. His son is also staying behind to look after him.<br/>Mr Asilo says he prefers to look after two pigs that a friend left in his care for a fee. <br/>At night, he watches the glowing lava flows seated on a bamboo bench outside his home.<br/>\"Every time I look at the volcano spewing lava, I always pray that it would stop,\" he tells the BBC.<br/>\"I am scared but I am prepared.\"<br/>Thousands evacuated as Philippine volcano oozes lava<br/>One doctor. 13,000 remote islanders.

The problem though is that often employees of coal, oil and gas companies are not open about their affiliations. <br/>At COP26 in Glasgow, there were more delegates from the fossil fuel industries than from any single country.<br/>Last year at COP27 in Egypt, the numbers had swollen by a quarter, with more than 600 representatives according to analysis from campaign group, Global Witness.<br/>With registration for delegates to this year's COP28 summit in Dubai set to open soon, the UN will now put in place a mandatory question on affiliation. <br/>\"From now onwards, every single badged participant attending the event will be required to list their affiliation and relationship to that organisation,\" said UN climate chief Simon Stiell, speaking at the closing of a preparatory meeting in Bonn.<br/>Campaigners say the step is long overdue.<br/>\"As long as UN climate talks have existed, the fossil fuel industry lobbyists have been flooding these talks seeking a seat at the table where the rules of climate action are written,\" said Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability.<br/>\"It's actually no small thing that for the first time ever, all participants, will have to be honest to the world about who they are.\"<br/>Observers say that the new requirement might prevent a recurrence of what happened last year when BP chair Bernard Looney attended the talks as a delegate of Mauritania, a poor African country where the company has major investments. <br/>Similarly, four senior employees of Total, the French oil company, came to the COP as representatives of a mysterious German environmental campaign group. <br/>However while information on a delegate's affiliation will now be mandatory, participants will be allowed to opt out on the nature of their relationship to that organisation. <br/>There will also be no requirement to say who's financing the trip to the COP.<br/>If delegates do opt out from providing some information, the UN will publish these blank answers in their lists, allowing people to draw their own conclusions.<br/>\"This information should help prevent those representing the interests of fossil fuels from sneaking through the back door without declaring their true intentions,\" said Alice Harrison, from Global Witness, who compile an annual list of fossil fuel delegates attending the COP. <br/>\"We'll be certain to dig into those who refuse to declare.\" <br/>The move comes as delegates left the meeting in Bonn meeting meant to prepare the ground for COP28.<br/>Deep divisions between rich and poor were again apparent, with huge frustration on the part of developing countries that their financial needs are not being met, as climate impacts ramp up around the world. <br/>\"The credibility of this process is under threat.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Countries agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.<br/>Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires. <br/>But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.<br/>Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. <br/>Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. <br/>By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's \"more likely than not.\"<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average. <br/>Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas. <br/>For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world. <br/>Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure. <br/>Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.<br/>And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time. <br/>\"We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.<br/>\"I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,\" he told a news conference. <br/>The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed. <br/>\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas<br/>\"However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" he said.<br/>There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up. <br/>The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon with global implications. <br/>For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a event which has dampened climate warming to some extent. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>El Ni\u00f1o: How does it affect global weather?<br/>But the extra heat that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.<br/>However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.<br/>\"It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Ni\u00f1o that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,\" Prof Scaife told reporters. <br/>\"But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Ni\u00f1o and that might be the one that does it. \"<br/>The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters. <br/>Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.<br/>Unexplained ocean warming alarms scientists<br/>Wind is main source of electricity for first time<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose -

You think trains are better than planes, but your dad books the summer holiday.<br/>Young people are some of the world's most powerful climate leaders and want rapid action to tackle the problem.<br/>It makes a lot of sense. Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.<br/>Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:<br/>Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. <br/>Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. <br/>Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.<br/>\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. <br/>\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. <br/>Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. <br/>Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.<br/>Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"<br/>How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.<br/>Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. <br/>\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.<br/>Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" <br/>\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  <br/>She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.<br/>Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.<br/>Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.<br/>\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.<br/>Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.<br/>\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.<br/>\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It's an important summary of six key pieces of research completed over the past five years. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the critical messages.<br/>The sober tones of this study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make clear that there is very little chance of keeping the world from warming by more than 1.5C. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid that. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s, despite all the political speechmaking.<br/>\"It has always been clear in the IPCC and in climate science, that it's not very likely that we always will stay below 1.5C,\" said Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team.<br/>Dr Geden and his colleagues now argue that coming back down as quickly as possible after overshooting this mark is where the focus should be. <br/>Overshooting is risky, as the report acknowledges, because it might trip tipping points that can't be uncrossed, such as the melting of permafrost that would in turn release vast amounts of warming gases.  <br/>Coming back from overshooting will need expensive, unproven technology to pull CO2 from the air, something known as carbon capture.<br/>It also means that it's even more urgent to get as quickly as possible to net zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere does not increase. Every increment of global warming and every year that goes by really matters. <br/>While the report doesn't definitively say it, there are some clear indications that there's no future for coal, oil and gas on a liveable planet.<br/>It highlights how renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar are now cheaper and that sticking with fossil fuels may be more expensive in many places than switching to low carbon systems.<br/>\"The message in terms of urgency, I think, is stop burning fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible,\" Dr Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors told BBC News.<br/>\"It is not because we are lacking some important piece of technology or some important knowledge. It is because so far, the sense of urgency has been lacking in the places where the important decisions are made.\"<br/>While it is easy to think that scientific reports on climate change are all about governments and energy policy, the IPCC has been moving to highlight the fact that the actions that people can take make by themselves make massive difference to the overall picture. <br/>\"We could cut 40 to 70% of projected 2050 emissions with end-use measures,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.<br/>This includes shifting to plant-based diets, avoiding flights, building more walkable and bikeable cities,\" she told BBC News. <br/>The report nudges governments towards reforming their transport, industry and energy systems so that making these low carbon choices becomes much easier and cheaper for individuals.<br/>It's amazing to think that the decisions we make around the world over the next seven years will echo down the centuries.<br/>The report warns that with sustained warming of between 2 and 3C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost \"almost completely and irreversibly\" over multiple millenia.<br/>Many other thresholds will be crossed at low levels of heating, impacting things like the world's glaciers. <br/>To stop this runaway train of warming, governments need to up their commitments before 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, in order to keep warming in or around 1.5C by 2100. <br/>\"I think our climate system, but also our social systems and our ecosystems, all show us that it's bloody urgent, so that we can still change the world to make it a better place for all of us,\" said Dr Otto.<br/>The real strength of the IPCC is that their reports are agreed with governments - and as such the reports are approved by their representatives in the presence of the scientists who research and write them.<br/>But the future of fossil fuels is becoming more and more a political question. <br/>Last November in Sharm el-Sheikh, a number of countries tried but failed to get the UN to agree to phase out oil and gas as well as coal. <br/>This argument is not going away - with the EU now openly supporting such a move.<br/>This new IPCC report will be central to it when countries meet again at COP28 in Dubai later this year. <br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. <br/>\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.<br/>\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.<br/>\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"<br/>The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. <br/>And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. <br/>\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.<br/>\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"<br/>The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". <br/>The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. <br/>They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. <br/>But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.<br/>Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.<br/>Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. <br/>\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

To be asked to play these multiple roles is an exhilarating challenge I can't wait to get into.\"<br/>In a five-star review of the Australian production, The Guardian said Snook's counterpart, actress Eryn Jean Norvill, had \"dazzled\" in the role.<br/>\"[The show] is ambitious, exuberant and whip-smart; it is an embrace of theatre's past, present and future,\" wrote theatre critic Cassie Tongue.<br/>The production was adapted and directed by Sydney Theatre Company's artistic director Kip Williams, who will also direct its West End transfer.<br/>Earlier this year, Snook starred in the hugely acclaimed fourth and final series of the Emmy-winning drama Succession, which was warmly praised by critics.<br/>She played Shiv Roy in the series, one of four children battling for control of their father Logan Roy's international media and entertainment company.<br/>Like its sister production in Australia, The Picture of Dorian Gray will employ a collection of on-stage cameras and video screens which help bring the characters to life.<br/>\"The powerful use of Snapchat filters and other selfie-style shots draw heavy parallels to the impossible beauty standards of social media influencers and how this curated identity can be the painted rust concealing psychological trauma beneath,\" Time Out said in its review of the Australian production.<br/>Despite the presence of the cameras and screens, the production features minimal pre-recording and Snook will play the overwhelming majority of the characters live each night, with the cameras employed more as a technique to complement her performance.<br/>Dealing with themes of morality, narcissism and excess, The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul in exchange for eternal youth and beauty.<br/>The show's titular protagonist makes a deal that his body will retain perfect youth, while a recently-painted portrait of him - representing his soul - grows older and uglier instead.<br/>Gray begins committing a series of debauched acts, but as he does, the ever-changing portrait he has in his house becomes increasingly hideous, serving as a reminder of the effect each evil act has on his soul.<br/>Gray's descent into sin and hedonism ultimately leads him to question the real source of beauty in life.<br/>Discussing the London production of the play, Snook said: \"This story of morality, innocence, narcissism and consequence is going to be thrilling to recreate for a new audience.\"<br/>The transfer from Australia to London mirrors that of Prima Facie, which was staged in Sydney before its West End transfer scored its British star Jodie Comer an Olivier and Tony Award.<br/>Brian Cox says Succession twist happened too early<br/>Critics praise 'brutal' final season of Succession<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Those are the ingredients that have made the Final Fantasy series stand the test of time.<br/>However, after a mixed reception to the previous game, this latest release, which launched on Thursday, has some work to do.<br/>Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida explains: \"Because the Final Fantasy 15 story wasn't as well received as past titles, we needed to focus on regaining players' trust, and show them again that this series is all about the story.\"  <br/>That story, clearly inspired by fantasy shows like Game of Thrones, encourages players to think about looking after the planet better. A theme that has been present throughout the franchise's history. <br/>How those messages are interpreted should be up to the player, although according to Naoki Yoshida: \"I look at games as entertainment, I hope that through this entertainment players can take something away.<br/>\"Talking about the environment and those issues is also very important, but I think what Final Fantasy 16 also focuses on is that there is darkness in the world and darkness in ourselves. We have to accept that darkness to overcome it and move on to tomorrow.  <br/>\"But I'm not in a position to say this is what players should feel, because everyone will take away something different. But if they do feel something then that makes us very proud and happy.\"<br/>Most games stay clear of overt messaging on social or political issues so they don't alienate potential players who may hold differing opinions.<br/>Aoife Wilson, who reviewed the title for Eurogamer YouTube Channel, says the series' ecological themes are plain to see: \"I think generally in most Final Fantasy games when you boil it down the story is saying something about protecting the planet, and being wary of of mining it for selfish reasons. <br/>\"What I really like about 16, however, is that it tries harder than previous titles to say all that through a very human perspective.\"<br/>The first game, for the Nintendo Entertainment System, came out in 1987 and since then around 173 million copies of titles in the franchise have been sold.<br/>An example of the Japanese roleplaying-game genre (JRPG), the series is unique because each title's setting is independent from each other (bar some small overlaps in places). Beloved characters, locations and worlds live and die in one game. It's as if The Sopranos swapped out Tony for a new character every series and ditched New Jersey for a different location. <br/>It's a risky approach which asks players to forget their attachment to previous characters and invest emotionally in new ones each time. However the series is sticking with it. <br/>According to Wilson, it's a way to try and keep the series current: \"It means you don't have to have played six to be able to play seven, for example. <br/>\"They're all self contained, but they do share little similarities and have nods to previous games for fans as well. I often think that's the reason they have been so successful, the fact that the games are constantly having to reinvent themselves.\"<br/>Final Fantasy games are not for everyone. They require patience and reward players for their investment. Attacks need to be learnt and mastered - bashing buttons at random will only take you so far in this franchise. <br/>The scripts are over the top, some story arcs are a little traditional and Final Fantasy 15 was criticised for having four male characters as its primary focus. There is an attempt at more diversity this time around with a female character Jill in a central role, a queer relationship is featured however the main protagonists are still predominantly white. <br/>With lots of competition in the role-playing game space at the moment (Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Hogwarts Legacy are this year's top selling games, for example), Final Fantasy 16 does have its work cut-out to attract players who aren't already fans of the series. <br/>However, its tone, distinct aesthetic and enjoyable set-piece battles give it clear points of difference.<br/>Wilson says that this release is the first in the series for some time that she fells has a chance to cut-through: \"When I was writing my review for Final Fantasy 16, I was asking myself 'who do I recommend this game to?'<br/>\"I think, interestingly, for the first time in a long time this is a title that I can recommend to pretty much anyone with an interest in games. I can do that without too many caveats or explainers and I think that's a very good sign for the series.<br/>\"Honestly with recent entries in the series it has been difficult to do that. Fifteen was fine, had some nice moments, but when it launched it didn't feel like a game that was finished. It had some of the right ingredients but it all didn't come together.\"<br/>This version has a darker tone than previous entries. The departure will seek to make the series more appealing to new players, who will be more used to this feel than some of the gothic and modern mash-ups we've seen in the past.  <br/>A JRPG fan once told a friend about a classic of the genre that it \"really comes into its own after about 80 hours of gameplay\". Not everyone has the desire to stick with a game for that long before seeing the best of it. <br/>Saying the same of Final Fantasy 16 isn't fair, however it is a title that requires some serious time investment to get the best out of it. The success of similar releases like Zelda, Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy recently suggests though that it should not be a barrier to success. Gamers' appetite for a title they love can easily stretch to a multi-hour investment for a story driven game like this.<br/>Its creators hope that it won't only be fans of the series that are willing to go the distance. <br/>Final Fantasy 16 is released on Thursday 22 June. <br/>For more gaming content, go to Press X to Continue, the BBC Sounds gaming Podcast.<br/>Zelda: Why Nintendo's latest game is so important<br/>Super Mario: Jack Black on rise of game adaptations<br/>Dungeons & Dragons: Hollywood's 50-year-old crush<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I was impressed. You put your dreams out there.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>How a smart suit could help Eli Crossley keep playing guitar<br/>It didn't take long for social media to take up the cause, petitioning festival organiser Emily Eavis to give Eli and his band a slot.<br/>After an initial flurry of activity, however, the requests died down. Then, a parent at Eli's school saw Askew performing in an end-of-term talent show. <br/>That parent just happened to be Jon Turner of Island Records. The following morning, calls were placed to Eavis and her husband Nick Dewey, and the cogs turned.<br/>\"They saw the video of Eli and said, 'Yes, we'd absolutely love to have him',\" Ms Reuben recalls.<br/>That evening she posted a cryptic message on WhatsApp to the group's parents: \"Major news incoming.\" Soon afterwards, Eli started making calls to his bandmates Alfie, 15, and Freddie, Jay and Will, all 16.<br/>\"I didn't believe him at all,\" says Will, who plays guitar. \"I thought it was a little joke.\"<br/>Then the news sank in...<br/>\"Will is fairly new to the band and he said, 'But I've never played a gig before',\" Eli recalls. <br/>\"And I was like, 'Yeah, well you're playing Glastonbury now, mate.'\"<br/>\"We've never played anything this big,\" says second guitarist Jay, admitting to a degree of nervousness. <br/>\"We've only really played in front of our parents and in small bars and stuff. We never thought we'd be here. \"<br/>Asked how he feels about the show, even Eli's bravado falters temporarily.<br/>\"I'm terrified about it, but really excited at the same time.\"<br/>But the band have already got the support of one famous fan, actor Eddie Marsan, who implored festivalgoers to catch their set.<br/>\"Eli is not only a remarkable young man, he's a phenomenal musician,\" he wrote on Twitter. <br/>\"I saw his band Askew play in Paris and their set was incredible. They're going to blow Glastonbury away.\"<br/>The group will play at 17:30 BST on Friday on the small and secretive Rabbit Hole stage - an underground venue where punters have to answer a riddle before they can enter.<br/>Their half-hour set will mix originals like Rosemary and Last with covers of Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love and Supersonic by Oasis - \"a few crowd pleasers to make sure everybody stays put\", as Eli puts it - before they're set free for the rest of the weekend.<br/>Eli is determined to see Royal Blood on the Pyramid Stage, while his mum has made it clear she'll be watching Sir Elton John on Sunday night.<br/>After that, she will go back to the day job of running Duchenne UK, the charity she set up after Eli was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy 13 years ago. At the time, she was told her three-year-old might not live to see 20.<br/>Along with co-founder Alex Johnson, she has raised more than \u00a317m, which has been used to fund clinical trials across the UK, as well as partially funding 34 posts for doctors and nurses, creating guidelines for care for Duchenne patients and research into how technology can help them. Both women received OBEs from King Charles last weekend.<br/>It was part of their research that led to Eli's initial appearance on BBC Breakfast, discussing the motor-assisted suit that will help him continue playing guitar when his arm muscles begin to waste away.<br/>She says the suit will mean \"being able to brush your teeth, give your mum a hug [or] put your arm up in class.

James Graham's fast-moving portrait of Gareth Southgate's reign as the England football manager is a joyous example of populist theatre,\" he wrote. \"There's anguish, joy and a surprisingly generous helping of humour.\"<br/>Dear England, which takes its title from Southgate's open letter to fans, focuses primarily on the pressure of penalties but also touches on the racism aimed at black players for missing them, set against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.<br/>\"There's a touch too much politically correct preaching in the final quarter,\" Davis noted. \"And I could have done without the political caricatures of [former prime ministers, Theresa] May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Graham makes his points about the power of solidarity and compassion eloquently enough through what he shows us of Southgate himself.\"<br/>What's on Stage gave another five-star review, with its writer Sarah Crompton calling it \"the beautiful game in a beautiful play\". The fear of the penalty, she said, is \"the thread that binds the play together\".<br/>\"It's a thrilling piece that you hope might just convince theatre fans of the importance of football, and football fans will see to understand just how exciting theatre can be,\" she wrote. \"What the production has in abundance is both energy and tenderness.\"<br/>She added: \"Graham is clear-eyed about the brutality of the choices and burdens of professional sport, and he doesn't exempt Southgate from criticism. Occasionally the writing gets bogged down in incident - the woman next to me was confused by the details of the ban on OneLove armbands in Qatar - and in its own metaphors.<br/>\"But as a drama, it is utterly absorbing, full of twists and turns, vivid characters, proper conflicts, and great lines.\"<br/>The Guardian's Arifa Akbar enjoyed Graham's \"touching\" and \"funny\" play, which, she wrote, delivers \"tension and movement\".<br/>However, she offered only three stars and said she had one or two reservations. \"As endearing as it is, the production, directed by Rupert Goold, takes time to really lift off the ground, focusing on story rather than drama in the first half - and it does seem like a game of two halves,\" she added.<br/>\"There is power in seeing the story of football told on the biggest stage of the National Theatre, with rousing moments in the second half, and it is beautiful from start to finish in its optics. So it scores, ultimately, even if it does not quite bend it like Beckham.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Joseph Fiennes on the power of football<br/>Speaking to the BBC in February, Graham promised the play would highlight the \"gentle revolution\" in the team's culture under Southgate and that he hoped to examine \"the identity of a football team and the country\".<br/>\"I think what has happened to the men's England football team over the past six years has been quietly extraordinary,\" the award-winning writer told BBC News.<br/>\"It's been humming along in the background, but we're only starting to really understand now Gareth's gentle revolution.\" <br/>Actor Fiennes later added that Southgate had \"a sort of moral integrity and compass.\"<br/>\"He's been brought up as a young player in a very toxic male environment and you can imagine that he wants to unshackle himself, giving players their voice.\"<br/>Dear England features portrayals of Southgate's star players, as well as sports psychologist Pippa Grange.<br/>Graham and Goold's take on the squad's recent highs and lows from the penalty spot received a four-star review from the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis, who described the show as a \"brilliant fusion of sport and art\".<br/>\"There's not much space for deep characterisation but Will Close and Josh Barrow are very funny as [Harry] Kane and [Jordan] Pickford, Darragh Hand and Kel Matsena quietly moving as [Marcus] Rashford and [Raheem] Sterling,\" he added.<br/>\"There's a goalmouth scramble at the end to fit in the Lionesses' 2022 Euros win and controversies over Qatar. It doesn't matter. This is a thrilling piece of work, popular and political as Graham always intends his plays to be, and - appropriately - a consummate team effort.\"<br/>Dear England runs at the National Theatre in London until 11 August.<br/>Joseph Fiennes on the power of football.

It has become an instant bestseller.<br/>\"We just finished the final season of Umbrella and I felt so much more embodied and centred, to be able to start the day as 'me',\" Page adds, \"as opposed to being in my trailer with constant discomfort.\"<br/>Page's character - originally named Vanya - transitioned to Viktor in season three of the Netflix superhero hit series The Umbrella Academy, in line with his real-life gender transition. <br/>\"It's who I've always been,\" the character Viktor tells his siblings, in an understated scene. Viktor asks if it is an issue for anyone and his siblings insist it is not, before returning to the original storyline. It was described as \"movingly low-key\" by Variety.<br/>Netflix employed trans writer Thomas Page McBee to incorporate the Viktor gender transition plotline into the show and the soft-touch approach worked with audiences around the world. <br/>Nielsen Media Research - which evaluated views across all platforms - says that the series chalked more than 10.5 billion hours of streaming, making it the 13th most viewed original show of the year.  <br/>Page's Viktor instantly became one the best known trans men in fictionalised broadcasting - one of the least represented groups in the industry.<br/>According to the 2022-2023 Where We Are On TV report by LGBT advocacy group Glaad, only 11 of the 596 LGBT characters portrayed across 100 global TV, film and streaming platforms were trans men. <br/>Page says he's aware that he is one of the most high-profile trans men in the world and takes this seriously. <br/>\"I'm in this unique position,\" he says, \"and I absolutely have to use my privilege and my platform to do what I can, in whatever way, to help my community.\"<br/>When he wrote his memoir, Pageboy, he chose a lyric from a song by transgender musician Beverly Glenn-Copeland for the opening lines.   <br/>\"This world has many ends and beginnings,<br/>A cycle ends, will something remain?<br/>Maybe a spark, once so bright, will bloom again.\"<br/>The words resonated with Page.<br/>\"At so many points I'd find myself thinking, 'I was never a girl. I'll never be a woman. What am I going to do? I just want to be a 10-year-old,'\" he tells the BBC.<br/>\"Then I started realising, 'Oh, that's because that's the last time I felt like myself, the last time I felt like I looked like myself and was in my body and knew who I was and had this spark,' you know?<br/>\"It's now coming back. That spark.\"<br/>It was in December 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 global pandemic, that Page publicly came out as a trans man via his Instagram account. In a post that quickly gathered more than three million likes, Page wrote that he felt lucky to be making the announcement.<br/>\"There were years and years of turmoil about it,\" he says, \"of getting really close and then pulling away, talking myself out of it.\"<br/>Some of that reluctance was a hangover from the years of hiding his identity, on advice from film executives who shaped his early career. In his book he describes the Hollywood he encountered as a 20-year-old star of breakout independent movie Juno, as \"plastic, empty, homophobic\". <br/>In Juno, he played a teenager who goes through an unplanned pregnancy. The role won Page an Oscar nomination and global fame.<br/>\"The success of Juno coincided with people in the industry telling me no-one could know I was queer,\" he writes in Pageboy, \"that it wouldn't be good for me\u2026 So I put on the dresses and the makeup. I did the photo shoots.\" <br/>He describes the level of discomfort, gender dysphoria, as crushing. <br/>\"I had to avoid my reflection. I couldn't look at pictures, because I was never there. It was making me sick.\"<br/>At the same time gossip writers printed columns questioning his identity. Page says he's not sure pieces like that would be published now, in the age of social media.<br/>\"The articles you're referencing came out in 2008. I imagine if those came out now about someone, I mean, they would probably be eviscerated for writing something like that.\" <br/>So does he believe a young trans person could come to Hollywood now, with no connections, and have a successful career?<br/>Page pauses before conceding, \"I'm not 100% sure. In some ways, potentially.\" <br/>Then he pauses again, \"But now, we're also in a time of such extreme hateful rhetoric against trans lives. There's still so far to go.\"<br/>Community is the answer to polarising online debates about transgender people, he insists, and he wants to connect with young LGBT people from around the world, through his work.<br/>We asked trans men who use the BBC languages services to send video questions for Elliot. One came from Adam, a 24-year-old pilot in India, whose family put him through conversion therapy and refused to let him leave the house for more than a year.  <br/>\"This is not just my story,\" Adam says. \"This is the story of trans people around the world. So my question is, what message do you have for trans people going through tough times?\"<br/>Page is visibly moved when he watches the video.<br/>\"My message is just to hold on and to love yourself with all your might and to know that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you,\" he says. \"Reach out for support where you can find it. In person or online. Seek out narratives that offer some kind of representation, some kind of comfort. Just a reminder that you're not alone.\"<br/>Changing the narrative on trans representation in the media is something he says he hopes to do with his film company Page Boy Productions, as well as his own acting roles in the future.<br/>He hopes that his platform can help change people's sometimes limited perceptions of manhood. <br/>\"Being aggressive is encouraged in men,\" he says. \"I hope those expectations of what it means to be a man, what masculinity means, can be redefined and healed.\"<br/>He says he isn't sure how his personal life will turn out.<br/>\"I'm not too interested in having kids, to be honest. But, I guess you never know,\" he says smiling. \"I do feel like I'm really living my life for the first time. I'm just happy.

The service, which offers shipping perks, access to streaming movies and more, costs $139 a year or $14.99 monthly in the US and \u00a395 per year in the UK. <br/>The FTC said Amazon used website designs that pushed customers into agreeing to enrol in Prime and have the subscription automatically renew as they were making purchases. <br/>The company attempted to make it difficult for users to opt out of auto-enrolment because \"those changes would also negatively affect Amazon's bottom line\", the agency alleged in the complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle. <br/>It also said Amazon put customers seeking to cancel through a cumbersome \"four-page, six-click, fifteen option\" process, which the FTC said was known internally as \"Iliad\" in a nod to the Greek epic about the \"long, arduous Trojan War\". <br/>Though Amazon altered the cancellation process shortly before the lawsuit was filed, the FTC said the company's tactics broke laws aimed at protecting shoppers.<br/>\"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said.<br/>The FTC is seeking a court order to force Amazon to change its practices, as well as financial penalties in an unspecified amount.<br/>Amazon said it had been in the middle of discussing the issues with the agency when the lawsuit was filed without notice. <br/>\"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,\" the company said. <br/>The FTC has repeatedly warned online firms against using \"dark patterns\" to manipulate shoppers.<br/>It had been investigating Amazon's Prime programme since 2021.<br/>It said the company had attempted to delay the probe on multiple occasions, including by refusing to deliver documents in a timely manner. <br/>Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Insider Intelligence analyst said the FTC was \"making an example of Amazon\".<br/>\"It's quite common for companies to make it more difficult to cancel an account than it is to create one,\" she said.<br/>Ms Khan, who was appointed to her post by President Joe Biden, made her name critiquing US competition policy related to Amazon.<br/>She has promised to move more aggressively to police online shopping and the power of America's tech giants. <br/>The lawsuit marks the third action from the FTC involving Amazon in recent weeks.<br/>The company agreed to pay $25m last month to settle charges it had violated child privacy laws by keeping recordings children made on Alexa. <br/>It agreed to pay another $5.8m to resolve claims that Ring, the doorbell company Amazon purchased in 2018, had violated privacy protections by giving staff unrestricted access to customer videos and failing to implement precautions against hackers. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Who will give us 'Glastonbury moments' in 2023?", "lead": "As the festival gates open, we look at the songs that could give us a \"Glastonbury moment\" this year.", "author": "By Mark Savage", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 23:06:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:52:51.787082", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0843/production/_130151120_gettyimages-1199627498.jpg", "body": "\"What's wrong with this picture?\" asked country star Kenny Rogers near the start of his Pyramid Stage set at Glastonbury in 2013. <br/>\"Glastonbury and Kenny Rogers? I'm so far out of my comfort zone.\"<br/>An hour later, he was walking on air. The audience received him so enthusiastically that he played Islands In The Stream twice. <br/>He later declared the festival one of his \"top five experiences\".<br/>A variation of that scene happens at Glastonbury every year. A song unexpectedly takes flight, and the artist and audience meet in a magical space between excitement, euphoria and exhaustion.<br/>It's almost impossible to predict... but there's no harm in trying, so I sat down with BBC Radio 1's Arielle Free to identify this year's potential \"Glastonbury moments\".<br/>You can listen to playlists on Spotify, Apple Music or YouTube, and argue with us about the choices on social media (not really, for goodness sake, who has the time?)  <br/>Mark: Which of the headliners are you most excited about?<br/>Arielle: That's so hard. Arctic Monkeys are a band I literally grew up with and have loved since their MySpace days - but I feel like I have to say Elton John, because I might never get to see him live again. Plus I keep hearing lots of exciting rumours about special guests. I think he's going to go all out.<br/>Mark: He's already said it'll be a completely different set to his current tour, but he traditionally finishes with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and I think that'll be a hugely emotional moment, because this could be his last ever show in the UK. I can hear that \"ah-ah-ahhhh\" chorus ringing out across the fields long after he's left the stage.<br/>Arielle: I saw him at Bestival and he was on stage at 11am doing his own soundcheck. He cares about the performance more than anything else, so it can't fail to be emotional.<br/>Mark: Any guesses on the special guests?<br/>Arielle: Let's be honest, we're all hoping for a bit of Harry Styles, aren't we!<br/>Mark: You chose RU Mine as the Arctics' big song. Why that one?<br/>Arielle: If there's a song that epitomises why I love Arctic Monkeys. it's that one. It's high energy. It's sexy. If they kick off with that one, we're in.<br/>Mark: The Last Dinner Party have got a huge buzz around them. They were signed to Island Records with just one single and they're already supporting Florence + The Machine on tour. There's a definite sonic similarity there. They're first on the bill at the Woodsies stage on Saturday morning, but I think the tent will be rammed.<br/>Arielle: Thank you for putting them on the list because I hadn't heard of them. I was like, \"The Last Dinner Party? That sounds like a site-specific theatre group.\"<br/>Mark: To be honest, I think they might be. They look like Wednesday Addams dressed like the cast of Bridgerton. <br/>Arielle: On Saturday, I'm hosting the West Holts stage, which means I get to see Gabriels, who are my favourite band at the moment.<br/>Mark: I saw them on The Park stage last year when no-one really knew who they were, and it was like a religious service. People walked away converted, telling everyone they'd seen the best band of their lives.<br/>Arielle: They give me goosebumps. I've seen them five times, and Jacob [Lusk, frontman] is one of the most incredibly charismatic, engaging, overwhelming performers. And I'll tell you one thing: Gold Leopards.<br/>Mark: OK...<br/>Arielle: Gold leopards. That's all I'm allowed to say!<br/>Arielle: Lizzo's set is going to be one of those ones where everyone just throws their arms around each other and has fun.<br/>Mark: She's such a force of positivity.<br/>Arielle: I remember when Adele headlined. There was a grandma, her daughter and the granddaughter all singing Rolling In The Deep in unison at the top of their voices. I think this will be the same. <br/>Mark: We've chosen Good As Hell, but it could just have easily been Juice or About Damn Time or Special.<br/>Arielle: I remember when Lizzo played the West Holts stage in 2019, she said she'd had a 13-year gap between Glastonbury performances, because she first played in the unsigned artist's tent. And now, however many years later, she'll be on the main stage, she'll bring her flute, she'll bring her dancers. I get really emotional when I see artists achieve their dreams like that. I'll probably cry.<br/>Mark: We need to talk about Rick Astley on Saturday morning. I think people will come along just to hear Never Gonna Give You Up and, honestly, he could just play that on repeat for an hour and we'd all be happy. The crowd's going to go bananas.<br/>Arielle: Carly Rae Jepsen's the same. You can hear everyone singing Call Me Maybe already.<br/>Mark: I've told the BBC I'm not working for that hour she's on stage. I'm turning my phone off and diving into the mosh pit.  <br/>Arielle: She's massively underrated as a vocalist. I can't wait to hear her play I Really Like You.<br/>Mark: Thank you for choosing the Nia Archives track. What a song.<br/>Arielle: I've had it as my tune of the week on Radio 1 this week and it has divided the crowd. I don't know if people are really attached to the original by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, or the remix by A-Trak, but a lot of people have been, like, \"Don't ruin a classic\". Also, I'm on the radio from four 'till seven AM, so it might not be appropriate for that time of day.<br/>Mark: It's pretty loud.<br/>Arielle: She's doing her own stage at Glastonbury - Nia Archives Presents on Saturday night. That'll be amazing.<br/>Mark: I'm really interested in Fred Again. I'm not sure he's that well-known but he's second on the bill on The Other Stage.<br/>Arielle: Oh, I don't know. He's just headlined Coachella. He also headlined Parklife [in Manchester] recently, and apparently every other stage was empty. Even other huge DJs just felt the wrath of going up against Fred Again. He's so fast and technical. It's like watching a Formula One race for like an hour.<br/>Mark: I've got to ask about your single, Technicolor Kenny. It's a summer anthem that's been two years in the making...<br/>Arielle: It's been a long, long slog getting it over the line, but it's finally there. The short version of the story is I was on the way to my brother's wedding and the radio in our car was stuck on this yacht rock station. We heard I Believe In Love by Kenny Loggins three times - and I was like, \"That would make such a good dance track\". So I made an edit and sent it to Annie Mac, because she's my hero, just to get some feedback, and she played it on the radio without even telling me. And here we are!<br/>Arielle: When Guns N' Roses are on the Pyramid Stage, I'll be running to watch Loyle Carner headline West Holts. For him, it's going to be such a special moment.<br/>Mark: Did you see his show at Wembley this year? It was such a compelling and thoughtful show. His album [Hugo] is all about his relationship with his father, and how that developed over a series of driving lessons, and the staging really brought that story to life. He even had the car on stage... It was really moving.<br/>Arielle: I did see him last time he played West Holts, at about four in the afternoon. He brought on his mum, Jorja Smith, Ezra Collective. He's very loyal... Loyal Carner! He loves raising people up and his new track with Enny is so good. I really hope he brings her on stage. She's such an incredibly gifted rapper. <br/>Mark: That song has such a laid-back summer vibe. And as much as we've talked about singalongs and dancing, there's that flipside to Glastonbury where the sun's going down, and you lie back and let the music wash over you. I think Lana Del Rey will be the perfect antidote for people who've maybe gone a little too hard during the day.<br/>Arielle: Wizkid's Essence is such a summer tune. I've never seen him and I think he's going to be amazing.<br/>Mark: There was a great review of his US tour, where they said he's entered his \"rock star era\", full of \"shirtless serenades and rabid fans\". I'm almost more interested in seeing that than Arctic Monkeys, who are on at the same time.<br/>Arielle: I don't know what I'm going to do about that. I'll just have to deal with the consequences of whatever decision I make.<br/>Arielle Free is hosting Glastonbury coverage on BBC iPlayer this weekend.<br/>Elton created a 'brand new show' for Glastonbury<br/>Glastonbury warning as highs of 27C possible<br/>The green energy powering Glastonbury Festival<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Sun cream: check. The next thing: what am I going to wear? <br/>With Glastonbury 2023 ready to start, festival season is well under way. <br/>The festival prides itself on being eco-conscious, but how do fans plan their outfits sustainably? <br/>Festival and concert fashion has become a huge part of event planning: a quick scroll on TikTok and you'll see cowboy hats and feather boas as the uniform for Beyonc\u00e9 and Harry Styles concerts.<br/>Jess Potter, 36, from Cardiff, will be going to Glastonbury with her online second-hand clothing business. <br/>At the festival she will be hosting the second-hand style awards, where festival-goers will be judged on their best sustainable looks from the weekend.<br/>Jess confesses she has not always been sustainable. During her first Glastonbury in 2014 she bought everything new, she used to be a \"retail addict\". That's where she met her now husband and business partner Davey, and they are now \"on a journey to sustainability together\".<br/>The idea for UsedandLoved.com - a search engine tool that allows you to search for second-hand items all under one roof - came from a sleepless night idea, said Jess. <br/>She said second-hand shopping was \"all about finding your own style\", and seeing content creators styling the outfits was key to changing people's attitudes on buying them.   <br/>In her spare time, Jess goes around Cardiff picking up bags of clothes that are left on the side of the road, which she sifts through and gives a new lease of life.<br/>\"I've found stuff from Ralph Lauren and Zara in them, all in really good condition,\" she said.<br/>She plans to put the clothes found on the streets of Cardiff on display at Glastonbury with the idea that \"they are free again and their destiny has been changed because they are going to get another life, and that clothes can live on for so long if you let them\".<br/>Bethany Lewis, from Swansea, planned her whole festival wardrobe via second hand shops and went on online clothes site Vinted for the In It Together festival in Margam, Neath Port Talbot. <br/>When she booked for In It Together, she was adamant she would not buy anything new.<br/>\"I've never done a festival in that kind of heat before so I kind of took all the  basics out of my wardrobe, so I mostly managed to use things I already owned,\" she said.<br/>\"But then, if I was looking for something specific, like I wanted like a mesh top to wear under an outfit so I went on Vinted, looking for stuff specifically.<br/>\"Rather than buying it new, I knew that I got it cheaper. I was also reducing my impact on the environment by buying it.\"<br/>Cost plays a part too, with tickets for festivals not cheap. <br/>A ticket to Glastonbury would set you back \u00a3335 this year - and that's without buying your camping essentials like tent, wellies and booze (if that's your thing) - so many people try to use second-hand sites to get their outfits. <br/>Caitlin Smith, a fashion blogger from Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taf, who's based in London, said: \"I don't tend to buy anything that doesn't work with at least five pieces in my wardrobe. So, if I'm looking for a festival 'fit, I'll only buy items that I know I'll wear again.<br/>\"I blame being a Capricorn for my frugality, so I don't like feeling like I've wasted money on something I'll wear once.\"<br/>\"I also tend to look for accessories or builder pieces that I can layer over things I already own. Accessorising and layering are such fun and easy ways to change up your look without having to buy a completely 'new' outfit.\"<br/>Rachel Cosgrove-Pearce, the head of retail operations for Oxfam, said shopping second-hand was a great way to express individuality. <br/>\"For the festival season, a lot of the (Oxfam) shops will pull together festival-style windows to help people choose their outfits for going. They'll have festival displays inside and the beauty of shopping second-hand with Oxfam is that you can be your own stylist.\"<br/>\"You can go in, you shop in a variety of brands, you're not being influenced around the latest trends, and you can literally go and choose the pieces and create your own look unique for you. <br/>\"Everyone is more conscious than ever now about sustainability and by shopping with Oxfam not only are you going to look fabulous, and you know you're going to feel fabulous.\"<br/>So that's the fashion advice. But what to do about the weather?<br/>With Glastonbury predicted to be a scorcher, the advice is to try and pack for the heat - and if it does rain, trusty wellies and a raincoat will always be in style. <br/>Love Island could change second-hand buying habits<br/>'Everyone' has to face fashion's climate impact<br/>Rise in sales of second-hand party outfits<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Beyonc\u00e9? Madonna?<br/>You wouldn't be wrong - but the word was coined long before our modern-day pop stars entered stage left.<br/>A new exhibition titled Diva at London's Victoria and Albert Museum is showcasing costumes, artefacts and images from a troupe of fabulous queens, beginning with opera singers and early silent film stars, and taking us through to today's A-list celebrities.<br/>The original diva, which means \"goddess\" in Latin, referred to opera's leading ladies, or prima donnas. Their success offered them an independence and agency that few women had at the time.<br/>Later, stars of stage and screen, such as avant garde dancer Isadora Duncan, used their bodies as a medium for expression, moving away from restrictive corsets to flowing gowns (pictured above). The white silk dress was designed by Mariano Fortuny and was inspired by Greek drapery.<br/>More exposure was offered to silent film's femme fatales with the growth of the movie industry in the early 20th Century. This image shows Theda Bara, one of cinema's early sex symbols, who starred in 1917's Cleopatra. Playing up her vamp persona, Bara's Cleopatra costume was risqu\u00e9 and revealing, combining a traditional Egyptian look with burlesque seduction.<br/>It's thought Bara designed her own costumes, perhaps inspired by her tailor father and wig-maker mother. The bulk of Bara's films were sadly lost in a fire at Fox Studios' vault in 1937. <br/>Later, Hollywood's golden era saw the likes of Mae West, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe take the spotlight. Monroe once responded to accusations of diva-ish behaviour by saying: \"People think that why I'm late is some kind of arrogance... I think it is the opposite of arrogance... I want to be prepared when I get there to give a good performance to the best of my ability.\"<br/>This 1967 Andy Warhol screenprint of the screen siren is on display, along with a black fringed dress from Some Like It Hot.<br/>Designed by Christian Dior, this dress was worn by double Oscar winner Vivien Leigh in 1958. There were allegations of so-called diva behaviour on the set of Gone With the Wind, but her co-star Olivia de Havilland defended her in 2006, saying: \"She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [her then husband, Laurence Olivier], who was in New York.\"<br/>Meanwhile, modern opera divas continued to perform and command worship across the globe, with Maria Callas's performances in works such Puccini's Tosca and Verdi's La Traviata becoming legendary in the arts world. The image above shows Callas as Violetta in the latter at the Royal Opera House in 1958, and is in the exhibition.<br/>Since the 1960s, an age of sexual liberation and political activism, modern divas have built on the definition of the term and reinvented it. Cher, Sir Elton John and Diana Ross are pictured here at the Rock Awards at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, California, in 1975.<br/>Cher's stage costumes are never understated. During a concert in Los Angeles in 2002, the singer told the crowd to rapturous applause: \"I have been a frickin' diva for 40 frickin' years!\" Cher's iridescent two-piece from the 1975 Rock Music Awards is pictured front left.<br/>Tina Turner, who died last month, is also honoured in the exhibition. Her famous flame dress, designed by Bob Mackie, is on display. He also designed a similar dress for Cher, while other stars including RuPaul and Beyonc\u00e9 have also gone on to wear versions of it.

The boss of Leeds and Reading Festivals has previously said he was concerned it could give people false confidence.<br/>Meg is a DJ who's worked on welfare teams at festivals with on-site drug testing and events without it.<br/>\"I've had some experiences before where I've been looking after 16-year-old girls who've taken way more than they thought they had,\" she says.<br/>\"Or that pill that they've taken is not exactly what they thought it was going to be. <br/>\"And it's really scary.\"<br/>Meg says these situations are \"massively reduced\" when there's testing on-site because it means more information is available.<br/>\"And then we know how to deal with it,\" she says.<br/>If the substance has been tested on-site the welfare teams will know if it's extra-strong or isn't what the person thought it was.<br/>\"Because there's plenty of times where that could happen and it can cause serious harm to the person who's taking the drug,\" says Meg.<br/>BBC Newsbeat asked the Home Office to respond to Sacha Lord's suggestion it had U-turned on back-of-house testing.<br/>\"Our position hasn't changed. Drug testing providers must have a licence to test for controlled drugs, including at festivals,\" a spokesperson said.<br/>\"We have consistently made this condition clear, and law enforcement have always had a responsibility to uphold this legal requirement.<br/>\"We have not received any applications for drug testing at the major festivals this summer. We continue to keep an open dialogue with any potential applicants.\"<br/>But Sacha says it's \"ridiculous\" to claim that nothing has changed, and the industry is considering taking legal action against the government.<br/>The Loop - which has provided most back-of-house testing at UK festivals - told Newsbeat it couldn't comment.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Parklife operation saw 33 arrests, police say<br/>'Festival drugs tests could have saved Georgia'<br/>'First' drug testing at UK festival<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These have included running five marathons in five days and cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats.<br/>The Yukon, which takes place in July, will see him kayak down the Yukon River from Whitehorse in Canada through the Arctic Circle to Dalton Highway Bridge in Alaska in the US. With only 10 days to complete the 1,000 mile race, 28 two-person crews will need to be able to survive in the wilderness - there are no support teams accompanying them, although their progress will be monitored. <br/>Ashley and his teammate, Gary Johnson - a personal trainer, hope to complete it in seven to eight days - which means they will need to cover 120-125 miles (193-201km) each day.<br/>\"That will involve 18 hours a day kayaking with one hour to change, pitch your tent and find a safe place to eat your food in case you're in wolf or grizzly bear territory,\" he says. \"Then five hours' sleep - if you can sleep - to start the day again.\"<br/>As well as the threat of bear and wolf attacks, challengers also face the risk of hypothermia if they fall into the turbulent waters. \"I'm willing to risk my life\", says Ashley.<br/>\"There's a lot of things that go against you out there,\" he says, \"especially as I'm going to be the least-experienced person by miles to have ever attempted it. I've only been kayaking since February.\"<br/>Known for his speed and power, Ashley says these long distance challenges that involve endurance don't suit him.<br/>He explains: \"I'm big, I'm stocky, it goes against me, but in hospital [with Azaylia] I realised that life is a battle of endurance.\" <br/>To make it through, all you can focus on is your next step he says - and in every challenge, Azaylia is the reason he keeps taking that next step.<br/>\"When I'm struggling, I look up to her and she gives me the strength that I need,\" he says.<br/>Ashley has written a memoir, which will be published on 22 June, about the relationship with his daughter, her fight for life and the struggles he has faced since she died.<br/>\"After Azaylia passed away and I spoke her eulogy, I found myself spiralling a little bit into alcohol,\" he says.<br/>\"When I woke up one morning, I was in tears because I felt ashamed, I felt embarrassed. I thought, 'If this is the person that my daughter's looking down on, I need to hang my head.'\"<br/>He says he could lie to his parents about whether he had drunk alcohol, but he could not lie to himself or Azaylia.<br/>\"That's when I knew I needed to be changed\u2026 I needed to keep the promises that I'm making, not only to me, but to her.\"<br/>With his ex-partner, Safiyya Vorajee, and the foundation they created in their daughter's name, Ashley is determined to fundraise and increase awareness of childhood cancer. He says it is an area of research that is severely underfunded.<br/>\"If there is no new research, it means there are no new cures, if there are no new cures, it means there are no better statistics,\" he says.<br/>No child should have to go through what his daughter experienced, Ashley says, adding she taught him how to be brave when life was frightening.<br/>The TV star says his Christian faith was tested throughout her illness, but he refuses to let Azaylia's short life be in vain.<br/>\"There has to be a reason why what happened, happened, and I'm not going to be that person that turns to stone as a result. I am going to be the hero of my story for her, for myself and for other people around me,\" he says.<br/>Working seven-day weeks and 18-hour days, Ashley describes his schedule as relentless. Currently single, he says it wouldn't be fair to start a new relationship because he is committed to the path he is on. For now, he also cannot see himself having another child.<br/>\"I find it hard to be able to imagine that I could love anyone or anything else as much as I love Azaylia,\" he explains.<br/>By pushing himself to the limits, Ashley says he is not running away from the pain of his loss, but running \"head on into it\". He wants to show others \"no matter how tough your struggle was, there is strength at the other side.\"<br/>He has chosen to go to the extremes, risking his life in challenges such as the Yukon 1000, because he wants to make the greatest impact for Azaylia.<br/>\"I will do something with that incredible and beautiful life and I will make her name live on for many more years.\"<br/>Strong: Life, loss and eternal love for my daughter, by Ashley Cain, is published on 22 June.<br/>If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It makes the audience feel part of an uncomfortable conversation.<br/>\"There's a woman, she's sitting on the edge of the bed, she's got my face but it's not my mouth, she's [doing a sexual act]\u2026 the woman's skin is a lot more tanned than mine would be, and this woman has exactly my tattoo. <br/>\"She's looking at some text... an invitation to humiliate the person in the picture, which is me.\"<br/>In the text, Helen is described as \"My blonde GF\", short for girlfriend, which becomes the title of the documentary.<br/>Morris tells the BBC she wanted to explore the impact the images had on Helen, including terrifying, graphic recurring nightmares and paranoia.<br/>In the film, Helen says she often feels as if \"people on the street somehow knew about the pictures, and they knew this horrible secret about me, which suddenly felt like my horrible secret\".<br/>This isn't the first time she has spoken about this though, and there have been other documentaries on deepfake porn, so how is Morris's film different? <br/>\"My film doesn't pay any attention to the perpetrator - I'm not interested in the headspace of the person that did it,\" the director says. \"My main goal was I want you to walk alongside Helen in this story. <br/>\"You are with her at every stage - when I met her she was still processing it, and trying to work it out. So the only way to get you to really feel it, is if you're alongside her the whole time.<br/>\"What struck me when I met Helen was that you can sexually violate somebody without coming into any physical contact with them. <br/>\"That's the thing that motivated me.\" <br/>The trauma of being used for deepfake porn is very real. Prof Clare McGlynn at Durham University, an expert in image-based sexual abuse, tells the BBC: \"The impact can be life-shattering and devastating. <br/>\"Many victims describe a form of 'social rupture', where their lives are divided between 'before' and 'after' the abuse, and the abuse affecting every aspect of their lives, professional, personal, economic, health, well-being.\"<br/>Helen says in the film: \"I did feel as if those were real images, and it's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen that with their own pictures, what is it really - they've done nothing to me. <br/>\"But they've planted all this stuff in my head, these pictures, I can't unsee any of the images. I can't even see the perfectly unaltered pictures in the same way either. <br/>\"I now look at that picture [an image of her in a dress] and if I saw it independently, I feel like it's a picture of an assault.\"<br/>Morris, whose documentary was made by Sheffield-based production company Tyke Films, talks about the impact of the images on Helen. <br/>\"The most disturbing aspect is that I don't think you can separate image from memory very easily, like photographs. You know, if you look back, you don't know if you remembered the moment or you remember the photograph of it. <br/>\"So what's happened to Helen is these images, which are attached to memories, have been reappropriated, and almost planted these fake, so-called fake, memories in her mind. And you can't measure that trauma, really.<br/>\"It's like being psychologically attacked by this, it's to do with the emotional attachment to the original image.\"<br/>Professor Erika Rackley, from Kent Law School, tells the BBC that a few years ago she and some colleagues interviewed victim survivors of image-based sexual abuse.<br/>\"One of them commented in the context of deepfakes that the picture was 'still a picture of you \u2026 it's still abuse',\" she says.<br/>A 2019 report by Sensity AI, a company that monitors deepfakes, found that 96% were non-consensual sexual images and, of those, 99% were of women.  <br/>Prof McGlynn agrees, saying: \"Women are far more likely to face this abuse, and it is mainly men perpetrating it. <br/>\"Society does not have a good record of taking crimes against women seriously, and this is also the case with deepfake porn. Online abuse is too often minimised and trivialised.\" <br/>Helen also speaks in My Blonde GF about the unimaginable worry of not knowing who created the images.<br/>\"In every single one of those pictures it's my eyes staring at the camera,\" she says. \"But through it all, this person, this profile creator, this image hoarder has no face.\"<br/>She was even more horrified when she found that police were unable to do anything to prosecute whoever had made the images. <br/>They told her there was nothing they could do, as no crime had been committed. It is not illegal to make deepfake images. <br/>The law in Scotland already allows police to investigate it, but current law in England and Wales does not. <br/>The forthcoming Online Safety Bill, which is currently being scrutinised in the House of Lords, is going to make sharing non-consensual deepfake porn images illegal. <br/>Prof McGlynn says the \"changes in the bill are long overdue,\" but for it to really be effective, \"it needs to name online violence against women and girls as a priority problem, and include measures to ensure internet platforms take these abuses seriously\". <br/>The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which is responsible for the bill, advised the BBC it is expected to become law this year. <br/>Morris concludes that she is \"trying to ask questions\" with her film, adding: \"I don't have solutions, but I really feel it's something we need to pay attention to\".<br/>She says the importance of documentaries cannot be under-estimated, adding: \"I think they give you a window into other people's lives.<br/>\"I feel like now, because of social media, we're so into our own experience, and how we represent ourselves.<br/>\"It's so important to think about how other people live and experience the world.\"<br/>Sharing pornographic deepfakes to be illegal<br/>Deepfaked: \u2018They put my face on a porn video\u2019<br/>Deepfake pornography could become an 'epidemic'<br/>'Deepfake porn images still give me nightmares'<br/>Bella Thorne fighting back on deepfake pornography<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

It was one day before the funeral.<br/>\"And there, in the sauna, my granny revealed my grandfather had actually betrayed her with another woman. <br/>\"She said how difficult it was... and she released all the emotions connected to that. It took hours. <br/>\"And then we went out - and there was peace.\"<br/>This is what we see over and over in the film, as the seasons change and the women keep returning to their \"safe space\".<br/>They talk about their relationships with their mothers, laugh about sex, and discuss how they feel about their bodies. <br/>One woman talks about the moment she came out as gay to her parents, while another expresses how it felt growing up in a culture that favoured boys.<br/>When something distressing comes up - there are some no holds-barred conversations about sexual assault and cancer - the women listen intently, absorbing all that is said.<br/>Emotions pour out, like the constantly flowing water of the sauna. <br/>The women sing and repeatedly chant their support: \"Take the pain away,\".<br/>Then we see them plunge afterwards into the icy pool dug into a frozen lake outside. <br/>It looks painful as they pad over the ice, naked except for socks, but they all look rejuvenated afterwards.<br/>\"All of us have stories inside,\" Hints says. \"As you sweat, first there is more [on the] surface and then there's dirt coming out - and it's the same with emotions.\"<br/>She talks about how \"all of us have those stories and deeper layers of experiences\".<br/>\"Something magical happens when you're there, naked in the darkness, with this community around you. And when you share something, nobody starts to teach. <br/>\"When you share, another listens, and that is a huge power. That is part of the healing itself.\"<br/>Hints also offers the audience at her film screening in Sheffield a new experience, just before it begins.<br/>She stands at the front and sings a traditional welcome, inviting us to join in: \"All your fears in cold water, All your shame in cold water, All your pain in cold water.\"<br/>This doesn't spark a huge singalong, but it does get a warm round of applause, and helps give an indication of the film to follow. <br/>Hints explains that in order to shoot the footage, the technical equipment had to be acclimatised.<br/>\"It's really a challenge,\" she explains.<br/>\"The average temperature was 80 degrees, and the average session lasts four hours, and then you go out and then you'll come back in.\"<br/>The camera lens had to be prepared in advance, by being put on the floor of the sauna two hours before filming started, to adjust to the heat.<br/>There was also a second lens outside, as the camera inside the sauna could not be used outdoors due to temperature difference.<br/>She says they had two lenses break during their seven years filming the documentary, which is perhaps not surprising.<br/>\"I had to, as director, not just hold the space in emotional terms, but also physically, checking that everyone is hydrated and we don't wait too long to go out,\" she adds. <br/>With the camera's focus so firmly on the women, Hints talks about how important it was for her how their bodies were filmed.<br/>She had a male cinematographer, and was at pains to avoid the film portraying the women in a sexualised way. <br/>\"So he's very sensitive, but in the beginning, when we were finding the language, there was a male gaze, and he was not aware of that,\" she says. <br/>\"It became a growth journey, of being aware that actually he is used to watching female bodies in a certain way. <br/>\"And then adjusting that, and starting to look beyond desire or judgement.\"<br/>Gayle Sequeira wrote in Film Companion that Hints achieved her goal, saying: \"The gaze isn't sexual, but empathetic. These bodies are the maps on which the history of these women's lives has been written.\" <br/>Variety's Jessica Kiang added that \"the small, smoky, steamy miracle of this film is how it creates something so intangible, so lyrical, from the absolutely elemental: Fire, wood, water and lots of naked female flesh\".<br/>Vox's Alissa Wilkinson called the film, which has a 100% rating on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, a \"gorgeously captured space, carved out away from the world of men\".<br/>Hints ends by telling another anecdote, about a woman who learned to feel positive about her body having seen the film.<br/>\"She wrote to me afterwards that she booked a photographer,\" she says. <br/>\"She had been so angry about her body throughout her life, she hated her body.<br/>\"And now, enough. <br/>\"She's just gonna do some beautiful pictures and accept her body the way it is.<br/>\"That was so nice.\"<br/>Will the UK warm to Finland's naked sauna diplomacy?<br/>Estonians convert old car into sauna<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But why do they mean so much to their fans?<br/>For Beth, it's not just her love life that BTS have helped her out with, but also her mental health.<br/>Over the past 10 years, the group have been commended for covering themes related to mental health in their songs, and Beth says one particular tune called Reflection connected with her. <br/>\"I remember just sitting in my room and looking at the lyrics, just crying while I was listening to it because it made me feel seen and so heard.\"<br/>Even though the group are singing in a foreign language, Beth still finds the messages about \"self-love\" and \"taking care of yourself\" incredibly powerful.<br/>BTS are often credited with being one of the factors for Korean culture becoming popular around the world.<br/>They've previously been named as the world's best-selling artists beating the likes of Taylor Swift and Adele, and were the first Korean act to score a chart-topping album in the UK.<br/>Jenny Sheehan, who now has her own YouTube channel dedicated to K-pop, praises the group \"for opening up my world to music that's not in English\".<br/>\"The music videos have subtitles so you can see what they're saying and it's usually so deep and there are so many cultural references in there.\"<br/>It's not just the music style that Jenny thinks is different, but the way they interact with fans.<br/>\"They do so much for their fans, [things] that maybe I haven't seen from Western artists.

They were using it [only] for album updates and links to videos.\"<br/>Members of the band often used these conversations and live streams to open up about their own struggles and vulnerabilities, creating a connection with fans.<br/>\"BTS were right in there, just chatting. You could get replies so it really felt like there wasn't that wall that K-pop used to have.\"<br/>Taylor thinks that BTS' success has \"opened the door\" for other Korean artists and made the K-pop world global.<br/>Groups like Blackpink have played at Coachella and are due to play in London this summer, while Red Velvet have been booked for a European tour.<br/>\"This is something very few K-pop idols could do prior to BTS.\"<br/>Though the group isn't making music right now, fans such as Mel James, currently based in Seoul, have been going all out in the past week to celebrate the birthday.<br/>The 26-year-old English teacher says the scenes of purple in the city, representing the band's colour, is \"amazing to see\".<br/>\"There are shows everywhere and Banpo Bridge which is in over the Han River is purple with fountain shows.<br/>\"There are deals going on in supermarkets.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that.

We can have amazing conversations. It's almost like a little book club,\" he says.<br/>A long-time scary movie fan, Sammy said it was a logical jump to streaming scary games.<br/>He started with first-person shooter Doom, and things have built up from there.<br/>\"At the beginning I was very much like 'most people aren't going to watch this. It's a bit niche',\" he says.<br/>\"But the more you do it, the more you realise there's a massive community out there that enjoy watching people be terrified.<br/>\"I think emotionally it's an exciting experience, especially with streaming because you get to share it with other people as well.\" <br/>That's something Shani, known as Lilzesst on Twitch, agrees with. <br/>\"I'm a jumpy person.

You'll know in your heart when it's good.\"<br/>\"We try to be good first time,\" smiles singer Cristal Ramirez.<br/>The US quartet are recording their first ever session for BBC Radio 1, who've made their single, Always Get This Way, the station's tune of the week.<br/>There are a couple of false starts: A drum sample isn't firing and an autotune effect is misbehaving. Guitarist Katie Henderson commandeers a laptop from their sound engineer, swipes through two dozen menus and recalibrates the backing track. <br/>\"Autotune's hella scary when it goes wrong,\" she observes. <br/>But once they rip into their three-song set, there's no stopping them. Even when Cristal \"chokes on my own spit\" during the final chorus of Always Get This Way.<br/>Spirits are justifiably high: A couple of hours ago, they released their third album, I've Loved You For So Long, and the reviews are trickling in.<br/>\"Seven out of 10 from The Line Of Best Fit,\" announces their PR. \"Eight out of 10 from Clash.\"<br/>This prompts a brief, animated discussion about how publications arrive at their scores; and whether a seven is positive or merely average.<br/>\"In the end, I don't really care about reviews,\" concludes Cristal. \"But I want a 10.\"<br/>The release couldn't be any more different to their last record, Under My Influence, which dropped a couple of weeks into the first lockdown in 2020. <br/>At the time, the band were still confident they'd get to play those songs live when summer rolled around.<br/>\"We really were in denial for a while,\" laughs bassist McKenna Petty. \"We thought it would all be over soon.\"<br/>Instead, their plans were ripped out of their hands. The album was left in limbo. The pressure to build on the buzz surrounding their debut vanished, leaving bigger questions about their future. <br/>\"We were kind of mourning our career, not sure how that was gonna go,\" says Alisa Ramirez, the band's drummer and Cristal's younger sister. \"We went into a really dark place.\"<br/>Cristal started having panic attacks, knocking on her sister's door every night at 3am. Alisa would try to comfort her, making her oatmeal and talking her back to sleep.<br/>But her anxiety had deeper roots than the pandemic.<br/>All four Aces were brought up in Provo, a deeply religious town in the US state of Utah, about 45 minutes away from the headquarters of the Mormon church.<br/>\"If you're not familiar with Mormonism, it's just intense Christianity, really,\" says Cristal. \"But it's a way of life in Utah. It's the world you live in. We didn't know people that weren't Mormon in high school.\"<br/>The sisters, who were \"tomboys from the time we were little kids\", were \"constantly reminded we don't fit in,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"The culture is super homophobic, super patriarchal,\" agrees McKenna. \"There's a blueprint you're supposed to follow, as women especially, of getting married young, having a family, not having a career. <br/>\"Just for some context, Utah has the highest suicide rate among LGBTQ youth in the whole country. So it's a really big issue, how they isolate queer youth, especially.\"<br/>Cristal had her first crush on another girl in kindergarten but she squashed her feelings, believing they were sinful. She tried praying to be straight and dated boys in high school before coming out to her sister at the age of 18. <br/>Alisa didn't bat an eyelid before replying, \"Oh, same.\"<br/>As soon as they could, they disavowed Mormonism and fled Utah for Los Angeles. But though their bandmates supported them, they were still tied to the church.<br/>So when, in 2016. the sisters presented the band with a song called Loving Is Bible - a \"grand declaration\" that God is tolerant of all sexualities - it caused a certain amount of internal friction.<br/>\"That song almost didn't come out because it was really upsetting to Kenna and Katie,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"The church conditions you to be scared because your salvation is on the line,\" McKenna explains. \"I was really scared of what other people would think.\"<br/>Five years later, things have changed. Katie has also come out as queer and left the church. McKenna, the band's only straight member, also stepped away from Mormonism despite getting married in the LDS Temple in 2019.<br/>\"I really didn't have a good experience there [at the temple]. That was kind of the catalyst of me leaving.<br/>\"But my biggest issue was when the girls came out to me. I was like, 'This feels real and what the church is teaching doesn't. There's something wrong with the church.'\"<br/>I've Loved You For So Long is the first album The Aces have recorded where they're all on the same page. But it was only possible after the solitude of the pandemic forced them to confront their past.<br/>\"As sisters, it started clicking that we'd spent the last six years running away from our hometown and trying to not be associated with our upbringing,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"We were ashamed about it and embarrassed about it. It deeply affected our mental state and and it's still affecting us to this day.\"<br/>At first, Cristal was reluctant to share those feelings in her lyrics. <br/>\"I was like, 'I don't want to talk about that'. I want to go to studio and not talk about it because that's my whole existence, all the time, and it's miserable.\"<br/>The breakthrough came when they were working on, of all things, a sexually-charged pop song about lust at first sight. Originally called Don't Speak, Alisa texted her sister, suggesting she change the lyrics to \"don't freak\" and making it about her panic attacks.<br/>\"I was like, 'Wait, that's actually really cool',\" says the 27-year-old. \"And it opened up these big conversations about mental health and anxiety and identity.\"<br/>Don't Freak came out as a standalone single in 2021, but its confessional approach reverberates throughout The Aces' new album.<br/>\"Everything I love / I'm told I shouldn't touch / Cause good girls love Jesus / Not that girl from Phoenix,\" sings Cristal, reliving her childhood with justifiable anger on the punky Suburban Blues.<br/>I Always Get This Way was written as Cristal's mental health unravelled, addressing her guilt at \"falling apart\", and the way it affects her relationships.<br/>But the album ends with the gorgeously catchy jangle-pop of Younger, where the singer tells her 14-year-old self: \"I wouldn't change anything.\"<br/>\"When I was 14, I was in so much pain about my identity, about what my life was going to look like, but all I needed was someone to say 'You're okay and you're gonna figure it out',\" she says.<br/>United by their experiences, the band tear into their new songs with a fresh musical ferocity. <br/>The spiky guitars on Girls Make Me Wanna Die are a direct callback to their beginnings, playing Paramore covers in a neighbour's garage before they were even teenagers. Other tracks draw on The Cure and Depeche Mode, who they'd hear around the house growing up.<br/>Katie, the most reserved in conversation, is the band's musical backbone, playing funky, staccato guitar riffs on the poppy title track, and shimmering shoegazy lines on the more introspective Person.<br/>\"That's really what elevated our band, was when we added Katie,\" says McKenna. \"That's when everything got better.\"<br/>\"It's just so cool to watch her chase sounds, chase tones,\" agrees Cristal. \"She's such an amazing musician that we're always just like, 'Yeah, let's throw solo in there. She'll make the song better.'\"<br/>Unsure how to handle the praise, Katie whispers to herself: \"What is even happening?\"<br/>That camaraderie, that mutual love, is what makes The Aces unique. <br/>Most bands push their lead singer to the foreground, and Cristal could certainly dominate if she wanted to, but The Aces are a gang. <br/>At Maida Vale, they move as a pack, trading goofy jokes and dancing to their own songs, having previously forced their Uber driver to play the new album at full blast on the way over. (\"We'd better get a five-star passenger rating,\" laughs Cristal).<br/>\"It's scary to think where I'd be without this band,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"What brought us together was that intrinsic feeling of not belonging, and wanting to create something where we could hang out together and feel like we did belong.\"<br/>\"It's just been this incredible support system for our entire lives,\" agrees her sister. <br/>\"People ask us, 'How did you not break up?' and, to me, that's the craziest question because it didn't even feel like an option. <br/>\"It was just like, 'We are The Aces. We were born to do this.'\"<br/>The Aces: 'We were told not to sing about girls'<br/>The Aces: 'Not all girl bands are the same'<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

with death rates below historical averages. <br/>In the third year, death rates rose in many countries as they opened up again.<br/>Some of the largest rebounds we found were in countries like Germany, New Zealand and Norway, who had fared better in the first two years of the pandemic (and well overall). <br/>Norway had far fewer deaths than Sweden in the first year of the pandemic but over the three years the two countries look more similar. <br/>It is hard to read straight across from Scandinavian countries to the UK, cautions Prof Sridhar, arguing \"we'd never look like either Sweden or Norway\", and describing them as \"healthier, wealthier and more equal\" countries that are very different to the UK.  <br/>It would take many inquiries to tease apart the effect of all the possible reasons behind every nation's pandemic outcomes: preparedness, population health, lockdown timing and severity, social support, vaccine rollout and health care provision and others. <br/>But some argue that there are lessons for the UK that need to be learned even before we think about future pandemics. <br/>The UK's heavy pandemic death toll \"built on a decade of lacklustre performance on life expectancy\" says Veena Raleigh, of the King's Fund, a health think tank. She argues that government action to improve population health and turn that around has \"never been more urgent\".<br/>We collected data on deaths in five-year age groups and population estimates/projections from Eurostat, the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland, the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency, the Centre for Disease Control, United States Census Bureau and Stats NZ. <br/>We calculated the death rate in each age group and combined them to form an age-adjusted death rate using the 2013 European Standard Population. <br/>Some nations did not have the full set of age bands. For example, US figures used 10-year age bands between five and 24 and above 55.

He was so ashamed.\"<br/>Ms Gordon-Smith is angry that the whole family were not informed of his diagnosis and that he was not given adequate information about the impact it would have on his health. <br/>She accused the UK government of pursuing a policy of \"deny, delay and death\" in relation to the infected blood scandal. <br/>And she said he was shown \"disregard\" by the state when he was dying.<br/>Ms Gordon-Smith, who lives in Edinburgh, says compensation would provide an acknowledgement of \"what they did to our family\" as his daughters cared for him when he was dying.  <br/>\"I think the government needs to get their chequebook out, do the right thing and pay [the compensation],\" she added. \"Not when the inquiry rules, but now.\"<br/>\"We lost our dad two years before he actually died because he was so impacted by the palliative care drugs. <br/>\"The distress this has caused myself and all my sisters has made it difficult for us as a family.\"<br/>She said the palliative care drugs \"tortured him to death\".<br/>\"I think it is a disgrace that they didn't provide proper palliative care for our dad, that they abandoned my sisters and I to take care of him and provide 24 hour care for two years. <br/>\"That we had to deal with suicide attempts, that we had to face all that without any support from the government.\"<br/>Meanwhile, a director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) has privately admitted that the lives of people like Mr Gordon-Smith could have been saved at a relatively low cost. <br/>In an email obtained by campaign group Factor 8, Prof Marc Turner makes the admission to a colleague in the weeks after the infected blood inquiry chair called for compensation scheme to be widened. <br/>The email said: \"It would have been better to spend a few thousands of \u00a3s to reduce transmissions than a few billions of compensate people after that fact (in my opinion). <br/>\"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"<br/>Jason Evans, director of Factor 8, said Prof Turner's statement was true but he should make it publicly and address those people who have been affected. <br/>\"That the kind of thing that people who have been so badly harmed, people whose loved ones have been killed, have waited a long time to hear. I just wish those statements were made publicly. <br/>\"It also confirms what many of us have suspected for a long time that this scandal - contrary to the government and public authority lines for many years - was preventable it was avoidable. <br/>\"At the end of the day it came down to money. Those in authority didn't invest the money or resource to stop this from happening. As a result people died and there's a price to be paid for that.\"<br/>NHS National Services Scotland said the comment was a personal opinion of a SNBTS director who was not invited to give a personal witness statement to the inquiry. <br/>A spokesperson said: \"The impact of transfusion-transmitted infections on patients, as well as their families and friends, cannot be understated and we recognise that there have been instances in the past where SNBTS could have performed better. <br/>\"We deeply regret these shortcomings and have explicitly accepted responsibility and apologised for them in our written and oral submissions to the inquiry.\"<br/>They said they would carefully consider the recommendation of Sir Brian Langstaff when the infected blood inquiry's final report is published in the autumn. <br/>A spokesman for the UK government said: \"The government accepts the moral case for compensation and work is ongoing at pace and in consultation with the devolved administrations to consider the recommendations put forward in the inquiry's second interim report.\"<br/>A debate on the infected blood inquiry is due to take place in the House of Commons later. <br/>Parents and children 'should get blood payout'<br/>Infected blood victims receive payouts next week<br/>Infected blood: Money can't quantify the suffering<br/>Infected blood victims get \u00a3100,000 compensation<br/>Infected Blood Inquiry<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

and asked for the protocol to be changed.<br/>He added that he didn't feel comfortable that someone \"a long way from front line\" could make such a decision, which would be better made by people closer to the situation on the ground, he added. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose -

The state meanwhile called four expert witnesses who questioned the safety of such treatment and the reliability of research on gender dysphoria, as well as two adults who had \"de-transitioned\".<br/>In his ruling, Judge Moody wrote that the state had \"failed to provide sufficient evidence that the banned treatments are ineffective or experimental\", while plaintiffs had shown that the care \"can relieve the clinically significant distress associated with gender dysphoria in adolescents\".<br/>He said banning hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery for anyone under 18 violated the rights of transgender children and their families under the US Constitution.<br/>Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said the state would appeal, adding: \"There is no scientific evidence that any child will benefit from these procedures, while the consequences are harmful and often permanent.\" <br/>Arkansas Republicans brought in the law in April 2021, overriding a veto by then-Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who criticised it as a \"vast government overreach\".<br/>Supporters of the bill argued it was necessary to regulate medical decisions with \"harmful and often permanent\" consequences for young people.<br/>Non-profit group the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the law on behalf of four transgender teenagers, their families and two doctors.<br/>One plaintiff, 17-year-old Dylan Brandt, who testified at the trial, said he was \"so grateful\" to the judge.<br/>\"My mom and I wanted to fight this law not just to protect my healthcare, but also to ensure that transgender people like me can safely and fully live our truths,\" he said.<br/>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she would challenge the ruling through an appeal.<br/>\"This is not 'care' - it's activists pushing a political agenda at the expense of our kids and subjecting them to permanent and harmful procedures,\" she wrote on Twitter.<br/>\"Only in the far-Left's woke vision of America is it not appropriate to protect children.\"<br/>Tuesday's court ruling may set the precedent for the ACLU to challenge seven other state bans on hormonal or surgical treatments for transgender minors.<br/>Enforcement of similar laws in Alabama, Florida and Indiana has also been blocked in federal courts.<br/>\"We hope that this sends a message to other states about the vulnerability of these laws and the many harms that come from passing them,\" said Chase Strangio, the ACLU's deputy director for transgender justice.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Researchers say males have a higher suicide risk than females, suggesting mental health issues manifest in different ways.<br/>The charity YoungMinds says it is hearing more often about complex mental health cases where young people develop an eating disorder and experience other mental health issues, but are unable to find support when they need it.<br/>Severe delays \"can put them at risk of getting worse and reaching crisis before they get any help\", said Olly Parker, head of external affairs.<br/>The research, which was supported by mental health research charity The McPin Foundation, is published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health. <br/>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said they recognised \"the devastating impact eating disorders can have on an individual and [their] family's life\". <br/>The government says it will invest an additional \u00a32.3 billion a year in NHS mental health services by March 2024, alongside \u00a354m a year to increase capacity at children and young people's community eating disorder services.<br/>If you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.<br/>Self-harm hospital admissions up 22% for children<br/>Quarter of 17-19-year-olds may have mental disorder<br/>Huge leap in children in mental health crisis<br/>What are eating disorders? - NHS<br/>The UK's Eating Disorder Charity - Beat<br/>YoungMinds - Mental Health Charity For Children And Young People - YoungMinds<br/>The McPin Foundation<br/>The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health Home Page<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

There are lots of treatable reasons, but for about one in four couples it may not be possible to find a cause.<br/>Fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), are not always free on the NHS. <br/>One cycle of IVF treatment may cost up to \u00a35,000 or more.<br/>Shema Tariq, from London, was diagnosed with \"low ovarian reserve\", meaning she had fewer remaining eggs, and told her chances of conceiving without IVF were almost zero.  <br/>It took six rounds of IVF to conceive her son, who was born in 2018.  <br/>\"My GP briefly mentioned contraception to me after he was born - but we both laughed and agreed that it wasn't relevant,\" Shema says.<br/>\"It never occurred to me that I might get pregnant, despite being a sexual-health doctor. <br/>\"I was 43 and had been told that my chances of conceiving naturally were less than 1%. <br/>\"Eight months later, I was unexpectedly, and naturally, pregnant with our daughter.  <br/>\"She has been the most wonderful surprise - but when we first found out, I felt overwhelmed and unprepared for another pregnancy.  <br/>\"If I'd known that one in five women conceives naturally after IVF, I'd have used contraception until I was ready both emotionally and physically.\"<br/>Lead author of the new research, published in the journal Human Reproduction, Dr Annette Thwaites, from University College London, said: \"Our findings suggest that natural pregnancy after having a baby by IVF is far from rare. <br/>\"This is in contrast with widely held views - by women and health professionals - and those commonly expressed in the media, that it is a highly unlikely event.\"<br/>The 11 international studies her team looked at found at least one in five women conceived naturally after having had a baby using fertility treatment, mostly within three years.

And it was more than a decade before she would stand outside the US Supreme Court to announce to her triumphant supporters that the nationwide right to abortion had been undone. <br/>But back then, in 2008, the SFLA headquarters were in Arlington, Virginia, and the closest town where Hawkins and her husband could afford to buy a house was 90 minutes away.<br/>At first, she tried the commute, leaving home at 5am and returning at 8pm. But the drives became too much, gas too expensive. <br/>So she bought a cheap loveseat from Ikea, figuring she could put in 30 hours of work over two days before driving home for a night. She used a nearby Gold's Gym for showers, the new couch for naps. When Hawkins found the office was also inhabited by cockroaches, she bought an eye mask and started sleeping with the lights on to keep them away. <br/>\"It was terrible, terrible,\" her husband Jonathan said of that period, which was just two years into their marriage.<br/>But Kristan Hawkins was relentless. And she had a job to do, she was going to see the end of Roe v Wade, overturning the national right to abortion that had been protected for nearly half a century.<br/>Last June, she was successful. Pro-choice advocates say that her activism since then has already helped cut off abortion access for around 20 million women, and pushed the country into a public health crisis. <br/>But Hawkins has a new, more ambitious goal: she wants to make abortion unthinkable and unavailable across the US. <br/>In the year after Roe was overturned, Hawkins has gone into overdrive, growing the size and reach of SFLA and using that power to push state legislatures to pass increasingly severe bans.<br/>\"That's the momentum thing, right? Like, ok, all of America is watching, push the gas pedal down on everything, right now,\" she said. \"More, more, more, more, more.\" <br/>Hawkins, now 38, is bolder and more unyielding than her predecessors, reflective of a new generation of activists moving towards their ultimate goal: a federal abortion ban, beginning at conception. <br/>\"She's representative of the rightward shift in the movement\u2026 and how far the movement can go,\" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a leading expert on the US abortion debate. \"Kristan is really important to understanding what comes next.\"<br/>Hawkins' plans are at odds with public opinion - a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion - and even some Republicans say she is going too far, too fast. <br/>But Roe's reversal, too, was once considered a longshot. And now, one year after its demise, Hawkins believes she will lead the anti-abortion movement to another improbable win. <br/>Most anti-abortion advocates have an origin story, a moment they say set them on a pro-life mission. <br/>Kristan Hawkins' moment came when she was 15. At home in West Virginia, she started volunteering at a crisis pregnancy centre, the type of facility that dissuades women from having abortions by providing pro-life counselling, ultrasounds and material supplies like diapers and wipes.<br/>Before she was allowed to start work, Hawkins had to learn what abortion was, to understand what it looked like. Someone at the clinic gave her a VHS tape of the Silent Scream, a controversial 1984 anti-abortion propaganda film that purported to show a foetus on ultrasound experiencing distress during an abortion at 12 weeks. The film, denounced as a fraud by abortion rights activists, runs counter to findings from leading scientists who say a foetus does not have the capacity to feel pain until at least 24 weeks gestation.<br/>But Hawkins was horrified. She was also incredulous. In her view, she had just encountered the greatest human rights atrocity of our time: the routine killing of \"preborn babies\" - the term she uses to describe foetuses. So why wasn't everyone trying to stop it?<br/>\"I remember that first day at the pregnancy centre, walking out and saying 'Oh my God, how is life going on as normal when this is happening?'\" she said during an interview in May. \"That changed everything.\" <br/>After a summer at the clinic, Hawkins started a community anti-abortion group called Teens for Life. She joined the local Right to Life chapter, she joined the local Republican chapter. \"I was the youngest one there by like four decades,\" she said. <br/>By 2006, after college graduation and short stints at the Republican National Committee and the Department of Health and Human Services, Hawkins was recruited to run Students for Life, then a fledgling organisation with groups on 180 campuses. She was 21. <br/>Seventeen years later, Hawkins remains obsessive, prone to sending colleagues texts and emails at all hours. Her daily schedule, typed into her iPhone, is a nightmare, more than two dozen meetings and commitments blocked off in overlapping intervals. Her days are, occasionally, interrupted by calls from a health coach. \"They're trying to get me to drink water,\" she said. \"I always joke that Students for Life is built on Diet Mountain Dew.\"<br/>She and Jonathan live in an RV with their four children so the entire family can join her on her frequent SFLA excursions. Jonathan, a former teacher, provides homeschooling.<br/>\"I just go with the flow, that's all you can do,\" Jonathan said during a family outing at the Pittsburgh Zoo last month. <br/>\"I think you're sick of the word abortion,\" Kristan said to him later that day. \"When I say it sometimes, I swear I can see you twitch.\"<br/>Watching her with followers and donors, Hawkins is sarcastic and often turns to humour, a sometimes unexpected habit from a woman pushing to outlaw abortion entirely. She also swears a lot and fidgets when she talks. She doesn't have friends, she said, \"in the traditional sense\". <br/>\"Like, I don't have girlfriends I go for brunch with\u2026 what would I talk about besides ending abortion?\" <br/>Hawkins' mission, born that day at the pregnancy centre, has proven to be all consuming, something she is well aware of. She has tried to teach her team the principle of DBW - Don't Be Weird - which is code for: don't freak people out.<br/>\"You have to know when to display your passion,\" she said. \"If you carry around a pocketbook of graphic images of children who've been aborted and whip that out at the dinner table, some people are going to be pretty mad at you.\" <br/>On a swampy June day in Washington, between clusters of teenagers on school trips and tour groups in matching t-shirts, six Students for Life members made their way to Capitol Hill, ready to lobby. <br/>They all wore red, half in SFLA branded clothing - \"The Pro-Life Generation VOTES\" emblazoned on their chests like a cheery warning. One wore a pair of dangly earrings, tiny gold feet meant to match the size of a foetus's foot at 12 weeks. \"It's a picture into their humanity,\" she said. <br/>Groups like this can be found at state legislatures and on college campuses across the US on any given week. Under Hawkins, SFLA has grown into more than 1,400 campus groups in 50 states, overseen by 80 paid staff. Since 2006, more than 160,000 anti-abortion activists have completed SFLA training. Experts say Hawkins' particular power lies in her ability to get people to turn out - SFLA activists are now staples at anti-abortion demonstrations across the country. <br/>\"We launched SFLA to be this post-Roe generation,\" she said. \"We were going to have that trained army.\" <br/>And after Roe's reversal last year, that army has mobilised, helping to steer dozens of anti-abortion bills through state legislatures. So far, 13 Republican-controlled states have outlawed abortion. Bans in at least six other states are in limbo pending legal challenges. <br/>Nearly one-third of American women of reproductive age now live in states where abortion is unavailable or severely restricted, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group. Over the past year, stories have emerged about the apparent consequences of these bans - a 10-year-old rape victim denied an abortion in her home state of Ohio, 13 women in Texas who say they were denied abortions despite life-threatening pregnancy complications - further galvanising support for abortion access.<br/>\"What SFLA and other anti-abortion groups promote is the worst, most damaging, most criminalising policy,\" said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice-president at NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"She [Kristan] is the embodiment of the extremeness of the movement.\" <br/>\"You're making it unsafe to be pregnant in the United States,\" she said. <br/>But where the anti-abortion movement goes now that Roe has been overturned is a matter of debate.  <br/>Hawkins and most other leaders still share a unifying philosophy: a foetus is a rights-holding person. They share an objective too: a federal abortion ban. But there is disagreement on what that ban would look like and how, exactly, to get there.<br/>\"The movement is really fragmented,\" said University of California's Mary Ziegler. \"There is no consensus.\" <br/>SFLA has pushed what they call an \"early abortion model\", drafting and championing legislation that bans abortion at conception or, at the latest, after early cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy. <br/>Hawkins' organisation, in other words, has abandoned the incrementalism that shaped earlier iterations of the anti-abortion movement, a strategy still favoured by some of SFLA's peers. <br/>Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America (SBA) is one such group. A powerful and long-established presence in the anti-abortion lobby, SBA's leader Marjorie Dannenfelser has said she will oppose any presidential candidate who does not embrace a 15-week national ban, a benchmark supported by 44% of Americans, according to a recent poll.<br/>That isn't good enough for Hawkins. Candidates must pledge support for a federal ban at six weeks if they want SFLA's support. <br/>It's a tension Hawkins acknowledges. \"Marjorie is the insider\u2026and I'm the person who comes in and is like, '[Screw] it, we're just doing what we know is right',\" Hawkins said, using an expletive. \"We're not fighting.\"<br/>Hawkins is also more outspoken, more outwardly conservative, on other abortion-related issues. She opposes exceptions for rape and incest. And she opposes several forms of birth control, including oral contraceptives, a position another anti-abortion leader privately called \"unhelpful\". <br/>\"What has changed is they are willing to say the quiet part out loud,\" said Elisabeth Smith, state policy director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a pro-choice group. \"They are willing to be publicly extreme.\" <br/>Hawkins' uncompromising approach worries some Republicans, too. Politicians have been forced to choose between disappointing Hawkins and her allies and alienating a much more moderate electorate. <br/>\"Republicans are politically in a much more defensive position than the Democrats because they keep talking about restrictions that are not supported by most Americans,\" said John Feehery, a former Republican congressional aide. <br/>A predicted red wave at the 2022 midterms seemed to collide with a surge of support for abortion rights, carrying Democrats to unexpected victories in a series of high-profile races. Last year, pro-choice voters swept all six abortion-related ballot measures, including in conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky. <br/>\"Women are watching Republicans post-Roe, and anything short of a compassionate strategy to win back suburban women and swing voters will severely set back the pro-life movement and the party as a whole,\" Nancy Mace, one of the few House Republicans who has publicly called for more flexibility on abortion, told the BBC in a statement. <br/>But Hawkins does not see the Republican party as her problem. She has little patience for politicians she deems insufficiently pro-life, threatening primary challenges against Republicans who do not support early bans. <br/>Merv Riepe, a Nebraska state senator who voted against a six-week ban this year, \"is going to be retired pretty soon\", Hawkins said. <br/>The three female Republican senators in South Carolina who opposed an outright ban face the same threat. Two supported a six-week ban, but that was not sufficient for Hawkins. Each of them was sent a plastic infant-size spine from SFLA earlier this year, with a note suggesting they grow a backbone.<br/>\"I think that's the difference between us and other pro-life organisations,\" Hawkins said. \"I don't really care if so-and-so in Washington, DC, isn't happy with me. It doesn't even earn me any points in my demographic.\"<br/>That approach - aggressive, uncompromising - has fuelled her dominance among anti-abortion activists, now lurching to the right in the absence of Roe. <br/>\"The movement as a whole is moving towards asking for more extreme bans,\" said Zelly Martin, a researcher at University of Texas' propaganda lab, who specialises in the US abortion debate. \"They feel like now that we don't have Roe protecting abortion why would we pull back? And I think Kristan Hawkins is a big part of that.\"  <br/>Just how far Hawkins will get - how close to abolishing abortion she will come - remains an open question. <br/>\"I don't see a point in American history where Americans are going to want an absolute ban on abortion,\" Ziegler said. \"There is no sign of that.\"<br/>But Hawkins and others are exploring ways to bypass both public opinion and political resistance, Zieger said. One, perhaps the most feasible, would be to ask the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to recognise foetal personhood under the Constitution. <br/>It seems improbable, but those are odds Hawkins is used to. <br/>Last month, in Northville, Michigan, Hawkins stood in a small first-floor conference room, neat rows of potential donors sitting in front of her. She began her speech with an anecdote from early in her career. <br/>A pro-life mentor had offered Hawkins some unsolicited advice: stop saying \"when\" Roe v Wade is overturned. By assuming Roe's demise, he cautioned, she sounded \"too immature, too naive\". <br/>Hawkins ignored him. She told her staff to double down, boost their messaging that promised to send Roe to the \"ash heap of history\". <br/>\"I always tell our team: winners envision the win.\" <br/>Thousands gather for first post-Roe March for Life<br/>How abortion became 'winning issue' in US election<br/>US Supreme Court preserves abortion drug access<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

She's sitting in the back of court,\" Mr Johnson said.<br/>Focusing on specific babies in the case, Mr Johnson later asked the jury to consider the evidence of the mother of Child E. <br/>She told the court in November last year that she went to feed her son, who subsequently died, on the night of 3 August 2015. <br/>Child E's mother said she heard her son making \"horrendous\" sounds when she arrived on the neonatal unit and found him with blood around his mouth.<br/>She told the court that she saw Ms Letby stood near a work station on the unit and when she alerted her to the blood, she was told it was due to a feeding tube. <br/>Ms Letby in her evidence denied having this interaction and said no blood was sighted in Child E's mouth before 22:00 that night. <br/>\"Have [the parents] made that up, to get at Lucy Letby? Are they in on it? Are they a sub-gang of two?\" Mr Johnson asked. <br/>Mr Johnson said this was \"a head on credibility contest\" and either Child E's mother was \"lying\" or Ms Letby was \"lying\". <br/>He said of the mother's account: \"It's powerful evidence - independent of the medical evidence - that Lucy Letby murdered [Child E]\". <br/>The trial continues.<br/>Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Fertility can be triggering and it doesn't always end in happiness. I tried to be sensitive but I wasn't prepared for some people to be so cruel.\"<br/>Vicky, who found fame on the reality show Geordie Shore in her native Newcastle, had to take a break from social media.<br/>\"People were saying 'why don't you just have a baby now you've got a boyfriend?' It is so toxic and outdated. I know so many people who had children with the wrong men because they were scared that they were running out of time.<br/>\"Why aren't we celebrating women who say 'this isn't the right time and I want to give my future children the best start in life'? It is so important we all know there are many different routes to motherhood.\"<br/>Breaking down in tears, she recalls the message that made her realise she had made the right decision to be so open.<br/>\"This woman said 'none of my friends have gone through this and I was feeling scared and alone and I hated the injections but every night after I had done it I came on social media to see if you had done yours'. <br/>\"It made her feel less alone and I thought 'I am in a very small way providing people with some comfort'.\"<br/>The author and podcaster won I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2015 and appeared on Loose Women shortly after, declaring that she did not want children.<br/>\"I've never been a maternal person, I've always been very career focussed,\" she explains. \"I kept waiting for this moment that I would have this burning desire to have children, but it never really came. <br/>\"The older I got, the more scared I became that it would kick in at an age when my body wasn't able to have children naturally.\"<br/>Vicky started looking into the process of egg freezing in her early 30s, after finding herself single again. Then she met her fianc\u00e9 Ercan Ramadan and \"became really happy\".<br/>\"I started to want things that I had never wanted before, like a house rather than a flat in London and dogs and a slower pace of life and wanting children came on my radar.<br/>\"But, even though I'm in a happy relationship, it is still in its infancy and Ercan is younger than me, he's not ready either. It was a mutual decision. We are in love but we don't want that pressure.\"<br/>An egg-freezing cycle involves taking drugs to boost your production of eggs, which are later collected while you are under general anaesthetic or sedation, and frozen for future use.<br/>Egg freezing has increased tenfold in the past decade in the UK, from just under 230 treatment cycles in 2009, to almost 2,400 in 2019.<br/>In 2021, the most common age for egg freezing was 35, with success strongly dependent on the age of the woman at the time of freezing her eggs, with higher success rates in those aged 35 and under.<br/>Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority<br/>Vicky had to make another difficult decision when it came to how many eggs to have fertilised with Ercan's sperm.<br/>\"I have been hurt before and it would be foolhardy to not have a back-up plan so I decided to keep some to myself. I'm safeguarding my future happiness,\" she says.<br/>\"I convinced myself it would be an awkward conversation but Ercan was so supportive.\"<br/>The couple started having tests at The London Women's Clinic in Brentwood last October but had to pause treatment after they found a cyst on one of Vicky's ovaries.<br/>\"I was crestfallen because I had this big plan. I was putting too much pressure on myself and my body. I'm so grateful for social media because I had this community to get advice from.\"<br/>They had to wait until April for the egg collection, but it was not a smooth process for Vicky. <br/>\"At about day ten my follicles were not where they needed to be so the solution is to up your hormones. I was struggling anyway but I would sit and burst into tears randomly. It is such a turbulent time for your body and mind.<br/>\"I tried my best to show the good and bad days. I was so stressed about the injections but they weren't too bad where as I underestimated how hard the hormones would be.\"  <br/>Three of Vicky's eggs were turned into embryos, which she was told have a 20% chance of resulting in a baby, and she decided to keep three as unfertilised eggs, which have a 10% chance.<br/>\"It has taken the pressure off loads. We are planning a wedding and we want to enjoy married life. This has given us the luxury of time and options,\" she says.<br/>The process is expensive, she adds, with the NHS only funding egg freezing for certain medical reasons, for example in advance of cancer treatment. <br/>\"I feel so grateful to be in a position to do it. I do think it should be available to more women. <br/>\"I had spent my whole life in a rush to be loved so I could do all the things I thought a woman was meant to do but now I'm doing things when they are right for me so I feel really empowered.\"<br/>Vicky has created a video diary of the whole process, which will be shown on ITV1's Lorraine.<br/>\"My hope is that it will help women struggling with their own journeys and also encourage a little more understanding and compassion around the subject, as well as helping women realise their own options.\"<br/>Watch Vicky Pattison - My Journey To Motherhood on Lorraine from 9am on Tuesday 20 June on ITV1 and ITVX<br/>Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show. <br/>The new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason. <br/>The investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.<br/>Modern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.<br/>They were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.<br/>The NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication. <br/>\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.  <br/>\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"<br/>But she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"<br/>There has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term. <br/>But on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.<br/>And there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.<br/>Withdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to. <br/>Taking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.<br/>The symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.<br/>If you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line<br/>Panorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.<br/>A copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway. <br/>\"We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,\" the memo says. <br/>Some of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.<br/>Pfizer no longer produces sertraline. Responding to Panorama's findings, a spokesperson said the company \"monitored and reported all adverse event data\" to licensing authorities, \"in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and updated sertraline labelling as required.\" <br/>It added: \"Public health organisations and professional medical bodies throughout the world have recognised sertraline and other SSRIs as the treatment of choice for adult depression.\" The company said the drug's label warned about withdrawal and had been updated \"as required\".<br/>The Royal College of Psychiatrists published updated information on withdrawal in 2019 - overseen by Prof Burn, who was its president at the time. It came after she heard testimony from patients who had experienced severe withdrawal effects.<br/>Until then, guidance used by the NHS and the college maintained withdrawal was mostly mild and short-lived - lasting no more than about a week. <br/>Now NHS guidance reflects that it can be severe and longer-lasting for some, and withdrawal can last many months.<br/>Information on stopping antidepressants <br/>A Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson told the BBC: \"Medicine continuously evolves, as does our knowledge of treating mental illness. As a result, the college updates its guidance when new evidence comes to light.\"<br/>A lack of awareness about withdrawal difficulties has meant that even medical professionals who prescribe the drugs have struggled to stop taking antidepressants themselves. <br/>Dr Mark Horowitz, who tried to stop the antidepressants he had taken for 15 years in 2015, said: \"It led to complete havoc in my life,\" he says. \"I would wake up in the morning in full panic, like I was being chased by an animal.\"<br/>The panic he felt would last until late into the evenings and he took up running as a distraction. <br/>\"I ran until my feet bled, because it gave me a slight reprieve from that panic sensation.\" <br/>He said it was worse than the symptoms that led him to take antidepressants in the first place. <br/>The Antidepressant Story<br/>Panorama examines whether the current generation of antidepressant drugs have lived up to their promises, following patients who have suffered serious side effects.<br/>Watch The Antidepressant Story on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 19 June (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)<br/>He is concerned that far more work has been done on how to start patients on antidepressants - and much less on stopping. <br/>\"To me, it's the same as allowing cars to be sold without brakes,\" he said. <br/>\"We should know how to start the car and how to stop it.\"<br/>Now Dr Horowitz runs England's only NHS antidepressant deprescribing clinic - a pilot scheme set up in London in 2021 to help people struggling to stop taking their medication.  <br/>At the moment he is seeing about 25 patients.<br/>Despite withdrawal guidance having been updated, Dr Horowitz thinks patients are still struggling to get tailored advice. Guidance for doctors now recommends that people reduce the dose of their medication in stages, but it does not specify how long it should take. It's different for everyone. <br/>The Royal College of GPs told Panorama that family doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants. <br/>\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\" <br/>The companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective. <br/>They said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions. <br/>As with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.<br/>Follow BBC Panorama on Twitter<br/>Antidepressants exit must be slow - says watchdog<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory. <br/>\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.<br/>She has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart. <br/>Meanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed. <br/>The synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.<br/>Prof Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos. <br/>\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\" <br/>Most countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.<br/>However, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.  <br/>Dr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development. <br/>\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\" <br/>Legal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.  <br/>Researchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.<br/>Prof Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.<br/>\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\" <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

But vaping's helped millions of people to ditch traditional cigarettes.<br/>It's widely considered less harmful than smoking tobacco - and the UK government endorses vapes as a quitting aid.<br/>But what do you do when you want to take the next step and quit completely?<br/>The main reason vaping gets you hooked is nicotine - the same ingredient that makes smokers crave cigarettes.<br/>It's thought to be pretty harmless on its own, but is powerfully addictive. That's why vaping isn't recommended for non-smokers.<br/>Nicotine creates new receptors in the brain when it enters the body, and you quickly come to associate it with feeling good.<br/>So when you stop getting it you'll feel cravings. These tend to be worse in the first three to four days after your last dose.<br/>According to the NHS, other withdrawal symptoms, like bad moods, are likely in the early stages of quitting.<br/>There's no firm answer to this - it varies for each person - but there are some things we do know.<br/>It's technically possible to go \"cold turkey\" and suddenly stop vaping. But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

In England just 61% of patients start treatment in that time against a target of 85%.<br/>Growing delays are, in part, the flip side of a medical success story.<br/>Scientific progress in cancer care has been remarkable, with cutting-edge drugs offering hope where previously there was little that could be done.<br/>New techniques are more effective but often far more complex for doctors to deliver.<br/>At the same time the UK population is getting older - and as cancer risk is strongly linked to age it means more more demand for expensive scanners, along with more staff to analyse those scans, and more specialist doctors and nurses. <br/>The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a perfect storm - and says the workforce is struggling to keep up.  <br/>Across the four UK nations, it calculates there is now a 15% shortfall of specialist cancer doctors - or clinical oncologists - who deliver chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <br/>Without action, it says this gap will grow to 25% - or a shortage of 368 full-time consultants - by 2027.<br/>Just as concerning is an even larger shortage of consultant radiologists - highly trained doctors who interpret scans to diagnose cancer or monitor its progression.<br/>The RCR says for each month a patient waits to start cancer treatment, the risk of death is increased by about 10%. <br/>In its annual survey, 44% of cancer service managers say they are now \"highly concerned\" about patient delays, up from 29% in the previous year.<br/>\"There are examples in almost every cancer centre where parts of the service just aren't running as well as we would like,\" said Dr Tom Roques, a consultant oncologist and vice-president of the RCR.<br/>\"We're having to tell patients all the time that we can't quite treat them as quickly as we would like, or in the way that we'd like, and that's a stressful thing to have to do.\"<br/>Kevin O'Hara, 60, from County Durham, broke five ribs in a motorbike accident last November. <br/>A scan of his upper body also picked up a shadow near one of his kidneys that was later diagnosed as cancer.<br/>He was offered drug treatment meant to slow the growth of the tumour and - in early February - was told the waiting list for surgery would be three to four months. <br/>That period has now been and gone but he is still waiting for a date for his operation. <br/>\"Every day you are waiting and waiting and nothing changes,\" he said. <br/>\"I come home from work and go to the door and, when there's no envelope that says NHS on the top, I just get so depressed.\" <br/>There is another trend in cancer care which is often overlooked.<br/>The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in people coming forward to get checked after spotting a possible symptom such as an unusual lump, strange mole or unexplained weight loss.<br/>The reasons for that are complex and include a bounceback in demand since Covid, stronger guidance for GPs to refer to cancer specialists, major NHS publicity drives and the work of campaigners such as \"Bowelbabe\" Deborah James.<br/>Cancer doctors view the spike in demand as a \"very good thing\", as a growing proportion of patients are now diagnosed earlier when cancer is easier to treat.<br/>But it also puts more pressure on NHS services, with waiting times for diagnosis and other scans one of the key bottlenecks in the system.<br/>Since Christmas there have been some signs of progress, with the NHS in England reducing the backlog of long waits for treatment and hitting one of its other standards - for faster diagnosis - for the first time. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>In Blackpool, the NHS has hit its skin cancer targets by changing the way patients are diagnosed, in an approach which is now being rolled out across England. <br/>The RCR also says there is a \"chink of light\" - with recruitment of oncologists rising over the last three years, particularly in parts of the country with the worst staff shortages.<br/>It wants each UK nation to increase medical school places and training posts, and says more also needs to be done to stop experienced staff cutting their hours or leaving the profession early. <br/>The Department of Health said that the total number of full-time staff in the cancer workforce in England had risen by 51% to 33,093 since 2010.<br/>A spokesman added: \"We want to build on this progress and will publish a workforce plan shortly to ensure we have the right numbers of staff, with the right number of skills.\"<br/>The Scottish government is also expected to publish its new 10-year cancer strategy within weeks, setting out ways to attract and retain more staff.<br/>The Welsh government recently published a cancer improvement plan and says it is now investing heavily to train more staff and build more diagnostic and treatment centres.  <br/>In Northern Ireland, the health department said it is \"extremely disappointing\" that cancer targets are being missed. It has recently opened two new rapid diagnostic centres and started a \"cancer strategy workforce review\". <br/>Data visualisation by Liana Bravo.<br/>Follow Jim on Twitter.<br/>Has your treatment been affected by the junior doctor strikes?

Check on those who may be more vulnerable, such older people and babies.<br/>Here's what you need to know about the effects of heat on the body and how to stay cool.<br/>As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.<br/>This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. <br/>At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. <br/>This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:<br/>If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.<br/>Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.<br/>It is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. <br/>But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.<br/>It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.<br/>As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.<br/>The UK Health Security Agency has some tips:<br/>Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.<br/>If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.<br/>NHS advice says: <br/>However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.<br/>It is a medical emergency and you should call 999.<br/>People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. <br/>Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.<br/>Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. <br/>Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.<br/>People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.<br/>Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.<br/>Diuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure.

He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.  <br/>At the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic. <br/>The former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic. <br/>Last week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services. <br/>Asked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"<br/>He accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.<br/>\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.<br/>He said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending. <br/>During the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending. <br/>Mr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.<br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\" <br/>The British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\". <br/>On Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid. <br/>During the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown. <br/>He said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".<br/>\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.<br/>\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans. <br/>\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"<br/>Earlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics. <br/>He also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.<br/>Labour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-PM Cameron admits mistake over pandemic planning<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Covid inquiry criticises government evidence<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant gas blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

both epidemiologists - said a coronavirus had already jumped to humans on a significant scale twice in the 21st Century, in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).<br/>And it had been \"a reasonable bet\", before 2020, another one might follow, infectious-diseases expert and former professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth said.<br/>By mid-January 2020, people in the international public-health community had been aware the Covid-19 outbreak had been \"out of the ordinary\", he said.<br/>\"It wasn't going to die away - it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered -

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4<br/>Covid origin likely China lab incident - FBI chief<br/>Covid origin studies say evidence points to market<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said. <br/>He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.<br/>But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. <br/>\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.<br/>The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020. <br/>This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus. <br/>It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.<br/>Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic.

That's a good thing for communication, for families and for most people.\"<br/>Face coverings were first recommended in healthcare settings in June 2020.<br/>The requirement to wear them in other places, such as on buses and in shops, was then introduced later as the country opened up after Covid lockdown measures. <br/>This legal requirement ended in April last year but guidance for health and social care settings was kept in place.<br/>Now staff, patients, service users and visitors will no longer be routinely asked to wear face masks in these settings.<br/>The BBC has heard from people with health conditions who have concerns about the latest relaxation of the rules.<br/>Brian Keeley, from Aberdeen, had a heart transplant in 2013 and takes medication every day to suppress his immune system and prevent organ rejection.<br/>Although he expects medics in immunotherapy settings will continue to wear masks, Brian frequently has appointments in other healthcare settings where he fears people may not be as careful.<br/>He said: \"I go to clinic every six months, but I also have to go to the GP, to respiratory appointments, local clinics to give blood samples, vaccinations clinics that are full of people.<br/>\"These are things we have to do anyway and nobody there knows the level of vulnerability of people. <br/>\"I was at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary recently and everyone there was wearing face masks.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.<br/>The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

The more Covid that is circulating, the more chance there is for the virus to mutate. <br/>But new variants can pop up anywhere - the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India have all been the likely origins of previous variants of concern.<br/>So will the new Covid test restrictions make any difference?<br/>Several countries are asking travellers from China to produce a negative Covid test in order to gain entry. <br/>The US said this would \"slow the spread\" of the virus, while scientists worked to identify any potential variants that may emerge. But no-one is suggesting that this will stop Covid cases coming in. <br/>Italy has gone further, and is imposing mandatory post-arrival PCR tests on travellers from China. Those that test positive will need to quarantine for several days. <br/>This has the advantage of enabling genomic sequencing of the virus, and so aids the search for new variants. But it will also add to airport congestion.   <br/>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that those travellers from China who have tested positive so far are carriers of \"Omicron variants already present in Italy\". Italy wants an EU-wide approach on the issue - but the EU's disease agency says, for many reasons, that is \"unjustified\".<br/>In the UK, there is plenty of Covid about. Probably well over a million people a week are getting infected, either at work, home or socialising - in other words anywhere people gather. The latest ONS survey estimated that around 1 in 45 people had the virus earlier this month.<br/>But most of the UK population is very well protected from severe illness, via a combination of vaccines and repeated natural infection.<br/>That means Covid - while still a potential danger here - is no longer the threat it once was.  <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Hope and worry as Beijing relaxes zero-Covid policy<br/>How many Covid cases are there in China?<br/>US demands Covid tests for visitors from China<br/>Search for Titanic sub enters decisive phase<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>Arrests after China restaurant blast kills 31<br/>The factors that could affect sub crew's oxygen supply<br/>The woman who wants to end abortion in America<br/>Satellite images reveal Ukraine canals drying up<br/>Windrush 75: 'We have put the Great in Britain'<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>Fears grow over Indian state on brink of civil war<br/>The draft star and his overdose - a death that changed America<br/>The Gen Xers making mid-life career pivots<br/>The fisherman who found a dead baby in his net<br/>Where tipping can be considered rude<br/>The fading glamour of digital nomadism<br/>Why are there mountains inside Earth?<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it.
