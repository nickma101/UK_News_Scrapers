The US will continue to stand with the people affected by Russia\u2019s devastating full-scale war and remains committed to providing life-saving assistance to those who need it most. The mayor of Kharkiv has dismissed Russia\u2019s claim that today\u2019s attack on the Kerch Bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia was an act of Ukrainian \u201cterrorism\u201d and said the Kremlin had brought death and destruction to his city on an epic scale. In an interview with the Guardian, Ihor Terekhov said Moscow had been bombarding Kharkiv\u2019s civilian population since last year\u2019s full-scale invasion. Yesterday, one person was killed and seven injured in three separate attacks, with S-300 missiles fired from across the Russian border. How can they speak about terrorism after unleashing war on Ukraine? They are shooting and killing our people. They have destroyed thousands of buildings in Kharkiv, leaving 150,000 homeless. Half of our schools and kindergartens have been wrecked, not to mention our cultural heritage. Our children can\u2019t go to school. This weekend, the Russians attacked us again. They strike our parks and gardens. How dare they speak of terrorism? They are trying to break us, to break Ukraine\u2019s spirit. They will not succeed. These grainy images taken from an official video on the Kerch Bridge show Russian committee investigators working assessing the heavy damage on a segment of the structure linking Crimea to Russia following the attack in the early hours this morning. A Russian Su-25 fighter-bomber crashed into the Sea of Azov near the town of Yeysk on Monday but the pilot ejected successfully, local officials said in a statement on social media. Unverified videos shared on social media appeared to show a parachute descending over the sea near a beach, and a large splash in the water. Yeysk lies across the Sea of Azov from the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region. The officials from Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region said the pilot had been rescued from the water. Russian officials on Monday encouraged holidaymakers stranded in Crimea to drive home through occupied Ukraine after explosions damaged the Kerch Bridge, connecting the Crimean peninsula to Russia, halting traffic. The attack killed two people and left their daughter injured, with President Vladimir Putin ordering authorities to repair the road and help tourists stranded in Crimea. Commercial flights to Moscow-annexed Crimea have been suspended after the start of the offensive in Ukraine, and most Russian tourists drive to Crimea using the bridge. With traffic jams building up, officials proposed that tourists drive 400km (250 miles) through territories held by the Russian army, some seriously affected by fighting, AFP reports. The Moscow-installed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said: I ask residents and guests of the peninsula to refrain from travel on the Crimea Bridge and with the aim of safety choose an alternative overland route through the new regions. Russian state television aired a map of the route, which goes through occupied Melitopol to the port of Mariupol and ends in the southern Russian city of Rostov. \u201cSafety is ensured by the Russian army, it will be strengthened,\u201d said Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of part of Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region controlled by Moscow. He said he had \u201cminimised\u201d the curfew to \u201clet the transit transport through\u201d. Saldo warned that there would be checkpoints that are in place to avoid \u201csabotage\u201d but that formalities would be \u201creduced\u201d. Teledyne FLIR Defense will supply an additional 1,000 Black Hornet micro drones to Ukraine as part of an order from Norway\u2019s ministry of defence, the company said on Monday. The pocket-sized drones are suitable for operations in global positioning system-denied environments and are useful in transmitting live visible and thermal videos, Reuters reports. The company had last year struck a four-year deal with Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency to deliver these nano unmanned aerial vehicles for around $48m (\u00a337m). Norway had donated nearly 300 Black Hornet systems to Ukraine forces in 2022 through the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, the company said. The company was formed in 2021 when industrial conglomerate Teledyne Technologies acquired thermal imaging camera supplier FLIR Systems in an $8bn (\u00a36.1bn)deal. The British government said on Monday it had introduced further Russian sanctions, including against the Russian education minister, Sergey Kravtsov, related to what it describes as Moscow\u2019s forced deportation of Ukrainian children. Britain imposed 14 sanctions designations in response to \u201cRussia\u2019s attempts to destroy Ukrainian national identity\u201d, 11 of which it said were linked to the forcible relocation of children. They will be subject to asset freezes and travel bans, Reuters reports. James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, said in a statement: In his chilling programme of forced child deportation, and the hate-filled propaganda spewed by his lackeys, we see [Russian President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s true intention \u2013 to wipe Ukraine from the map. Today\u2019s sanctions hold those who prop up Putin\u2019s regime to account, including those who would see Ukraine destroyed, its national identity dissolved, and its future erased. An EU sanctions package last month included those the bloc said were responsible for \u201cthe forced transfers and deportation of Ukrainian children and persons responsible for the looting of Ukraine\u2019s cultural heritage\u201d. In June 2022, Britain also sanctioned Russian children\u2019s rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for the forced transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children. Britain says many of the children have been sent to re-education camps, where they are \u201cexposed to Russia-centric academic, cultural, patriotic, and military education.\u201d The Russian culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, was also targeted with sanctions on Monday \u201cfor using her position to support the Russian state\u2019s damaging anti-Ukrainian policies\u201d, the British government said, and former Russia Today presenter Anton Krasovsky, for spreading \u201cpropaganda designed to incite violence and hatred towards Ukraine\u201d. Cleverly will chair a session on Ukraine at the UN security council in New York later on Monday, where he will highlight the deportation of Ukrainian children, his office said. Russia said on Monday that it would be ready to consider rejoining the Black Sea grain export deal if it had \u201cconcrete results\u201d, but that so far its demands had not been met. Its foreign ministry said in a statement that, despite UN efforts to prolong the deal, obstacles to Russian food and fertiliser exports remained, Reuters reports. It said: Only upon receipt of concrete results, and not promises and assurances, will Russia be ready to consider restoring the deal. The president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, condemned Russia\u2019s cynical move to terminate the Black Sea grain initiative in a tweet. This map, created by the graphics team, shows where the Kerch Bridge is situated. The 12-mile crossing is the only direct land link between Russia and Crimea. The Russian foreign ministry on Monday condemned what it called a Ukrainian terrorist attack on the bridge between Russia and Crimea and said the west may be complicit in it, Reuters reports. The Russian foreign ministry said: If a western origin of the surface drones that attacked the bridge, as well as a role of western countries in planning, sponsoring and carrying out this operation, is revealed, this will confirm their complicity in the terrorist activities of the Kyiv regime. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, paid tribute to the lives lost in the MH17 incident, where Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was brought down over eastern Ukraine. The flight was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July 2014. Zelenskiy tweeted: Our thoughts and hearts are with the families and loved ones of each and every one of the 298 victims. This tragedy caused by the aggressor will never be forgotten. A Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT) concluded in May 2018 that the missile system belonged to a Russian brigade, and Australia and the Netherlands announced they are holding Russia responsible for downing the aircraft. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Russia has denied any involvement. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said on Monday that he believes Russian president Vladimir Putin wants the continuation of a deal allowing the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, after Moscow said it will suspend its participation. Speaking to reporters, Erdo\u011fan said he would discuss the deal, including the export of Russian fertiliser, with Putin when they meet in person during an expected meeting in August, Reuters reports. Erdo\u011fan said: I hope that with this discussion, we can make some progress and continue on our way without a pause. Russian grain exporting union Rusgrain said on Monday that its members planned to continue supplying customers with Russian grain at competitive prices, despite Moscow pulling out of the Black Sea grain export deal, Reuters reports. It said: Russia is the largest supplier of wheat to the world market \u2026 All contractual obligations of Russian grain exporters will be fulfilled. Sweden\u2019s government on Monday announced it was pledging 6bn krona (\u00a3450m) in aid to rebuild Ukraine and facilitate reforms to pave the way for EU membership. The international development cooperation minister, Johan Forssell, said the funds, which would be distributed between 2023 and 2027, were part of a newly developed aid strategy specifically developed for Ukraine, AFP reports. He stressed that the funds made up a \u201cbase plate\u201d for Swedish aid to Ukraine. Forssell told a press conference: This is the largest and most ambitious bilateral strategy that Sweden has developed, ever. Additional specifically directed investments will come on top of this. In the long term we want to see not just one, but two blue and yellow flags in Kyiv. The Ukrainian and the European. Funds would be targeted to help build up Ukrainian infrastructure and institutions such as healthcare; increasing Ukraine\u2019s access to fossil-free energy and transition to greener technologies; and towards strengthening security and human rights protections. Here is a video our multimedia team has put together, showing some of the damage caused by the explosion on the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Crimean peninsula to Russia. Sanctions hold Russia to account for child deportation programme, British foreign minister says James Cleverly, the UK foreign minister, said sanctions announced by Britain on Monday held those individuals to account who had propped up Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, including with a programme of forced child deportation in Ukraine. More information to come \u2026 Germany continues to appeal to Russia to make an extension of the Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine possible, a government spokesperson in Berlin said on Monday. Asked at a regular news conference about blasts on the Kerch Bridge, the spokesperson said Berlin did not comment on individual developments in the war. Earlier on Monday, Russia said it had halted participation in the UN-brokered grain deal but that this had nothing to do with the blasts, which Moscow called a Ukrainian terrorist attack. This is from the BBC\u2019s Ukraine live blog. Many Ukrainians greeted the news of the incident on the Kerch Bridge with glee. Writing on social media, they are hopeful that Russian logistics will be interrupted as a result \u2013 the bridge has been a major supply route for Russian armour and supplies. The spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s eastern group of forces, Serhiy Cherevaty, said soldiers on the frontlines \u201creacted well\u201d to the events on the bridge with \u201ca healthy dose of schadenfreude\u201d, or joy over Russia\u2019s misfortune. \u201cThey have faith in their commanders and they want to strike the enemy wherever possible \u2013 to exact retribution for our people who have been killed, for our destroyed cities,\u201d he told the BBC. A Ukrainian filmmaker who joined fighting against Russian forces, said on Monday that he has been treated for shrapnel wounds after coming under artillery fire on the southern front. Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian film-maker vocally opposed to Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, was convicted on terrorism charges in 2015 and sentenced to two decades in prison. The 47-year-old film served several years before he was freed in a prisoner swap and joined Ukrainian special forces when the war broke out. Sentsov, a junior lieutenant, was injured shortly after receiving France\u2019s L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur from the French ambassador to Ukraine on Friday. \u201cOn the first combat mission after our return, during the landing, we came under artillery fire. Bradley saved our lives again. Three wounded, mostly shrapnel,\u201d Sentsov wrote on Facebook today, referring to a US Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. He posted a picture of himself sitting in an ambulance in his military uniform with blood on his face. \u201cThey have already removed the shrapnel from my face, the small pieces in my arm and leg will stay with me for ever. The other guys are also doing well \u2013 \u2013 Zaporizhzhia doctors know their job, thank you!\u201d Sentsov wrote. In 2018, he was awarded the European parliament\u2019s prestigious Sakharov prize. Russia has officially notified Turkey, Ukraine and the UN that it is opposed to extending the Black Sea grain export deal, the state-owned RIA news agency reported. Over the last year, the Black Sea grain initiative enabled the export of more than 32m tonnes of Ukrainian grain. But that traffic has come to a halt because of Russia\u2019s refusal to renew the deal. The last cargo ship cleared by the signatories to the deal was headed across the Black Sea from the Ukrainian port of Odesa towards Istanbul, the Marine Traffic website showed late last night. According to data from the Joint Coordination Centre that oversees the agreement, China and Turkey are the main beneficiaries of the grain shipments, as well as developed economies. UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has been working hard to get the deal renewed. He supports removing hurdles to Russia exporting its fertilisers and sent Putin a letter last week. Russia has effectively suspended its participation in the Black Sea grain export deal, the Kremlin has said. The deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey last July, aimed to alleviate a global food crisis by allowing Ukrainian grain blocked by the Russia-Ukraine conflict to be exported safely. It had been extended several times, but was due to expire today. Russia had been saying for months that conditions for its extension had not been fulfilled. \u201cIn fact, the Black Sea agreements ceased to be valid today,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \u201cUnfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements concerning Russia has not been implemented so far, so its effect is terminated.\u201d Moscow has long complained that obstacles remained to its exports of grain and fertiliser. \u201cAs soon as the Russian part of the agreements is fulfilled, the Russian side will return to the implementation of this deal, immediately,\u201d Peskov said. He said the decision not to renew the deal was unrelated to the overnight attack on the bridge between Russia and Crimea, which he called a \u201cterrorist act\u201d and blamed on Ukraine. \u201cThese are absolutely unrelated events. Even before the terrorist attack, the position was declared by president Putin,\u201d Peskov said. The Russian couple killed in what Moscow said was a Ukrainian attack as they drove across the Kerch Bridge at night for what they hoped would be a family holiday on Crimea\u2019s Black Sea coast have been named, along with their 14-year-old daughter who was wounded. Video posted on social media showed the family\u2019s car smashed, with bloodied bodies contorted and silent. The girl was named as Angelina. Her parents were Alexei and Nataliya. Angelina sustained injuries to her head and chest but was conscious and breathing independently and her life was not in danger, according to the local emergency response headquarters, which said psychologists were on hand. An unidentified relative told Russian media RBK that the family had been travelling with the girl\u2019s aunt, in two cars, and decided to drive at night to avoid traffic jams. \u201cAt about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, the family heard the first bang, after which the lights went out on the bridge,\u201d the relative said. \u201cAfter the second bang, there was no more contact.\u201d On the frontlines, Ukraine is pushing ahead with its counteroffensive and says it has retaken more than 200 sq km since the beginning of the push. Ukrainian forces have taken back nearly 18 sq km of territory in the east and the south in the past week in their counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior defence official said. That includes several square kilometres of territory around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russian forces seized in May. In the Kupyansk area of Kharkiv region Russian forces had been \u201cactively advancing since the end of last week,\u201d deputy defence minister Ganna Malyar said. Reuters could not immediately verify the battlefield developments. Russia has not confirmed the Ukrainian reports of territorial gains. Ukraine and its supporters have taken to social media to celebrate the apparent attack this morning on the Kerch bridge. Former Estonian president Toomas Ilves shared a meme showing joyful singing going on in a bar, with the chorus line: \u201cKerch Bridge on fire! Your defence is terrified! Na-na-na-na!\u201d The video was credited to NAFO, the North Atlantic Fella Organisation, a popular internet movement that counters Russian propaganda and features a dog. Anton Gerashchenko, a popular blogger and adviser to Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry, posted a photo of a shark with some explosives bursting through the bridge. The shark appears to be a reference to a Russian tourist who was killed by a shark last month, while swimming in Egypt. Meanwhile, Czech journalist Tomasz Dawid J\u0119druch\u00f3w shared a photo showing Vladimir Putin sitting at one end of his infamous long Kremlin table and meeting his defence minister Sergei Shoigu and commander in chief Valery Gerasimov. The middle of the table is broken, and resembles the Kerch Bridge after today\u2019s explosion. The Ukrainian security service source told AFP: Today\u2019s attack on the Crimean bridge is a special operation of the SBU and the navy \u2026 It was difficult to reach the bridge, but in the end it was possible to do it. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter in an apparent allusion to the bridge attack: In written comments to AFP, SBU spokesman Artem Dekhtiarenko said: \u201cWe are watching with interest as one of the symbols of Putin\u2019s regime once again failed to withstand the military load.\u201d Kyiv\u2019s navy and Ukraine\u2019s security service (SBU) carried out a \u201cspecial operation\u201d using seaborne drones, an SBU source has told AFP. Waterborne drones struck the sole bridge connecting Russia to the annexed Crimea peninsula on Monday, a major conduit for Russia\u2019s troops in Ukraine, in a deadly attack which is said to have killed a civilian couple and injured their daughter. The explosion hit the Kerch Bridge just hours before a crucial deal to export Ukrainian grain was to expire. There has not yet been word from talks in Istanbul, where Turkish and UN officials were trying to persuade Russia to agree another extension of the deal that was first signed there in July 2022. Ukrainian officials have continued to hint at Kyiv\u2019s involvement in the Kerch Bridge attack. A spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence department, Andriy Yusov, has said: \u201cThe peninsula is used by the Russians as a large logistical hub for moving forces and assets deep into the territory of Ukraine. Of course, any logistical problems are additional complications for the occupiers.\u201d AP reports that the security service of Ukraine has posted a redacted version of a popular lullaby, tweaked to say that the bridge \u201cwent to sleep again.\u201d. It also released a statement saying \u201call details regarding the explosion will be announced after the victory\u201d, the BBC reports. A Crimean Tatar-led underground movement is already active behind Russian lines and hundreds of young Tatar men are ready to take up arms to liberate the occupied peninsula, a veteran community leader has said. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor Julian Borger reports. Moving away from events on the Crimean bridge for now, Russia continued its assault on Kharkiv last night and air raid sirens sounded to warn people to take shelter. Loud explosions were heard in the central district on Sunday evening, just hours after one person was killed and four wounded in an earlier attack. Officials from the Kremlin have now spoken. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the following, without providing evidence to corroborate the claims: Today\u2019s attack on the Crimean bridge was carried out by the Kyiv regime. This regime is terrorist and has all the hallmarks of an international organized crime group. Decisions are made by Ukrainian officials and the military with the direct participation of American and British intelligence agencies and politicians. The US and Britain are in charge of a terrorist state structure. A senior Russian politician has said that Russia should not renew the Black Sea grain deal in light of the attack on the bridge. Sergei Mironov, leader of the A Just Russia party in Russia\u2019s parliament, also said that Moscow should respond by destroying Ukrainian infrastructure, according to Reuters. \u201cThat is what we need to do, and not discuss a grain deal that helps Kyiv\u2019s rulers and their western masters line their pockets. There can be no grain deal after another terrorist attack,\u201d he said on Telegram. Russia agreed a year ago to sign the Black Sea grain deal which allowed Ukraine to resume shipping food from its southern ports despite the war. But it has repeatedly cast doubt on whether it will agreed to extend the arrangement, which \u2013 incidentally \u2013 expires today. The Kremlin has yet to comment on the Crimean bridge incident or its possible implications for the grain deal. But state media is now reporting that Russia\u2019s anti-terrorist committee has said Ukrainian \u201cspecial forces\u201d attacked the Crimean bridge overnight using unmanned drones on the water surface. At least two other Ukrainian media outlets have cited unnamed sources which have said Ukraine\u2019s domestic security agency and navy were behind the incident. Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne and media outlet Ukrainska Pravda gave few details of an operation they said had involved the security service of Ukraine and the navy, but Suspilne cited its sources as saying the bridge was attacked with underwater drones, according to Reuters. Suspilne quoted a navy spokesperson as saying he had no such information and urging the broadcaster to wait for official announcements. The Russian-installed head of Crimea\u2019s parliament has claimed that Ukraine was behind the incident on the Crimea bridge which killed two people earlier, the state RIA news agency reported. Vladimir Konstantinov was quoted as saying that the bridge had been attacked by what he called Ukraine\u2019s \u201cterrorist regime\u201d and that the railway part of the bridge was not damaged. In comments published by Russian media, he alleged Ukraine had committed a \u201cnew crime\u201d by targeting a \u201ccivilian\u201d facility. Meanwhile, the BBC reports that a Ukraine security service source has told the broadcaster that the attack was \u201ca special operation of the naval forces of the armed forces of Ukraine and the security service of Ukraine\u201d. \u201cThe bridge was attacked with surface drones. It was difficult to reach the bridge, but in the end it was possible,\u201d the source says. The Ukrainian site censor.net is also reporting that Ukraine\u2019s domestic security agency was behind the attack, citing security service sources. It also states that the organisation head, Vasyl Malyuk, previously said the bridge was a legitimate target. The Russian independent online newspaper The Insider has published a video showing the damage done to the bridge earlier today. One section of the carriage way has buckled. There is no vehicle traffic in either direction. The footage was taken from the neighbouring railway bridge which is undamaged, and broadcast by the pro-Kremlin Crimea 24 channel. We may not know exactly what happened to the bridge for some time. Reuters reports that Russia blamed Ukraine for an attack on the bridge last October, but the country admitted only indirectly to it months later. Today, Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s Odesa military administration, has posted a photo on his Telegram account of what seemed to show part of the bridge broken. But it was not immediately clear whether that was related to any attack. Russia\u2019s transport ministry said there was damage to the road on the bridge closer to the Crimean Peninsula, but there was no damage to the pillars. It did not say what caused the damage. In recent weeks, traffic jams to the entrance of the bridge have stretched for kilometres on a daily basis as Russian people went on holiday. This morning the traffic jam ran for kilometres before police directed vehicles away from the bridge. Social media accounts showed cars lined up on the bridge and its entrance. Here\u2019s the full story following the reported explosions on Crimea\u2019s Kerch Bridge, from the Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison. The Kerch Bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula to Russia has been closed by an \u201cemergency\u201d that killed two people and injured a child, after local residents reported hearing explosions in the early hours of Monday morning. The heavily guarded road and rail link is among the Kremlin\u2019s most important and high-prestige infrastructure projects, and the only overland link that goes directly from Russia to occupied Crimea. Cars heading for the bridge were stopped early on Monday morning after the head of the Russian-controlled administration in Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said there was \u201can emergency situation\u201d on the 145th pillar of the bridge. Mattha Busby here taking over the blog from my colleague Helen Livingston. I\u2019m on Twitter here or email mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk Russia is suffering from a shortage of \u201ccounter-battery radars\u201d, which are key to allowing commanders to \u201crapidly locate enemy gun lines,\u201d the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update on the conflict. \u201cRussian ground forces survivability relies on effectively detecting Ukrainian artillery and striking against it,\u201d the MoD added. \u201cAfter being sacked by as commander of Russia\u2019s 58th Combined Arms Army (58 CAA) in Ukraine, General-Major Ivan Popov claimed that one of his key complaints had been about the lack of counter battery provision,\u201d the ministry wrote. Ukrainian forces have recaptured a total of seven square kilometres in the past week around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which was captured by Russian forces in May, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has said. \u201cOn the southern flank around Bakhmut we have been advancing every day during the past week,\u201d she wrote on Telegram. In total Ukrainian forces have liberated 31 square kilometres in the Bakhmut area during the counteroffensive, she said. Pictures are circulating on social media which show the damage done to the bridge in more detail: If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s a quick summary of what we know so far about the incident in Crimea: Two people, a mother and father, have been killed and their daughter injured in an \u201cemergency\u201d on the Crimean bridge linking the peninsula with the Russian region of Krasnodar, Russian authorities say The road has been damaged near the Crimean end of the bridge, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Transport has said, but it did not confirm reports that the pillars supporting the bridge had been damaged Russia\u2019s Grey Zone channel, a heavily followed Telegram channel affiliated with the Wagner mercenary group, reported that there had been two strikes on the bridge at 03:04 a.m. (0004 GMT) and 03:20 a.m, according to Reuters. Reuters and the Guardian are not able to verify this report The incident could be an act of provocation by Moscow, Natalia Humeniuk, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern military command, has said, claiming that such events are a \u201ctypical way of solving problems by authorities of Crimea and the aggressor country\u201d Train services across the bridge will resume by 9am local time (0600 GMT), the Russia-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, has said, while further updates will be given on ferry services to Kuban, in Krasnodar Aksyonov also said law enforcement agencies would be giving more information about the causes of the \u201cincident\u201d by 9am The 19-km (12-mile) bridge over the Kerch Strait is the only direct link between the transport network of Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014 It consists of a separate roadway and railway, both supported by concrete stilts, which give way to a wider span held by steel arches at the point where ships pass between the Black Sea and the smaller Azov Sea The bridge is crucial for the supply of fuel, food and other products to Crimea, where the port of Sevastopol is the historic home base of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet. It also became a major supply route for Russian forces after Moscow invaded Ukraine last year The incident on the Crimea Bridge could be an act of provocation by Moscow, Natalia Humeniuk, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern military command, has said according to Reuters. \u201cThe creation of such provocations, which the occupying authorities of Crimea report immediately very loudly, is a typical way of solving problems by authorities of Crimea and the aggressor country,\u201d Humeniuk told the national broadcaster Rada. The wires have also meanwhile sent a series of pictures by photographer Oleg Petrasyuk from the frontline Donetsk town of Vuhledar. More than 14,000 people lived there before the war \u2013 now they number fewer than 100. The town has been completely shattered; there is no water or electricity and no buildings that have not been damaged or completely destroyed by the fighting. If you\u2019re keen to read more on Vuhledar, the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh and Ed Ram sent this report from the area back in February: Reuters has sent some images of the Crimean bridge from this morning, which show there is no traffic currently on it. It\u2019s difficult to make out any more detail: While we try to find out more about what\u2019s happening in Crimea, here\u2019s a bit more from the ISW analysis that I mentioned earlier. The apparent \u201cchain of command crisis threatens to demoralize the wider Russian war effort in Ukraine\u201d and could affect its ability to conduct offensive operations in southern Ukraine, the institute says. The continued hollowing out of support for the Russian military leadership among field commanders will produce morale issues throughout the theater. Further controversies about insubordination and command changes will likely increasingly reach a wider domestic audience as the Russian ultranationalist milblogger community continues to closely follow and amplify these developments. The Kremlin\u2019s failure to appeal to these commanders and their personnel while also failing to fully back [defence minister Sergei] Shoigu and [chief of the general staff Valery] Gerasimov may increasingly undermine the Kremlin\u2019s desired goal to be viewed as an effective manager of the war in Ukraine. Two people from Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, a mother and father, were killed in the \u201cemergency\u201d on the Crimean bridge and their daughter was injured, the region\u2019s governor has said on Telegram. \u201cThis morning we all started with information about the emergency that happened on the Crimean bridge. We all saw a video on the internet of a damaged car with Belgorod number plates,\u201d Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote. \u201cThe girl was injured, moderately injured \u2026 The hardest thing is that her parents died, dad and mom.\u201d Train services across the Crimea bridge will resume by 9am local time (0600 GMT), the Russia-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, has said \u2013 that\u2019s in about an hour and a half. In a post on his Telegram account, Aksyonov said more information on the operation of ferry services would also be given before 9am and that law enforcement agencies would be giving more information about the causes of the \u201cincident\u201d. Aksyonov had spoken to Russia\u2019s first deputy minister of transport, Andrey Alexandrovich Kostyuk, he added. A child has been injured as a result of the \u201cemergency\u201d on the Crimean bridge, Russia\u2019s Tass news agency is reporting, citing Crimean authorities. It said the child would be transported to Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region by air ambulance. More from the ISW, which says president Vladimir Putin has consistently undermined the Russian MoD and made it into a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for all Russian military failures, making it hard for defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov to impress their authority on subordinates: The Kremlin\u2019s chronic disregard for the Russian chain of command is likely hindering Shoigu and Gerasimov in their attempts to suppress insubordination and establish full control over the Russian military in Ukraine. Putin consistently bypassed or ignored the established chain of command in hopes of securing rapid successes on the battlefield throughout the war, degrading Shoigu\u2019s and Gerasimov\u2019s authority \u2026 Putin also established the Russian MoD as the scapegoat for all Russian military failures, which saddled Shoigu and Gerasimov with a reputation for incompetence and failure that they are unlikely to repair. In other Russia-Ukraine related news, Moscow\u2019s Ministry of Defence has begun to \u201cremove commanders from some of the Russian military\u2019s most combat effective units\u201d and \u201cappears to be accelerating this effort\u201d, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest analysis of the conflict. The arrests and dismissals, including that of Maj Gen Ivan Popov, appear \u201cto be associated with cases of insubordination\u201d, the US-based thinktank says. Popov flagrantly attempted to bypass Russian Chief of the General Staff and overall theater commander Army General Valery Gerasimov and directly bring his complaints about the frontline in western Zaporizhia to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The ISW also reports that \u201cinsubordination among commanders appears to be spreading to some of their soldiers\u201d and that the \u201cintensifying dynamic of insubordination among Russian commanders in Ukraine may prompt other commanders to oppose the Russian military leadership more overtly.\u201d Russia\u2019s Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there is damage to the road on the Crimean side of the bridge, Tass is reporting. It did not confirm reports that the bridge\u2019s supporting pillars have been damaged. \u201cThe ministry stressed that the inspection of the bridge\u2019s condition is ongoing,\u201d Tass wrote on its Telegram channel. More updates from Russian news agency Tass, which cites the Grand Service Express as saying that train services to the Crimea may be changed due to the emergency on the Crimean bridge. It also reported that Crimean authorities are urging tourists to stay in hotels if possible. Checkpoints in Armyansk, Dzhankoy and Perekop, which connect Crimea with the Russian-occupied Kherson region, are operating as usual, Tass said citing Oleg Kryuchkov, an advisor to Crimea\u2019s governor. As mentioned in the previous post, Ukraine\u2019s post office actually issued a commemorative stamp last year to celebrate the October attack on the Crimea bridge. It illustrates how hated the bridge is by Ukrainians as a symbol of Russia\u2019s illegal occupation of the Crimean peninsula. Designed by the Ukrainian artist Yuriy Shapoval, the stamp shows the bridge behind clouds of dark grey smoke. In the forefront is the famous scene from the Titanic, where Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet stand on the bow of the ship a reference to Russia\u2019s claims that the bridge was unsinkable. The bridge was hit by a huge explosion back in October, causing a section of the road bridge to collapse into the Kerch strait and leaving a train and the rail link in flames. Russia said three people were killed in the blast and blamed it on a truck bomb. Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the attack, although it was certainly celebrated by Ukrainians. The country\u2019s post office revealed \u2013 within hours \u2013 designs for a commemorative stamp, showing the bridge ablaze and raising questions about whether the explosion had been anticipated. More on the significance of the Crimea bridge, also known as the Kerch bridge or Kerch Strait bridge, from George Barros, an analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War: Crimea has stockpiles of fuel, food and industrial goods, the Russian news agency Tass has reported, citing Elena Elekchyan, acting minister of industrial policy in Crimea. A ferry service linking Crimea with Kuban, in the Russian region of Krasnodar, has also been halted, Tass reported. While we try to find out more about the latest \u201cemergency\u201d on the Crimean bridge here is background on why it\u2019s so important, courtesy of Reuters: The 19-km (12-mile) Crimea Bridge over the Kerch Strait is the only direct link between the transport network of Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The bridge was a flagship project for [Russian president Vladimir] Putin, who opened it himself for road traffic with great fanfare by driving a truck across in 2018. It consists of a separate roadway and railway, both supported by concrete stilts, which give way to a wider span held by steel arches at the point where ships pass between the Black Sea and the smaller Azov Sea. The structure was built, at a reported cost of $3.6 billion, by a firm belonging to Arkady Rotenberg, a close ally and former judo partner of Putin. The bridge is crucial for the supply of fuel, food and other products to Crimea, where the port of Sevastopol is the historic home base of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet. It also became a major supply route for Russian forces after Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, sending forces from Crimea to seize most of southern Ukraine\u2019s Kherson region and some of the adjoining Zaporizhzhia province. Google maps is showing huge tail backs on the Russian side of the bridge: Russia\u2019s Grey Zone channel, a heavily followed Telegram channel affiliated with the Wagner mercenary group, according to Reuters, reported that there had been two strikes on the bridge at 03:04 a.m. (0004 GMT) and 03:20 a.m. Reuters and the Guardian are not able to verify this report. Meanwhile, in a further Telegram post, Crimean governor Aksyonov has asked residents to \u201crefrain from travelling through the Crimean bridge\u201d and to choose alternative land routes \u201cfor security reasons\u201d. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Traffic has been stopped on the Crimean bridge, which links the Crimean peninsula with the Russian region of Krasnodar, due to an \u201cemergency\u201d, the Russia-installed governor Sergei Aksyonov has said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Monday, Aksyonov said \u201cmeasures are being taken to restore the situation\u201d but gave few further details. The RBC-Ukraine news agency reported that explosions were heard on the bridge, according to Reuters which said it was not able to independently verify the reports. The bridge, one of president Vladimir Putin\u2019s prestige projects and a vital logistical link for the Russian military, was hit by an explosion in October. In other developments: Fighting in eastern Ukraine has \u201csomewhat intensified\u201d as Ukrainian and Russian forces clash in at least three areas, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. Russian forces had been attacking in the direction of Kupiansk in Kharkiv for two successive days, she said: \u201cWe are on the defensive,\u201d Maliar wrote. \u201cThere are fierce battles.\u201d Maliar also said the two armies were pummelling one another around the ruined city of Bakhmut but that Ukrainian forces were \u201cgradually moving forward\u201d along its southern flank. Russian president Vladimir Putin said the Ukrainian counteroffensive had been a failure in an interview broadcast on television. \u201cAll enemy attempts to break through our defences \u2026 they have not succeeded since the offensive began. The enemy is not successful,\u201d Putin said. The president also said Russia had a \u201csufficient stockpile\u201d of cluster bombs and that Moscow reserved the right to use them if such munitions were used against Russian forces in Ukraine. He added that Russia had not yet used the weapons although Russia was accused of using cluster munitions in last year\u2019s deadly Kramatorsk railway station attack. The Russian state has taken control of French yoghurt maker Danone\u2019s Russian subsidiary along with beer company Carlsberg\u2019s stake in a local brewer, according to a decree signed by Putin. Danone said it was investigating the situation while Carlsberg said it had not been officially informed of the move. The UN-brokered deal under which Moscow allowed Ukraine to ship its grain across the Black Sea is due to expire late Monday. The Kremlin has threatened to pull out of the agreement and said at the weekend it still had concerns that obligations to remove \u201cobstacles to the export of Russian food and fertilisers still remain unfulfilled\u201d. Two people were killed on Sunday when Russia launched a series of missile and shelling attacks on the city and region of Kharkiv, beginning in the early hours of the morning and continuing into the evening. Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov said a young man was killed in the city\u2019s Osnovianskyi district and another civilian man was killed in a village in the Kupiansk area. Ukrainian forces shelled the Russian town of Shebekino near the Ukrainian border with Grad missiles on Sunday, killing a woman riding her bike, the governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region said. Vyacheslav Gladkov said the missiles had struck a market area, damaging a building and two cars. Only a \u201cfew hundred\u201d fighters from Russia\u2019s Wagner group have so far relocated to Belarus, a Ukrainian official said, leaving the eventual fate of the fighting force unclear. \u201cThere are some groups of mercenaries on the territory of Belarus, but we are not talking about any massive or large-scale deployment \u2026 we are talking about a few hundred,\u201d Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s border guards, told Ukrainian television. A Chinese naval flotilla set off on Sunday to join Russian naval and air forces in the Sea of Japan in an exercise aimed at \u201csafeguarding the security of strategic waterways\u201d, according to China\u2019s defence ministry. Codenamed \u201cNorthern/Interaction-2023\u201d, the drill marks enhanced military cooperation between China and Russia since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and is taking place as Beijing continues to rebuff US calls to resume military communication. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair said it would be \u201ccompletely disastrous\u201d if the US rowed back support for Ukraine in the event of Donald Trump being re-elected as US president. He also told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that said Ukraine had done an \u201cextraordinary\u201d job in defending itself but when asked what the endgame looked like he said the path would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8726", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jul/17/interest-rate-rises-biggest-postwar-fall-in-uk-household-wealth-china-gdp-disappoints-petrol-bosses-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK mortgage rates stabilise for first time since May; Rising interest rates knock \u00a32.1tn off household wealth \u2013 business live", "lead": "UK mortgage rates held steady today, as a new report shows that rising interest rates have reversed rise in household wealth", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 13:26:56", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.624873", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d0217730ebcb162b960e08c92e278206a8902162/0_335_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has acknowledged that inflation is not coming down as quickly as he would like. Sunak, who has pledged to halve inflation by the end of the year, said in an interview with LBC that the process of slowing price rises was \u201ctaking longer than any of us would like\u201d. June\u2019s CPI report, due in Wednesday, is expected to show inflation slowed to 8.2% this year from 8.7% in April and May. Sunak told LBC that inflation was \u201cproving more persistent\u201d, but that he was determined to bring it down, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s what is eating into people\u2019s pay packets, it\u2019s what\u2019s eroding their savings, it\u2019s what\u2019s putting up interest rates and putting pressure on mortgages. \u201cSo, the best way to help people with the cost of living \u2026 is to bring down inflation. \u201cSo, the first of my priorities is to halve inflation. Is that taking longer than any of us would like? Yes, it is. \u201cAm I the right person to tackle it? Yes, because I identified it as a problem before anybody else. \u201cI think people trust me when it comes to managing the economy, and they trust me to be honest with them because, you know what, bringing inflation down does mean you have got to make some difficult decisions sometimes because they are the right long-term ones for the country. In the US, a closely watched business index has shown that factory activity slowed in New York State this month. The Empire State Manufacturing index has fallen by six points to 1.1 in July, with companies reporting a small increase in new orders and shipments expanded. Delivery times shortened and inventories continued to decline, and employment levels edged higher. But, planned increases in capital spending remained weak \u2013 a sign that companies are cautious about the outlook. Looking ahead, optimism remains muted although firms expect conditions to improve. Economists had expected a larger fall in the index this month, to around 4.3. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen says that Chinese policymakers are concerned about \u201csluggish growth\u201d. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Yellen said that China\u2019s consumers have been more focused on rebuilding their savings, leading to slower than expected growth (as we saw this morning). Yellen points out that youth unempoyment in China is quite high. But the US is on a \u201cgood path\u201d, she insists, and doesn\u2019t expect a recession. Rupert Thompson, chief economist at Kingswood, reckons the financial markets could be wrong to predict UK interest rates will rise over 6% by earlly next year. Thompson writes: One UK asset which has benefited from the ramping up of the expected peak for UK rates is the pound. That said, its gains last week were down to dollar weakness and any further strength from here should be primarily down to a further decline in the US currency which continues to look overvalued. Famous last words but market expectations of UK rates peaking at over 6% do look somewhat overblown. Sterling hit a 15-month high against the US dollar last week, over $1.31. With a UK election due within 18 months, pressure is building to find a buyer for the Daily Telegraph. Lloyds Banking Group, which seized control of the title last month, has now called on Mike McTighe, the veteran technology executive who chairs BT\u2019s network arm Openreach, to spearhead the sale of The Telegraph. McTighe has been appointed chairman of Press Acquisitions Limited, the parent company of the Telegraph and also of May Corporation Limited, which owns The Spectator magazine. He will oversee a sales process at each of the parent companies, an indication they could be bought by different buyers. According to the Telegraph, McTighe has been asked to find a buyer who will not trigger concerns about media plurality, or \u201cadversely affect the accurate presentation of news or the free expression of opinion.\u201d Investment bankers to run the auctions could be appointed within a fortnight. Such concerns could prompt a lengthy reviews by regulators, leaving Lloyds in the awkward position of owning The Telegraph in an election year. The Telegraph adds that senior Conservatives have warned that the sale must be conducted quickly and transparently, (presumably so the paper is free to express its traditional support for the party at the next election). Nigeria\u2019s annual inflation rate has climbed to a new 18-year high of 22.79% in the year through June, up from 22.4% the previous month. The rise came after President Bola Tinubu scrapped a fuel subsidy at the end of May, due to pressures on the public finances. The rise in inflation was also fueled by a 25.3% increase in food prices, up from 24.8% a month earlier. Inport costs jumped after Nigeria abandoned currency peg in June and allowed the naira to trade freely, prompting the biggest single-day fall in its history. Over in China, the head of the state planning commission has held a meeting with officials from private companies, hours after second-quarter growth missed expectations. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), met officials from companies from sectors including iron and steel smelting, electronic devices and modern logistics. It\u2019s Beijing\u2019s latest attempt to improve business confidence, so they can support China\u2019s post-pandemic recovery. A statement from the planner said: \u201cNDRC will strive to optimise the environment for the development of the private economy, and form a synergy for the promotion of the private economy\u2019s development and expansion.\u201d Microsoft is facing its first formal EU antitrust investigation in 15 years next week, the Financial Times reports. The EC will probe claims that the US tech giant is unfairly tying its video conferencing app Teams with its popular Office software. The investigation could lead to formal charges as early as the autumn. The FT adds: The commission\u2019s decision to open an investigation signals Brussels\u2019 determination to clamp down on practices by large tech companies that could stifle competition. Apple, Google and Meta are all facing probes for alleged anti-competitive behaviour. Back in 2008, the EU today imposed a record \u20ac899m fine on Microsoft for charging \u201cunreasonable\u201d prices to rivals for access to its dominant software. Workers at a second Amazon warehouse in the UK have voted overwhelmingly for strike action. The GMB union has annouced that 86% of workers at Amazon\u2019s Rugeley site in Staffordshire have voted to hold strike action. More than 100 workers at the West Midlands site are now set to walk out, GMB says. Stuart Richards, GMB senior organiser, says: \u201cThe is a game changing moment in the campaign to force Amazon to treat its workers like human beings. \u201cThey\u2019ve thrown everything at stopping this, but workers at Amazon Rugeley have organised and delivered a clear message that they demand fair pay and union rights. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen one of the world wealthiest companies, offering UK workers a pay rise of pennies and work conditions fit only for the history books. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering that Amazon are still trousering millions from the British taxpayer whilst treating UK workers with disdain. \u201cAs GMB members in Rugeley plan for the picket line, it\u2019s time for politicians and decision makers to finally confront the facts. \u201cIf Amazon workers are being forced to the breadline by low pay, then why should the public purse be open to the Amazon.\u201d This follows a series of strikes at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse, where the GMB has accused the e-commerce giant of drafting in more than 1,000 extra workers to skew a decision on union recognition at the site. In the commodity markets, the wheat prices is rising sharply after the Kremlin announced that Russia has effectively suspended its participation in the Black Sea grain export deal. The Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s most active wheat contract rose over 4% at one point, before settling 3.4% higher at $6.84 a bushel. The agreement guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s safe shipping of grain exports was due to expire today, having been brokered by the UN and Turkey last July. Russia had been saying for months that conditions for its extension had not been fulfilled, and today Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said\": \u201cIn fact, the Black Sea agreements ceased to be valid today. Unfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements concerning Russia has not been implemented so far, so its effect is terminated.\u201d Our Russia-Ukraine liveblog has all the details: Mick Whelan, ASLEF\u2019s general secretary, has blamed the train companies, and the government, for the new weeklong overtime ban just announced. Whelan says: \u2018We don\u2019t want to take this action. We don\u2019t want people to be inconvenienced. But the blame lies with the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, which refuse to sit down and talk to us and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years \u2013 since 2019 \u2013 while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%. \u2018The proposal they made on Wednesday 26 April \u2013 of 4% with a further rise dependent, in a naked land grab, on drivers giving up terms &amp; conditions for which we have fought, and negotiated, for years \u2013 was not designed to be accepted. \u2018We have not heard a word from the employers since then \u2013 not a meeting, not a phone call, not a text message, nor an email \u2013 for the last twelve weeks, and we haven\u2019t sat down with the government since Friday 6 January. That shows how little the companies and the government care about passengers and staff. They appear content to let this drift on and on. \u2018In contrast, we want a resolution. A fair resolution. That\u2019s why we are taking this action, to try to bring things to a head. Then I can concentrate on my day job working with others in the industry to rebuild Britain\u2019s railways for passengers, for business, and for this country.\u2019 Newsflash: Train drivers are to launch another week-long ban on overtime from July 31 in the long-running pay dispute, the Aslef union has announced. The move threatens to cause disruption to train services at the height of the summer holidays. The news comes as train drivers also start an overtime ban today, which will run until next weekend. Aslef says: The ban \u2013 which is the latest move in our long-running national pay dispute \u2013 will seriously disrupt services as none of the train companies employs enough drivers to deliver the services they have promised passengers, and the government, they will run. That\u2019s why they are dependent on rest day working, as it is called in the railway industry, which of course is voluntary, and, by agreement, and properly for the purposes of training, and which leaves them vulnerable to this sort of industrial action. The ban will affect Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; Cross Country; East Midlands Railway; Greater Anglia; Great Western Railway; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Island Line; LNER; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway main line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains. Train drivers have also held overtime bans from Monday 15 to Saturday 20 May; and from Monday 3 to Saturday 8 July. Britain\u2019s economic growth will fall further behind the euro area next year, a new poll shows. UK gross domestic product is expected to grow by 0.6% in 2024, a monthly survey of economists by Bloomberg showed. That\u2019s down from a previous forecast of 0.9%, and below the 1% gain anticipated in the euro area. UK inflation is expected to remain stubbornly high too, creating a bleak backdrop for Rishi Sunak ahead of the next general election. This year, the UK could only grow by 0.2%, the report suggests. Bloomberg says: While the UK struggles to build any momentum, the euro area is expected to grow by 0.5% this year and 1% next, as strong rebounds from France, Italy and Spain \u2014 and Germany in 2024 \u2014 help boost the bloc\u2019s performance, according to the Bloomberg survey. Inflation expectations for the UK were also revised up more than for any other major European economy. Economists expect Sunak will hit his target of halving inflation by the end of the year, but they are now predicting that rate for the fourth quarter will be 4.8%, up from 4.6% previously. Back in the financial markets, the oil price has weakened following the release of weaker-than-expected Chinese GDP figures this morning. Brent crude has dropped by 1.6% to $78.55 per barrel this morning, which wipes out much of last week\u2019s gains. Today\u2019s Chinese economic data \u2013 showing GDP expanded by 6.3% year-on-year, missing forecasts of over 7% growth \u2013 has dented the markets\u2019 view on future oil demand. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: China is the world\u2019s top oil importer, and its GDP figures missed the consensus by a full percentage point, posing a big question on the pace of the recovery in the world\u2019s second-largest economy and hitting oil prices as expectations for future demand were downgraded. Here\u2019s the key finding from the Resolution Foundation\u2019s report showing that rising interest rates have wiped out \u00a32.1tn of household wealth (details here). Short-term buy-to-let residential mortgage rates have also stabilised, although longer-term deals cost a little more than last Friday. Moneyfacts says: The average 2-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.93%. This is the same average rate as the previous working day. The average 5-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.75%. This is up from an average rate of 6.74% on the previous working day. There are currently 2,397 buy-to-let mortgage products available, the same as on Friday. Although mortgage rates stabilised today, savings rates have continued to rise. That could please critics of the banking sector, such as MPs on parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, who have accused the banks of \u201cblatant profiteering\u201d by offer paltry rates to savers. Moneyfacts reports that: The average 1-year fixed savings rate today is 5.10%. This is up from an average rate of 5.05% on the previous working day. The average easy access savings rate today is 2.61%. This is up from an average rate of 2.60% on the previous working day. The average 1-year fixed Cash ISA rate today is 4.78%. This is up from an average rate of 4.70% on the previous working day. The average easy access ISA rate today is 2.72%. This is up from an average rate of 2.71% on the previous working day. The number of residential mortgage products on the market has dipped this morning, Moneyfacts reports, to 4,246 today from 4,312 on Friday. Newsflash: UK fixed-rate mortgage costs have stabilised today, having risen steadily in recent weeks. Financial data provider Moneyfacts reports that the average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 6.78%, matching the rate recorded on Friday. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate has also remained flat at 6.30%. This is the first time in almost two months that the average fixed mortgage rates haven\u2019t gone up, Moneyfacts tell us. The last time the average rate didn\u2019t go up between two working days was on the 24th and 25th May \u2013 when the average two-year mortage was 5.34% while five-year fixed rates cost 5.01% on average. The rates on both two and five-year fixed-rate mortgages have been rising pretty steadily since the end of May, when concerns over future interest rate rises began to grow. In recent days, though, market expectations for rate rises have eased. The money markets currently predict Bank of England base rate could peak around 6.25% early next year, down from an earlier forecast of 6.5%. But rising interest rates have already cooled the market, with Rightmove reporting a small drop in asking prices last month. UK sofa retailer DFS has told shareholders this morning that the furniture market has been \u201csignificantly worse than expected\u201d this year, but it has grown its market share to a record level. DFS reports that consumer demand was hit by \u201cthe macroeconomic environment\u201d, with volumes across the market falling by between 15% and 20% in the last year (to 25 June). But DFS expects to slightly grow its profits this year, reporting that its trading has been in line with expectations \u2013 leading to a record market share of 38%. It told shareholders: We currently expect market volumes to decline by mid-single digits for the full year, however, the economic outlook remains uncertain. Inflationary pressure and rising rate expectations are weighing on optimism in Britain\u2019s boardrooms. Deloitte\u2019s latest survey of chief financial officers (CFO) has found that tight monetary policy is seen as the top threat to business, outweighing the concerns around geopolitics and energy prices CFOs are focusing on cost reduction and controlling their cash reserves, as the cost of credit hits a 14-year high. And with recruitment challenges easing, many bosses are expecting a slowdown in wage growth. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cThe burst of business optimism seen in the spring has faded under the weight of inflation and rising interest rates. Corporates have responded with an increasing focus on cost reduction and cash control. Businesses have negotiated a series of major challenges in the last four years, including the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, the pandemic and supply shortages. The legacy of those earlier shocks, in the form of inflation and high interest rates, is now the central challenge.\u201d Deloitte also found that the majority of CFOs expect employees to spend more time in the office in future. Here are two interesting charts from Resolution\u2019s new report into the impact of higher interest rates on UK household wealth And here are the key points from the report: Household saving has whipsawed over the past three years. The adjusted saving ratio peaked during the pandemic at 24.4 per cent \u2013 the highest on record. Saving has declined since but remains above its pre-pandemic level . Saving behaviour has direct implications for household wealth holdings, but the fluctuations in interest rates have had a more profound impact: the pandemic saw interest rates hit record lows and asset prices boom which pushed the value of wealth to a peak of 840 per cent of GDP in early 2021. The cost of living crisis, coupled with the monetary policy response, has put an end to the trend of rising wealth. Our estimates suggest that the wealth-to-GDP ratio fell to around 650 per cent by early 2023. This is by far the biggest fall on record as a proportion of GDP, wiping out \u00a32.1 trillion of household net worth in cash terms. A higher-rates world and an ultra-low rates world represent starkly different societies to live in. If the rise in long-term interest rates persists, would could see household wealth settling at around 550 per cent of GDP, a level last seen in 2007. But, if downward pressure on long-term interest rates resumes, this could see wealth settling at around ten-times GDP. The future path of long-term interest rates matters hugely in the context of intergenerational inequality. Higher rates of return make it significantly easier to save for retirement. Pre-pandemic, a 40-year-old with median earnings needed to save approximately 16 per cent of their gross income (just over \u00a35,000 a year) to reach a retirement target replacement rate of two-thirds of gross earnings. However, with current rates of return, the required contribution rate for the same goal is much lower at 9 per cent (\u00a33,000 per year). A higher-rates world would also improve housing affordability, helping young, would-be homeowners. Based on current interest rates, the house-price-to-earnings ratio could fall to around 5.6 \u2013 the lowest level seen since 2000. But if ultra-low rates return, there would be further upward pressure on house prices, with our modelling suggesting that they could reach 11 times earnings. Europe\u2019s stock markets have begin the new week in the red, after China\u2019s economy slowed in the last quarter. In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is down 31 points or 0.4% at 7403 points. Mining giant Anglo American (-2.5%) is leading the fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta (-2.2%) and Glencore (-2%) also weakening. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 0.6%, as traders digest the news that China\u2019s quarterly growth rate has slowed to 0.8% from 2.2%. Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, explains: Market sentiment is pretty much negative among traders and investors due to the Chinese economic data, which missed the forecast and raised concerns that the second-biggest economy in the world is suffering from a crisis. Basically, going into Monday, traders and investors were highly focused on China\u2019s GDP data, and they were hoping that the country\u2019s economic data would print a decent reading if not a strong one. Rising interest rates are continuing to hit the housing market. Asking prices for residential homes in Britain fell by 0.2% in July, new data from Rightmove shows, knoking \u00a3950 off the average price tag. Rightmove reports that buyer demand remains resilient, around 3% higher than 2019. But sales of larger homes are lagging the wider market, as potential buyers wait to see what direction mortgage rates head in the coming months. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, tells us: The UK\u2019s sluggish economic growth backdrop, rampant inflation and the Bank of England\u2019s monetary tightening path are weighing on the housing market as mortgages become increasingly costly and consumer budgets get squeezed. Smaller homes are more shielded from the headwinds as first-time buyers try to make the most of the weaker property market where they can despite the rising cost of debt. However, many homeowners are holding off from listing their properties amid the uncertainty, limiting the supply of flats and houses up for sale. But stemming an even steeper slide in the property market is a chronic undersupply of housing in the UK, exacerbated by the rise in build cost inflation, which disincentivises the housebuilders. The combination of limited supplies and rising mortgage rates have prompted more potential would-be buyers to head to the lettings market instead, sending the cost of renting sharply higher.\u201d Resolution Foundation\u2019s report also shows how higher rates of return make it significantly easier to save for retirement. They explain: In the pre-pandemic world of low interest rates, a 40-year-old on median earnings had to save around 16% of their gross income, or just over \u00a35,000 a year, in order to achieve a target replacement rate of two-thirds of gross earnings in retirement. But at today\u2019s rates of return, the required contribution rate to achieve that goal is much lower, at 9%, or \u00a33,000 per year, freeing up around \u00a32,000 per year during working age. Although many people are still not saving enough for retirement, the scale of the required increase would be much smaller if rates remain high, they add. Rising interest rates have caused household wealth across Britain to fall by \u00a32.1 trillion, the biggest drop since the second world war, a new report from Resolution Foundation has found. However, there are also winners from the rise in borrowing costs \u2013 mainly among young people, who may find it easier to save for a retirement or buy a house. New analysis published by Resolution shows how rising interest rates have caused household wealth across Britain to fall by \u00a32.1 trillion over the past year. Much of the loss of wealth was due to falling bond prices, which have cut the value of pension assets. Resolution estimates that total household wealth has fallen to 650% of national income in early 2023 \u2013 in the biggest fall as a share of GDP since World War II. The report outlines that \u201ca defining change to Britain and its economy took place over the past four decades\u201d: household wealth grew from around three-times GDP in the mid 1980s, to seven-times GDP on the eve of the pandemic. Much of this was due to \u2018passive gains\u2019 \u2013 the increase in asset prices that has fuelled intergenerational inequaliy. But that trend is now in reverse, with the Bank of England having hiked interest rates over a dozen times since the end of 2021 to fight inflation. This has hit the value of bonds, lowering guaranteed income streams such as defined benefit pensions, and weakening house prices. Resolution says: Our analysis suggests that, from early 2021, these passive changes reduced the household-wealth-to-GDP ratio by 185 percentage points, to around 650 per cent, by early 2023, based on a snapshot of asset prices and interest rates in March. This is by far the biggest fall on record as a proportion of GDP, wiping out \u00a32.1 trillion of household net worth in cash terms. We can expect further falls in wealth as asset prices continue to adjust to higher interest rates, although the scale of those falls is highly uncertain. Indeed, if interest rates remain high, wealth could fall to around 550% of GDP. And higher borrowing costs would have two key long-term effects \u2013 lowering house prices and making it easier to achieve a decent standard of living in retirement by raising rates of return on pension savings. Resolution estimates that higher interest rates could reduce the house-price-to-earnings ratio from its 2022 peak of 8.9 to 5.6, a level not seen since the turn of the century. Were this adjustment to happen over five years, it would mean house price falls of around 25% in cash terms. Ian Mulheirn, research associate at the Resolution Foundation, says governments should try to shield household from wild swings in interest rates. Mulheirn says: \u201cOver the past four decades wealth has soared across Britain, even when wages and incomes have stagnated. But rapid interest-rate rises have ended this boom and brought about the biggest fall in wealth since the war, of \u00a32.1 trillion. \u201cThose with significant mortgages will be hit by these major changes. But there are winners too from a shift to a world of higher rates and lower wealth. Higher returns will make it far easier for younger people to save for a pension that delivers a decent standard of living in retirement, while lower house prices will make it easier for younger generations to get on the property ladder and others looking to trade up. \u201cThe future path of interest rates is very uncertain. The current surge could be a blip, or herald a new era for the UK. Either way, policy makers should focus more on whether and how to insulate households from wild swings in their fortunes from these forces well beyond their control.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. China\u2019s economy has grown more slowly than expected in the second quarter, driven by a slowdown in consumer spending and the ongoing problems in its property sector. New GDP data released this morning shows that China\u2019s GDP grew by 6.3% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2023, missing forecast of 7.3% growth. On a quarterly basis, GDP grew by just 0.8% in April-June, a slowdown on the 2.2% expansion recorded in the first quarter. Retail sales growth has stumbled too, growing by just 3.1% per year, down from 12.7% in Q1 2023, while fixed asset investment growth slowed to 3.8% from 4%. China\u2019s property sector remains firmly in a downtrend too; property investment slumped 20.6% in June year-on-year after a 21.5% drop in May, according to Reuters calculations. The slowdown will add to calls for Beijing to do more to support the recovery, as Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank explains: In one hand, weak growth means that the government and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) will step up efforts to further ease the financial conditions and pave the way for a quicker recovery. On the other hand, supportive policies put in place so far have had little impact. The Chinese property downturn, risk of disinflation, and falling exports have been difficult to reverse. Also coming up today China\u2019s slowdown could be under discussion at Gujarat, India, where G20 finance ministers and central bankers are gathering for a summit. UK supermarket bosses are set for showdown talks with the government next week over the cost of fuel at the pumps. Energy Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to meet bosses from Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and other major fuel retailers on Monday, and tell them to end any attempts to overcharge at the pumps. The meeting comes after an investigation found that drivers paid an extra 6p per litre for fuel last year after supermarkets increased their profit margins.

Driscoll says a full campaign will cost \u00a3150,000, but he says if he can get \u00a325,000 by the end of next month, he will definitely stand. (See 1.53pm.) Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has said that Scottish Labour is opposed to the two-child benefit cap (see 9.35am) and will push Keir Starmer to get rid of it if he wins the next general election. Sarwar told the Daily Record: Scottish Labour policy has not changed. We continue to oppose the two-child limit. We continue to believe that it exacerbates poverty, and we continue to believe that it needs to change. What we recognise is an incoming Labour government will inherit economic carnage and that means we will not be able to do everything we want, and we won\u2019t be able to do everything as fast as we want. But we will continue to press any incoming UK Labour government to move as fast as they can within our fiscal rules to remove this heinous policy. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor, has resigned from the Labour party. He was recently banned from standing in the contest to be the party\u2019s candidate for mayor of the north-east (a new post, including the area covered by the North of Tyne mayoralty, with a wider chunk of the north-east also included), and at the time the decision was seen as one of the most extreme of many recent cases of candidates not wholly aligned with Keir Starmer and his politics being purged from Labour contests on dubious grounds. In a serious of tweets, Driscoll says that if he can raise \u00a325,000 for a campaign by the end of August, he will stand as an independent against Labour\u2019s candidate for north-east mayor. He says: I\u2019ve decided to resign from @UKLabour and serve as an Independent Mayor. People are tired of being controlled by Westminster and Party HQs. They want someone to stand up for them.

Politicians should answer to you, not to party bosses in London HQs. Since my barring by @UKLabour, I\u2019ve received overwhelming support. The cry for me to run as an independent has come from business leaders, community workers, trade unionists and politicians cross party. People have stopped me in the street asking me to run! But I won\u2019t have big party machinery behind me, or a national press office. I\u2019ll need \u00a3150k to run a full campaign. If I can raise \u00a325k by the end of August, I\u2019ll run.

If you want to find out more about me and my vision for the future, you can find out more on my website A reader asks: Who runs the Office for Students? Good question. The chief executive is Susan Lapworth, but the appointment to the OfS that attracted most attention was James Wharton, who was appointed chair in 2021. Wharton was Conservative MP for Stockton South between 2010 and 2017. He was a junior minister for two years, but one of his main achievements as an MP was taking a private member\u2019s bill through the Commons in 2013 proposing a referendum on EU membership. That, and the fact that he helped to manage Boris Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign in 2019 (despite the fact he was no longer an MP), probably help to explain why Johnson made him a peer in 2020. When Wharton was made chair of the OfS, despite having no background in higher education, Labour denounced this as cronyism. And here is a full summary of that was said at the Downing Street lobby briefing about the government\u2019s plan to limit the number of people studying what are deemed low-value courses in England. No 10 refused to give examples of what it sees as \u201crip off\u201d courses. Asked to give examples, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said that under the plans it would be for the Office for Students to decide what courses were not value for money. He said the OfS would focus on particular courses, not entire subjects. He said: This is not about specific subjects. We are subject-agnostic when it comes to this. As to how the OfS would decide what courses did not offer value for money, the spokesperson did not give precise details, but he highlighted two criteria that would apply: drop-out rates (\u201cregardless of the subject, you wouldn\u2019t want to see students being signed up to a course where half of the students drop out\u201d, the spokesperson said); and whether the course leads to students getting good jobs. The spokesperson said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of university courses would not be affected by the policy because they were \u201cgood quality\u201d. The spokesperson would not say whether Rishi Sunak thought too many students were going to university. Asked if he thought too many people were going to university, the spokesperson said Sunak thought \u201cworking to an arbitrary number is not the right approach\u201d. At 3.30pm Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, will make a Commons statement on the plan to restrict student access to what are deemed low-value degrees. There are no urgent questions. No 10 has said some \u201crip-off\u201d university courses could be closed down under the plans announced by the government today. The government says it wants to impose a limit on the number of students in England who can study courses deemed as poor value for money, either because of their drop-out rates or because they don\u2019t help students get good jobs. But at the No 10 lobby briefing this morning, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said the cap could be as low as zero. He said: In extremis, recruitment limits could be used to prevent any recruitment to a course. The OfS [Office for Students] has powers to suspend a provider\u2019s registration or even remove it from their register if they wish, but it\u2019s up to them to decide the scope and nature of any recruitment. I will post more from the briefing shortly. In his interview for broadcasters this morning Rishi Sunak also paid tribute to Ben Wallace, following the defence secretary\u2019s announcement that he expects to leave cabinet at the next reshuffle and to stand down as an MP at the next election. Asked if he was sorry to see Wallace go, Sunak replied: Of course I am \u2026 Ben\u2019s been a great defence secretary. I\u2019ve enjoyed working with him and he\u2019s got a track record he can be very proud of. Sunak also insisted that Wallace\u2019s decision to leave parliament was understandable. He said: [Wallace has] been in politics and public service for a very long time, and, as he said, he wants to be able to spend more time with his family, and as a dad myself I completely understand and sympathise with that. Wallace, who is 53, joins a long list of Conservative MPs, some of whom are quite young, who are standing down at the next election, and this trend is partly explained by the despair they feel about their party\u2019s election prospects. But Wallace has been defence secretary for four years under three prime ministers, making him the longest-serving Conservative in the post since Winston Churchill, and so he has more reason than some of the others for thinking it is time to move on. In his clip for broadcasters this morning Rishi Sunak was mostly asked about the policy the government is billing as a \u201ccrackdown on rip off university degrees\u201d in England. Here are the main points. Sunak said the policy partly intended to reinforce the message that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go to university to succeed in life\u201d. He explained: For many people university is the right answer and it does brilliantly, but actually there are a range of people who are being let down by the current system. They\u2019re being taken advantage of with low-quality courses that don\u2019t lead to a job that it makes it worth it, leaves them financially worse-off. That\u2019s what we\u2019re clamping down on today \u2013 but, at the same time, making sure that young people have a range of fantastic alternative opportunities, whether that be apprentices or higher technical qualifications, for example. Sunak is only the latest in a long line of senior politicians, from all main parties, who for years have been saying that success in life should not depend on having a good university degree. But generally their children end up going to university anyway, which may be one reason why the message is not cutting through. Sunak brushed aside concerns that the policy would cut revenue for some universities. When this point was put to him, he said what mattered was the \u201coverall financial sustainability\u201d of the university system. He said the policy would make higher education better value for taxpayers. He explained: I think it\u2019s important that the system is also fair for taxpayers, because ultimately as taxpayers that fund the system \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a situation at the moment where around half of people who go to university don\u2019t end up paying back the cost of that degree \u2013 that costs the taxpayer money. So, we need to make sure the system is not just fair for students and they\u2019re getting the right outcome, but it\u2019s also fair for taxpayers. Part of these reforms clamping down on low-quality courses will improve the overall financial sustainability of the system. And that\u2019s right, right for students, right for the taxpayer. He stressed that it would be for the Office for Students, not the government, to decide what might count as \u2018rip off courses\u201d. He said: What the regulator will do is look at a range of different outcomes for courses. So, what kind of jobs are students going on to, do they complete the course, how much do they earn in later life? On the basis of all of that, they\u2019ll be able to figure out \u2018well, hang on, that course actually isn\u2019t delivering value for money. It\u2019s letting people down and we should not put students on it because we\u2019re letting them down\u2019. With that information, students can make more informed choices and, at the same time, we\u2019re making it easier for them to find things like apprenticeships. A fresh overtime ban has been announced by train drivers, threatening disruption to services at the height of the summer holidays, PA Media reports. PA says: Members of Aslef at 15 train operating companies will refuse to work overtime from Monday 31 July to Saturday 5 August in the long-running dispute over pay. Drivers launched a week-long overtime ban on Monday which the union warned will \u201cseriously\u201d affect services. Aslef said train companies did not employ enough drivers, which was why they are dependent on rest day working, which the union pointed out was voluntary. The action will affect Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; Cross Country; East Midlands Railway; Greater Anglia; Great Western Railway; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Island Line; LNER; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway main line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains. It will be the fourth week-long ban on overtime since May. Commenting on the decision, Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: We don\u2019t want to take this action. We don\u2019t want people to be inconvenienced, but the blame lies with the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, which refuse to sit down and talk to us, and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years \u2013 since 2019 \u2013 while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%. The proposal they made on April 26 of 4% with a further rise dependent, in a naked land grab, on drivers giving up terms and conditions for which we have fought, and negotiated, for years was not designed to be accepted. We have not heard a word from the employers since then \u2013 not a meeting, not a phone call, not a text message, nor an email \u2013 for the last 12 weeks, and we haven\u2019t sat down with the government since January 6. Rishi Sunak has recorded an interview for broadcasters this morning. Among other topics, he was asked about the report from the National Audit Office today saying that the government is not likely to deliver the 40 \u201cnew\u201d hospitals promised by Boris Johnson at the time of the last election. Sunak downplayed the NAO findings, saying the report showed that 40 projects were set to be delivered by the end of the decade. He said: I think we will deliver 40 hospitals by 2030 as we committed to do \u2026 I think if you look at the report, they do say we actually will deliver 40 hospitals by 2030. But that\u2019s just one of the many things that we\u2019re doing for the health service. The NAO report explains that the 40 hospital projects now on the government\u2019s list for completion by 2030 are not the same as the original 40 announced. Only 32 of those are still on the list covered by this deadline, and only 11 count as \u201cwhole new hospitals\u201d, it says. Rishi Sunak has written an article for the Daily Telegraph this morning defending the government\u2019s plan to limit the number of places for students in England on what it calls \u201crip off degree courses\u201d. In it he argues: Too many of our young people are sold a false dream of going to university only to find they\u2019re enrolled on low-quality courses that don\u2019t offer the skills they need to get a decent job at the end of it. Contrast that with apprenticeships or other vocational routes. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, one in five graduates in this country, about 70,000 every year, would be better off financially if they had not gone to university. And despite having studied for several years, one in three graduates are in a job that doesn\u2019t require them to be degree-educated. Put simply: our young people are being ripped off. They\u2019re being saddled with tens of thousands of pounds of debt from bad degrees that just leave them poorer, and dissuaded from pursuing more vocational options because they are led to believe that university is the only route to success. It\u2019s not fair on them \u2013 and it\u2019s not fair on you as taxpayers, forced to pick up a big chunk of the bill despite getting nothing back for our economy. Sunak is referring to this IFS report, published three years ago, saying \u201cone in five students \u2013 or about 70,000 every year - would actually have been better off financially had they not gone to university\u201d. But, in interviews this morning, Robert Halfon, the education minister, was unable to name any of the degree courses that will be affected by the new cap. Under the plan, the Office for Students will implement the policy, which will start to apply from the 2024-25 academic year. But Halfon did reject claims that this approach amounted to an attack on arts and humanities courses. When this was put to him, he told Times Radio: That\u2019s absolutely not the case. Because we\u2019re not saying that particular arts courses are going to have limits. It may be that in some universities there are arts courses that are leading to good jobs. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was also asked about Keir Starmer\u2019s comments on the two-child benefit cap on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. She firmly rejected the claim that Starmer\u2019s decision to say he would keep the cap meant Labour were the same as the Tories. She said: I strongly do think there is a massive difference between Labour and the Tories, who have been in power for 13 years and left us with a country that just feels broken, where everything\u2019s gone backwards, everyone is worse off. Labour is setting out an alternative course. She cited Labour\u2019s plan to introduce breakfast clubs in every primary school in England as one example of what the party would do to address child poverty. An accommodation barge to house 500 asylum seekers has left its berth in Falmouth, Cornwall, and is expected to head to its destination in Portland, Dorset, PA Media reports. PA says: The Bibby Stockholm had been due in Portland a month ago, despite resistance from the local council and Tory MP Richard Drax. But work on the barge had been delayed and it was only this morning that tugs began towing the vessel out of Falmouth harbour. Supermarket bosses will meet Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, today after he pledged to hold \u201crip-off retailers\u201d to account for charging motorists \u201csky high\u201d prices for fuel. Kalyeena Makortoff has the story here. In his Inside Politics briefing for the Financial Times, Stephen Bush says that, regardless of what Keir Starmer told Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, a Labour government would end up getting rid of the two-child benefits cap. Bush argues: The Conservatives\u2019 policy \u2014 which caps the amount a household can receive in benefits if they have no, or low, earnings \u2014 upsets the party\u2019s social liberals, its Christian socialists, its feminists and its pro-welfare tendency \u2009\u2026 \u2009Essentially every part of the Labour party hates this policy, which is one reason why almost every major figure in the party is on the record calling the policy \u201cimmoral\u201d, \u201cheinous\u201d or \u201csocial engineering\u201d or some variation thereof. The only question will be whether a change to the current cap is enforced on the leadership \u2014 perhaps by some equivalent of the bill currently working its way through parliament \u2014 or if the policy never gets that far. You can see at the moment that Keir Starmer is trying to win, essentially, a doctor\u2019s mandate: that was the subtext of his piece for the Observer this weekend. The short version is \u201cthe UK is sick, the disease is low growth, give me a mandate to cure the illness\u201d. And you can see, too, how Labour might find its way around this commitment, whether through spinning its changes to universal credit or pointing out the problems that UK benefits create for growth. Good morning. MPs have got four more days sitting in the Commons before the summer recess starts, but it is not really the moment for Rishi Sunak to start winding down. There are byelections in three Conservative-held seats on Thursday \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Nigel Adams\u2019 Selby and Ainsty, and David Warburton\u2019s Somerton and Frome \u2013 and Tories fear they will lose them all, even though in the latter two the majorities in 2019 were around 20,000. If this does happen, Sunak will be the first PM to lose three byelections in one day since Harold Wilson in 1968 (12 years before Sunak was even born). We got a preview of one possible Tory line to take in the event of a triple drubbing from the Conservative MP Steve Brine on the Westminster Hour last night. Asked about the possibility of defeat in Uxbridge, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s another bit of what I call \u2018long Boris\u2019, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Long Boris might also part-explain a defeat in Selby, where the byelection is only happening because Adams, a Johnson loyalist, resigned in a huff when his nomination for a peerage was blocked. But if Sunak does lose in all three seats, most commentators, and Tories, will conclude that this is symptomatic of a wider malaise, and not purely the fault of Johnson. With the recess looming, Keir Starmer has his own problems. As Pippa Crerar and Patrick Butler report, the Labour leader is facing criticism because yesterday he said he would keep the two-child benefit cap in place. A new report out today by academics, who have studied the impact of the policy in detail, says the case for scrapping the two-child cap, and the overall benefit cap, is \u201coverwhelming\u201d. It says both policies are causing \u201cextreme hardship\u201d and failing to incentivise claimant families to find more work or limit the number of children they have \u2013 supposedly the whole point in the first place. On the two-child cap in particular, the report, which is funded by the Nuffield Foundation and produced by researchers from the Larger Families project, says: Many of the families we interviewed did not know that the two-child limit existed until after their child was born and, in some cases, conception was not a choice, but was the result of failed contraception or an abusive relationship. In other cases, the family was not receiving benefits when the affected child was born, and parents only found out about the restriction when their circumstances later changed as a result of relationship breakdown or job loss. Additionally, while there is an exemption in place for children born as a result of non-consensual conception or within the context of domestic abuse, the majority of the participants eligible for this were not receiving it. As this analysis by Matthew Weaver explains, getting rid of the two-child benefit cap would cost about \u00a31.3bn. This morning Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, defended Starmer\u2019s decision to say Labour would keep it in place, saying the party could only promise things it could afford. She told Sky News: We\u2019ve got to be clear about what we can fund and that\u2019s why Keir Starmer\u2019s set out the position. Because we\u2019ve got to make sure that any policy that we propose, anything that we might want to change, anything we might not like that the Tories have done, we\u2019ve still got to say how we\u2019d fund it. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Rishi Sunak is on a visit to a school. 10am: Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, gives a speech on national security. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: An education minister is expected to make a statement to MPs on the plans to cap the number of students who can enrol for \u201clow value\u201d courses in England. After 4.30pm: MPs will debate and vote on the latest Lords amendments to the illegal migration bill. If you want to contact me, do try the \u201csend us a message\u201d feature.

They concern golf rules, carpenter bees and CPR short courses I\u2019ve not signed up for at local fire departments I could not place. I have been on the receiving end of a round-robin addressed \u201cto all the stoners\u201d. The explanation is that I share my name \u2013 and therefore a similar email address \u2013 with a stranger half way round the world from me. Random email is the bane of everyone\u2019s existence; I could tell you how many actual thousands of unread messages I have, but no one needs more pain. What does alleviate it, though, is any inkling that a real person may be present \u2013 and there is something fascinating about discovering people who share our name, as though we are connected by something more than pure coincidence. Last autumn, 178 Hirokazu Tanakas scratched that particular itch, displacing the Martha Stewarts of the world in breaking the Guinness world record for the number of like-named people in one room. They had gathered in a Tokyo cinema at the behest of their founding Hiro, nicknamed Semi-Leader, a baseball fan with a good sense of humour. He was inspired to find others with the same name after stumbling across a mention of another Hirokazu Tanaka, and experiencing a feeling of \u201cthunderous joy\u201d. Sometimes I reply to the misdirected emails, especially when important notices \u2013 invoices, records from business service divisions, shipping contracts, medical appointments \u2013 show up. The other day it was an email strap-lined \u201cSad News\u201d, to tell not-me that someone had died. \u201cI\u2019m not the Dale Berning you think I am,\u201d I\u2019ll say, always kindly. An Urma once shot back: \u201cBut didn\u2019t we speak this morning?\u201d She wanted to fill me in on the carrier Ts and Cs for two vehicles going west, to California. I had to explain that I live in London. A year before lockdown, I got a masterly cold open. \u201cI have Dale Berning Sawa in my address book,\u201d it started. \u201cIs that something I should toss?\u201d It was from a woman I\u2019ll call Joni. She said she\u2019d been cleaning pollen out of her roof gutters and that they were closing floodgates because of all the rain. She had almost forgotten her birthday dinner, to which, she said, someone called Bob had asked that she bring \u201cthe insect collection\u201d. She mentioned someone called Adam having once eaten fire-roasted grubs. And she signed off with a line you know I\u2019ll treasure for ever: \u201cLots of love and stay dry,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you checked your bridge lately?\u201d I wrote back to Joni. \u201cI\u2019m writing a novel about a little girl who collects dead bees,\u201d I said. I needed to know about those insects. I wanted to know about that bridge. Joni \u2013 the other Dale\u2019s big sister \u2013 is now 88 years old. Dale is 83. The reason I\u2019ve been getting his mail all this time is that I chose my email address before I got married and added the Sawa to my surname. And because \u201cdaleberning\u201d was taken, Dale added his middle initial to his, a detail secretaries and correspondents frequently omit. Going by my more famous namesakes (Dale Watson, Dale Winton, Dale Denton!) and my professional experience, Dales are mostly men. The people who cold call me in office settings clearly think so too. Postal invitations are invariably addressed to a Mr me. Joni and the other Dale are happy for me to write about them, if slightly mystified as to why I\u2019d want to. \u201cToday, I plan on cutting the grass and doing some plant trimming,\u201d Joni said when I asked her. \u201cWho would want to read about that?\u201d The answer, I suppose, is that we all want connection, even in its most random, accidental forms. It\u2019s why we shore up stories such as that of the Arizona woman who mistyped her grandson\u2019s mobile number and invited a perfect stranger to Thanksgiving. He said yes, and seven years on, they\u2019re still celebrating together. Joni sent me a photo of her, Dale and her husband sat in a pub. Whenever I look at it, I smile as broadly as they do in that picture, three gorgeous oldies celebrating an 85th birthday under different skies, several hundred miles away.

I had a weekly show on the pirate radio station Q102, which morphed into Xfm, and made a couple of guest appearances on Mark Goodier\u2019s fledgling BBC Radio 1 evening show. Mark was away for four weeks in the summer of 1993 so they got in guest presenters, including Jo and me. A couple of months later, we were invited back to co-host for seven weeks. Matthew Bannister had just taken control of Radio 1 with rumours of an immediate shake-up. He called us into his office. We both sat staring at our boots, thinking: \u201cThis is the point where he says: \u2019Thanks very much.\u2019\u201d He said: \u201cWe\u2019d like you to carry on.\u201d He gave us the job full time, and off we went. The idea was to take the left-field music from what some people considered this rather dark ghetto and make it more accessible \u2013 somewhere between daytime and John Peel, who had the 10pm to midnight show. Even though we were both in our late 20s, we were perceived as the whippersnappers of Radio 1. We wanted to recreate the feeling from when we were kids at the end of the 70s, listening to Mike Read and Kid Jensen. We both understood what a brilliant radio friend Janice Long [who worked for Radio 1 from 1982 to 1988, including presenting the evening show] had been, making listeners feel part of a gang. It probably helped that we weren\u2019t the most proficient of presenters: we couldn\u2019t believe that someone let us play records for a living. It couldn\u2019t have happened at a better time. I\u2019d made a reputation of going out to find new bands to champion, and the whole music landscape was about to change. A month after we signed the contract, in late October 93, Elastica released their debut single. I remember playing Girls &amp; Boys by Blur, which was such a culture shock after Modern Life Is Rubbish. Oasis\u2019 first session went out the first week of 1994 where they played a set of four songs [Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol, Shakermaker, Bring It On Down and Up In The Sky] before they\u2019d even recorded them for Definitely Maybe. In November 1994, we had the exclusive first play of Love Spreads, the Stone Roses\u2019 comeback single. A security guard turned up at Radio 1 with the CD, let us play it once, put the CD back in the case and took it away again. Suddenly, all these misfit characters became pop stars, and we became part of the process that Jarvis Cocker describes as the lunatics taking over the asylum. We were the two lunatics at Radio 1. Jo Whiley, co-presenter I knew his name from NME, but Steve and I didn\u2019t meet until we were in the studio preparing for our first show. Although I did have a bit of radio experience, I think he knew me best as the person who booked bands for [Channel 4 chatshow] The Word, like Nirvana, L7 and Rage Against the Machine. Steve and I were both wearing cherry-red Dr Martens. The chemistry was instant. The layout at Radio 1 meant you could see into the other studios. We would be messing around and see Alan \u201cFluff\u201d Freeman, Dave Lee Travis and Simon Bates. We\u2019d think: \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d I used to borrow Dave Lee Travis\u2019 headphones that smelt strongly of aftershave. I\u2019d go home, get into bed and think: \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d I smelt of Dave Lee Travis. We were both going to lots of gigs, so it was a melting pot of who to play. Steve would suggest These Animal Men or S*M*A*S*H and I\u2019d suggest Therapy? or Northern Uproar. We were fans of trip-hop \u2013 Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky. Suede, the Manics, Radiohead, Pulp, Blur, Oasis and the Verve brought out seminal albums during our tenure, and most came in to do sessions and interviews. It was like they were our mates down the pub. There was no fakery or pretence. When Chris Evans took over the Breakfast Show [in 1995], he would play all the bands we liked, which took them to the mainstream. We\u2019d be sitting in our little studio going: \u201cDo you remember when Oasis sent us their demo tape?\u201d as Noel Gallagher was pictured at No 10 with Tony Blair on the front page of the Mirror. These days, I always listen to Steve on Radio 6 when I\u2019m doing the cooking. We see each other whenever we can, although we are just as likely to talk gardening as we are music. It\u2019s fantastic that Pulp, Blur, Suede, the Manics, Richard Ashcroft and, of course, both Gallagher brothers are doing their old hits but still doing new music. It feels like this is a really good time to still be involved in music. \u2022 Jo Whiley and Steve Lamacq host the eight-part podcast The Rise and Fall of Britpop, available on BBC Sounds.

In an interview with the Guardian, Ihor Terekhov said Moscow had been bombarding Kharkiv\u2019s civilian population since last year\u2019s full-scale invasion. On Sunday, one person was killed and seven injured in three separate attacks, with S-300 missiles fired from across the Russian border. \u201cHow can they speak about terrorism after unleashing war on Ukraine? They are shooting and killing our people. They have destroyed thousands of buildings in Kharkiv, leaving 150,000 homeless,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cHalf of our schools and kindergartens have been wrecked, not to mention our cultural heritage. Our children can\u2019t go to school. This weekend, the Russians attacked us again. They strike our parks and gardens. How dare they speak of terrorism?\u201d Terekhov said Russia\u2019s army tortured and shot \u201cthousands of people\u201d living in the Kharkiv region, which was occupied for six months. He cited the city of Izium, where the bodies of 447 men, women and children were discovered in a mass grave, including the bodies of 22 Ukrainian soldiers. The mayor suggested the bridge between Russia and the occupied Crimean peninsula was a legitimate military target. \u201cThis will cause a lot of logistical problems for Russia,\u201d he observed. \u201cIt shows the Kremlin is weak. The task of Ukraine and its allies is to make Moscow even weaker.\u201d When Russian tanks tried to seize Kharkiv last March, most citizens fled, with only 300,000 remaining from a population of 2 million, he said. \u201cSometimes I would drive around and I didn\u2019t see anybody on the streets,\u201d he recalled. Local people returned in several waves after Ukraine\u2019s successful counteroffensive last September. Kharkiv\u2019s population had gone back up to 1.2 million, he said, after many families returned this summer. He described the city as \u201cindomitable\u201d. But he stressed the situation was far from normal, with frequent air raid sirens, and the threat of bombs and explosions hanging over daily life. \u201cThey are trying to break us, to break Ukraine\u2019s spirit. They will not succeed,\u201d he said. Terekhov spoke after one of the biggest Russian attacks on Kharkiv for several weeks on Sunday. Air raid alarms sounded across the city for much of the day, with a strike at 2am, followed by another in the evening, and a third on Sunday night. All involved S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said a young man was killed in the second attack. Vapour trails were visible above Kharkiv\u2019s Freedom Square and the neoclassical regional administration building, which was bombed in the first days of the invasion. Synyehubov said the victim on Sunday was a man born in 1999 who worked in a civilian enterprise. Three people were hospitalised with shrapnel injuries after the strike in the Osnovianskyi district of the city. A fourth was treated at the scene. Ukraine recaptured much of the wider Kharkiv region in September, with Russian forces occupying now only a small strip of land there. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram that Russian forces had also been attacking in the direction of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region for two days. \u201cWe are on the defensive,\u201d Maliar wrote. \u201cThere are fierce battles. The positions of both sides change dynamically several times a day.\u201d Maliar also said the two armies were pummelling one another around the ruined city of Bakhmut, but that Ukrainian forces were \u201cgradually moving forward\u201d along its southern flank. She added that Kyiv\u2019s troops were also fending off Russian attacks elsewhere on the eastern front near Avdiivka and Maryinka."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d872b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/17/new-uk-government-plan-to-protect-against-climate-heat-very-weak", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New UK government plan to protect against climate heat \u2018very weak\u2019", "lead": "Exclusive: Leaked document \u2018falls far short\u2019 of what is needed to safeguard lives and livelihoods from heat, drought and storms, say experts", "author": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 13:00:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.624983", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9389d85ee86b845f3d23cf4c6ad4809296674ca3/0_21_4912_2947/500.jpg", "body": "The government\u2019s new plan to cope with the climate crisis has been condemned as \u201cvery weak\u201d by experts, who say not enough is being done to protect lives and livelihoods. Responding to the document, which was leaked to the Guardian, one highlighted its failure to adequately protect people in the UK from extreme heat. The heatwave in 2022, when temperatures surpassed 40C for the first time, led to the early deaths of more than 3,000 people, wildfires, buckled rail lines and farmers struggling with drought. Southern Europe is currently in the grip of a searing heatwave. Another expert said there was a \u201cyawning gap\u201d in measures to restore nature, which is a vital part of adapting to climate change. The National Adaptation Programme is expected to be published on Tuesday by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which is required by law to produce a plan every five years. In March, the government\u2019s official advisers, the Climate Change Committee, said its publication would be a \u201cmake-or-break moment\u201d. Ministers have been criticised for years over the failure to make adequate plans for the impacts of global heating. The CCC said in March that the UK was \u201cstrikingly unprepared\u201d and that there had been a \u201clost decade\u201d in action on adaptation. It said heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms would intensify in the coming years until carbon emissions reached net zero. \u201cThe new plan falls far short of being a strategy that will ensure the protection of lives and livelihoods against more frequent and intense floods, droughts and heatwaves,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. In the foreword of the plan, the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, writes: \u201cThis programme represents a step-change in our approach to managing the risks of climate change, moving us from planning to action.\u201d But Ward said: \u201cDespite the claim of a step-change, it outlines measures that lack the urgency and scale necessary to make households and businesses resilient. \u201cFor example, the section on dealing with the mounting risks of heatwaves is very weak. It promises lots of new research on how homes and workplaces overheat, when this work should already have been undertaken. We need a national heat risk strategy and an urgent retrofit programme to stop existing buildings from overheating and damaging health and productivity.\u201d A source with detailed knowledge of the plan said: \u201cThis is yet another weak plan coming from a government that isn\u2019t prioritising climate change or the environment.\u201d The source said restatements of existing measures had been used in an attempt to \u201cbeef up\u201d the plan. The plan cites building regulations that have been in force since June 2022 aimed at ensuring residents of new residential buildings are not exposed to extreme heat, although they do not cover existing buildings. It also cites the \u00a35.2bn investment in new flood and coastal defences, announced in 2020, and Defra\u2019s Plan for Water, local nature recovery strategies, and environmental land management schemes, also already announced. The plan says the government will triple the funding for climate adaptation overseas from \u00a3500m in 2019 to \u00a31.5bn in 2025 to help vulnerable countries and to \u201creduce the likelihood of emerging risks cascading to the UK\u201d. This funding will come from the \u00a311.6bn of international climate finance pledges by the government, the plan says. But a Foreign Office document recently leaked to the Guardian showed this pledge would be near impossible to meet. Richard Benwell, the chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 76 green groups in England, said: \u201cThe government is right that reversing nature\u2019s decline is a critical part of our response to climate change. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still a substantial gap between the measures listed in the plan and what\u2019s needed for nature\u2019s recovery. That gap yawns all the wider with the added pressures of climate change on species and habitats.\u201d Benwell said ministers could start bridging the \u201cadaptation gap\u201d this week by giving local nature recovery strategies the much stronger legal footing they need to be effective, when the levelling up and regeneration bill is debated in the House of Lords: \u201cThe government must surely accept the amendments if it is serious about adaptation.\u201d Some of the new measures set out in the adaptation plan were welcomed. \u201cPerhaps the most significant is the promise to create a new cross-departmental climate resilience board to drive further government action,\u201d said Ward. \u201cThe task of making the UK more resilient to climate change is too important to be left to Defra.\u201d Defra has been contacted for comment."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d872c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/derek-malcolm-obituary", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Derek Malcolm obituary", "lead": "Distinguished Guardian film critic who wrote with wit and charm for more than 25 years", "author": "Ian Christie", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 12:59:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625002", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/633b51633dc743f80e8e3acff400887244f7e655/0_133_4064_2438/500.jpg", "body": "Few film critics can boast that they were employed to pick winners at the races before doing likewise for movies, but Derek Malcolm, who has died aged 91, was the Guardian\u2019s racing correspondent before he became its longest-serving film critic, between 1971 and 1997, following this with a stint at the London Evening Standard from 2003 until 2015. He put his experience as a critic to good use when he became director of the British Film Institute\u2019s London film festival for three decisive years in the mid-1980s, making this a livelier, more inclusive event, helped by such novelties as a surprise film, and screenings outside London. Derek defined himself as a reviewer rather than a critic, having started at a time when more judgmental figures were leaving the arena. Among many choice anecdotes, he recalled that one of his predecessors on the Guardian, Richard Roud, was fired for dismissing The Sound of Music in a one-word review: \u201cNo\u201d. But if Derek was more inclined to balance negative with positive assessment \u2013 his even-handedness would irk some cinephiles \u2013 he also had notable enthusiasms. One of these was Indian cinema, especially the movement known as Parallel cinema in the 70s and 80s, headed by such directors as Shyam Benegal, Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ketan Mehta and Mani Kaul. Serving on the Cannes festival jury in 2006, which awarded its main prize to the austere Romanian film 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, Derek lamented the absence of any films from India. Typically broadminded, he had co-authored Bollywood, a book on popular Indian cinema, in 2002, but was thwarted in plans for a major Indian retrospective at the BFI by the lack of available prints from an industry with a notoriously scant regard for its history. The decades of Derek\u2019s tenure at the Guardian saw major shifts in the film business, of which the most important was probably the arrival of home video in the early 80s. In Britain, this was accompanied by an outbreak of moral outrage, largely directed against low-budget horror films with provocative titles, collectively dubbed \u201cvideo nasties\u201d. As the idea that these could irrevocably damage children gained traction, especially among Conservative MPs and campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse, Derek found himself testifying in court on behalf of the movie titled Nightmares in a Damaged Brain. When he described it as \u201cnot a classic, but well-executed\u201d, he could scarcely believe the judge\u2019s response: \u201cSo was the German invasion of Poland.\u201d Such was the hysteria that accompanied the arrival of video, which would lead to a tightening of Britain\u2019s draconian film censorship. But Derek had many opportunities to defend challenging films of vastly greater integrity, including Ken Russell\u2019s The Devils during its protracted struggle to be seen as originally intended. Derek\u2019s own early life was not untouched by violence and controversy, albeit of a distinctly English variety, as revealed in his 2003 memoir Family Secrets. He was born in London, the only child of elderly parents, Dorothy (nee Taylor) and Douglas Malcolm. His father belonged to a wealthy Scottish family and had been an officer with the Royal Artillery. Fifteen years before the arrival of young Derek, Lieutenant Malcolm had shot his wife\u2019s lover, before becoming the first man in British legal history to be acquitted on grounds of justifiable homicide. Despite the inevitable scandal, Dorothy and Douglas remained married, although living eccentric and largely separate impoverished lives in Bexhill, East Sussex. Derek discovered the scandal as a schoolboy, when he found a book about famous legal cases in his father\u2019s study with a chapter ripped out. Deeply embarrassed, his father felt he had to confess. \u201cHe told me he had something to tell me, and he dreaded it. I just said I knew, quite understood, would have done the same myself.\u201d Derek had obeyed his father\u2019s request and not mentioned it to his mother, so regretted never hearing her side of the affair. When young, his mother had been a fine singer and occasional performer, who had impressed Arturo Toscanini, and she continued to have many admirers, one of whom would later help Derek enter Merton College, Oxford, where he studied history. Before that, he had attended Eton, where the scandal was never mentioned. Writing his memoir, reluctantly, at the prompting of his second wife, the journalist and historian Sarah Gristwood, whom he married in 1994, was an attempt to overcome the lurid prejudice of the original reporting, \u201cportraying my mother as an idiot, with this dastardly Jewish brute [her lover] pursuing her, whereas my father was a hero, a gentleman, for protecting her honour.\u201d The memoir records Douglas\u2019s kindness, even though Derek had learned shortly after his death that the Italian ambassador to Britain was his real father. There were also happier memories, one perhaps foreshadowing the route that led to film criticism. In 1947, Dorothy took her teenage son to see Laurel and Hardy performing on stage at the London Coliseum. Derek\u2019s account of meeting them after the show reveals a shrewd economy and sensitivity, especially describing their business with a bun. \u201cHardy took a bun from the tray, placed it on his chair and sat on it. It was, of course, squashed flat. I\u2019m pretty sure he did it to amuse me. But you never knew with Hardy, who preferred playing golf to working. Laurel looked horrified, especially when Hardy offered the flat bun to me. He was the master of most situations and the pair\u2019s directors invariably deferred to him on set.\u201d Among other roles before journalism, Derek was an amateur national hunt jockey and spent three years acting in provincial rep. He arrived at the Guardian in 1962, via the Daily Sketch and the Gloucestershire Echo, and recalled that \u201cmoving from subediting to horse racing and then to the cinema may seem an odd progress. But in those days it was not so peculiar. The Guardian had a tradition of its writers being all-rounders.\u201d Despite being at the centre of Britain\u2019s film culture for 50 years, and playing important roles in international critics\u2019 associations, Derek remained exceptionally approachable, modest and enthusiastic. At a birthday gathering last year, he plied me with recommendations of new films to see (as well as avoid). Speaking recently to his successor, the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw, he explained that he had retired because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand the mediocre films\u201d, adding, with characteristic self-deprecation: \u201cIt was the secret of my lack of success.\u201d Yet for countless film-makers, and especially for distributors of foreign and independent films, Derek was the epitome of a trusted supporter and guide. He is survived by Sarah, and by a daughter, Jackie, from his first marriage, to Barbara Ibbott, which ended in divorce in 1966. \u2022 Derek Elliston Michael Malcolm, film critic, born 12 May 1932; died 15 July 2023"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d872d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/17/elton-john-tells-court-kevin-spacey-attended-charity-ball-at-his-home", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Elton John tells court Kevin Spacey attended charity ball at his home", "lead": "Singer gives evidence in trial of actor accused of committing sexual offences against four men between 2001 and 2013", "author": "Emine Sinmaz", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 12:44:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625021", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/27312b6dc38ea20d87c3569a2602768f7c092f76/1577_342_2636_1581/500.jpg", "body": "Elton John has told a court that Kevin Spacey attended a charity ball at his home after arriving by private jet. The singer also quipped that he was always in a \u201cmad rush\u201d when leaving West End theatres, saying: \u201cIt could be the queen and I wouldn\u2019t notice her.\u201d John, 76, was called as a defence witness in the Oscar-winning actor\u2019s trial, giving evidence to Southwark crown court via video link from Monaco on Monday. Spacey denies all charges including sexual assault and indecent assault against four men in their 20s and 30s, between 2001 and 2013. One complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has claimed he was driving the House of Cards star to a party hosted by John and his husband, David Furnish, when Spacey grabbed his penis with such force that he almost crashed. Spacey has denied assaulting the man on the way to the white tie and tiara ball, saying: \u201cNo, I was not on a suicide mission in any of those years.\u201d Wearing a dark suit, open-necked shirt and orange tinted glasses, John told the court that he did not recognise a photograph of the complainant. During cross-examination by the prosecutor, Christine Agnew KC, the musician was asked if he remembered Spacey attending the ball, which raised funds for the Elton John Aids Foundation, on one occasion in the early 2000s. John, who gave his name to the court as \u201cElton Hercules John\u201d, said: \u201cYes, because he arrived in white tie, he came on a private jet and came straight to the ball.\u201d Agnew asked him to confirm if Spacey had flown in by private jet and John joked: \u201cI believe so. I don\u2019t think he was wearing white tie on a commercial flight.\u201d \u201cOne never knows,\u201d she returned. John, who struggled to hear the questions over the video link and had to have them repeated by a lawyer in the room in Monaco, said Spacey had stayed at the couple\u2019s home after the ball. \u201cOn the night he attended the ball he stayed overnight at our house,\u201d he said. During the trial, jurors have heard how Spacey bought \u201cthe most expensive Mini Cooper ever\u201d at an auction at the ball and stored it at the couple\u2019s home. John was asked if remembered Spacey coming to collect the car, to which he responded: \u201cI can\u2019t remember him coming down after that, no.\u201d He also faced questions about a picture of himself leaving the Victoria Palace theatre in London after a performance of Billy Elliot. He told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m looking straight forward at my car there. When I come out of the theatre, it\u2019s always a mad rush to get into the car. Anyone who is on my periphery, I wouldn\u2019t notice them. It could be the queen and I wouldn\u2019t notice her.\u201d Furnish also gave evidence via video link from Monaco, saying he remembered Spacey attending the ball \u2013 which was sponsored by OK! Magazine \u2013 on one occasion. The possibility of Spacey attending the ball on more than one occasion has formed part of the evidence at the trial. Agnew asked Furnish, 60, if it was possible that the celebrities attending the charity event could ask not to be photographed. He said: \u201cIt never happened. It was understood we were promoting a charity involving the eradication of stigma surrounding disease. For celebrities wanting to come to our event, it was always understood they needed to be photographed.\u201d He added: \u201cTo have a star of the magnitude of Kevin Spacey and to go to OK! and say he didn\u2019t want to be photographed, that would be an impossible situation for the foundation to be in.\u201d He added that \u201cthere was a lot of buzz and excitement\u201d that the award-winning actor was attending the ball. Wearing a grey suit and blue shirt, Spacey appeared in the dock on Monday, as his trial entered its fourth week. He appeared emotional on Thursday as he described feeling \u201ccrushed\u201d when he found out that the complainant in question had accused him of assaulting him in the early 2000s. In his evidence, he said the pair had a \u201csomewhat sexual\u201d relationship. \u201cI was crushed. I never thought that [the man] I knew would 20 years later stab me in the back,\u201d he said. Spacey denies 12 charges: seven of sexual assault, three of indecent assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

Passersby must navigate the rubble and crumpled shell of a water tank, as well as the debris of an annihilated family life: a red teddy bear, kitchen utensils, scraps of books and clothing. The Adas family were not the targets of the airstrike that hit their neighbour\u2019s house at about 2am on 9 May, in the opening salvo of Israel\u2019s Shield and Arrow operation, but the buildings were less than a metre apart. The GBU-39 bomb that crashed through three floors of the Bahtini home, down into the basement, also blew apart one side of the Adas\u2019s house, killing the family\u2019s two teenage daughters. Dania, 19, died immediately, while her sister, Imam, 17, clung to life for two hours before succumbing to her injuries in hospital. \u201cThe explosion blew the bedroom door off on to me and my wife as we were sleeping, and then I ran into the living room to find the children,\u201d said Alaa Adas, 55, a civil servant. \u201cMy son was there, but my daughters did not respond. When I saw their hair under the rubble my heart stopped.\u201d Shield and Arrow, a surprise Israeli airstrike campaign targeting Islamic Jihad, the second largest militant organisation in the blockaded Gaza Strip after Hamas, began with the targeted assassination of Bahtini and the near-instantaneous killings of two other commanders elsewhere in the strip. Israel claims that it takes pains to avoid civilian deaths in \u201cprecision strikes\u201d targeting high-ranking members of Gaza\u2019s factions. But the timing and ferocity of Shield and Arrow\u2019s opening salvo has led to new action from Israeli rights groups, challenging Israel\u2019s supreme court to launch independent investigations into civilian casualties as per an existing \u2013 but not enforced \u2013 ruling on the use of targeted killings. The assassinations, which came during a ceasefire, led Islamic Jihad to respond with almost 1,500 rockets fired towards Israel over the course of five days before a truce was brokered by Egyptian mediators. The violence left 33 people in Gaza dead, including at least 10 women and children, and, according to Palestinian officials, 103 homes were destroyed and a further 2,800 damaged. Three people were reportedly killed by misfired Islamic Jihad projectiles inside the strip, and in Israel, an 80-year-old woman and a Palestinian worker died. After the ceasefire, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Shield and Arrow as \u201cperfect\u201d due to the low Israeli death toll. He did not mention civilian deaths in Gaza. This sort of Israeli operation is becoming more common. There have been four major wars between Hamas and Israel since the Islamist movement seized control of the strip in 2007, the last of which was fought over 11 days in May 2021. But there have also been three smaller operations since 2019, two of which were surprise attacks: in total, these more limited missions have killed approximately 107 people in Gaza, at least 42 of whom were civilians. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) officials say that technological innovations and artificial intelligence allow attack cells working alongside drones and jets to pinpoint exactly which people and buildings should be targeted. But for the tiny strip\u2019s trapped population of 2.2 million people, these surprise operations are making it clear that if a neighbour is on Israel\u2019s kill list, other families are also in danger. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a commander living in this building,\u201d said Abu Hamza, 55, who lives in a high-rise in downtown Gaza City that was hit in May, killing the senior Jihad figure Tareq Ezzedine and his 12- and eight-year-old children, as well as a dentist living on the floor below, his wife, and the couple\u2019s 19-year-old son. \u201cIf they have such sophisticated weapons, why can\u2019t they hit targets when they are in the car or somewhere else, away from families and innocent people sleeping?\u201d Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups allege that Israel\u2019s assessments surrounding acceptable civilian casualties in airstrikes are changing, even though an Israeli supreme court ruling from 2006 states that targeted killings are only legal if certain conditions are met \u2013 including avoiding civilian deaths as much as possible. In the past, Israeli officials have claimed it was not known that women and children would be killed in strikes targeting members of Gaza\u2019s armed groups. But during Shield and Arrow the language used by the government and IDF shifted markedly, suggesting that instead measures were taken to reduce \u201cnecessary\u201d collateral damage. Far-right members of Israel\u2019s new government campaigned on promises of a \u201ctougher stance\u201d against the Palestinians, and are also seeking to curb the powers of the supreme court, which plays an important checks and balances role. The IDF\u2019s chief of staff, Herzl Halevi, said the air force carried out \u201caccurate action that hurt terrorist targets while minimising the damage to uninvolved parties. If we could, we would have operated without hurting uninvolved people at all, but we must remember terrorists act from inside the civilian population and put Gazan residents in danger.\u201d The IDF maintains that Shield and Arrow was a proportionate response against violence emanating from the strip, and the assassinations were postponed twice to \u201censure suitable conditions and minimise civilian casualties\u201d. But on the grounds that the existing supreme court ruling on targeted killings is not enforced, Public Committee Against Torture Israel (PCATI) and Yesh Gvul, an NGO that plays a watchdog role on the Israeli military, have recently launched a petition demanding Israel\u2019s attorney general establish an independent investigation into civilian harm in Gaza. \u201cIf an independent committee is not formed to examine the legality of the military\u2019s recent actions in Gaza, as mandated by the supreme court, Israel will have manifested that it is neither willing nor able to observe international law and the rule of law. This will open the door to intervention by international institutions, like the international criminal court,\u201d a statement from the two human rights organisations said. \u201cNot only has Israel thus far not conducted an independent inquiry, it did not provide any evidence that the individuals targeted for assassination presented a clear and present danger; as far as we know the IDF did not warn neighbours or nearby civilians of the looming assassination, nor does it appear it actively attempted to limit so-called collateral damage.\u201d In emailed comments, the ministry of justice spokesperson, Efrat Oren, said the attorney general\u2019s office had received the petition, and would reply in due course. The issue of targeted killings, however, has increasing relevance outside the Gaza Strip. The occupied West Bank has witnessed more bloodshed in 2022 and 2023 than at any point since the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, drew to a close in 2005 \u2013 and this year, Israel began using armed drones and airstrikes in the northern city of Jenin for the first time in nearly two decades. \u201cIsrael\u2019s supreme court sees the ruling [on investigating civilian harm caused by targeted killings] as more applicable to the West Bank than Gaza, as it does not view Gaza as still under occupation,\u201d said Michael Sfard, a well-known human rights lawyer, who filed the petition to the attorney general on behalf of PCAT and Yesh Gvul. \u201cSo this petition is very relevant. What\u2019s interesting is that Israel of 2023 is using the pretexts of two decades ago to deal with the rule of law and international law now. Today it seems that the Israeli government no longer pretends like its actions are in accordance with the rulings of an independent judiciary \u2026 I just don\u2019t think this government cares.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d872f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/17/tom-jenkins-best-shots-of-wimbledon-2023-in-pictures", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tom Jenkins\u2019 best shots of Wimbledon 2023 \u2013 in pictures", "lead": "Our photographer Tom Jenkins looks back at two glorious weeks of tennis in SW19", "author": "Tom Jenkins", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 12:25:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625060", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf6a110ef7fdad76ace5bfd96b1fe29fea501bf3/3_402_5892_3535/500.jpg", "body": "This year\u2019s tournament saw a changing of the guard in the men\u2019s singles, with 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz beating the veteran reigning champion Novak Djokovic in the final.

Where is the Kerch Bridge? The Kerch Bridge, also known as the Crimean Bridge, was built by Russia after it invaded and de-facto annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The 12-mile bridge, which includes a separate roadway and railway, spans the Kerch Strait and connects Crimea with mainland Russia. The construction was announced in 2014 and completed in 2018. The bridge holds great symbolic importance for the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin celebrated the opening of the bridge by driving a Kamaz truck from Kerch to Crimea and telling workers they had performed \u201ca miracle\u201d. What happened? There were reports of several explosions targeting the bridge at around 3am on Monday. Video taken from the adjacent railway bridge showed the blasts had shorn off a section of the road bridge near pillar 145, making it impossible for traffic to cross that section. Russia claimed there was no damage to the pillars themselves, which would have required extensive repairs. A married couple were killed and their 14-year-old daughter was injured in the blast. Russian officials said her life was not in danger. This is the second time the bridge has been hit by an explosion since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. In October, a truck bomb detonated on the bridge, causing several spans of roadway to collapse into the water. Russia blamed Ukraine for that explosion, but Kyiv has not taken responsibility for it. Russia moved quickly to complete the repairs, with Putin driving a Mercedes over the bridge in early December and the formal reopening to road traffic taking place in late February. How was Monday\u2019s attack carried out? Early reports suggest the attack was done through several unmanned, explosive-carrying amphibious vehicles, or sea drones, that were directed to the bridge and then detonated from beneath the roadway. Russia has blamed the attack on Ukraine, with the national anti-terrorist committee, a security services agency, saying: \u201cTwo Ukrainian unmanned underwater vehicles carried out an attack on the Crimean Bridge.\u201d Ukraine has not publicly taken responsibility for the attack and has a policy of disavowing attacks in Crimea and raids into mainland Russia. Aerial and seaborne unmanned vehicles have been used in previous attacks on Russian bases and the Black Sea fleet in Crimea. Some officials have hinted that the attack was carried out by Ukrainian special forces. In a post on Telegram, the SBU Security Service of Ukraine wrote: \u201cThe bridge has gone to sleep again.\u201d A military intelligence spokesperson called the bridge a \u201csuperfluous structure\u201d. How is Russia defending the bridge? Since the October attack, Russia has employed extraordinary security measures to defend the structure. Tourists travelling to Crimea during the holiday season reported queueing for hours as security forces checked every vehicle crossing the bridge for explosives. Russia beefed up anti-air defences to prevent an aerial or missile attack on the bridge. It also reportedly deployed a \u201ctarget barge\u201d with radar reflectors meant to act as a decoy for any guided missiles targeting the bridge. And in the wider region, the Russian navy has reportedly built new pens for dolphins trained at military facilities to protect its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol (the dolphins have been trained to target enemy divers). Before the war, Russia claimed the bridge was \u201ccomprehensively protected on the ground, from the air and from the water and under the water\u201d. In remarks to the Tass news agency, the Russian National Guard chief, Viktor Zolotov, said anti-saboteur boats patrolled the waters adjacent to the bridge and combat swimmers were deployed to check the waters beneath it. Some Ukrainian officials used those heightened defences to deflect questions about whether Kyiv was behind the attack. According to a translation by NBC, Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern command, told Ukrainian media: \u201cGiven the unprecedented security measures that the Russians have been taking for a long time around the Crimean Bridge, they most likely controlled this entire situation and it continues to unfold according to the script programmed by them.\u201d What is the result of the attack? The attack is a blow to the Kremlin\u2019s prestige and is the latest blowback from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on to territories that Moscow claims to control. Russian tourists wanting to leave the peninsula are being rerouted through newly occupied Russian territories in south-east Ukraine. The bridge is the only direct transport route that goes between mainland Russia and Crimea, although Russia can also supply the peninsula via its occupied territories or ferries from Kerch. The extent of the damage to the roadway bridge is still unclear, and the railway bridge, which carries freight that could include military vehicles and equipment, appears not to be affected."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8731", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jul/17/viewfinder-review-sad-owl-thunderful", "primaryCategory": "games", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Viewfinder review \u2013 the magic of stepping into a picture", "lead": "What if the photos you took became real?

It\u2019s all too easy to erase something essential by mistake (like a teleporter), but mistakes are easily undone by holding down the rewind button and scrubbing backwards through time. Viewfinder is forgiving, playful. It encourages curiosity. The best moments are when your curiosity is indulged. Finding a cubist painting and discovering that it becomes a huge, colourful maze when you place it down, with a secret hidden in one of the rooms. Entering a photo of a corridor only to discover there\u2019s a room round the corner at the end, just out of sight. These moments are more like occasional treats, however. For the most part you\u2019ll be flipping switches and manhandling batteries into place. The camera is only part of Viewfinder\u2019s toolbox. Other levels base puzzles around things like changing the visual filter of the landscape, lining up fragmented pictures or navigating trompe l\u2019oeil illusions. New quirks and twists are constantly introduced, but nothing is quite as exciting as the wonder of the camera, taking a snapshot and then walking into the picture. There\u2019s a story behind all this, a plot about entering a computer simulation to discover the lost work of some brilliant scientists who might have found a solution to climate change. But it feels inessential, a piece of narrative sticky tape to connect otherwise abstract levels. However, the plot does give us Cait, a Lewis Carroll-esque Cheshire cat of the virtual kind, who provides some welcome company in otherwise lonely landscapes. Viewfinder is magical, then, but also short-lived. Even with the optional puzzles, you can easily finish the whole thing over two or three evenings, and it never quite capitalises on the promise of the camera, the promise of getting lost inside picture after picture after picture. Each level is bespoke, tiny; although the very final sequence, a timed dash through puzzle after puzzle, hints at a grander potential. I\u2019m left dazzled by the possibilities, but ultimately wanting more. \u2022 Viewfinder is released on PC and PS5 on 18 July."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8732", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/17/labour-mps-keir-starmer-tories-two-child-benefit-limit", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour MPs attack Starmer\u2019s commitment to keep Tories\u2019 two-child benefit limit", "lead": "Campaigners react on policy that has been criticised as one of the biggest drivers of child poverty", "author": "Patrick Butler Social policy editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 11:42:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625118", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/222a5884fd5f4098d7182c4338b630c8e932e9c5/0_58_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Labour MPs and anti-poverty campaigners have attacked Keir Starmer\u2019s commitment to keep the Conservatives\u2019 controversial two-child benefit limit. Starmer told the BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show that Labour was \u201cnot changing that policy\u201d, which has been widely criticised as unfair, cruel, ineffective on its own terms, and one of the biggest drivers of child poverty. Meg Hillier, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, and chair of the influential Commons public accounts committee, told the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour: \u201cWell, I was never comfortable about having the child benefit cap come in \u2026 personally, I\u2019d be lobbying for a lifting of that.\u201d Rosie Duffield, Labour MP for Canterbury, who is on the centre-right of the party, responded to Starmer\u2019s comments by describing the two-child policy as \u201cone of the most unpleasant pieces of legislation ever to have been passed in the UK\u201d. She tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for someone to enter the House of Commons having been on tax credits, but myself and a few others did in 2017; scrapping this cruel policy was one of our shared political motives.\u201d The two-child limit bars parents from claiming child tax credit or universal credit for any third or subsequent child born after April 2017. Affected low-income families are left at least \u00a33,000 out of pocket. Larger families, and minority ethnic households are disproportionately affected. It was designed to force parents of larger families to find a job or work more hours, but academic studies showed its main function has been to impoverish families rather than increase employment. Starmer\u2019s stance is seen by some in the party as failure of Labour\u2019s determination to tackle child poverty. Nevertheless, some insiders have suggested Starmer \u2013 who said in 2020 he wanted to scrap it in order to help \u201ctackle the vast social injustice in our country\u201d \u2013 could revisit the policy if the public finances improved. Abolishing the two-child limit would cost around \u00a31.3bn, which shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is reported to regard as unaffordable in the present economic climate. However, removing it would lift 250,000 children out of poverty and a further 850,000 children out of deep poverty. Campaigners say it is the most cost-effective way of reducing child poverty. The Labour left has made clear it is opposed to Labour keeping the two-child cap. Birkenhead MP Mick Whitley tweeted: \u201cThe two-child cap is causing misery for thousands of young people in Birkenhead. This is the wrong call.\u201d Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that we now need an honest and fundamental discussion in the Labour party about child poverty, its causes and the impact of the policies introduced by the Tories, including the two-child limit, because it\u2019s obvious some in the party don\u2019t fully appreciate its impact.\u201d Labour\u2019s refusal to commit to scrap the two-child limit was received with disappointment an incredulity among anti-poverty campaigners, social policy academics, and left-leaning thinktanks. Former children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield tweeted: \u201cThe two-child benefit cap is an unfair, bad policy, and it should be scrapped by whoever is in government.\u201d Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society thinktank, tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m happy with Labour\u2019s new line on the 2-child limit. It is a vicious policy that seeds child deprivation. And a nasty dog whistle (what sort of families have 3+ children in modern Britain?) Reversing it is fairly cheap &amp; lasers in on hardship.\u201d Ruth Patrick, senior lecturer in social policy at York University and co-author of a research project into the two-child limit published on Monday, said: \u201cThe two-child limit must be abolished if Labour is to have any credibility as a party committed to tackling child poverty. \u201cEvery day the two-child limit remains, more children are born into a country that does not provide adequate support for them to meet their most basic of needs. This can and must change, and any political party should be proud to be the one to make that change by abolishing the two-child limit.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8733", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/17/weather-tracker-temperatures-to-intensify-in-europe-as-new-heatwave-hits", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Weather tracker: temperatures to intensify in Europe as new heatwave hits", "lead": "Spain, Italy, Greece and parts of Balkans to be worst affected, with some areas braced for possible 48C", "author": "Matt Andrews/MetDesk", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 11:41:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625136", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/336adfe31c5929ff826fc051f10a1493336ac66a/0_0_6297_3778/500.jpg", "body": "In contrast to the rather cool, unsettled and unseasonably windy weather in the UK, large parts of southern Europe are in the grip of intense and dangerous heatwave conditions. Temperatures reached the mid to high 30s celsius last week, in what was named by the Italian Meteorological Society as the Cerberus heatwave. A temperature of 44.8C (112.6F) was observed in Almer\u00eda, Spain, on Wednesday. By Saturday, temperatures were peaking at 41C in Greece, 44C in Turkey and 39C in southern Germany. These extreme temperatures forced authorities to close the Acropolis in Athens during the hottest part of the day to protect tourists. Elsewhere, a large forest fire on La Palma destroyed at least 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres) of land and forced the evacuation of more than 4,000 people. Temperatures are set to intensify this week as heatwave Charon develops, and in some locations may approach European records. The heat has been building as a result of a large area of high pressure across central parts of Mediterranean, and even hotter conditions will develop as a surge of high temperatures moves in from north Africa. The hottest places will be across Spain, Italy, Greece and parts of the Balkans. The Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia may approach 48C on Tuesday and Wednesday, close to the all-time European record of 48.8C set in Sicily in August 2021. Record-breaking heat is also expected in Rome. Meanwhile, at least 37 people died after days of heavy rain led to severe flooding and landslides in central South Korea on Friday and Saturday. North Gyeongsang province was one of the worst-affected areas. Heavy rain swept away cars and submerged roads and a landslide caused the derailment of a train in North Chungcheong. Flood water trapped people in a tunnel near the city of Cheongju, resulting in the deaths of at least nine people. Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate and tens of thousands of homes and businesses have been left without electricity. Further heavy rainfall is expected on Monday and Tuesday but conditions should improve later in the week."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8734", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/17/paralympian-anne-wafula-strike-uk-sports-venues-fully-accessible-toilets", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Paralympian leads call for all UK sports venues to have fully accessible toilets", "lead": "Anne Wafula Strike tells ministers that lack of facilities leading to \u2018serious injustice\u2019 for disabled athletes and sports fans", "author": "Diane Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 11:17:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625156", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aa96dca3990e3266ef8cc61660f88734509685c8/0_830_3102_1860/500.jpg", "body": "Disabled athletes and sports fans are urging ministers to ensure that UK sporting venues have fully accessible toilets so they can enjoy sport in the same way as everybody else. At the moment fewer than 10% of venues have these facilities. The Paralympic athlete and campaigner Anne Wafula Strike has written to the sports minister, Lucy Frazer, and the disability minister, Tom Pursglove, saying that current facilities are leading to \u201cserious injustice\u201d and are preventing disabled fans and athletes from enjoying sport. There are two types of toilets for people with disabilities \u2013 accessible toilets that are big enough to accommodate a standard wheelchair and have a height-adjusted toilet and sink, and changing places toilets that are bigger and can accommodate disabled people with greater support needs, including those using larger power-assisted wheelchairs and those who need one or two carers to accompany them to the toilet, those who need hoists, an adult-sized changing table and space on both sides of the toilet giving more room to manoeuvre. There are more than 250,000 disabled people who need a changing places toilet but there are currently just 1,893 of them registered in various parts of the UK. According to government mapping there are many areas that need to improve provision of these toilets and nine areas that have none of them at all. To put the 1,893 figure into context, Wembley Stadium has 2,618 toilet cubicles and urinals including two changing places toilets and 147 accessible toilets. The government has allocated more than \u00a360m in recent years for the provision of changing places toilets but campaigners say that, while this support is welcome, there are still far too many gaps in provision. A campaign to increase the number of changing places toilets at sporting venues is being coordinated by Rise For Sport which wants to see them in every sporting venue by 2023 to allow everyone to participate in or spectate in their favourite sport. In her letter to ministers, shared with the Guardian, Wafula Strike, who went public in 2017 about how she was forced to wet herself on a train due to a lack of an accessible working toilet, said current legislation does not go far enough. It states that while any newly built venue for more than 350 people must include a changing places toilet there is no legal requirement on existing venues to provide one. It leaves people with disabilities such as motor neurone disease, cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis faced with the choice of either staying at home, only going out for a couple of hours or being changed on a dirty toilet floor or in the back of a car. \u201cThis is an urgent issue and needs to be addressed by a change in legislation to ensure that disabled people are not left behind,\u201d Wafula Strike says in her letter. She has called for a meeting with ministers as soon as possible. \u201cSport is such an important part of society. It has played a huge role in my life and it is saddening to hear disabled people face barriers to access,\u201d she adds. Three disabled sports fans, wheelchair users with cerebral palsy, have launched a petition calling for all sports venues to have changing places toilets. Lorna Fillingham, a disability campaigner who has a 13-year-old daughter with cerebral palsy who needs to use a changing places toilet, said: \u201cMy daughter cannot stand or walk. She needs 24-hour support. I wouldn\u2019t even consider taking her to a sporting event because of the lack of changing places toilets. Disabled people talk about \u2018pee maths\u2019, limiting fluids so they won\u2019t need to use a toilet while they\u2019re out. At the age of 13 my daughter\u2019s world should be expanding but it\u2019s shrinking.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to see a step-change in the number of changing places toilets across the country. We recently announced up to \u00a330.5m funding to local authorities in England to boost the number of larger accessible toilets over three years. Changing places toilets are a vital facility for people who cannot use standard accessible toilets and for their family and carers. \u201cThat\u2019s why they will be installed in existing buildings and we have made it compulsory for new public buildings to have them, including sports stadiums.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8735", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/17/us-climate-envoy-kerry-meets-chinese-counterpart-amid-record-heat", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US climate envoy meets Chinese counterpart on hottest ever day in China", "lead": "John Kerry arrives in Beijing as temperature hits 52.2C in Xinjiang \u2013 where authorities tell workers and students to stay at home", "author": "Emma Graham-Harrison in Taipei", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 11:10:28", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625175", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7537473582937b340752485f33025b3b30ee1b98/585_146_2780_1668/500.jpg", "body": "A remote township in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region has set a nationwide temperature record of 52.2C, as the US climate envoy, John Kerry, held meetings with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, in Beijing. The temperature was reached on Sunday at Sanbao township in the Turpan Depression, the China Meteorological Administration said in a statement. It broke a previous record of 50.6C, set in July 2017, the CMA said. Sanbao lies on the outskirts of the city of Turpan, where authorities have told workers and students to stay at home and ordered special vehicles to spray water on major thoroughfares. Ground surface temperatures reached 80C in parts of Turpan on Sunday, according to the CMA. Large swaths of Asia, Europe and the US have been sweltering in extreme heatwaves in recent weeks, which scientists say are being exacerbated by the climate crisis. Methane emissions and China\u2019s coal consumption are expected to be at the top of Kerry\u2019s agenda in his first formal talks with Xie in nearly a year. The pair will probably also discuss preparations for the Cop28 climate summit later this year. Hot weather and drought have driven power shortages in eastern Sichuan province, where low water levels in hydropower dams have led to power rationing. Because Sichuan usually sends electricity to other parts of China, the impact could spread. Kerry said he hoped this week\u2019s meetings would show that the world\u2019s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases had renewed their focus on tackling the climate crisis. \u201cIn the next three days we hope we can begin taking some big steps that will send a signal to the world about the serious purpose of China and the United States to address a common risk, threat, challenge to all of humanity, created by humans themselves,\u201d Kerry was quoted saying before the talks. China is the largest producer of renewable power from solar and wind generation, and Kerry praised Beijing\u2019s \u201cincredible job\u201d building up capacity. The country has promised to hit peak carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. It is also the world\u2019s biggest producer and consumer of coal-generated electricity, a major source of emissions. It has vowed to start reducing coal consumption by 2026, although approval of new coal-fired generating capacity has increased since last year, Reuters reported. China is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of global heating, with scarce water resources, a large population and an already serious problem with desertification. Beijing has said global agreements on reducing greenhouse gases should take more account of historic emissions \u2013 an area where countries that industrialised decades or centuries before still outpace China and other fast-growing economies. Otherwise, the climate crisis risks becoming an excuse for hobbling China\u2019s growth, officials have said. Beijing\u2019s reluctance to reach agreements may also be in part due to uncertainty about the outcome of next year\u2019s US presidential election, and whether there will still be a White House administration interested in change. Kerry\u2019s trip is part of a flurry of high-level delegations flying to Beijing to try to shore up ties between the two countries. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, had visited China before him. China suspended all high-level diplomatic contacts with the US last August, after the then speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, visited Taiwan, which Beijing claims should come under its rule. The disruption included climate talks between the world\u2019s two biggest emitters, even as the climate crisis gathered pace, and despite a long personal connection between Kerry and Xie. The two have met dozens of times across negotiating tables and had a private dinner together on Sunday night."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8736", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/mystery-object-wa-beach-green-head-western-australia", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mystery object: Australian police warn public away from huge cylinder found washed up on WA beach", "lead": "Object at Green Head, 250km from Perth in Western Australia, could be from an Indian space rocket, experts said, but police say it is not hazardous", "author": "Mostafa Rachwani", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 11:09:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625194", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e68c90a93e0264f9d8401b5e92bb9a10d725df6/0_189_2238_1343/500.jpg", "body": "A giant metal cylinder has washed up on a beach in Western Australia, baffling locals and posing a mystery to police.

WA police confirmed that they did not believe the object originated from a commercial aircraft but were unsure what it was and were treating it as hazardous. However, in a statement on Monday night, police said analysis of the object by the state\u2019s fire department\u2019s chemistry centre had \u201cdetermined the object is safe and there is no current risk to the community\u201d. They added that it would be removed \u201cfollowing formal identification of the item and its origin\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Police were coordinating a joint investigation into its origins, and asked the public to stay away from the object. \u201cThis measure has been taken to ensure the preservation of potential evidence and facilitate further expert examination.\u201d The huge cylinder looks partly damaged in videos posted to social media, and does not look like anything from a regular aircraft. It appears to have detached from something, with the bottom half looking like it was ripped from its origin. Police immediately dismissed the idea it had come from the vanished flight MH370, which disappeared on its journey from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. A spokesperson for the Australian Space Agency said it was making enquiries related to the object. \u201cThe agency is working to confirm whether the object could be part of a foreign space launch vehicle that has washed up on shore, and liaising with global counterparts who may be able to provide information about the object. \u201cAs the origin of the object is unknown, the community should avoid handling or attempting to move the object.\u201d Dr Alice Gorman, an expert in the field of space archaeology, said she believes the object is a fuel cylinder that came from the the third stage of India\u2019s polar satellite launch vehicle rocket, as many have suggested on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising because it\u2019s such a large fragment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it makes you wonder what was going on at the time, if maybe a marine weather event dislodged it and brought it ashore. \u201cIt is very interesting though, and is a way regular everyday people can get close to space, as often these things turn into souvenirs. People like to keep some space junk.\u201d Gorman said police were right to stop people from attending the site, saying the cylinder likely contained toxic materials. \u201cA lot of rocket fuel is actually quite toxic, even though this one\u2019s been around for a while, and clearly it hasn\u2019t killed off any of the things growing on it, that precaution is justified \u2013 a lot of rocket fuels are not very friendly to living things.\u201d Gorman said she believes the cylinder likely fell from a launch in the past decade, and that it was likely now full of \u201cdirt and sand\u201d. She said the next step involves identifying its true source and returning it to its original country of origin, as per the UN\u2019s Outer Space Treaty."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8737", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/17/susie-mccabe-femme-fatality-edinburgh-fringe", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Susie McCabe: \u2018The worst advice I\u2019ve had?

Yes! I went to visit a friend who\u2019d been diagnosed with stage four cancer. A couple of weeks later, I was talking with another friend about how life is all right and you don\u2019t know how lucky you are. I\u2019d just turned 30 at the time and I thought we\u2019d grown up in a really turbulent time. If only I\u2019d known. They said: \u201cWe should do something to scare ourselves.\u201d I thought: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t jump out of a plane.\u201d He suggested a comedy course with a gig at the end of it. The rest is history. Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny? There was this Christmas gig in a pub on the outskirts of Glasgow. It was Black Friday and all the 18 to 22-year-olds who worked at the local call centre had decided they were finishing at five and going out to this comedy night. But the comedy was an inconvenience to their evening. The gig started at 9pm, they\u2019d been there for four hours. It was so bad that the comics just did the gig to each other. It was the only thing we could do, but we had to do the gig to get paid. If you\u2019re booked, you always do your time. Do you have any pre-show rituals? I tend to listen to music and shower. I know showering sounds daft but it\u2019s a reset as that\u2019s me going to work. If I\u2019ve got up and had a shower that morning, I\u2019ll still have one before my gig. For me it\u2019s quite important to always listen to the same playlist of about 100 songs. What\u2019s your current show, Femme Fatality, about? There\u2019s been a lot of chat about womanhood recently so I decided to look at how my gender and identity have been something that has taken me until now to understand \u2013 and that I\u2019m a gay woman. Even though I\u2019ve been living as a gay woman since I was 17. I talk about the time, the society and the country I grew up in, and the careers I\u2019d chosen before I became a standup, and all of that comes together and we have a lot of fun. What is the best advice you\u2019ve ever been given? Enjoy the moment and appreciate your success. And the worst? \u201cDon\u2019t be too gay in your material, men don\u2019t like that.\u201d Heaven forbid they get a woman who\u2019s gay on stage \u2013 this will throw men! And stuff like, \u201cYou need to change how you look and you need to change who you are to be accepted on a stage.\u201d I never did change and I\u2019ve always been accepted on stage. Ironically, the people who have given me this advice no longer do comedy. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? The frustration for me \u2013 I\u2019m in my 40s, working-class, Scottish \u2013 is there\u2019s not many of our voices on the TV. I certainly didn\u2019t grow up with voices like mine on the TV. It\u2019s getting better with regards to the industry moving out of London, looking further afield and trying to be more representative of minority communities. I think class is more important now that ever. My other bugbear is people looking down their nose at club comics. Club comics do an awful lot of heavy lifting at the weekend because you and your art don\u2019t always make people laugh. You have to be able to do both. Go out and present your art as an artist at festivals and fringes, and you still have to be able to go into a club, anywhere in the UK, and make people laugh. What are you currently excited about? Everything! I\u2019m getting married in September \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a great wedding.

It seemed like a safe job. Instead, Wood experienced thousands of dollars in wage theft and is one of more than 40 workers for a federal contractor who have been trying since 2015 to recoup their pay. They have yet to receive any of it. Workers say the contractor \u2013 Consultis \u2013 and government agencies have deflected responsibility to one another for over $500,000 in back pay owed to workers for this contract alone. \u201cI ended up with over $42,000 in wage loss,\u201d said Wood. \u201cDespite the Department of Labor ruling in our favor, we didn\u2019t get the money.\u201d Wood said the hardship that followed the wage theft pushed her and her partner to leave Florida, where her family had lived for generations. \u201cI sold my car. We left our families. We ended up moving to Colorado,\u201d Wood said. Wage theft of workers employed by federal contractors under the Service Contract Act is not uncommon. In 2021, the US Department of Labor\u2019s wage and hour division recovered more than $48m in back wages owed to more than 21,000 workers on federal contracts. Federal contractors found to have conducted wage theft are supposed to be excluded from receiving new contracts for three years but enforcement is lax, according to a government survey. An October 2020 report by the Government Accountability Office noted that in the previous five years, the Department of Labor conducted more than 5,000 compliance investigations resulting in over $220m in back wages for workers, but only 60 contractors were excluded from receiving federal contracts for three years. A 2017 report by the Center for Public Integrity found many federal contractors who commit wage theft continue receiving lucrative federal contracts. In some cases, there also appears to be a reluctance within government agencies to right wrongs for fear of causing issues elsewhere, according to emails obtained by the Guardian. A US Department of Labor wage and hour division investigator in Orlando, Florida, wrote to the Department of Veteran Affairs in October 2015, noting 44 current and former employees were not paid correct wages and fringe benefits while working for Consultis from September 2013 to October 2015. The investigator noted in the letter that the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that supports and assists in managing the functions of other federal agencies, claimed it could not add the wage determinations retroactively to the contract \u201cbecause it could possibly impact other contracts with undeterminable repercussions across the US\u201d. Another document from the labor department noted the GSA claimed \u201cit would result in great confusion and potentially cause many claims against the government\u201d if the agency added required wage determinations to the contract retroactively. Joey Mendoza, a former IT contractor with Consultis at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), first discovered he and his co-workers were being underpaid in 2014 while looking through the contract after workers were notified of a possible furlough. Mendoza initially filed the complaint with the Department of Labor. He is owed more than $29,000 plus interest in back pay. \u201cI want that money because it\u2019s owed to me, because I worked hard for it. I worked overtime. I did everything I was supposed to do,\u201d said Mendoza, who said he struggled financially while working for about $14 an hour. \u201cFinancially, that set me back so far. I\u2019m still dealing with the waves of it, the repercussions. Eight years dealing with this. What kills me is I can\u2019t get a single person to explain to me why it\u2019s OK: why the VA put in writing we are owed this money, Consultis put in writing we are owed this money, the civilian board of contract appeals put in writing we are owed this money, the Department of Labor put in writing we are owed this money. So where is the money?\u201d In a May 2016 letter, Consultis chief financial officer Bob Hageman wrote a letter to the Department of Veteran Affairs outlining the back wages owed to 30 workers totaling over $560,000 plus interest. Desiree Yates, one of the affected workers who is still owed more than $37,000 plus interest in unpaid wages, provided emails and documents from the Department of Labor that noted the Department of Veteran Affairs deferred responsibility to the GSA to modify the contract. Despite the outstanding unpaid wages, the VA renewed the contract with a different contractor that used Consultis as a subcontractor. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s really nothing in place to ensure that we get paid that back pay, the lost wages, because essentially what happened was Consultis was getting paid an amount to pay us, and they were pocketing a lot of it,\u201d said Yates. \u201cWe\u2019ve filed report after report to the GSA saying we still haven\u2019t been paid. Because of the type of contract, it\u2019s actually their responsibility. They should have ensured that Consultis paid us properly and they should be paying us and then work it out with Consultis. They keep telling us to go to Consultis.\u201d Yates said after the Department of Labor investigation, their wages were fixed under a new contract, but the workers have not received any back pay for the wages they\u2019re still owed. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve been fighting this for so long, it\u2019s become like a second job to me to be constantly spending time on this email after email,\u201d added Yates. \u201cWe would like the GSA held accountable, to hold the contract company up to par; we want insurance to ensure they\u2019re going to do better in the future, we want to get paid back what we\u2019re owed and we want interest on that because of the insane hoops they\u2019ve put us through.\u201d Consultis, the General Services Administration and the Department of Veteran Affairs did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \u201cConsultis, the prime contractor and responsible party, was informed of the retroactive incorporation of the applicable wage determinations but did not agree to pay the affected workers the wages owed,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Labor said in an email. \u201cThe Wage and Hour division attempted to find other federal funds to withhold but found no active contracts with Consultis. Therefore, no federal funds were available for withholding or cross-withholding. Due to these factors, funds could not be recovered for the affected employees.\u201d Another worker who is still owed thousands of dollars in wages said due to the statute of limitations when the initial complaint was filed, they are likely owed much more in back pay for years of underpaid work for a federal contractor. They requested to remain anonymous because they still work for a government agency. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ll never see any of that money,\u201d they said. \u201cIt strikes me the most in this situation is that a federal agency found for the class; they said the class was wronged, that we were underpaid. But yet, at the same time, everybody escapes accountability. They\u2019ve all pointed fingers at each other and said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not my responsibility.\u2019\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d873a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/disney-marvel-pixar-have-the-studios-blown-it-streaming-glut-blockbuster", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Have Hollywood studios blown it with the streaming glut?

It was only in February that the mouse house\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger, told shareholders that the mega-studio needed to get \u201cbetter at curating\u201d franchise content for Star Wars and Marvel because of the extraordinary expense of creating it. Now, in the middle of the company\u2019s worst box office slump in years, Iger this week told CNBC that Disney would be both \u201cspending less on what we make, and making less\u201d in the years to come. It\u2019s a response to movies such as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Pixar\u2019s Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny all struggling to put bums on seats for various reasons. Each of these films falls under the Disney mantle via its various sub-studios (Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm), as the company has hoovered up so many of its rivals in recent years. That all creates fabulous material for Disney+, but also means there\u2019s an ever-expanding need for more and more movies and interconnected TV shows to keep all the sofa-bound, slavering content-hounds happy. You might think it would be rather unwise to let all those subscribers know they can expect a lot less new material coming through in future. It doesn\u2019t feel like a week goes by without one of my favourite Amazon Prime shows switching to a channel that requires an extra subscription fee, but the streaming site is hardly shouting this to the rooftops. Iger, on the other hand, almost seems to be blaming Disney+ for causing all the studio\u2019s issues. \u201cWe would have liked some of our more recent releases to perform better,\u201d Iger told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s reflective not as a problem from a personnel perspective, but I think in our zeal to basically grow our content significantly to serve mostly our streaming offerings, we ended up taxing our people way beyond \u2013 in terms of their time and their focus \u2013 where they had been.\u201d \u201cMarvel\u2019s a great example of that,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey had not been in the TV business at any significant level. Not only did they increase their movie output, but they ended up making a number of television series, and frankly, it diluted focus and attention. That is, I think, more of the cause than anything.\u201d How this works is beyond me. Were the few extra licks of creativity plunged into She-Hulk and Ms Marvel really responsible for Quantumania\u2019s listless storyline and unfocused script? Have Pixar\u2019s recent ventures into episodic streaming content somehow made Elemental less of a box-office event? The latter seems more likely. There has been much industry talk of audiences failing to get excited about turning up to the multiplex for a new movie that they would most likely have had the chance to catch at home during the Covid-19 lockdown. And this is something, to be fair, that distributors have been warning about for years. Anyone recall 2013\u2019s Best Buy system, which would have allowed the 1% to purchase new movies on the same day as they turned up in cinemas for $500 a pop on top of $35,000 in set-up costs? Then there was start-up Screening Room in 2016, which followed a similar business model. Distributors fought tooth and nail to keep first-run movies in cinemas, claiming that a shift to the small screen would put multiplexes out of business and lead to a degradation of the film-going experience. Iger\u2019s comments seem to suggest that they might have been right, although the future has panned out somewhat differently to how many imagined. A huge element has been the pandemic, which sent a glut of high-profile new movies straight to people\u2019s homes because multiplexes were unable to open. Cinema chains are struggling, with Cineworld at one point entering bankruptcy. But rather than pile on more streaming misery, giants such as Disney seem to be waking up to the possibility that this brave new world of home content has the potential to cause problems for the entire industry \u2013 including themselves. Who knew that convincing audiences they no longer need to go to the cinema would torpedo a blockbuster movie model that\u2019s been in place since the mid-1970s? Well you can\u2019t say nobody warned us."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d873b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/china-to-fill-the-gap-in-solomon-islands-budget-as-pm-blasts-unneighbourly-australia-and-us", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "China to \u2018fill the gap\u2019 in Solomon Islands budget as PM blasts \u2018unneighbourly\u2019 Australia and US", "lead": "Manasseh Sogavare accuses Australia of pulling budget support amid continuing fallout from Honiara\u2019s policing pact with Beijing", "author": "Ben Doherty", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:40:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625288", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6358aca92c06cfceaabd9ae2000ab7ef2787a265/0_100_5295_3177/500.jpg", "body": "China will \u201cfill the gap\u201d in Solomon Islands\u2019 troubled budget, after Australia and other traditional development partners suddenly withdrew millions of dollars in promised funding, the country\u2019s prime minister has claimed. While the Albanese government immediately denied the claim, Manasseh Sogavare again condemned Australia and the US for criticising his country\u2019s policing pact with China, saying while Australian and other Pacific police forces were its \u201cpartner of choice\u201d, China was a welcomed additional security ally. \u201cIt takes only nine hours\u2019 flight from China to land forces here,\u201d he said. The Australian government said no development funding had been withdrawn. \u201cAustralia has delivered on our budget support commitments,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian. Sogavare, a four-time prime minister with an oft-troubled relationship with Australia, gave a rare \u2013 and excoriating \u2013 press conference at Honiara airport immediately upon his return from a week-long visit to China. He said China had agreed to patch the Solomons\u2019 ailing budget for this year and blamed the country\u2019s traditional aid partners \u2013 citing Australia and New Zealand \u2013 for agreeing to cover the shortfall but then reneging. \u201cSome of our donor partners who have committed to providing budget support to us this year have since changed their position and delayed their assistance for us and we are struggling to finance the 2023 budget,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has left this country and people in a predicament. But I am glad to announce, and delighted to announce, the People\u2019s Republic of China has really stepped up to provide this budget support needed for 2023.\u201d Sogavare said China was providing in health, agriculture and sport, in building infrastructure and in addressing climate change. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said China might \u201cvery well be the answer to \u2013 not all \u2013 but most of our challenges\u201d, but also that the Solomons needed to free itself from the \u201cyoke\u201d of foreign assistance. \u201cI will not allow our people to live in a perpetual state of dependency. We must break the yoke and shackles of dependency \u2026 It\u2019s time to empower ourselves.\u201d Sogavare said the Solomons\u2019 traditional allies and partners should not fear its growing relationship with China or with any other country. \u201cSolomon Islands has no enemies, only friends. Our struggle is to develop. We stretch out our hand of friendship and seek honest cooperation and partnership with all countries.\u201d In a statement, Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said no development funding had been withdrawn: \u201cAustralia has delivered on our budget support commitments to Solomon Islands this year.\u201d \u201cThis support has been provided across numerous sectors in Solomon Islands, including health, education and elections. We continue to discuss development and budget support needs with the Solomon Islands government,\u201d a spokesperson said. Last year, Australia provided about $40m for budget support, including for health, education and Covid recovery. Australia has also committed $25m in election support and $16.7m for the Pacific Games. Sogavare\u2019s comments, first reported by the ABC, also reiterated criticism of Australia and US for their concerns over a policing pact between the Solomons and China. \u201cThe narrow and coercive diplomatic approach of targeting China-Solomon Islands relations, and I want to use this word, is unneighbourly \u2026 This is nothing but interference of foreign states in the internal affairs of Solomon Islands,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has not invaded or colonised any other nation-state. Australia and the United States should not fear China\u2019s police support.\u201d Australian police forces led the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (Ramsi) \u2013 known as Operation Helpem Fren \u2013 after longstanding civil tensions in the archipelago\u2019s main islands erupted into violence in 2003. The Ramsi mission, which ran until 2017, was criticised by Sogavare, who argued it was dominated by Australia and subjugated Solomons\u2019 sovereignty. Australia also sent defence force personnel and federal police to Honiara in 2021 to quell anti-government riots. However, Sogavare emphasised Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific nations would remain the \u201cpartner of choice\u201d for Solomons\u2019 security and said he would call those nations first for help if violence again broke out. \u201cWe have a standing, a current arrangement with Siaf (Solomon Islands Assistance Forces) with Australia, New Zealand, PNG, Fiji, but now we\u2019ll need to dialogue with them, as we are consistent that they are our partner of choice \u2026 We\u2019ll need to call on them first,\u201d he said. But Sogavare said his country now had a \u201cstanding arrangement\u201d with China as well and if there were delays in other forces arriving in the Solomons, \u201cit takes only nine hours\u2019 flight from China to land forces here\u201d. \u201cNothing is actually stopping me from that if there are some hiccups along the way. \u201cWe can invoke our security arrangements.

Forest were willing to give the Brazilian a two-year deal and there was also interest in the winger from clubs in Saudi Arabia. However, Fulham made a breakthrough in talks with Willian over the weekend and the deal is at an advanced stage. The 34-year-old, a key player for Marco Silva last season, is happy in London and is poised to end the speculation over his future by signing a one-year deal to stay. Willian proved an inspired signing after joining on a free transfer last summer. The former Chelsea and Arsenal player was keen to return to England after an unhappy spell at Corinthians and his experience was valuable for Fulham after their promotion to the Premier League. Willian, who ended last season with five goals and five assists in all competitions, played an important role in Silva\u2019s side finishing 10th. Fulham are keen to add more quality as they attempt to cement their position in the top flight and hope to bolster their options on the flanks. They have had an initial bid for Hudson-Odoi rejected but are likely to return with a higher offer.

The deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey last year, was meant to alleviate a food crisis sparked by a Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports that had frozen millions of tonnes of grain exports around the world, much of it to developing countries. The UK has accused Russia of \u201cweaponising food\u201d. The deal was set to expire on Monday. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, blamed the damage on a Ukrainian attack, calling Ukraine \u201ca terrorist state structure\u201d. Asked about the explosion on Monday morning, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence directorate quoted a previous statement by the directorate\u2019s head, Kyrylo Budanov, saying: \u201cThe bridge is a superfluous structure.\u201d Ukrainian media outlets cited unnamed sources suggesting the Ukrainian domestic security service, along with the navy, had been responsible for the attack. Some reports suggested underwater drones may have been used. If the damage was caused by an attack, it would be the second time the bridge has been sabotaged. It follows a coup attempt by the Wagner mercenary group last month amid reports that senior field commanders are being removed from their posts in Ukraine. A ferry service linking Crimea with Kuban, in the Russian region of Krasnodar, has also been halted, the Russian Tass news agency reported. The bridge, a much-hated symbol of Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea, was built on Putin\u2019s orders and inaugurated by him in 2018. It is a key link for bringing troops, equipment and supplies to Moscow\u2019s invasion force in Ukraine. Moscow has in the past boasted of layers of protection, ranging from the latest weapons systems to military dolphins. In October 2022, the day after Putin\u2019s 70th birthday, a massive explosion destroyed a section of the Ukraine-bound road and engulfed the rail link in flames. Kyiv did not initially claim that attack, but earlier this month, the deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar marked 500 days since Russia\u2019s invasion by acknowledging in a Telegram post that Ukraine was behind the truck bombing \u201cto break Russian logistics\u201d. After it was repaired, Putin drove a Mercedes across the bridge to Crimea, underlining how important he considers the project. Russia has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the grain deal, citing attacks on its assets in Crimea and its Black Sea fleet. Following the October attack on the bridge, Putin said Russia would close the humanitarian corridor if the Kremlin determined that the explosives used in the attack had been smuggled on ships protected by the grain deal. The 19km (12-mile) bridge is the only direct land link between Russia and Crimea; ferries are slower and, when winter weather hits the Black Sea, can be unreliable. The road and railway bridges run parallel, with a wide suspension span in the middle to allow ships to pass through. It has been a supply route for food, fuel and other supplies for Russian troops invading southern Ukraine, and for the naval base at Sevastopol port, the base of Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet. When the bridge is closed Russia can still send supplies to Crimea through occupied Ukraine, along the coastal highway through ruined Mariupol, beside the Sea of Azov, but this is a longer route and presents a less challenging target for Ukrainian forces than the heavily guarded bridge. \u201cThe Kerch Strait Bridge is a logistically significant object,\u201d George Barros, an analyst with the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, wrote on Twitter after the first reports of explosions on the bridge. \u201cRussia will only have one ground supply line \u2013 the coastal highway on the Sea of Azov \u2013 to sustain (or evacuate) its tens of thousands of troops in occupied Kherson &amp; Crimea if UKR manages to degrade/destroy the bridge.\u201d The bridge has also been the main route used by Russian civilians heading to Crimea for holidays, apparently undeterred by a string of Ukrainian attacks on Russian military targets there, including an airbase and naval vessels. Crimea has always been popular with Russian tourists. Visitor numbers rose after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 made it harder for them to travel to western countries, and Moscow\u2019s propaganda machine doubled down on the historically inaccurate claim that Crimea had been Russian for centuries."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d873f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/tunisia-not-reception-centre-returns-sub-saharan-migrants-eu", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tunisia says it will not be \u2018reception centre\u2019 for returning migrants ", "lead": "North African country, which agreed \u20ac1bn deal with EU to stem irregular migration, says it will take back only Tunisians", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll Brussels correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:33:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625367", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ecf9d6c05744302b0f2276e0d2c41dbdb68b92a0/0_170_5092_3056/500.jpg", "body": "Tunisia has said it will not be a \u201creception centre\u201d for returns of sub-Saharan migrants from Italy or any other country in Europe despite a groundbreaking \u20ac1bn deal signed on Sunday. Authorities in the north African country are determined not to enter a contract similar to that which the UK has with Rwanda and will take back only Tunisians who have made irregular entry to the EU. This appears to be a setback for the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who won significant compromises last month in the wording of draft migration legislation that would enable authorities to return people to countries they were smuggled through even if they were in the country for only a few days or weeks. A senior EU official confirmed the tough line taken by the Tunisian president, Kais Saied, who had previously warned the EU that Tunisia would not act as the EU\u2019s \u201cborder guard\u201d. The source said: \u201cThat is a point on which the Tunisian authorities feel they have communicated this clearly \u2013 that they \u2026 shouldn\u2019t be a reception point for irregular migrants generally coming from Europe.\u201d Potentially it could still mean significant numbers of people being returned to Tunisia. About 8,000 people arrived irregularly in the EU from Tunisia in April, 1,000 in May and 5,000 in June. A pact on migration was signed on Sunday night after a flying visit to Tunisia by the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, Meloni and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, their second trip in five weeks. It includes a deal to return thousands of Tunisian migrants who take the dangerous trip across the Mediterranean to Italy, along with a new initiative to accelerate legal routes for Tunisians to work or study in the EU. As part of the agreement, \u20ac105m will be allocated to help Tunisia deal with people smugglers. About half of the budget will be available to deliver contracts with humanitarian organisations such as the Red Crescent to transport and support migrants who wish to return to their home countries. Tunisia has faced criticism over its treatment of migrants since February, after Saied accused \u201chordes\u201d of migrants from sub-Saharan African countries of a \u201cplot\u201d to change the country\u2019s demographic makeup. Cash-strapped Tunisia, a key route for migrants trying to make their way to Europe, has since seen a rise in racially motivated attacks. Tensions came to a head after a Tunisian man was killed on 3 July in a clash between local people and migrants in the city of Sfax. Since then, hundreds of migrants fled their homes in Tunisia or were forcibly evicted and driven to desert areas along the borders with Algeria and Libya, left to fend for themselves in searing heat. Von der Leyen hailed the overall package as groundbreaking and said it included \u201csignificant\u201d measures to stem deadly irregular migration across the Mediterranean. The pact had been in negotiation since early June when EU interior ministers hammered out a deal on migration laws including on returns to transit countries, new rules on relocation of migrants across the bloc and \u20ac20,000 charge per head to countries who could not take their allocation of people in the asylum process. Undocumented sub-Saharan Africans in Tunisia received 3bn dinars (about \u00a3750m) in remittances from their countries during the first half of 2023, an official from the Tunisia national security council said in a meeting on Friday. The memorandum of understanding has to be agreed by leaders of the bloc but in its current form includes plans for significant economic and educational ties to be developed. As part of the deal the EU will work with Tunisia to deliver renewable energy through solar and windfarms with electricity routed back to the EU through a new sub-marine cable connecting to Italy. The offer of \u20ac900m in macro finance is still on the table, while the EU will also reopen talks on an association agreement with Tunisia alongside talks on allowing it become a member of the Horizon Europe and Erasmus+ student exchange programmes."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8740", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/first-thing-explosions-on-kerch-bridge-linking-crimea-and-russia", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Two dead after explosions on Kerch Bridge linking Crimea and Russia | First Thing", "lead": "Road and rail link is only direct overland link between Russia and occupied Crimea.

The Kerch Bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula to Russia has been closed after explosions in the early hours of this morning killed two people and injured a child. The heavily guarded road and rail link is among the Kremlin\u2019s most important and high-prestige infrastructure projects, and the only overland link that goes directly from Russia to occupied Crimea. Video published by the pro-Kremlin Crimea 24 channel, taken from the adjacent railway bridge, showed a section of the road bridge had sheared off and was sloping towards the Black Sea. There were reports of explosions at about 3am local time, and cars heading for the bridge were stopped early on Monday morning, after the head of the Russian-controlled administration in Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said there was an \u201cemergency situation\u201d on the 145th pillar of the bridge. What has Ukraine said about the attack? Ukrainian media outlets cited unnamed sources suggesting the Ukrainian domestic security service, along with the navy, had been responsible for the attack. A Ukrainian security service source told AFP: \u201cToday\u2019s attack on the Crimean Bridge is a special operation of the SBU and the navy \u2026 It was difficult to reach the bridge, but in the end it was possible to do it.\u201d Rightwing disinformation on Plan B vending machines at colleges \u2018harmful to young lives\u2019 The headlines warned parents of an unspeakable horror on college campuses \u2013 something even more dangerous to their precious children than left-leaning curricula. \u201cAbortion vending machines are appearing on college campuses,\u201d one stated. \u201cAbortions pills available by vending machine at 39 US colleges,\u201d said another. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life America, wrote that there was a \u201crecent obsession with putting Plan B vending machines on college and university campuses as some kind of miracle drug in a post-Roe America\u201d. \u201cAn anti-baby, anti-family bias permeates many campuses exposing students to risks and dangers they are either not told about or told to ignore.\u201d The \u201ccasual distribution of Plan B\u201d, Hawkins also wrote, exposes young women \u201cto dangerous people, to unknown physical consequences, and to the current epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\u201d. The conservative backlash against Plan B vending machines stems from an influx of colleges installing them on campuses \u2013 at least 39 with more to come \u2013 amid post-Roe v Wade abortion restrictions. Advocates worry that criticism and disinformation could stymie access to emergency contraception. How does Plan B work? \u201cPlan B is an emergency contraceptive,\u201d said Kelly Cleland, executive director of the American Society for Emergency Contraception. \u201cPlan B works by preventing or delaying ovulation. If you miss the point in the cycle to prevent ovulation, it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s different from the abortion pill in that Plan B prevents pregnancy from ever happening and medication abortion is used to end a pregnancy after somebody already has an established pregnancy.\u201d Millions in US, Europe and Asia under warnings amid severe heat More than 100 million people, about a third of Americans, were under extreme heat advisories this weekend and that record-breaking heat was expected to continue into this week. There were advisories from coast to coast, with the south-west and parts of the west hard hit and officials warning that conditions could get worse in Arizona, California and Nevada. Meanwhile, parts of Europe and Asia are preparing for scorching heat today that threatens to break records, drive wildfires and has prompted health warnings and evacuations. Europe could record its hottest ever temperature this week on Italy\u2019s islands of Sicily and Sardinia where a high of 48C (118F) is predicted, the European Space Agency said, while Japan has issued heatstroke alerts affecting tens of millions of people, as near-record high temperatures hit several parts of the country, with other areas pummelled by torrential rain. What else is happening? The US\u2019s climate envoy, John Kerry, said it was \u201cimperative that China and the United States make real progress\u201d in the four months before the Cop28 global climate talks in Dubai, as he met his counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, in the Chinese capital on Monday. He also urged China to partner with the US to cut methane emissions and reduce the climate impact of coal-fired power. In other news \u2026 Twitter\u2019s cashflow remains negative because of a near 50% drop in advertising revenue and a heavy debt load, Elon Musk admitted, falling short of his expectation in March that Twitter could be cashflow positive by June.

Microsoft has signed a binding agreement to ensure that the Call of Duty video game franchise will remain available on Sony\u2019s PlayStation platform after Microsoft\u2019s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the tech company said yesterday, easing concerns from Sony and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Student journalists in Indonesia are facing a backlash after reporting on sexual harassment on campus. The students say they are being targeted with expulsion, physical assault and death threats after publishing a damning piece on the prevalence of sexual harassment at the Ambon Islamic State Institute. Hundreds of women who have been imprisoned have, with human rights organisations, lawyers and activists, written an open letter calling on the organisers of a high-level conference in Rwanda this week to include female incarceration as a key topic due to the alarming rise in women in prison. Stat of the day: Taylor Swift becomes first woman to have four albums in US Top 10 at once Taylor Swift has become the first woman, and only the third artist ever, to have four albums in the Top 10 of the US album chart simultaneously, while also beating a record set by Barbra Streisand to become the female artist with the most No 1 albums in history. The 33-year-old\u2019s latest album, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), has debuted at the top spot on the Billboard 200 with 716,000 album-equivalent units \u2013 a figure that combines physical sales with digital sales and streaming figures. It is the largest week for any album in 2023 and the best since her previous album, Midnights, was released last October. Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) is joined in the Top 10 by Midnights at No 5, Lover at No 7 and Folklore at No 10. This makes Swift the first woman to have four albums in the Top 10 at the same time since the charts began in 1963, and the first living act to do so since 1966, when the US trumpeter Herb Alpert achieved the same record. Don\u2019t miss this: \u2018We used to check every day, now it\u2019s every minute\u2019 \u2013 how we got addicted to weather apps One day in 2020, close to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Matt Rickett realized he was checking weather apps all the time. He immediately understood why: \u201cEverything felt so unpredictable, so out of control,\u201d he says. \u201cJust knowing that something was going to happen, tomorrow, that people said was gonna happen, was reassuring.\u201d The next year Rickett, who lives in Austin, Texas, decided to stop using social media: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the control it had over my life,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I still had the energy, the need to look at my phone, for some reason. So I got even more into weather.\u201d He checks apps roughly every couple of hours. After much trial and error, he\u2019s decided he likes Weather Underground and Forca the best. He also uses apps\u2019 radar functions to try to track storms and precipitation. As unprecedented weather leads to increasing climate anxiety, more of us have become addicted to weather apps, like Rickett. Climate check: big oil quietly walks back on climate pledges as global heat records tumble It was probably the Earth\u2019s hottest week in history earlier this month, following the warmest June on record, and top scientists agree that the planet will get even hotter unless we phase out fossil fuels. Yet leading energy companies are intent on pushing the world in the opposite direction, expanding fossil fuel production and insisting that there is no alternative. It is evidence that they are motivated not by record warming, but by record profits, experts say. \u201cThe fossil fuel industry has massively profited from selling a dangerous product and now innocent people and governments across the globe are paying the price for their recklessness,\u201d Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard University who studies the oil industry, said. Oil majors have, over the past several years, rolled out pledges to decrease oil and gas production and slash their emissions, citing concerns about the climate crisis. But more recently, many have walked those plans back. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday. If you\u2019re not already signed up, subscribe now.

But with how-to videos regularly going viral, cleaning brands are reinventing themselves for the social media age with fashionable colours, sound-effects and tips from \u201ctoilet cleaner\u201d influencers. Given the drudgery associated with chores, that watching videos of other people doing them counts as entertainment takes many by surprise. But over the past three years TikTok cleaning videos have amassed 6.4bn views in the UK alone, with #CleanTok, the area of the platform devoted to scrubbing toilets and kitchen floors, a bigger draw than makeovers on #BeautyTok. Peter ter Kulve, who runs the large home care business of consumer goods company Unilever, says TikTok has turned a once predictable market upside down. The company shifts more than \u00a310bn of cleaning products a year globally, with Domestos and Cif among its biggest brands, but Ter Kulve says it is no longer just in the \u201cstains and hygiene\u201d business as social media had turned consumer attention to the \u201cjoy and Zen\u201d of cleaning. With that in mind the company is working on products that \u201care sensorily more interesting\u201d. \u201cEven in cleaning, it is all about the experience,\u201d says Ter Kulve. \u201cWe are thinking more about the hedonics of our products, more fragrance, more excitement in the application. We need to fun up the whole cleaning experience.\u201d This desire to inject pizzazz means the once staid household aisle in the supermarket has become a hotbed of innovation. Toilet cleaner, for example, now comes not just as a strong-smelling blue liquid but also in an exciting selection of colours, including pink (for Barbie fans), as well as in the forms of gels, foams and fizzing tablets. Ter Kulve gives the example of its work on Domestos, which it has been selling for the past century. \u201cIt\u2019s a thick bleach, it drips slowly through your toilet bowl, a bleach is bleach,\u201d he says of the old world. Now, though, it also comes in a \u201cpower foam\u201d that makes a \u201csatisfying swoosh sound\u201d when you spray it under the rim. TikTok exposure can have a big impact on sales in a UK market worth nearly \u00a35bn a year \u2013 whether it\u2019s a new gadget like the soap-dispensing dish brushes that are in vogue, or an old favourite like Cif scouring cream. Sales of the latter are \u201cexploding\u201d after TikTok highlighted its cleaning power on scuffed trainers. Lynsey Crombie, the TV cleaning expert and influencer known as the \u201cQueen of Clean\u201d, says cleaning hacks and tips are popular because many people just don\u2019t know how to do it. \u201cA lot of basic skills have gone out the window because life is so busy, so they look for someone online to guide them and to educate them,\u201d she says. To capitalise on social media\u2019s love of cleaning Unilever recently struck a deal with TikTok to work with more than 100 influencers, with their input used to shape new products. This turn of events is a surprise even to Ter Kulve: \u201cFive years ago we would not have been talking about influencers, maybe for certain beauty products, but influencers for toilet cleaners are you mad?\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8742", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/latest-mission-impossible-shows-the-silent-asian-stereotype-is-alive-and-well", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Latest Mission: Impossible shows the \u2018silent Asian\u2019 stereotype is alive and well", "lead": "Pom Klementieff\u2019s assassin Paris is largely mute throughout the latest instalment of the franchise, flying in the face of the recent forward-thinking use of Asian actors in Hollywood", "author": "Ann Lee", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:10:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625433", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bb3d9852c3e8b8f346c35a20fca6e0bd6faef77d/170_0_2830_1699/500.jpg", "body": "There are many things wrong with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One: its ridiculous storyline about AI, its bloated runtime, the plot holes as wide as Tom Cruise\u2019s gleaming megawatt smile, but the most jarring of all? How Pom Klementieff\u2019s supporting role as Paris, a savage assassin, is transformed into the tired stereotype of the silent Asian, who is largely mute throughout the film. Paris is part of villain Gabriel\u2019s (Esai Morales) crew. She\u2019s on screen for many of the fights and action sequences including a thrilling car chase through the streets of Rome. All kamikaze glee and thigh-crushing aggression, she\u2019s more than capable of giving Cruise\u2019s Impossible Mission Force agent, Ethan Hunt, a run for his money. But the French actor, who is half Korean, barely utters a word throughout the whole thing. Admittedly, no one comes to a Mission: Impossible film for the dialogue. They come for spectacular set pieces and death-defying stunts performed by Cruise in breathtaking locations \u2013 and on those fronts it certainly delivers. But joining those segments together are multiple scenes featuring reputable actors trying to keep a straight face while saying the words \u201ckey\u201d, \u201copen\u201d, and \u201cthe entity\u201d over and over again in various formations, as the story unfolds about a supersized ChatGPT going rogue. Despite this, it seems the writers couldn\u2019t spare many of those lines for poor Klementieff. Her most expansive moment comes when she says: \u201cSee you soon,\u201d in French, until the very end of the film when she strings together a few more sentences to impart some Extremely Important Information to Hunt. Which makes it even more bizarre that she was so silent before that. She\u2019s even asked a direct question at one point by Denlinger (Cary Elwes), director of National Intelligence. Does she reply? Does she heck! No, she responds in the language she knows best - full-on violence, pulverising any bodies that happen to be in her way. After all the fine work done by Asian-led films such as Everything Everywhere All at Once, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Crazy Rich Asians in blitzing Hollywood free from its crusty old stereotypes, I had hoped that the trope of the silent Asian was on its way out. Instead it remains stubbornly persistent. You don\u2019t have to look too far in the past to see how it has permeated western films and TV. Take Hana Mae Lee in the Pitch Perfect films. The Korean American actor plays Lilly Onakuramara, a painfully shy student who speaks in a barely audible whisper for most of the three comedy films. Sonoya Mizuno, a British actor of Japanese, English, and Argentinian descent, gets to boogie on down with co-star Oscar Isaac in the cerebral sci-fi thriller Ex Machina, but says nothing as Kyoko, a mute, sexy robot. Similarly, Japanese star Rinko Kikuchi is a spark of joy in the comedy caper The Brothers Bloom as Bang Bang, one of the film\u2019s main characters, but only says a few words. The message to Asian actors is clear; you can be part of our film, a major part even, just don\u2019t expect to actually say anything substantial. Actor Jimmy Wong, who starred as Ling in Disney\u2019s live-action adaptation of Mulan, called out the trope, posting a tweet with pictures of mute superhero Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) in The Boys and Ben (Justin H Min), the ghost in The Umbrella Academy. \u201cLeast favourite acting thing I\u2019ve noticed during pandemic binge watching: incredibly sexy and good looking Asian actors playing characters with barely ANY dialogue because it\u2019s supposed to be \u2026 mysterious?\u201d The silent Asian stereotype taps into the myth that Asians, particularly Asian women, are meek and submissive. Paris, of course, is the opposite of meek and submissive \u2013 you can tell that just by her Harley Quinn-esque makeup, her white face powder made up, no doubt, by the ground bones of her long dead enemies. She joins the ranks of Hollywood\u2019s other largely silent Asian assassins, including Devon Aoki\u2019s Miho in Sin City and Bai Ling\u2019s Mysterious Woman in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow \u2013 powerful women who are only allowed to lacerate with their fists rather than their verbal wit. Klementieff\u2019s character points to the franchise\u2019s at times questionable treatment of women. Who can forget Thandiwe Newton\u2019s Nyah in the second instalment? Despite her professional capabilities as an accomplished thief, it\u2019s made clear she\u2019s only recruited by Hunt to seduce her ex, a rogue agent (Dougray Scott). \u201cShe\u2019s got no training for this kind of thing,\u201d Hunt complains to his mission commander (Anthony Hopkins). He replies odiously: \u201cTo go to bed with a man and lie to him? She\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s got all the training she needs.\u201d Don\u2019t get me wrong, there have been some great female characters over the years, most notably Vanessa Redgrave\u2019s Max, a cunning and manipulative arms dealer, in the first film. But many of these women disappeared after a single outing, never to be seen again including IMF agents Claire (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art), Jane (Paula Patton) and Zhen (Maggie Q). Hunt\u2019s wife Julia, played by Michelle Monaghan, did make a reappearance in Ghost Protocol after starring in the third film, but only in a brief uncredited cameo. In the Mission: Impossible world, women, it seems, are disposable, unlike Hunt\u2019s constant companions Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). It\u2019s only in the most recent films that we\u2019ve seen recurring parts for Vanessa Kirby\u2019s mysterious broker Alanna Mitsopolis, AKA the White Widow, and Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s Ilsa Faust, the MI6 operative, who can match Hunt punch for punch. Paris will presumably be returning too for Dead Reckoning Part Two, although her fate is left hanging as precariously as Hunt on a motorbike teetering by a cliff\u2019s edge.

Aslef said there would be a further overtime ban from Monday 31 July to Friday 5 August, in the long-running pay dispute, as unions revealed that almost three months had passed without talks with industry bosses \u2013 and six months without any contact with government. The announcement was made as a week of overtime bans got under way. A number of train operators have slashed schedules because of not having enough rostered drivers to run a full service. Strikes later in the week by the RMT are expected to cause significant disruption. Passengers have been urged to check before they travel, with South Western, Chiltern, Greater Anglia and TransPennine Express among operators that have cut timetables in advance. Great Western and all of Govia Thameslink Railway\u2019s trains \u2013 Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express \u2013 are also affected. Train staff in the RMT union are also poised to strike across England-based train operators contracted to the Department for Transport (DfT), with 24-hour stoppages on Thursday and Saturday this week. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the RMT strikes and Aslef overtime ban would \u201cundoubtedly cause some disruption, affecting not only the daily commute of our passengers but also disrupting the plans of families during the summer holidays\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cWhile we are doing all we can to keep trains running, unfortunately there will be reduced services between Monday 17 July and Saturday 29 July, so our advice is to check before you travel.\u201d The Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, said: \u2018We don\u2019t want to take this action. We don\u2019t want people to be inconvenienced. But the blame lies with the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, which refuse to sit down and talk to us and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years \u2013 since 2019 \u2013 while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%.\u201d He said the 4% offer made in April was designed not to be accepted, adding: \u201cWe have not heard a word from the employers since then \u2026 and we haven\u2019t sat down with the government since Friday 6 January. That shows how little the companies and the government care about passengers and staff.\u201d Whelan said the union wanted a fair resolution and was \u201ctaking this action, to try to bring things to a head\u201d. On Sunday, the RMT leader, Mick Lynch, also blamed the rail industry and government for refusing to try to settle the dispute. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re available to talk to them, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met a government minister since January, and even the employers now have stopped negotiating.\u201d A DfT spokesperson said the government had \u201cplayed its part by facilitating fair and reasonable pay offers\u201d, adding: \u201cUnion leaders should stop blocking their members from having a vote on these offers and give them the chance to help resolve this dispute.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8744", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/lithgow-siege-man-dies-police-shots-fired-bowenfels", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man who died during siege near Lithgow was wanted for domestic violence offences", "lead": "NSW police say man found dead at Bowenfels home was wanted for serious offences dating back to 2021", "author": "Cait Kelly and Australian Associated Press", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:05:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625470", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ff164658512fbf593a7b520a45e3c8cf21a577e0/0_99_2965_1779/500.jpg", "body": "A man wanted for domestic violence and weapons offences has died during a siege in which shots were fired at officers near Lithgow, New South Wales police say. NSW police confirmed the 29-year-old was found dead when they gained entry to the property in Bowenfels at around 9am on Monday. The man had sustained a gunshot wound, which was suspected to be self-inflicted. NSW police said they were called to the home around 12.15pm on Sunday, following reports of a man and a woman fighting at the property. Police were told the man had a firearm and concerns were raised for his welfare. They had been unaware of the man\u2019s identity when officers first arrived at the home. Inquiries through the negotiation unit established the identities of the man and woman, assistant commissioner Scott Tanner said on Monday. The man had been wanted for serious domestic violence and firearm matters dating back to 2021. In a statement, NSW police said a \u201cperimeter was established, and assistance was requested from specialist resources, including police negotiators and the tactical operations unit\u201d after the pair allegedly refused to come out of the home. Around 4.20pm, a number of shots were fired from the home in the direction of police, with police returning fire, a spokesperson said. No one was injured during the exchange. \u201cPolice continued to attempt to engage the pair in conversation overnight, but they refused to come outside,\u201d the spokesperson said. Just before 9am on Monday morning, a 20-year-old woman came out of the property. An investigation has commenced into all circumstances relating to the incident by a critical incident investigation team from Orana Mid-Western police district. The neighbouring streets have been shut down since Sunday. One businesses owner, who did not want to be named, said \u201cthe swat team, ambulances, fire trucks and about 20 police cars\u201d were at the scene during the siege. Around nine shots were heard by people in the area.

Last week, Iowa lawmakers passed a six-week ban on abortion in a rare special legislative session, called by Governor Kim Reynolds, who signed the bill on Friday afternoon. The law takes immediate effect, further shrinking the options available to people seeking abortions in the midwest. \u201cIn a rare and historic special session, the Iowa legislature voted for a second time to reject the inhumanity of abortion and pass the fetal heartbeat law,\u201d Reynolds said on Friday. The move to restrict abortion in Iowa came less than one month after a deadlocked state supreme court blocked enforcement of a near-identical six-week ban. Reproductive justice advocates across the country condemned Reynolds\u2019 decision to call a special session on abortion. \u201cEvery dirty trick in the book is being used to pass these extremely unpopular abortion bans,\u201d said Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity (Urge), a progressive advocacy group that supports abortion rights. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do it in the light of day, that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing these special sessions, that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing bans passed in the middle of the night,\u201d she added. Abortion providers in Iowa said they were unsurprised that the state GOP used a unique legislative tool for the sole purpose of restricting reproductive freedom. Francine Thompson, executive director of the Emma Goldman Clinic \u2013 one of two abortion providers in Iowa and a plaintiff in the new lawsuit \u2013 said the ban\u2019s passage was expected yet appalling. She said there was a cruel irony to the timing of the governor\u2019s announcement of the special session, which came just after Independence Day, \u201ca day we typically associate with celebrating our freedom from oppressive and tyrannical governments\u201d. Staff at the Emma Goldman Clinic spent hours this week on the phones with nervous patients confused by the legal status of abortion in Iowa. \u201cSince Dobbs, the phone lines are always jammed,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe most recent calls are not really in an attempt to get seen before the law goes into effect, but are clients seeking information to wade through the chaos of rapidly changing access and the myriad of restrictions in surrounding states.\u201d The six-week ban is confusing, in part, because it closely resembles a 2018 law that was blocked by an Iowa district judge years before Roe v Wade was overturned. Earlier this year, Reynolds asked the Iowa supreme court to reverse the district judge\u2019s decision. The state justices split 3-3, leaving the lower court\u2019s order in place, meaning the 2018 ban remains unenforceable. The lawsuit against the new six-week ban is expected to reach the Iowa supreme court, which last year ruled that the state constitution does not guarantee the right to abortion. But last month, the 3-3 deadlock happened after one justice, Dana Oxley, opted to recuse herself from the case because of a conflict of interest with her old law firm. It is unclear if Justice Oxley will recuse herself again, causing another split ruling. Iowa Republican lawmakers might not care about the outcome of the legal battle. They win political points with their core, conservative voter base simply by reconvening at the state capital to pass an abortion ban. \u201cBecause of gerrymandering, Iowa Republicans aren\u2019t really worried about losing to a Democrat, but they are at a real risk of being primaried,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at University of California, Davis. If the ban is struck down, Republicans can blame the courts, a convenient boogeyman in the tug-of-war over state abortion law. The good-faith attempt to pass a six-week ban is enough to reassure anti-abortion lobbying groups and socially conservative donors. Ziegler said ideological posturing is especially important for Governor Reynolds ahead of the Iowa caucus, which helps select the Republican presidential nominee. Reynolds\u2019 endorsement could therefore change the future of her party. But first, Ziegler said, the governor \u201cneeds to prove her conservative credentials\u201d on abortion. Reynolds signed the ban at the Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of evangelical Christians and social conservatives in Des Moines. The event attracted 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls such as Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, and the former vice-president Mike Pence. Just as Reynolds was signing the six-week ban, attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the Emma Goldman Clinic asked an Iowa judge to temporarily block the six-week ban from taking effect while litigation proceeds. That decision is expected this week. Dr Emily Boevers, an Iowa OB-GYN at one of the state\u2019s last remaining rural hospitals, braced for an anxious weekend. She volunteers her weekends providing abortion care at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Iowa City, though she does not offer abortions in her everyday work at the hospital. Boevers is one of two OB-GYNs in her home county \u2013 the other is expected to retire this fall. She\u2019s worried that the six-week ban could drive doctors in her specialty out of Iowa, worsening the region\u2019s existing shortage of maternal healthcare providers. \u201cNorth of me, there is not another hospital for 50 miles,\u201d said Boevers. She said the criminalization of abortion brings \u201ca level of hostility towards obstetric care in all its components\u201d that will \u201cinvariably harm\u201d the already dwindling OB-GYN workforce in Iowa. \u201cForcing experts in women\u2019s health to withhold care from our patients, it goes against many of our moral codes,\u201d Boevers said. \u201cAs an obstetrician-gynecologist, I trust my patients to make the best decision for their situation.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8747", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/republican-primary-field-diverse-trump-desantis", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Republican field most diverse primary slate ever \u2013 what does it mean for 2024?", "lead": "Critics say important breakthrough overshadowed by contenders\u2019 reluctance to confront systemic racism in US", "author": "David Smith Washington bureau chief", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:00:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625529", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb892070c7344725cd47e8ac8702b6223527f32/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "An African American man whose grandfather dropped out of school to pick cotton. A daughter of Indian immigrants raised in the Sikh faith. A son of Cuban immigrants, an Indian-American entrepreneur, a Black talk radio host and a former undercover CIA officer who is mixed race. A casual observer might assume that these candidates for the White House in 2024 must be from the same Democratic party that produced Barack Obama. In fact, they all contenders in the Republican presidential primary field \u2013 the most diverse in the party\u2019s history. But what should be an important breakthrough for a party long criticised for racist dog-whistling is overshadowed by some significant caveats. First, the opinion polls are dominated by Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, two white men whose words and deeds have alienated many Black voters. Second, they are, critics say, seeking to benefit from identity politics and deny the existence of racism at the same time. Senator Tim Scott, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, Miami mayor Francis Suarez, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, conservative radio host Larry Elder and ex-congressman Will Hurd refer to their own struggles but are reluctant to acknowledge a wider social and historical context. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the quality and diversity of the candidates who have emerged and are emerging,\u201d said Michael Steele, who was the first Black chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). \u201cIt does matter what they say and how they sound and how they represent not just Republican values but the values of the communities they come from, and that\u2019s always been where the wheels start to come off. You can\u2019t be authentically you if you\u2019re parroting what white Republicanism is.\u201d Steele\u2019s elevation to RNC chairman after the 2008 election of Obama, America\u2019s first Black president, implied that the party of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had finally recognised the need to broaden its appeal. There was early vindication in 2010 when Steele successfully backed Haley for governor of South Carolina, Scott for Congress in the same state and Susana Martinez for governor of New Mexico. But the following year, Steele lost his re-election bid to Reince Priebus, a white man from Wisconsin who would later become Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff. When Republicans were defeated by Obama again, the RNC produced an \u201cautopsy report\u201d that urged them to diversify or die. Yet in 2016 Trump effectively tore that up with attacks on immigrants and Muslims that were cheered by white nationalists. He lost the popular vote but won the electoral college. There have been gains and setbacks since then. In last year\u2019s midterm elections, the RNC said its lineup of candidates was more diverse than ever: 32 Latinos, 22 Black candidates, 11 Asian Americans and two Native Americans. Among them was Herschel Walker, who denied the existence of racism and lost a Senate race in Georgia to Raphael Warnock, a Democrat steeped in the civil rights legacy of Martin Luther King. Now the presidential primary candidates vying to take on Joe Biden, an 80-year-old white man, seem unwilling to discuss racial politics, except in the past tense or with an individual anecdote rather than a societal diagnosis. Haley, the first Asian American woman to compete for the Republican nomination, has described the discrimination that she and her family suffered as immigrants in the south while rejecting the idea of systemic racism. Launching his presidential campaign, Scott, the sole Black Republican in the Senate, spoke of feeling angry and disillusioned until a mentor \u201ctold me in the most loving way possible to look in the mirror and to blame myself\u201d, leading Scott to choose \u201cpersonal responsibility over resentment. I became the master of my fate.\u201d It was a message that implied: if Scott could live the American dream, any Black person can. He accordingly likes to frequently swipe at the left with lines such as, \u201cMy life disrupts their narrative. The truth of my life disrupts their lies,\u201d \u2013 even though has in in the past described incidents in which he was racially profiled by police, including US Capitol police. Steele, for one, is not impressed. He said: \u201cTim knows me, he knows I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat shit; I\u2019m going to be straight up. That\u2019s just playing to a white audience because that\u2019s not his own experience. He\u2019s the one who told us of the time he was profiled as a member of Congress. So what are you talking about? \u201cYou can be aspirational about your own story and your own future while at the same time being honest and recognising the history of your story as it\u2019s related through your parents, grandparents, neighbours, friends, who I would probably argue with Tim would not necessarily view their experience with America as exclusively, \u2018I did all this by pulling myself up by my bootstraps and white America appreciated me as an American\u2019. That\u2019s just not how that narrative plays out.\u201d Republicans have taken pains to reject the New York Times\u2019s 1619 Project and the concept of slavery being part of America\u2019s origin story. A fashionable reflex is to selectively quote King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech about a nation where children \u201cwill not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\u201d in an effort to justify colour blindness. This is seen by critics as disingenuous cherry picking from a civil rights leader who also highlighted police brutality and systemic poverty. Like previous Black Republican candidates, such as Herman Cain and Ben Carson, this year\u2019s field has little incentive to dwell on the party\u2019s divisive past and risk being accused of going \u201cwoke\u201d. Leah Wright Rigueur, a political historian at Johns Hopkins University, told the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly America podcast: \u201cThere is no reward for calling the party out on racism or bigotry. There\u2019s none for Black Republicans. \u201cIn fact, we have documented evidence that the Black Republicans who get support from within the party \u2026 are the ones who either support the party uncritically, who echo whatever the party\u2019s standard bearer is saying, or who find this space to carve out where they don\u2019t alienate their audience while also adhering to certain conservative principles.\u201d Rigueur, author of The Loneliness of the Black Republican, added: \u201cThe latter is where Tim Scott is, and so that\u2019s why you hear him say things like, \u2018I have experienced racism on an individual level but I don\u2019t believe America is a racist place.\u2019 And so it becomes something which alleviates the conscience of the base, where they can say, well, it doesn\u2019t affect me, that\u2019s something he experienced, that\u2019s his individual experience. That can be true, but it has nothing to do with me, and I can feel OK in this moment.\u201d Although the current Congress has more Black Republicans than at any point since 1877, the number is still only five. Efforts to recruit diverse candidates and appeal to voters of colour have been repeatedly undermined by party leaders and allies. Trump, the runaway leader in primary polls so far, dined last year with Nick Fuentes, an outspoken antisemite and racist. Last month, the former president\u2019s appointees to the supreme court were instrumental in ruling against affirmative action in colleges and universities. Scott told Fox News that it was \u201ca good day for America\u201d; Haley tweeted, \u201cPicking winners &amp; losers based on race is fundamentally wrong\u201d; Ramaswamy told Politico: \u201cAffirmative action is the single greatest form of institutional racism in America today.\u201d This week Tommy Tuberville, a senator for Alabama, gave several media interviews in which he repeatedly declined to describe white nationalists as racist before finally backing down. And Ryan Walters, Oklahoma\u2019s state superintendent of public instruction, said teachers should tell students that the Tulsa race massacre was not racially motivated. Tara Setmayer, a political commentator who received a torrent of online racist abuse following a recent TV interview, argues that the diversity of the Republican primary slate will not address the deeper malaise. \u201cThe irony in this is that the diversity is on paper and the party that claims that they\u2019re so against affirmative action is seemingly intent on putting up racial numbers to show, look, we\u2019re not racist, we have diversity. You can\u2019t have it both ways. \u201cTaking away the rights of women, the rights of minorities \u2013 these are all issues that are being advocated by a Republican party that wants to laud itself for \u2018diversity\u2019? They\u2019re perfectly OK with a governor of a major state like Ron DeSantis banning diversity and inclusion programmes. They\u2019re OK with book-banning on Black history. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, criticised Haley, Scott and others for denying that systemic racism has an impact on Black communities. \u201cTo try to whitewash that, I\u2019m embarrassed for them, because you cannot tell me that they don\u2019t go home at night and watch the news, read the newspaper, look at the bills and the laws that are being passed in their own states and the experiences of people of colour in this country and not acknowledge privately that, guess what, racism still exists in America. \u201cIt\u2019s so disingenuous for them to say that, and Tim Scott more infuriatingly, given that he\u2019s a Black man in the south, who himself claims he was racially profiled as a senator, but turns around and denies that there is still a problem with race in this country when he\u2019s speaking in front of predominantly white audiences. He\u2019s not going to go to the NAACP convention or the Urban League convention or speak in front of the Congressional Black Caucus saying those things.\u201d The Democratic party remains more diverse by every measure. Some 80% of racial and ethnic minority members in the current Congress are Democrats. A new Pew Research Center analysis of last year\u2019s midterm elections shows that 93% of Black voters supported Democrats while just 5% backed Republicans. Hispanic voters favoured Democratic candidates by a 21-point margin in 2022 \u2013 but that was a sharp drop from the 47-point margin they enjoyed in 2018. Such shifts give Republicans hope that they will continue to make inroads next year \u2013 with or without a Black nominee. Antjuan Seawright, a party strategist based in Columbia, South Columbia, said: \u201cThat word diversity means different things to different people and for us as Democrats, not only have we talked the talk when it comes to diversity, but we walk the walk with age, race, gender, geographics and demographics. \u201cThe browning of America is happening right before all of our eyes and, truth be told, is that Republicans have not given any voters of colour a reason to even think about joining their chorus.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8748", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/greg-abbott-spoof-story-garth-brooks-author-dumb", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Author of spoof story shared by Greg Abbott calls him one of \u2018dumbest people in the country\u2019", "lead": "Texas governor shared fake article by Christopher Blair about Garth Brooks being booed by \u2018patriots\u2019 in made-up city", "author": "Gloria Oladipo", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:00:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625548", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/686aca8a40f5edfee4050c9b5ec42318e230c577/0_298_5109_3065/500.jpg", "body": "The author of a satirical website said Texas governor Greg Abbott is among the \u201cdumbest people in the country\u201d after Abbott shared a fake article about his own state. The Maine resident Christopher Blair, who runs the satirical website Dunning-Kruger-Times, ridiculed Abbott after the governor shared a fake article about country singer Garth Brooks being booed off a stage over his support of Bud Light. \u201cWhen I saw that, I was besides myself with joy,\u201d Blair said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the dumbest people in the country.\u201d On 25 June, Abbott responded to a story about Brooks being jeered by \u201cpatriots\u201d over his calls for tolerance at the 123rd annual Texas Country Jamboree in the city of Hambriston. But Hambriston is not a real city. The jamboree is also not a real event. The entire article was false, one of many written by Blair under the alias \u201cFlagg Eagleton\u201d. Blair said, at one point, he feared that it would be too obvious the article was fake. \u201cAs soon as I wrote the headline, I said to myself that it might be a little bit much,\u201d Blair said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Abbott still genuinely responded to the fake article from his personal Twitter account. \u201cGo Woke. Go Broke,\u201d Abbott wrote about the false story. \u201cGarth called his conservative fans assholes. Good job, Texas,\u201d Abbott added, referring to the booing. Abbott quickly deleted the tweet. But several Twitter users took screenshots of the gaffe and mocked Abbott. \u201cWay to go governor Abbott!\u201d, wrote one Twitter user. Another user called Abbott a \u201csucker\u201d for being fooled by the article. Abbott\u2019s office could not be reached by the Guardian for comment. Republicans have denounced Brooks after he announced that his Nashville bar would serve Bud Light beer and encouraged his customers to be tolerant. Far-right and anti-trans figures have criticized the beer brand for working with the trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney for a promotion during the annual March Madness national college basketball tournament. Blair said Abbott is not the first public official to share false articles written by himself or other satirical writers. Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, has also reposted a Dunning-Kruger-Times article. Miller responded to a false article about Kyle Rittenhouse taking out a lien against actress Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s house. \u201cShe refuses to pay. He\u2019s within his rights. He seems to be very good at that,\u201d Miller wrote on Facebook, according to a screenshot shared by Blair. Blair has run America\u2019s Last Line of Defense (Allod), which operates the Dunning-Kruger-Times and other satirical websites, since 2016, when Donald Trump was elected US president. Blair, who self-identifies as a \u201cprofessional liberal troll\u201d, said the goal of the website is to expose the \u201cgullibility of rightwing extremists\u201d. Prior to this \u201coperation\u201d, Blair received attention for hijacking a conservative Facebook page and posting pictures of goats as the online liberal personality \u201cBusta Troll\u201d. Fake articles created by Blair and other Allod affiliates usually cover topics associated with conservatives\u2019 culture war, including Garth Brooks and the M&amp;M candy controversy. \u201cThey get so riled up over nothing,\u201d Blair said of the conservatives who reshare his article. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re at war with Garth Brooks. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Blair added that much of the focus on cultural issues among conservatives \u201ccomes from the top in the conservative world\u201d, from figures like Tucker Carlson. \u201cAnything to take away from what\u2019s happening to Trump,\u201d Blair said. \u201cAnything to take away from what the Republican party is doing in general. Anything to take away from the corruption in the supreme court.\u201d Blair says he has received criticism from people who say that he is propagating misinformation, but contends that the site openly advertises as being false. The Dunning-Kruger-Times.com website reads: \u201cDunning-Kruger-Times.com is a subsidiary of the \u2018America\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u2019 network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery, or as Snopes called it before they lost their war on satire: Junk News.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, somebody is telling them that this is fake,\u201d Blair said. Blair said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d to see public officials share articles that are clearly fake. \u201cI shake my head. To see it shared by people who matter, I shake my head and I chuckle,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing to see so many people over the years who have just been dumb enough.

We didn\u2019t even want her. We had reserved her brother, a gorgeous silver maine coon named Ollie, who would join his older brother, Leo, who we had got a year earlier. But when we travelled the 150 miles to Doncaster to pick him up, the breeders offered us Lizzy as well \u2013 a sort of buy one, get one free. The runt of the litter, Lizzy had nearly died soon after she was born and was so small she had to be hand-fed every couple of hours. She and Ollie were inseparable and it seemed cruel to part them. She was a birdlike creature with a shock of cream fur, amber eyes, and a shy, sensitive nature. All cats are special in their own way, and as she grew older it became clear that Lizzy\u2019s particular gift was to know when you weren\u2019t feeling great, and sit to share the moment with you. From headaches to hangovers, she would be there. In 2012, aged 45, I was reassured by my GP that the pain in my breast wasn\u2019t a sign of cancer, but to go for a mammogram to be on the safe side. There wasn\u2019t any cancer where the pain was, but, totally coincidentally, there was in my other breast. I tried not to make a big deal out of it; the cancer could be treated and my kids were 13 and 15, so they had enough going on being teenagers. But it was Lizzy whose presence gave me comfort, a shadow following me around, a silent support when I felt the tears of uncertainty welling up. After surgery, I came home to find her at the front window, looking out for me. Later, exhausted and in pain from radiotherapy, I would lie down and she would instantly be there, just wanting to sit beside me and purr. Often my tears spilled on her. Cats can\u2019t really know what you\u2019re feeling or thinking, but it felt as if Lizzy did \u2013 and this helped me get through some dark days. Pets don\u2019t judge, they don\u2019t offer advice, their loyalty is never doubted. When I recovered, she was always there for me: running to greet me at the door after a day at the office, crawling on to the bed in the middle of the night trying to sleep with her paws on my pillow, standing guard by my keyboard as I worked from home, patiently hoping for head rubs. It was kidney disease that took her from us, very suddenly and very cruelly in 2018. I wasn\u2019t ready for it. Who is? Her ashes are still in our garage, neatly boxed with her name on the front. Since then there have been times when we have thought about burying her, next to her brothers \u2013 a proper ceremony with her human family all present. But the truth is I haven\u2019t been ready to say goodbye, even five years on. Now I realise it\u2019s time. The ashes can be buried; Lizzy\u2019s pawprints will be with me for ever."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d874a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/dissociative-amnesia-trauma-brain-fog-memory-loss", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m a chef and I forgot how to bake a cake\u2019: why trauma often leads to brain fog and amnesia", "lead": "Shock, stress and grief can have a devastating effect on memory \u2013 but there are ways to bring it back", "author": "Zoe Beaty", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:00:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625584", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e00bfeaa6d3f4137833db576344987bd1959d1ca/0_427_6403_3842/500.jpg", "body": "In early 2016, Juliet Owen-Nuttall decided to bake a cake. It was something she \u2013 a trained chef and former wedding cake decorator \u2013 had done hundreds of times before. Except, this time, her mind was blank. \u201cI had forgotten how to do it,\u201d Owen-Nuttall says. \u201cI know it sounds really strange but after the trauma of the last few months, it was like suddenly I no longer had access to any of the knowledge I\u2019d built up over the years.\u201d Owen-Nuttall, 48, wanted to bake to help her decompress after the most stressful period of her life. A dream adventure \u2013 relocating to Costa Rica to look after horses on some of the world\u2019s most beautiful beaches \u2013 had turned out to be a vicious scam, costing Owen-Nuttall and her husband, Daniel, 41, their life savings and forcing them to live in a small tent on the beach \u201cin squalor\u201d. The pain and shock caused her brain to \u201cshut down entirely\u201d. \u201cThere are only certain bits I remember. When we found out we\u2019d lost everything, I remember starting to feel severely physically ill. Then it\u2019s all a blur.\u201d Her memory was shattered; she describes certain periods as \u201cblanks\u201d, marked by forgetfulness and acute loss of basic skills \u2013 such as baking. \u201cIt\u2019s like your mind has been shrunk down to a single, dark corridor. There\u2019s nothing outside this corridor, and only the basics inside.\u201d What Juliet experienced is a common, if rarely articulated, phenomenon that occurs during points of high emotional stress, trauma and often grief. Some people describe it as a \u201cfog\u201d, or a film around reality; others report chunks of time being severed and lifted from memory, or reappearing as fragments. While we might associate this type of memory loss with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, it\u2019s not always so neatly categorised. One psychological term for the condition is dissociative amnesia \u2013 a form of memory loss that is more severe than mere forgetfulness, and that can\u2019t be explained by another medical diagnosis. It is thought to be more common among women than men, and can last from a matter of days to months or, in rare cases, years. For Sophie, 35, from Hackney, this is something she struggles with daily. Eight months ago, she lost her baby during childbirth, and she has found the noticeable loss of memory since then difficult to cope with. \u201cIt\u2019s the everyday forgetfulness that bothers me most,\u201d she says. Sophie is using a pseudonym due to the ongoing legal dispute around her baby\u2019s death. In the past few months she has left her bag on the tube and in restaurants, and forgotten the names of close friends and dates. \u201cOften, I don\u2019t even realise until the next day. I spend half the day doing things I\u2019ve already done, or thinking I\u2019ve done things when I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s really frustrating and costly. Before this, I was impeccably organised.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting function of the brain,\u201d says Dr Chlo\u00e9 Rowland, a clinical psychologist. \u201cPart of your brain, namely the hippocampus [the main memory hub] and the amygdala, the so-called emotional centre, basically go offline because of the chemicals, like cortisol, that are released at the point of intense stress. So you don\u2019t fully lay down the memory of what\u2019s happening. Then, because the memories are essentially offline, when things begin to come back they appear to be fragmented.\u201d Memory is such a remarkable function of the mind that, for Bernhard Staresina, professor of cognitive neuroscience in the department of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford, \u201cIt\u2019s almost a miracle that we have a memory at all.\u201d Essentially, there are four stages of making a memory: encoding (the learning of information), consolidation (the process of storing) and recall (the ability to access information when you need it). \u201cBut, during these three stages a lot of things can go wrong,\u201d says Staresina. \u201cSo, for instance, during the encoding stage, if you\u2019re distracted for some reason, your memories don\u2019t stand a good chance of surviving the whole metamorphosis to becoming a fully fledged memory.\u201d And things can go particularly awry when it comes to moments of heightened emotional stress, or trauma. \u201cThere\u2019s a well documented effect called the \u2018weapon focus effect\u2019,\u201d says Staresina. \u201cIf you\u2019re held at gunpoint, all your attention is focused on the weapon, the most threatening item of the scene, hijacking all your attentional resources on to that gun and leading to the failure to perceive the rest of the scene.\u201d Because the memory is not fully formed, this can also lead to problems in recall further down the line. \u201cWhen we\u2019re trying to reconstruct the memory, we\u2019re very open to suggestions or intrusions. The entire process of memory is very fragile.\u201d Often, the shock and devastation from a traumatic event can leave a person feeling displaced and confused, but it\u2019s an unpredictable process, and it isn\u2019t always linear. \u201cWeirdly, I wasn\u2019t like this in the immediate aftermath of losing my son,\u201d says Sophie. \u201cI had a long time where I felt very lucid, very concise. I did some public speaking and I was able to organise my thoughts very quickly. Then, that faded.\u201d During a crisis, some people experience a period of intense focus \u2013 a little like being in a fight, Staresina explains. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like adrenaline. If you\u2019ve been punched, you\u2019re super sharp at that moment. It\u2019s only later that bruises show up. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the brain works on similar lines in that way.\u201d Those emotional bruises bring their own practical difficulties. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to ask for support because we don\u2019t have the vernacular for it,\u201d says Maggie Anne Hayes, 33. A breakup in 2018, followed by the traumatic death of her mother from cancer in 2021, left the trade union worker from north London with an increasingly unreliable memory. \u201cI forgot something really important at work,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep up. Remembering dates \u2013 birthdays, important anniversaries \u2013 has always been my way of showing people I care. I only realised how much I used to remember when I started to forget. \u201cSuddenly, I had no recollection of entire conversations with my loved ones. Even this week, two years on, I forgot my best friend\u2019s birthday. Of course, missing a birthday isn\u2019t calamitous, but it becomes a further indication that you\u2019re just not yourself. Even though it\u2019s understandable that, in trying to cope with everything going on, my brain let go of a few things, it was still scary.\u201d Clearly, the effects of stress on our memories are vast. But, Staresina says, our brains aren\u2019t permanently affected: \u201cThe good news is that anything that has been \u2018carved into\u2019 the brain, in that metaphorical sense, can also be untrained again.\u201d Research shows that sleep is a crucial part of stabilising memory, and treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) \u2013 which is like CBT but adapted for people who feel emotions very intensely \u2013 can have remarkable effects, helping those \u201cin the fog\u201d to find ways through the after effects of trauma and stress. After Owen-Nuttall returned to the UK in 2015, she was told that she had contracted an infection in her womb and would probably never fall pregnant naturally. It was the final straw, she says, and it triggered a \u201cfull mental and physical breakdown\u201d. \u201cI remember thinking, I need to find a way back to myself. And I didn\u2019t know how to get there. It\u2019s like your brain is trying to deal with so much that it\u2019s just switched off. It had gone back to basics, so I had to as well. The regret, coupled with beating myself up for not being able to remember anything, was exhausting.\u201d Together, she and her husband started to practise the things that had always come so naturally before \u2013 baking, cooking and studying. She had therapy and did \u201can awful lot of deep, inward-looking exercises\u201d. Despite her prognosis, she became pregnant naturally three years ago. Owen-Nuttall now works as a fertility wellbeing practitioner and has been writing about her experience, which she says is helping to unlock all the information that she once felt was lost for good. \u201cThere are still odd things Daniel asks if I remember from that time and it\u2019s a complete blank,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, though. It\u2019s been hard. But, eight years on, I\u2019m remembering more, and I finally feel like myself again. I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d874b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/17/parmigiana-recipe-courgette-mozzarella-parmesan-layered-bake-rachel-roddy", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for courgette, mozzarella and parmesan layered bake | A kitchen in Rome", "lead": "An inventive savoury bake in which layers of softened courgette are squashed firmly between two types of cheese and tomatoes", "author": "Rachel Roddy", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 10:00:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625603", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a738fd2c14b17a92a0c1a00f2ab25ddb34a095be/0_750_2448_1469/500.jpg", "body": "While the selection is best between midday and 2pm, I prefer going to the canteen-like Felice just under our flat at about 3.30pm, because, after the rush of lunch, even the chairs seem to sit back and sigh with relief. And because there is less to choose from, which is great, because I am busy, hungry and don\u2019t want to think; the counter tells me. Also, by mid-afternoon, the last of the vegetable dishes they do so well \u2013 the several-inches-deep aubergine parmigiana, the mashed potato cake, the flat green beans stewed in tomato, and little cubes of roast potato with rosemary \u2013 have been sitting a while, resting, soaking. And now that hot days are here again, the resting is even better for vegetable dishes long out of the oven but far from cold, and their flavours are the better for it. Four o\u2019clock, however, was too late, and I watched the last slice of parmigiana go home in an aluminium box with a man in a Guns N\u2019 Roses cap with a guitar strapped to his back. Which, of course, made me resent him and his parmigiana more. So, after a rice ball and a potato croquette with a bit of cheese in the middle, I bought basil, tomatoes and mozzarella, which I pulled out of its plastic bag of cloudy liquid and put on a plate in the fridge, so it would drain overnight, ready for the next day. It was only when I\u2019d got everything out the next morning \u2013 the plate of drained mozzarella, the parmesan, the tomatoes for the sauce and the basil \u2013 that I realised I had forgotten the principal ingredient: the bloody aubergine. It was already hot, and the idea of going out again and then frying slice after slice of egged aubergine felt less than appealing. But I did have courgettes, and parmigiana is simply a layered, baked thing \u2026 which brings me to this week\u2019s recipe. Could they work? And could they work without pre-frying, or would they release a lot of water as they baked and set the whole thing afloat? The answer is: yes, they work! And, yes, they do release a large amount of liquid. Which is why this week\u2019s recipe is an exercise in blotting and tilting. Blotting the thin strips of courgette, blotting the already-drained mozzarella, and then, halfway through cooking, pulling the tin out of the oven and tilting it slightly to ladle away some of the excess liquid. But, in return, it is the most delightful bake, with the courgettes stewed and softened in the liquor before being baked into a firm slice with tomato and two types of cheese. The resting period is even more vital than with aubergine parmigiana, I think, to give the remaining juices and sauce time to be absorbed, and the mozzarella and parmesan to cool, so the cheese grouts and binds everything together. Take a lead from Felice \u2013 in the oven at 11am and out by 11.45, to be eaten at 2pm. Although it is even better at 3.30pm, with a beer at the table near the window. Courgette, mozzarella and parmesan layered bake Serves 4-6 600g courgettes Salt 500g mozzarella, drained overnight and then blotted Olive oil 300ml tomato passata, or thick tomato sauce 100g parmesan, grated A big handful of basil leaves Using a mandoline or a potato peeler, cut the courgettes into thin strips \u2013 don\u2019t worry if they are not perfect. Pat dry with kitchen towel and sprinkle with salt. Rip the mozzarella into small, scraggy pieces, and blot them dry. Rub a deep-sided metal tin or small baking dish with oil, then use a third of courgettes to make a base layer, arranging the pieces neatly, but not worrying too much. Cover with a third of the sauce, a third of the cheese, half the mozzarella and a handful of basil leaves. Repeat the layers of courgette, sauce, parmesan and the remaining mozzarella and basil, then finish with a final layer each of courgette, sauce and the remaining parmesan. Bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 20 minutes, then remove from the oven and tip away or ladle off some of the excess liquid. Return the tin to the oven and bake for another 20 minutes, or until the top dark and golden.

Fans said the presale access codes they were given didn\u2019t work properly and the Ticketmaster website crashed repeatedly. As a result, the main sale was cancelled and a group of fans filed a lawsuit accusing the company of fraud, price-fixing and anti-trust violations. \u201cWe need to do better and we will,\u201d said Joe Berchtold, president of Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company Live Nation. In the UK and Europe this month, presales for various dates and locations opened at different times and different days, to try and avoid the same issues \u2013 but fans have found the process stressful and unpredictable. We spoke to some of them about the difficulty of buying Swift tickets, and to people across the industry about how the ticketing system can be improved. How transparent is the pricing and distribution system? Ticket prices for the primary market (those sold through a tour\u2019s official ticket partners) are determined by the artist and their team alongside the tour promoter. Sometimes, they employ dynamic pricing where ticket prices fluctuate according to demand, as they do in the airline industry. While this doesn\u2019t seem to have been in play for the Taylor Swift presales, Ticketmaster has used it in the recent past for shows by Harry Styles and Coldplay (and got flack due to prices sometimes doubling). For artists playing arenas and stadiums, prices typically fluctuate depending on how close the tickets get you to the stage. Then there\u2019s the growing popularity of various VIP packages which offer a host of add-ons (of varying quality) for an extra fee. Swift fans only found out how much they were expected to pay for tickets once they made it through the giant online queues to the seat allocation: the fans we spoke to for this article reported price tags that ranged from \u00a378 to \u00a3600 for a single ticket. What makes it even more confusing is that multiple ticket companies will usually be involved in selling tickets for one show. Adam Webb, campaign manager at campaign group FanFair Alliance, explains: \u201cAt the majority of UK venues, box office contracts are usually outsourced to a third-party ticket company, which can be guaranteed an allocation of up to 60-70% of the tickets.\u201d Promoters will then appoint a range of other companies to sell the rest, \u201cso it\u2019s quite common to see two, three or four official ticket agents at UK shows,\u201d he says. For the Eras tour in the UK and Europe, there are five official providers operating across the different territories: Ticketmaster, AXS, Eventim, See Tickets and eBilet. That\u2019s before you get to secondary resale sites such as Viagogo and StubHub. Ticket prices are determined by the third-party seller and based on demand, hence they can reach extortionate levels. A recent listing on Viagogo priced up one ticket for Swift\u2019s 21 June Wembley Stadium date from \u00a349 face value to \u00a3393, plus a \u00a374 booking and \u201chandling\u201d fee. How much preparation does it take to get a Swift ticket? Swift fans have been employing complex strategies involving spreadsheets, group chats, multiple computers and social media in order to aid their success in getting tickets. Hopeful fans needed to register for a presale code, which they already had if they\u2019d pre-ordered Swift\u2019s Midnights album last year. . Registration didn\u2019t guarantee a code, and some were waitlisted; even those with codes are then put into a queue to buy tickets, their position seemingly random. Andrea Rogers-M\u00fchlhaus, a Swift fan who lives in Munich, had multiple presale codes and three computers set up for presale day. She and a friend tried to get tickets in Munich, Milan and Zurich but couldn\u2019t get any that were in line with their \u20ac300 per-person budget. After crying and feeling like she wanted to \u201cthrow up\u201d from stress, Rogers-M\u00fchlhaus\u2019s husband got lucky. He managed to track down another code for Warsaw and secured affordable tickets. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly impressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018you can go all the way to the basket but it\u2019s going to time out because it happened to me\u2019. But it\u2019s like he walked into a grocery store, picked up an apple, went to the checkout and it was his. It was so flawless.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s deputy music editor Laura Snapes, who was eventually successful in buying tickets, has this tip: \u201cCheck again later once it seems as though a date is sold out, to try buying individual tickets \u2013 I got two in a row that way \u2013 and to keep searching for tickets even if it says none are found.\u201d What other issues have fans faced? As well as these frustrations, French fans were left hanging last week after the sale was suspended due to a website glitch. And even fans who got through to the sale found themselves repeatedly getting timed out of the website, or panicking in the face of a 90-second checkout window. Disabled fans trying to get tickets to the Wembley Stadium dates were faced with even more issues. They needed to call an access line managed by the venue directly, which Swift fan India Rose Meade says wasn\u2019t functional on Monday\u2019s presale day. \u201cIt would connect to the point that it would say \u2018this line is too busy, please try again later\u2019 and cut out after three or four seconds. It did that from opening time all the way through to the end of the day.\u201d Meade eventually got hold of tickets by calling a different number on Tuesday. Similarly, it took Jack Fermor-Worrell until 1.30pm on Tuesday afternoon \u201cto reach an actual human being\u201d. Then, he was faced with an option of buying a ticket for \u00a3197.25 \u2013 a \u201cmuch higher price\u201d than he\u2019d hoped for. In a complaint written to the venue Fermor-Worrell said: \u201cI feel beyond let down and somewhat insulted by the service that Wembley Stadium has provided to its disabled patrons throughout this entire experience.\u201d Is it a simple matter of demand outstripping supply? A big part of the problem is unprecedented demand for the Swift shows. The 131-date tour could become the first in history to reach more than $1bn in ticket sales. Part of this is due to the fact that Swift is \u201chaving a moment\u201d, says ticketing expert and consultant Tim Chambers: after dipping in favour at the end of the 2010s, Swift is back on top. Chambers calls the tour the \u201cepitome of a frothy Fomo event\u201d. Each show lasts more than three hours, encompassing highlights from her back catalogue to date. There\u2019s also pent-up demand: it\u2019s Swift\u2019s first tour since her 2017-18 Reputation dates. Since then, as Chambers points out, \u201cwe\u2019ve had the pandemic, which forced a lockdown and limitation of live, and the re-recording of her back catalogue, so the tour is well-timed\u201d. Speaking of Covid, there\u2019s also what economist Will Page correctly predicted to be \u201cthe slingshot\u201d effect at play. After a two-year downturn of the live music industry, ticket sales bounced back last year as fans and artists clamoured to get back into venues to make up for lost time. According to data from trade title Pollstar, which concerns the US market, total ticket sale gross hit $6.28bn in 2022, up 13.2% on the pre-pandemic year of 2019. The publication is predicting a record-setting year at the box office thanks in large part to a number of big-selling artists, including Swift, being on the road. What would a better, fairer ticketing situation look like across the industry? Beyond improving technology to better handle high demand, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint what a different solution might look like. While there are many reports of issues with the sales process, other fans have been satisfied. Swiftie Mollie Corrigan managed to get seven tickets thanks to a presale code she got by ordering Swift\u2019s latest Midnights album. \u201cIt meant that longtime fans got priority with tickets, which has been great compared to the general sale system where it\u2019s random, and a lot less people were trying for the tickets at one time.\u201d Pixies manager Richard Jones says the issue lies in the complexity of the buying process. \u201cI personally think they\u2019ve tried to be too clever and made the entire process far too frustrating and difficult for people, who have other things going on in their lives. Yes, the demand is insane but knowing that, they need to prepare in a more sensible way. Make it more streamlined, make it very clear what you need to do to try and get a ticket and put all the dates on sale at the same time.\u201d When it comes to the secondary market, Jones says artists and their teams could have better control and \u201cimmediately\u201d cancel any tickets that show up on websites like Viagogo and StubHub, a process he calls \u201ccomplex, but very doable\u201d. Phil Hutcheon, who heads up ethical ticketing platform Dice, says the issues associated with the Eras tour create a \u201clack of trust\u201d in the market. His platform advertises prices up front and doesn\u2019t allow reselling. If fans can\u2019t go to a sold-out show, organisers can deploy an option where, at the tap of a button, a refund is issued and the ticket goes to someone on a waiting list. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science \u2013 it should be the same as buying a toaster on Amazon,\u201d he says. \u201cAt a basic level I think most of us want transparency,\u201d concludes FanFair Alliance\u2019s Webb. \u201cWe want clear upfront info about which companies are licensed to sell tickets, the pricing, and any important information about its use. And we also want to know where we can resell a ticket at the price paid or less, while cutting out the parasitical secondary market that invests nothing in UK culture.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d874d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/australian-government-spending-big-four-consultancy-firms", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australian government spending on big four consultancy firms up 1,270% in a decade, analysis shows", "lead": "PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY face scrutiny as critics warn core functions of democracy should not be outsourced", "author": "Henry Belot", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 09:39:33", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625684", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/87095433aa3a1ef8c81c20facd78507b8b9d044d/0_169_6550_3930/500.jpg", "body": "The amount of taxpayer money given to the big four consultancy firms for management advisory services has increased by more than 1,270% in a decade, according to new analysis from the Centre for Public Integrity. The analysis comes as the big four face intense scrutiny after disclosing the misuse of government information and multiple conflicts of interest, as well as concerns that taxpayers are being ripped off for work the public service once conducted itself. In 2012 the federal government spent $44m on these services, which include audits, project management and strategic advice. In the last financial year the bureaucracy spent $605m, with the largest share of that money going to KPMG. The increase was mostly due to a huge increase in demand from the defence department, which accounts for almost 80% of KPMG\u2019s management assurance contracts, the analysis found. But the Centre for Public Integrity found it was \u201cvery difficult to identify precisely what Defence is procuring\u201d based on publicly available information. \u201cCurrent procurement disclosure requirements and practices mean that precisely what is purchased with taxpayer dollars is frequently opaque, leaving government unable to assure the public that they are receiving value for money,\u201d the report said/ \u201cA sample includes such descriptions as \u2018business support services\u2019, \u2018process and resource review\u2019, and \u2018logistic service provider\u2019. What is meant by any of these descriptions is unknown.\u201d Defence was contacted for comment. Geoffrey Watson, a board member at the Centre for Public Integrity, said it was difficult to properly assess the consultancy spend without more information being provided. \u201cWithout it, how can the public be expected to have confidence that they are actually getting value for money with the enormous sums of money that are being used to procure these services, which are almost certainly at times within the core function of the public service,\u201d Watson said. Spending on consultants spiked when the federal government imposed staffing levels caps, which were first introduced by former prime minister Tony Abbott and removed by the Albanese government. When the staffing caps were reached, departments often turned to consultants who did not count towards that cap. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The former competition watchdog head Prof Allan Fels has warned consultancy firms have been able to charge higher rates as the public service becomes more reliant on their services. He has called for new rules governing how taxpayer money is spent. \u201cWe need public criteria about the circumstances in which governments can engage consultants,\u201d Fels said. \u201cIt is essential that the criteria specify that core functions of democracy should not be outsourced.\u201d The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, on Monday said the commonwealth\u2019s reliance on consultants was worse than she initially expected and warned that would take time to change. \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps to rectify that, but it\u2019s going to take a bit of time because of the way the imbalance has occurred over particularly the last five to seven years,\u201d Gallagher told the ABC. \u201cThere will always be things that you need to seek external advice from, but at the moment, the balance is out of whack.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, who worked as a consultant before entering politics, said a rethink on consultant use was required. \u201cKnowing when to use them, and how to use them, is something the government needs to get better at. There is no question about that,\u201d Taylor told the ABC. Andrew Podger, a former Australian public service commissioner and former health department secretary, has previously told an ongoing Senate inquiry that consultants may be influenced by commercial motives when giving government advice. \u201cThere is a [risk], when you become reliant on consultants and the consultants also want to continue to get business, that they may tailor their work in order to ensure that they get future business and they won\u2019t necessarily be as independent as you would desirably want,\u201d Podger told the inquiry earlier this year. \u201cI think this does occur from time to time.\u201d The big four consulting firms include PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d874e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/17/actors-strike-streaming-1-cent-paycheque", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The 1 cent paycheque: here\u2019s the awful truth about being an actor in the \u2018golden\u2019 age of streaming", "lead": "While streaming services rake in hundreds of millions of dollars, many TV stars can\u2019t even afford heating \u2013 or are somehow paid in negative figures.

It effectively shuts down production on hundreds of films and TV shows, which means that thousands of crew members will be out of work. The lack of stars willing to promote their work mean that the festival circuit is functionally kaput. Worst of all, it means that new original scripted content will soon dry up, and I will be forced to write about all sorts of worthless true crime documentaries. This, I\u2019m sure you will agree, is the real tragedy here. Nevertheless, as inconvenient as it may be, the strike feels vital for the future of the acting industry. As with the Writers Guild of America strike (when we learned that a writer for critical darling The Bear was paid so badly that it left him overdrawn and he had to work in an apartment with no heating after the studio refused to fly him to the writers\u2019 room in Los Angeles), details are emerging about the difficulty of being a working television actor in the age of streaming. This was underlined by a recent feature in the New Yorker, concerning the miserable compensation received by cast members on the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black. Kimiko Glenn, who played Brook Soso, posted a video to Instagram in which she opened a Sag-Aftra foreign-royalty statement and, despite starring on a huge, award-winning series that helped pave the way for the current glut of streaming originals, discovered she had been paid just $27.30 (about \u00a321). Another cast member, Matt McGorry, replied to the post revealing that he had to keep his day job throughout filming, because he couldn\u2019t support himself on his acting salary. A further star, Beth Dover, revealed that, after deducting travel expenses, she lost money on the show. One of the issues here \u2013 and one that is driving the Sag negotiations \u2013 is the lack of residual rates (similar to TV royalties) offered by streaming services. Previously, a guest star on a series could expect a cut of the money whenever an episode was re-aired anywhere, and this could help sustain them through the leaner times that most actors experience. But streamers such as Netflix don\u2019t re-air episodes because all their content is constantly available to be watched by anyone around the world whenever they want. So, as the New Yorker reports, Emma Myles can still make hundreds of dollars a year for a few spots on the traditionally broadcast Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, but only $20 a year for OITNB, which she worked on for six years. This isn\u2019t to say that OITNB is especially terrible either: as the strike begins to bite, more and more actors are revealing how hard streaming has made it for them to make a living. Kendrick Sampson, an actor who has spent the past half-decade working on shows including The Flash, Insecure and I\u2019m a Virgo, recently wrote a Thread revealing that he received 50 residual cheques for his work over the past year, but they totalled just $86. Brandee Evans from P-Valley posted a TikTok of a residual cheque she received for exactly one cent. Kamil McFadden, an actor who has worked on I Think You Should Leave, KC Undercover and Millennials, tweeted a scrolling list of his recent residuals, many of which somehow detailed negative figures. It is a lousy situation, and is not helped by the fact that many people think all television actors must be dripping with money. They have heard about the vast sums made by the cast of Friends, The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory, and assume that this level of opulence applies all the way down the line. Which isn\u2019t the case at all. To qualify for Sag-Aftra health insurance, an actor is required to earn $26,470 from acting or residuals each year. It has been claimed that 75% to 90% of members are not able to reach this threshold. Even household names can fall foul of this; two years ago, Sharon Stone lost her union health coverage after earning $13 less than the minimum figure. At the bottom end of the scale, a background performer will make the equivalent of \u00a3142 a day, for insecure, irregular work. But even that is being chipped away at. Sag claims that background artists are now having their likenesses scanned when they sign on for a project, with studios apparently reusing them in other work without consent or compensation. Obviously, this points at a miserable present and a worse future, and is especially unfair when studio bosses are earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It is hard not to see this and want to support the strikes however you can. And if that means I have to sit through another miserable true crime documentary, it is a sacrifice worth making."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d874f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/17/captured-the-public-zeitgeist-court-to-hear-appeal-against-england-wild-camping-ban", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Captured the public zeitgeist\u2019: Court to hear appeal against England wild camping ban", "lead": "Dartmoor ruling has sparked mass trespasses that may lead to biggest shake-up of land rights in a generation", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 09:11:33", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625728", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8458026031ed054529fe231c5a364b5c80543e8d/0_85_3863_2319/500.jpg", "body": "When wealthy hedge fund manager Alexander Darwall won a court case to stop people wild camping on his land in Dartmoor national park in January, he could not have imagined that it would spark a mass uprising and what may turn out to be the biggest shake-up of land rights in a generation. This week, the owner of the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor, which offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals, will be back in the headlines after the national park won the right to appeal against the high court ruling. The landowner launched his legal action at a time when access to the countryside in England was already a highly contentious issue. Campaigner Nick Hayes recalls a moment in 2019, at writer Guy Shrubsole\u2019s kitchen table, where they sat discussing how to get the issue of access to green space on to the public agenda. Despite only 8% of the country being available for picnicking and walking without permission from the landowner, it was not really a big public issue at that time. The right to roam in England had been lost over generations, with signs saying \u201cno trespassers\u201d becoming part of the fabric of the countryside for most people. Hayes told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve been raised into a country where the status quo is to not be allowed to swim in our rivers, or not be allowed to wander in our woods unless we\u2019re wealthy enough to pay for access. That\u2019s normal for us now.\u201d The pair released two critically acclaimed books on the issue. Shrubsole mapped the ownership status of land in England in Who Owns England, while Hayes wrote about the history of land rights and trespass in the country in The Book of Trespass. They also decided to start up a campaign of planned trespasses, to highlight how much of the country is off-limits. Inspired by the Kinder trespass in 1932, where people walked up the highest point in the Peak District to protest against a lack of access to nature, they started up their own series of trespasses. \u201cWe started going on trespasses in the summer of 2021,\u201d Shrubsole said. \u201cOur first was on council-owned land on the South Downs, we got 300 or 400 to people to come. Then our group kept organising them, each trespass highlighting a different issue of access.\u201d The first trespass was in Caroline Lucas\u2019s constituency and the Green MP then became involved in the campaign. In October last year, she tabled a bill on the right to roam, to allow the public to access woodlands and the green belt in the same way they can currently walk the coastal paths. The Kinder mass trespass of 1932 was a catalyst towards the creation of the first national park in 1951 \u2013 Shrubsole hopes today\u2019s access campaign will have a similar impact. The Guardian has accompanied Shrubsole, Hayes and other protesters on a few of their mass trespasses. Last summer, they danced, sang, walked, picnicked and played music in green fields and under ancient oak trees. Many who took part remarked that it was odd that these idyllic scenes in the English countryside were in fact unlawful. In neighbouring Scotland, there is a right to roam through the countryside, as long as people abide by a code with regards to littering, keeping dogs on leads around livestock, and other matters of safety and politeness. The protests have slowly grown in number, with a feeling of momentum building, but a lot of the same faces were cropping up at each one. The campaign was reaching a group of committed nature lovers and leftwingers, when really this was a fight for everyone\u2019s rights, no matter their political party. A few months later, in the icy depths of winter, the Dartmoor case was heard in a stuffy little room in the high court. In the presence of less than a dozen people, the argument centred on the phrase \u201coutdoor recreation\u201d in the Dartmoor Commons Act. The landowner argued that it had a very narrow definition, encompassing activities such as horseback riding and picnics, and not backpack camping. The national park strongly disagrees and says this decision will mean long hikes across the park, which can take days, will be curtailed. When the ruling was handed down a few weeks later, with the judge siding with the landowner, the response was dramatic. From military veterans, to keen hikers and families who love camping under the stars, people were outraged that this ancient tradition on Dartmoor could be overturned because of the desires of one wealthy man. Right to roam campaigners organised a protest on Darwall\u2019s land and were stunned when 3,500 people showed up. It was by far the biggest protest yet. \u201cIt was kind of a magic that captured the public zeitgeist; it\u2019s been a long-running campaign, but like with the Kinder trespass this has kind of galvanised people and with this energy we might be able to progress our rights,\u201d Hayes said. Shrubsole added: \u201cIt\u2019s taken the actions of the Darwalls to attempt to rescind people\u2019s rights, to make people aware of what we still have and what we stand to lose and what we could gain as well. Darwall\u2019s victory is a phyrric one.\u201d More political parties then got involved. The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, met campaigners at the national park and declared a Labour government would pass a right to roam law, allowing more access to the countryside. The Liberal Democrats are also trying to bring legislation to parliament to allow more wild camping. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant to see all the opposition parties having a race to the top in terms of promises of policies ahead of the next election and I hope it keeps going,\u201d Shrubsole added. Kevin Bishop, the mild-mannered chief executive of the park, has found himself at the eye of a media storm. Land rights campaigns weren\u2019t really in his job description, but he has risen to the challenge and he and the team have been working to build their case for appeal. Though the ruling knocked their confidence, Bishop said he thought it was important to do the right thing, even if they lose. McMahon agrees. He said: \u201cThis is so much more of an issue than Dartmoor \u2026 It threatens everything we\u2019ve taken for granted, really, which is the access rights that we all enjoy, which are under a fundamental threat if this is allowed to go unchecked.\u201d Dartmoor national park will on Tuesday appeal against the judgment, and now the national conversation has started, it is unlikely to stop. If Labour win the next election, they have committed to a wider right to roam. Darwall refuses to speak to the media, bar the occasional statement through his lawyer, but it would be interesting to know what he thinks about being the catalyst for such a moment of significance."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8750", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/fbi-head-christopher-wray-republican-attacks-fisa", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Progressives denounce FBI attacks by right wing but push for agency reforms", "lead": "Some Democrats wonder if a cross-aisle push to include privacy protections into the reauthorization of Fisa is now possible", "author": "Joan E Greve", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 09:00:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625746", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/85b6c14f38f396cca41bdc232dbccdc8eea5705c/0_473_7336_4402/500.jpg", "body": "Christopher Wray appeared stupefied. As the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified on Wednesday before the House judiciary committee, Republicans on the panel painted him as a liberal stooge abusing his power to punish Joe Biden\u2019s political enemies. The accusations stunned Wray, a registered Republican who was appointed by Donald Trump and previously served in George W Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cThe idea that I\u2019m biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me, given my own personal background,\u201d Wray told the committee. Some progressives share Wray\u2019s disbelief. The two indictments of Donald Trump, as well as Hunter Biden\u2019s plea deal with federal prosecutors and conspiracy theories about the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, have fueled Republicans\u2019 accusations that the FBI and the justice department are unjustly targeting rightwing groups. Those allegations have somewhat complicated progressives\u2019 longstanding criticism of the FBI over the bureau\u2019s documented surveillance of liberal activists. Even as progressives denounce rightwing conspiracy theories about the FBI, they continue to push for an overhaul of the bureau\u2019s surveillance and data collection methods. \u201cIf Republicans really care about FBI overreach of civil liberties, then they will get serious about the real reforms,\u201d Representative Cori Bush, a Democrat from Missouri, said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really what they\u2019re pushing right now. Instead, they\u2019re still amplifying those conspiracy theories and trying to distract the public, to gaslight the country and distract us from Trump\u2019s criminality.\u201d Progressives\u2019 skepticism of the FBI long predates Trump\u2019s presidency. In 1956, the FBI launched its domestic counterintelligence program (Cointelpro) to infiltrate and discredit political organizations that the bureau considered suspicious. The program, which shuttered in 1971, resulted in the surveillance of many leaders in the anti-Vietnam war and civil rights movements, including Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Progressive activists\u2019 concerns about FBI surveillance stretch into the present day. According to a 2022 memo declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in May, the FBI violated its own guidelines in running so-called \u201cbatch queries\u201d related to 133 people \u201carrested in connection with civil unrest and protests\u201d after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The memo found that the FBI conducted similarly inappropriate inquiries of more than a dozen people suspected of participating in the January 6 Capitol attack. \u201cThe FBI for many decades \u2013 almost a century \u2013 has been sort of the chief secret police entity against the left and progressives,\u201d said Vince Warren, executive director of the progressive Center for Constitutional Rights. \u201cDuring that time, the right wing and Republicans have been the biggest cheerleaders of this illegal activity when aimed at communists, civil rights advocates, anti-war advocates, all the way up to [Black Lives Matter] protesters. That seemed to change in 2016, when they backed a lawless president who didn\u2019t like that his illegal activities were being investigated.\u201d Republicans\u2019 sentiments toward the FBI have indeed shifted as Trump has come under increasing legal scrutiny, marking a notable sea change for a party that long claimed the mantle of law and order. When Trump was indicted on 37 federal charges last month for his alleged mishandling of classified documents, the former president\u2019s congressional allies jumped to his defense, accusing the FBI and the justice department of exploiting its powers to target Republicans. Opening the hearing with Wray on Wednesday, Representative Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the judiciary committee, bemoaned the \u201cweaponization of the government against the American people\u201d and \u201cthis double standard that exists now in our justice system\u201d. Jordan repeatedly suggested that Republicans and Democrats could work together on reforming the FBI\u2019s data collection methods, specifically in the form of overhauling the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa). That law, which is currently set to expire at the end of the year, has long been a source of outrage on the left. One particularly controversial provision of Fisa, section 702, allows the FBI to carry out warrantless surveillance of targeted foreigners overseas, and the personal data of many Americans \u2013 including Black Lives Matter protesters \u2013 have been swept up in the expansive searches made possible by the law. When Representative Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, questioned Wray on Wednesday, she focused her queries on the FBI\u2019s data collection methods and warned that Fisa would face \u201ca very difficult reauthorization process\u201d. During a press call on Wednesday, Jayapal expressed dissatisfaction with \u201cthe vagueness of the director\u2019s answers\u201d and suggested Democrats and Republicans could indeed work together to ensure a significant overhaul of Fisa. \u201cI think that this is actually a bipartisan area of concern,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWe have an opportunity here to ensure that any [Fisa] reauthorization that we pass contains some significant reforms that protect the privacy and the personal information of people across the country.\u201d On the possibility of bipartisan Fisa reform efforts, Bush said she was \u201copen to working with anyone who cares about real people and bringing about real change\u201d, although she remained skeptical of Republicans\u2019 commitment to the cause. \u201cIf that\u2019s what they actually want to see, then yes, I\u2019m open to working with them,\u201d she said. Warren was even more dubious about bipartisan efforts to overhaul the FBI\u2019s surveillance methods. Given Republicans\u2019 decades-long history of endorsing the FBI despite its controversial tactics, he considered it unlikely that the party\u2019s leaders would now embrace reform. \u201cWhile the right and left may both see a problem with the FBI, I don\u2019t see them agreeing on a reform solution,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe foundational challenge with federal law enforcement is that it broadly criminalizes communities of color and activists, and I think that, so long as those activists are environmental or [Black Lives Matter] ones, the right wing will be perfectly happy with the way things are going.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8751", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/17/the-wind-and-the-rain-review-finborough-theatre-london-merton-hodge", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Wind and the Rain review \u2013 love and whimsy in 1930s student comedy", "lead": "The first professional production of Merton Hodge\u2019s quippy drama in more than 80 years shows how a play can date", "author": "Arifa Akbar", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 09:00:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625764", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3470b18bbc1354aa2c874e12b1f6d0e9df5ccc1f/0_130_7101_4260/500.jpg", "body": "Merton Hodge\u2019s whimsical play became an international hit on its 1933 premiere and was performed over a thousand times and translated into numerous languages. This staging, which marks the first professional London production for more than 80 years, shows how a zeitgeisty drama can date. In this quiet comedy following three medical students in an Edinburgh boarding house, we only ever see them gathered in its front room to eat, study, drink and quip. It is a meticulously revived period piece, designed with detail by Carla Evans and its 1930s language fully intact \u2013 there are ample \u201cold boys\u201d and \u201ccheer-os\u201d. The play captures the hopes and fears of student life for a certain class of men, too, and it could be seen as a Men Behaving Badly type drama of its day: rakish Gilbert (Mark Lawrence) boasts of his sexual exploits, John (Harvey Cole) is a sports bore and Charles (Joe Pitts) the new arrival and swot. The house\u2019s refined Frenchman, Dr Paul Duhamel (David Furlong), occasionally pops up and the Scottish housekeeper Mrs McFie (Jenny Lee), brings gentle humour. In a production directed by Geoffrey Beevers, characters waft in and out, having meandering conversations about their impending night out, the rain outside, their love interests. The pace is glacial and it is hard to know where the story is going but it eventually finds a direction in Charles. Through him, it shows a tug between family duty versus love and sexual freedom after he falls for sculptor Anne (Naomi Preston-Low) but is already attached to Jill (Helen Reuben), who his family are keen for him to marry. The storyline gathers momentum towards the end but takes too long to get there with not enough emotional payoff. It is a shame because the cast is excellent, from Reuben\u2019s brittle gaiety as Jill to Preston-Low\u2019s contained anguish as Anne when she finds herself caught in a love triangle. There is an amusing turn by Lynton Appleton as Jill\u2019s cocktail-making squeeze Roger, and Pitts gives a strong central performance. Every character but Charles is paper thin and his dilemma, of whether to please his family or himself, seems too anaemic now. Apparently inspired by Hodge\u2019s experience of training as a doctor and also, arguably, of his bisexuality, it might have held a coded double-meaning in 1933, but here we see Charles merely stuck between marrying one middle-class woman or another. Like the Shakespearean reference of the title, this is a play of windy drifting.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life America, wrote that there was a \u201crecent obsession with putting Plan B vending machines on college and university campuses as some kind of miracle drug in a post-Roe America\u201d. \u201cAn anti-baby, anti-family bias permeates many campuses exposing students to risks and dangers they are either not told about or told to ignore.\u201d The \u201ccasual distribution of Plan B\u201d, Hawkins also wrote, exposes young women \u201cto dangerous people, to unknown physical consequences, and to the current epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\u201d. The apparent conservative backlash against Plan B vending machines stems from an influx of colleges installing them on campuses \u2013 at least 39 with more to come \u2013 amid post-Roe v Wade abortion restrictions. Advocates worry that criticism and disinformation could stymie access to emergency contraception. \u201cPlan B is an emergency contraceptive,\u201d said Kelly Cleland, executive director of the American Society for Emergency Contraception. \u201cPlan B works by preventing or delaying ovulation. If you miss the point in the cycle to prevent ovulation, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s different from the abortion pill in that Plan B prevents pregnancy from ever happening and medication abortion is used to end a pregnancy after somebody already has an established pregnancy.\u201d Since it works by preventing ovulation, there\u2019s a \u201creally short window\u201d for taking it. Because of this urgency, Plan B vending machines could help college students who might not be able to access Plan B elsewhere \u2013 due to remote geography, lack of transportation or intractable pharmacies. \u201cVending machines are such a good solution because they can be 24-7, or close to 24-7 access,\u201d Cleland said. \u201cThey can provide the product at a much lower cost and discreetly.\u201d Of opposition to Plan B and birth control generally, Cleland said: \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard for me to get my head around being against contraception if you want to prevent abortion. \u201cPreventing pregnancy is the best way to prevent abortion. Plan B, along with other contraceptives, can help people prevent pregnancies they don\u2019t want,\u201d she added. Ellen Herlihy, a student at Bard College in New York state, who has led efforts to install a Plan B vending machine on her campus, said that emergency contraception is nothing new to students \u2013 and that these machines are simply part of that. One will soon be installed in a student hub at Bard. \u201cAll that putting emergency contraception in a vending machine does is really increase its visibility and accessibility,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cEmergency contraception in vending machines is just a safe and effective way of acquiring a product that has been a part of college \u2013 especially a part of young women\u2019s \u2013 lives in college, for a while. EC has been bought and used by million and millions of women in college for a long time and is not something that is a new idea or practice.\u201d Misinformation on emergency contraception, Herlihy said, can be \u201cincredibly damaging and harmful to the young lives\u201d of people in college by discouraging them from seeking it. \u201cIf they feel more confident that their health will not be at risk by taking a pill, then they will not be put in a situation that causes more damage in the long-term like bearing a child at such a young age \u2026 or having to give up their education,\u201d she said. Jakeya Johnson, a graduate student at Maryland\u2019s Bowie State University, has been advocating for an emergency contraception vending machine on campus for two years. She said that they were something that students wanted and needed \u2013 not just for the medication, but privacy and judgment-free access. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that students have that kind of autonomy over their own healthcare,\u201d she said. Seeing this need, Johnson said, she wrote a bill and presented the proposed legislation to a state legislator. Due to Johnson\u2019s efforts, a law was passed requiring University System of Maryland schools to have a reproductive health plan \u2013 including 24-hour access to emergency contraception \u2013 by fall 2024. Johnson is advocating for these vending machines, which would include emergency contraception and wellness items, to be on her campus by the fall semester. As for backlash to emergency contraception in vending machines, Johnson said she was \u201cshocked\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation coming from the right,\u201d she said. \u201cTo call Plan B an abortion pill is completely wrong.\u201d What\u2019s more, restrictions on abortion have intensified the need for emergency contraception access for students in Maryland even though it is still legal in the state, she said. \u201cAbortion providers in the area are overwhelmed because they\u2019re seeing an influx of patients from out of state,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may have longer wait times, which may make it more difficult for you to access the care you need.\u201d Anti-abortion advocates have stood by their opposition to Plan B vending machines even though they could prevent unwanted pregnancies and thus, demand for abortions. \u201cPlan B vending machines are a bad idea because they expose vulnerable young women to many risks, including abusers and the pandemic of STDs, which are not prevented with a pill,\u201d Students for Life America said in a statement, also saying: \u201cThe vending machines are a medically negligent policy because they are set up without any assessment of total risk for the women taking them, including the risks of multiple doses of strong hormones.\u201d \u1427 Asked about disinformation surrounding Plan B, Foundation Consumer Healthcare, which makes Plan B One-Step, said: \u201cGiven the misinformation circulating around reproductive health, it is especially important that women are educated about options like Plan B One-Step emergency contraception, so they know how it works and can continue to be assured it remains legal and available in all 50 states.\u201d The company noted that it has donated Plan B One-step to advocacy and campus organizations, as well as clinics; through this initiative, they have donated more than 265,000 units of Plan B at no cost, the company said."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8753", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/17/poem-of-the-week-how-to-be-a-fern-by-kit-fan", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Poem of the week: How to Be a Fern by Kit Fan", "lead": "A pained love poem to Hong Kong, a city the writer has been forced to abandon", "author": "Carol Rumens", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 09:00:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625801", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/86d4edfabc531e56100ce0141c32577e92add5a0/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "How to Be a Fern Blue-white then inky grey then hailstones go pitter-patter on the glass. The city I loved whose name I\u2019ve erased returns between me and the glass as the thunder bends like saxophones buried inside one of Keats\u2019s urns. Give me a second chance, the city insinuates. A legion of storm clouds evaluates me. I was young, opened my heart too soon and the wind tore it apart just like that. Wind was never a city except when it drained the blood, stuffed silences like cotton wool into my ears, eyes, nose, asshole, mouth, and preserved what was left in me in mud Silence is the city I still kiss, not reason with. Many springs have swung by and I keep kissing, unfurling my tongue for the city in me I can\u2019t return to isn\u2019t rain, wind, or glass. I\u2019m no fern. Tell me how to be, and I\u2019ll learn and unlearn. From Kit Fan\u2019s recent collection, The Ink Cloud Reader, How to Be a Fern is a pained love poem to Hong Kong. \u201cThe city I loved whose name I\u2019ve erased\u201d suggests both self-preservation through emotional reticence, and a political context necessitating \u201cerasure\u201d. Fan has lived in the UK since the age of 21. The changeable weather seems lightly treated in the early lines of the poem. But wind and storm clouds may be images of menace: in a neighbouring poem, The Shape of the Wind, one of those shapes is \u201ca cloud of tearful gas\u201d. In How to Be a Fern, weather seems ominously claustrophobic: like the \u201cglass\u201d repeated in lines two and four, it embodies entrapment. In a striking audio-visual image, \u201cthe thunder bends like saxophones / buried inside one of Keats\u2019s urns\u201d. It revives memory, but cannot \u201cbend\u201d a way out, or shatter colonial walls. The bending of the saxophones connects nicely with the verb \u201cinsinuates\u201d. The city neither pleads for nor demands the speaker\u2019s return, its \u201csecond chance\u201d. There\u2019s less persuasive subtlety when \u201ca legion of storm clouds evaluates\u201d him. The violence of the wind in the ensuing lines, felt by a remembered self, young and exposed, urges the poem to a more emotionally direct and physically intense confrontation with suppression. A kind of mummification process, it\u2019s suggested, is set in motion by the \u201cwind\u201d. The latter has drained the blood, packed the orifices, \u201cand preserved what was left in me in mud\u201d. There\u2019s no full stop after \u201cmud\u201d and yet a capital S for \u201cSilence\u201d. The nouns are forced to stick to one another, although \u201cSilence is the city I still kiss, not reason / with\u201d. In the end, the city is felt inside the speaker. The speaker\u2019s tongue is not for language, but for kissing. We might imagine the curled tip of a fern trying to unfurl in a prison of double-glazing. Perhaps the constant silent \u201ckissing\u201d of the city takes the form of making poems for it? Kit Fan as technician is a poet of courage. He experiments with various structures in The Ink Cloud Reader, neither afraid to break rules nor to keep in touch with tradition. In How to Be a Fern a small act of courage lies in the final denial of the central metaphor: \u201cI\u2019m no fern\u201d. It\u2019s not the only dismissive gesture, and not only a dismissive gesture. \u201cTell me how to be, and I\u2019ll learn / and unlearn\u201d opens the window a little way and retrieves the hope for future change."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8754", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/17/cultural-prescription-super-fandom", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Stan and deliver: art, books, film and more about super-fandom", "lead": "From an intimate take on Harry Potter to a moving monument to Marilyn, our writers celebrate culture that plays the fame game", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 09:00:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.625822", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/816af626e4a68d805eb0bfa985cd54f3c837d2c1/0_19_2880_1729/500.jpg", "body": "Film The special effects are dodgy, the fans zealous, and Alan Rickman is in devastatingly droll form in Galaxy Quest, an adventure caper that both satirises sci-fi fandom while heeding the joy and heart of these communities at their best. Rickman, Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver play actors who used to be leads in a cult Star Trek-like television series, and now spend their days making appearances at fan conventions and lamenting the yesteryears of serious acting. (Rickman staring morosely into the mirror in alien-makeup: \u201cI played Richard the Third.\u201d) When they\u2019re approached by a group of kooky beings who ask them for help, and lead them to a recreation of their famed starship, the actors don\u2019t think much of it.

Rebecca Liu *** Theatre Thanks to Harry Potter fans, or \u201cPotterheads\u201d, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was one of the most breathlessly anticipated West End openings in eons. How to live up to the hype? The genius of writer Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany\u2019s production was to give the fans not what they wanted \u2013 but what the theatre needed. And that was a show with great heart (Harry as an insecure dad!) and brilliant magic. The stage tricks were kept purposefully lo-fi. But this didn\u2019t make the Dementors any less mesmerising; the invisibility cloaks any less miraculous. Instead, it meant that we \u2013 the audience \u2013 had to help dream Harry\u2019s magic into life. This collective effort of imagination turned a potential spectacle into a surprisingly warm, intimate and inspiring show, and helped a legion of young Potter fans fall in love with the theatre. Miriam Gillinson *** Music \u201cWhat if I told you / I feel like I know you?\u201d Indie-folk songwriter Phoebe Bridgers has long been outspoken about the boundary-crossing nature of digital-era fandom, the difficulties of being there for an audience who want more than you are able to give. Sharing its name with her breakthrough album title, her song Punisher draws on her own love of the songwriter Elliott Smith, and her gratitude that she never got to meet (or \u201cpunish\u201d) him in person, content to feel connected by haunting their shared stomping ground of Silver Lake, LA. In channelling Smith\u2019s gently creepy but deeply beautiful acoustics, it\u2019s no wonder that Bridgers has amassed her own fleet of occasionally overstepping admirers, drawn to the realism with which she builds worlds. Jenessa Williams *** Book In Misery, Annie Wilkes is the \u201cNo 1\u201d admirer of novelist Paul Sheldon. She is also \u201cdangerously crazy\u201d. This knowledge has come to Paul because she is holding him prisoner. She found him after he crashed his car in a blizzard and, instead of getting him to a hospital, she\u2019s taken him back to her isolated house. Thanks to the crash, Paul\u2019s legs are broken and Annie\u2019s got him addicted to painkillers. She withdraws the drugs if he doesn\u2019t give in to her whims \u2013 and soon she is forcing him to write a book for her, demanding that he bring back to life a character he had killed in a previous story. It\u2019s a fantastic premise that allows Stephen King to give free rein to his unique talent for generating fear and disgust. It also allows him to produce an exquisitely disconcerting exploration of creativity, addiction and love. In short, it\u2019s the work of a true master \u2013 and guaranteed to turn you into a devoted fan. Sam Jordison *** Art Andy Warhol makes a religion of his fandom in his 1962 masterpiece Marilyn Diptych. It was created in the age of stars, rather than mere celebrities. Warhol joins the millions addicted to the faces on the silver screen. To make Marilyn Diptych he repeatedly silkscreened a publicity image for the thriller Niagara, in which Marilyn Monroe plays a femme fatale. But Monroe had just died. Warhol depicts her on the right panel fading, decaying, her photographic image raw. On the left, he gives her eternal life, in colours as hard as plastic. It is a painting that shocks you into trying to understand pop culture. Warhol\u2019s Marilyn is martyr and saint, Madonna and God. He is an ironist with a broken heart.

Mine had soulful eyes, a shy smile, and I thought he was beautiful. I spent months trying to put myself in Brad\u2019s way. He was in the same tutorial class at secondary school as me, so I enjoyed at least one daily encounter, and others could be manufactured if I walked a certain way to the lunch hall or chose my PE options wisely. I would note our meetings in my diary, where I gave Brad (not his real name) the codename \u201cGregory\u201d, which I considered uncrackable and lush, probably because my mother admired Gregory Peck. (I later learned, when she asked me if I knew a boy called Gregory, that my mother had found my diary, but that\u2019s another story.) Brad was shy and he never went out with girls. I tormented myself with challenging metaphysical questions, such as, \u201cHow well do I know Brad?\u201d and, \u201cDo I really love him or is this an infatuation?\u201d It stumped me how Brad did not see that he and I were perfect life partners. After two years of Brad remaining steadfastly unobtainable, I decided to go off him. My love ended as abruptly as it started. The following week, Brad caught me up on the path to maths. \u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d he said. It seemed implausible to my 15-year-old self that the fates would work this way. Besides, being shy, I tended to underinterpret signals. \u201cDo you mean it?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo shit,\u201d he said. Brad and I broke up two weeks later, after one kiss in the squash court during PE, and absolutely zero conversational intercourse. And yet, for 36 years, I have remembered verbatim our dialogue en route to maths, the fact that I was walking ahead of him, the paving slabs of the little path, our kiss in the squash court, the discomforting clash of our teeth. I have loved other people much more fully since then. So, why do I remember Brad more vividly? What is it about our first loves that make them so enduring in our memories, and why can we never let them go? \u201cWe have loads of relationships, but in some ways we learn the most from the very first one,\u201d says Catherine Loveday, a professor at the Centre for Psychological Sciences at the University of Westminster. I\u2019m certain I learned nothing from Brad \u2013 but, then again, maybe my subconscious knows otherwise, because these questions engrossed me while I was writing my novel, Speak to Me. It tells the story of a woman who becomes obsessed with her husband\u2019s phone \u2013 he cannot keep his hands off it \u2013 and who in turn nurtures her own distractions. She has lost a case of letters, written by her first love, and must decide whether to go in search of him, or to put the past in its place. \u201cI think we could walk down a street and ask everyone about their first love and they could tell you about it in detail,\u201d says biological anthropologist Helen Fisher who, at 78, has spent a lifetime studying love. She met up with her first love decades after they separated and spent a night with him. \u201cThere are some things about first love that are really dramatic,\u201d she says, and they cannot all be explained by novelty, or what author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry refers to the \u201csocial contagion\u201d that has us pursuing \u201ctrue\u201d love even at age 13. As part of her research, Fisher \u201cput people in brain scanners and studied the brain circuitry of love. I\u2019ve found the basic pathway of people who have fallen madly in love,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting pathway\u201d, and it originates in \u201ca tiny little factory near the very base of the brain, called the VTA or ventral tegmental area.\u201d Fisher had expected to find this pathway in the outer part of the brain, where we do our cognitive thinking, or in the middle part, where our emotions reign. \u201cBut no. This pathway lies right next to the factory that orchestrates your drive \u2013 for hunger, thirst, the drive for shelter, the drive to learn, the drive to create.\u201d And, of course, as Fisher puts it, the evolutionarily driven need \u201cto send your DNA into tomorrow\u201d. When Fisher put the participants in her research into those scanners, \u201cwe found activity in the addiction centres of the brain. You\u2019re addicted when you fall in love with somebody,\u201d she says. \u201cAddicted to them.\u201d Each morning I walked into my tutorial class, or engineered a \u201cchance\u201d encounter with Brad, I was driven by the production of dopamine in my VTA. It doesn\u2019t matter that the love lacked depth or practicality. \u201cIt had emotional power,\u201d Loveday says, \u201cpurely because of what\u2019s going on chemically in the brain. The reward pathway activation you get every time you see that person, have contact with that person, is a very big predictor of whether something will stick in our mind. \u201cWhen we form a memory, it\u2019s not some magical thing. We\u2019ve got a network of cells that fire together to give us a conscious experience of remembering \u2026 We learn through pleasure and pain. Stuff that\u2019s good we want to do again, and stuff that\u2019s painful we want to avoid. In very simple terms, that pleasure-pain index is a chemical barometer in the brain [that decides] whether something needs to be done again \u2026 quite literally reinforcing neuronal circuits in the brain.\u201d However, first loves are rarely last loves. One problematic outcome of this chemical system is that first loves often flounder on a catastrophic mismatch between strength of feelings and future viability. Witness the accounts of Guardian readers who wrote in to share their experiences of the first loves from which they have never recovered. \u201cShe broke up with me a year after I met her. I\u2019ve mourned her ever since. No girl could match her. I could not feel for others, even for my future wife, what I had felt for her,\u201d writes one 78-year-old. \u201cI had a couple of relationships after, but they weren\u2019t as good. I spent vast periods of my life single,\u201d shares another. \u201cEvery person since has unknowingly been compared,\u201d admits a 30-year-old reader. \u201cNo one has ever matched up to what I had with him,\u201d writes another, in her late 60s. Why are some people affected so powerfully by their first love that they are unable to love as fully again? Lance Workman, co-author of Evolutionary Psychology, points out that this was the case for many bereaved women during the first and second world wars. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of PTSD \u2013 they don\u2019t feel they can love again.\u201d \u201cIt is a very important question,\u201d says Prof Sue Carter, a biologist and behavioural neurobiologist at the Kinsey Institute. \u201cBecause the same chemistry that allows first love is probably the chemistry we need to overcome trauma.\u201d When someone in their late 70s shares that subsequent loves never matched up, \u201cwhat they are telling you is that that first relationship blocked their capacity to love later\u201d. Carter shares a \u201ctidbit\u201d about William Masters, the gynaecologist and sex therapy pioneer, who, along with Virginia Johnson, pioneered research into human sexual behaviour. \u201cMasters and Johnson were married for 20 years before they divorced, after which Masters married his third wife, Geraldine Baker, whom he first knew in medical school, and whom he had met again by chance. It has been reported that Masters sent Baker roses and a love note when they were in college, but she never acknowledged them, and he only discovered at the age of 79 that she had never received them. Was Masters\u2019 young love for Baker, \u201ca barrier to forming lasting relationships with his first two wives?\u201d Carter asks. \u201cIn relationships, we can only speculate, but in trauma there is a great deal of research on this. Many people who have had so-called traumatic experiences seem not to have the ability to rewrite those experiences.\u201d It is not a huge leap to imagine that a failed first love might impose a similar legacy. Margaret Magee, who responded to the Guardian\u2019s call-out, was not traumatised when she broke up with her first love, Graham, at 17. But subsequently, \u201cI was traumatised by the fact that I\u2019d let him go when I really shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, she says. Though married, she kept the letters he\u2019d written to her in a carrier bag, and read them occasionally. \u201cI found solace in looking at them. I thought, \u2018This was a person that really loved me.\u2019 I missed him every day. It sounds hideously oversentimental, but it\u2019s true.\u201d After her marriage ended, Magee contacted Graham, and they got back together. At their wedding, 10 years ago, they danced to Careless Whisper \u2013 which they had first danced to at Magee\u2019s 18th birthday. She is now 56. \u201cI know you\u2019ll think it was science or psychological,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it was fate.\u201d Perry comes across this scenario surprisingly often. (Indeed, Fisher says that her sister also married her first love after a long period apart.) \u201cYou see them as they were,\u201d says Perry. And, presumably, doing so allows us to see ourselves as we were, too. \u201cWe do retain the image of someone and what they looked like when we first met them. I got off with my husband the first time when he was 27,\u201d Perry says. \u201cHe\u2019s a 62-year-old man now but he is perpetually 27 to me \u2026 I can\u2019t imagine getting off with anyone old if I was widowed. I\u2019d have to go for the small pool of people I knew as a teenager. \u201d Most people do not reunite with their first love, of course. So, why carry the imprint of those first experiences? Why doesn\u2019t my memory, for instance, identify Brad as a waste item (as I hope he has me \u2013 that was a terrible kiss) and dispose of him to make room for things that it would be helpful to remember, such as deadlines, medical appointments, or what I was saying 30 seconds ago? Surely a very old love for a very young person is memory junk that needs clearing out. \u201cGosh, no. No, no, no. So much the opposite,\u201d says Loveday. \u201cThe fact that those memories stay \u2013 even in someone who\u2019s in their 70s, 80s or 90s \u2013 tells us that this is a really important event. The discovery of relationships is absolutely paramount to the rest of our lives \u2026 It\u2019s not a wasted memory because we continue to learn and we continue to use it as a foundation for who we are. These memories help to give us a sense of what kind of person we are, what kind of lover we are, who we are. \u201cThe teenage years are a biologically optimum time, from a brain perspective, for retaining knowledge and developing memories,\u201d she says. While memories fade the further back we go, \u201cwe have this weird anomaly\u201d in our teenage years \u2013 a \u201cbig reminiscence \u2018bump\u2019\u201d. Our strongest and sharpest memories across our lifetime form between the ages of 10 and 30, and typically peak at around 15. No wonder so many Guardian readers were able to recall their first encounters as precisely and filmically as if they were replaying the scene. \u201cShe was in black school uniform and wearing glasses. She was holding a pen and spinning it in her fingers,\u201d writes one. \u201cHe sat next to me on a sticky sofa in the bar and put his arm around me,\u201d remembers another. \u201cI met him at a pyjama party when I was 15 \u2026 a teenager with eyeliner, some kind of woman\u2019s blouse, studded belt. He had an aura about him, like someone who\u2019d already lived more life than anyone in that room.\u201d Loveday, who remains friends with her own first love, points out that when asked to recall songs that are important to them, \u201cpeople will often choose one that relates to a first love. When you think about how many pieces of music we know and how many we encounter in our life \u2026 you have to ask yourself, why? Why would someone in their 70s \u2013 when they can choose from all the songs in the world \u2013 choose a song that reminds them of their first ever relationship?\u201d Sometimes, she says, we \u201cbump into\u201d our memories. A bit like going to a library in search of a book only to find that a familiar one, sticking out a little more on the shelf, catches our eye. \u201cNostalgia gets a really bad press,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, for most people, nostalgia is really good for our wellbeing. There\u2019s a lot of evidence that it makes us more adventurous, think more positively and make better decisions about the future.\u201d When I think of Brad, and honestly I do not do this very often, it is our silence that has stayed with me, alongside the gnashing teeth \u2013 the shame of having a \u201cboyfriend\u201d I could not talk to, the invalidating effect of my reserve. I called my novel Speak to Me and it features a character who is unable \u2013 or perhaps not permitted \u2013 to do just that. It\u2019s a novel, of course, and entirely fictional. But it is about all the ways we say and don\u2019t say the things in our hearts. So maybe Loveday is right, and I have continued to learn from and make use of my first love \u2013 just not in the way that I expected.

The 40-year-old Lancashire seamer will feature on home turf as he returns to the team in place of Ollie Robinson, the only change to the side that defeated Australia at Headingley in the third Test. England kept the Ashes alive in Leeds after Harry Brook steered the hosts to victory with 75 runs before Chris Woakes and Mark Wood\u2019s match-winning partnership drove them over the line. England trail 2-1 in the series with another must-win game ahead in Manchester. Another tweak to the side is the batting position of Moeen Ali, who has been promoted to No 3, with Ollie Pope ruled out for the rest of the summer. Brook had originally occupied the vacant spot, but all-rounder Moeen, who was dismissed for five while batting at No 3 in the second innings, was unexpectedly promoted after asking the head coach, Brendon McCullum, if he could bat there. \u201cWhen I took the role on I asked for 10 other selfless cricketers,\u201d England\u2019s captain Stokes said at Headingley. \u201cAnd that little moment of Mo going to Baz [McCullum] and saying, \u2018I want the opportunity\u2019 is everything that we\u2019re about as a team.\u201d Anderson was officially \u201crested\u201d at Headingley, even if three wickets at 75 runs apiece during the defeats at Edgbaston and Lord\u2019s sparked wider questions about the 40-year-old\u2019s enduring potency.

Today\u2019s main developments: The Australian Electoral Commission has received the official submissions from the yes and no campaigns on the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum. The two arguments will be published online mid-morning tomorrow, before a physical pamphlet with translations and general information is sent to Australians in future. Speaking on opinion polling for the voice that showed a declining yes vote, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, today said: \u201cThe yes campaign needs to be stronger in putting the case.\u201d Rangers are rejecting calls for a dingo cull at a tourist site on K\u2019gari after a woman was attacked by a pack of dogs while jogging on the beach and hospitalised. Deloitte\u2019s leadership appeared before a Senate inquiry on consultancy firms today. You can read a full breakdown on what happened from my colleague Henry Belot here. A giant metal cylinder has washed up on a beach in Western Australia, baffling locals and posing a mystery to police. In a statement, the Australian Space Agency said it was investigating whether the object is part of a foreign space launch vehicle. A man has died during a siege near Lithgow that lasted almost 48 hours. The Queensland government says it will push for the commonwealth to roll out free flu vaccinations across the nation every year, after announcing its own one-off program amid an outbreak of the virus. Have a lovely evening, and we will see you back here on the blog in the morning. Coldest morning of the year for Melbourne Melbourne recorded its coldest morning of 2023 today, dropping to 4C. The Bureau of Meteorology said it hopes everyone appreciated the \u201capricity\u201d \u2013 meaning the warmth of the sun in winter. Rangers reject cull call after dingo pack attacks woman Rangers are rejecting calls for a dingo cull at a popular tourist spot despite a woman being hospitalised after she was attacked by a pack of the dogs while jogging on a beach. She was flown to Hervey Bay hospital in a stable condition with wounds to her limbs and torso after suffering multiple bite injuries about 9am on Monday, the Queensland ambulance service said. Rangers said at least three dingoes attacked the 24-year-old while she jogged at Orchid Beach in the island\u2019s north-east. She ran into the water to escape the pack, and was rescued by two men who pulled her from the ocean and drove her to safety. Despite the growing number of attacks, rangers have angrily rejected calls to cull the dingo population on the tourist destination formerly known as Fraser Island. Ranger-in-charge Linda Behrendorff said their job was to mitigate risk, not cull for the sake of culling: You need to know the individuals, you need to work with the individual dingoes, and you also need to work with the situation that those dingoes are in. At least one of the animals in the pack was classified as a risk and has a collar with a device to track movement and behaviour, Behrendorff confirmed: One of the dingoes we have identified has been involved in a previous incident which was involved in contact \u2026 it was lunging with an intent to make contact. \u2013 with AAP Australia remembers victims of flight MH17 On the ninth anniversary of the downing of flight MH17, wreaths have been laid at the Australian memorial site to remember the 298 victims. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade tweeted: Our thoughts are with them and their loved ones. Australia remains steadfast in our pursuit of truth, justice and accountability. Earlier today, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, released a statement on the matter: Australia, along with our international partners, has made substantial progress in our pursuit for truth, justice and accountability over the last year. Wong said Russia \u201cmust take responsibility\u201d: Russia must take responsibility for the role it played in this horrific act of violence, and stop harbouring those who contributed to the downing of Flight MH17 and the murder of all on board. Australia maintains that Russia is responsible under international law for the downing of Flight MH17. \u2026 Our thoughts remain with those who lost their lives, their families and loved ones. It\u2019s been a very busy day of news \u2013 you can take a minute to catch up on all the biggest headlines with the Afternoon Update from Antoun Issa: Measles alert for Brisbane and Redcliffe A case of the measles has been confirmed in an adult on Brisbane\u2019s north side, with the Metro North public health unit issuing a list of exposure sites. The adult male was unknowingly infectious when he arrived at Brisbane airport on Monday 3 July and visited several businesses and locations on Brisbane\u2019s north side and Redcliffe peninsula. The full list of exposure sites can be viewed here. Dr Megan Young said anyone at the locations during said times should monitor themselves for symptoms for 18 days from when they may have had contact: If they do develop symptoms, they should seek medical advice. Early symptoms of measles include a fever, tiredness, cough, runny nose, and red, inflamed eyes. Those symptoms then progress to a blotchy red rash, which often starts on the face before becoming widespread.\u201d Measles symptoms typically start between seven and 18 days after infection. Anyone seeking treatment for an illness they think could be measles should call ahead before visiting their GP or medical practice to allow precautions to be taken that can prevent the illness spreading to others. Queensland Health recommends that anyone born in 1966 or after who has not had two documented doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or had proven measles should visit their doctor to get vaccinated for measles. Electoral commission confirms receipt of yes and no essays for pamphlet Electoral commissioner Tom Rogers is speaking on the ABC about the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum. He confirmed the AEC has received submissions from the yes and no campaigns for the official pamphlet. The two cases are due to go on the AEC\u2019s website \u201cat some point mid-morning tomorrow\u201d, he said. However, Rogers confirmed that the pamphlets would not be accompanied by translations as early as tomorrow: That is a huge task. A vast number of languages and Indigenous languages, that will take quite a significant period of time. There has to be a quality-control process as well to make sure that what is being translated is exactly what is in those cases. Rogers said they have already begun planning for the printing and distribution of the physical pamphlets: It is such a big job, we are already starting that process to make sure it is legible, also appears strictly neutral \u2026 and then we\u2019ll be doing a large-scale print \u2026 distribution process. Getting over 12 million of these things into all Australian households in a way that makes sense, is legible, and also has other information in the book around the referendum process - not just the yes and no cases, but the referendum process itself so people understand the process. Space agency to determine whether mystery object is from a space launch vehicle The Australian Space Agency has released a statement on the mysterious metal object that has washed up on a beach in WA. The agency says it is working to confirm whether the object is part of a foreign space launch vehicle that has washed ashore: The Australian Space Agency is making enquiries related to an object located on a beach near Jurien Bay in Western Australia. The Agency is working to confirm whether the object could be part of a foreign space launch vehicle that has washed up on shore, and liaising with global counterparts who may be able to provide information about the object. As the origin of the object is unknown, the community should avoid handling or attempting to move the object. If the community spot any further suspected debris they should report it to the Australian Space Agency via space.monitoring@space.gov.au. The Agency is committed to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, including debris mitigation and continues to highlight this on the international stage. You can read more about the mystery object here: The Bureau of Meteorology has released its weekly weather outlook for the week ahead. After a chilly and wet weekend along parts of the east coast, more of the same is forecast as a series of cold fronts sweeps across the south, the BoM says. Users experience delays in accessing ATO website If you are an eager person trying to lodge a tax return with the Australian Taxation Office this month, you might have noticed a delay in being able to access the site. The ATO says it has an \u201conline waiting room\u201d to manage user traffic, and this is not an error, and people do not need to call the ATO about this. The office says this has been in place since April 2020 to keep services running when there is high demand: It is a standard method used by many organisations to manage online user experience. This means while some users are still able to access our online services without issue, others are placed in a queue to await access to services. We are double-checking if it\u2019s a queue or it\u2019s like Ticketek\u2019s waiting room where, once you\u2019re in, your access is randomised. The ATO said there\u2019s no rush, in any case. People lodging their own returns using myTax have until 31 October, and waiting until the end of July allows the ATO to collect data from banks, insurers, and government agencies to make the lodgement process smoother. Senator O\u2019Neill is asked whether a royal commission is on the agenda. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet\u201d and that there is more work for the Senate to do first before it escalates to that stage: Despite a sense of mistrust amongst the public in the agencies of government, there is still a hope a royal commission can do something good and I think the robodebt inquiry has reinvigorated people\u2019s sense there will be truth telling \u2026 I think it is a failure if we don\u2019t exercise the full breadth of the capacity of the Senate to do our job. We\u2019re here not just to hold the government to account, but to hold the value of what government does for the Australian people up to the daylight and really investigate that. I think if we get to a point where we are unable to find a pathway to deliver good outcomes for the Australian people through the processes of the Senate and parliament, if we need to go to a royal commission, I will be on board with that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. I think there is a job of work for the Senate to continue. O\u2019Neill defends questioning Deloitte chief executive\u2019s salary Senator Deborah O\u2019Neill is speaking to the ABC following a day of consultancy inquiry hearings, in which she and Greens senator Barbara Pocock questioned representatives from Deloitte. She is asked why it was necessary to question Deloitte chief executive Adam Powick\u2019s multi-million dollar salary, asking him if he\u2019s \u201creally worth seven times the salary of the prime minister\u201d. O\u2019Neill said it comes back to a final point raised at the end of the day when she was questioning prof Brendan Lyne: I asked professor Lyne, have we got to a point where these \u2026 partnerships think they are bigger than the government? His answer was a monosyllabic yes. So, this is the reality. They think they\u2019re bigger and if your salary is seven times larger than the prime minister or nine times larger than the prime minister, and you\u2019re in every boardroom getting all their information and you\u2019re also landing spots with the government, you know everything about what is going on with everyone, everywhere, I suppose it\u2019s easy to become delusional about how significant you are and to convince yourself to every day you show up and you\u2019re worth thousands and thousands of dollars every second. Hello from Canberra, where Anthony Albanese is speaking to Sky News. Albanese has been asked about the Newspoll which shows that support for the voice is falling \u2013 41% in favour, while 48% are against. There is still some time to go, but the trend for support for the voice is on a downward trajectory. Albanese says the yes case must be \u201cstronger\u201d in putting forward its case. \u201cThe yes campaign needs to be stronger in putting the case.\u201d That is further than he has gone in recent times when asked about declining support \u2013 but now that the pamphlets detailing the case is about to head out to people, Albanese says it is time to get the \u2018yes\u2019 case rolling. He said: Most Australians, of course, will focus when the referendum is actually being held. It\u2019s got a while to go yet. What we know is that there\u2019s been a considerable no campaign already that is out there just trying to sow doubt. The yes campaign needs to be stronger in putting the case. Further to his belief that Australians will focus on the referendum once the date has been called, Albanese says it won\u2019t be a long campaign: The date will be between October and December. I don\u2019t plan to announce the date at Garma [festival] because that\u2019s just in a couple of weeks and there needs to be at least 33 days notice of the referendum campaign but there certainly doesn\u2019t need to be that very long campaign. And once the date\u2019s announced, then it will be the campaign on in earnest, and I don\u2019t think that Australians appreciate very long campaigns. That\u2019s been the case in the past. Wrapping up the interview Albanese was asked if he would visit China this year: It is likely to be the case. We\u2019re discussing arrangements between officials \u2026 I\u2019ve said really clearly we\u2019ll engage with China where we can and disagree where we must. I was pleased to meet with president Xi [and] my ministers have met with their Chinese counterparts over the past year [since taking office]. Albanese is asked whether any further rate rises are on the horizon, as the new RBA governor Michele Bullock was announced: I didn\u2019t try to pre-empt the past governor and I won\u2019t pre-empt the new governor either. Albanese said he wants the Indigenous voice to parliament to be an \u201cuplifting\u201d moment for the nation, like Kevin Rudd\u2019s apology to the stolen generation: We know that in the lead up to Kevin Rudd\u2019s apology for the Stolen Generations here in Parliament House there was a whole lot of concern, but none of them were realised. It was an uplifting uniting moment for the nation. And that\u2019s what I want this to be as well. Albanese is asked when the referendum will be held: The date will be between October and December. I don\u2019t plan to announce the date at Garma because that\u2019s in a couple of weeks and it needs to be at least 33 days notice [for the campaign to start]. I don\u2019t think Australians appreciate very long campaigns. He is asked whether it will be a five-to six week campaign: I\u2019ll consult, but that\u2019s the sort of timeframe that is appropriate. The statements, the yes and no statements, will be up on the AEC website \u2026 whether they go up just after midnight or early tomorrow morning [we\u2019ll see]. I have faith in the Australian people and they know that we need to do better on Indigenous affairs. Albanese is asked for details on what is included in the yes argument campaign pamphlet: It puts the case for why we need to do things better and differently. The voice is just the means to the end \u2013 the end is closing the gap, making a difference to the lives of Indigenous Australians. It is a very strong and powerful case that is put forward that will be available from tomorrow. Case for voice is \u2018very strong\u2019 despite decline in support, PM says Prime minister Anthony Albanese is speaking to Sky News with host Andrew Clennell. Albanese is asked about opinion polling on the Indigenous voice referendum, showing 41% support and 48% opposition. When asked if the referendum is \u201cdead in the water\u201d before it begins, Albanese said \u201cnot at all\u201d: People will focus and indeed today is the deadline for putting in the yes and no cases [forward]. The yes case is a coherent argument [put together from all sides of politics] who\u2019ve all come together to endorse the yes wording that will go out to the population. \u2026The yes case is very strong, it\u2019s clear, and when people focus on the words that are actually in the referendum \u2026 I\u2019m confident that a majority of Australian\u2019s in a majority of states will vote yes. Albanese acknowledged \u201cthe truth is it is hard to pass a referendum without bipartisan support\u201d, but said he remains positive: This is a clear and simply proposition for recognition \u2026 in order to achieve better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. If you need an explainer, here\u2019s something prepared earlier by Lorena Allam: Victorian councils struggle to fix roads as extreme weather bites Deteriorating roads are increasingly draining Victorian council budgets and more investment is needed to strengthen them against extreme weather events, an inquiry has been told. Pothole costs in Murrindindi, north-east of Melbourne, have tripled in recent years while 12 bridges, 27 culverts and 15 major roads were seriously damaged in October\u2019s floods, the shire\u2019s director of assets and environment Vito Albicini said. He told a parliamentary inquiry into weather impacts on rural and regional roads: Roads are the lifeline of the community. It\u2019s not just about transporting food, it\u2019s around their social health and wellbeing, it\u2019s the only way to connect people ... It\u2019s also the only way to get out of emergencies. Albicini said building resilient roads and sealing unsealed roads, rather than just repairing them, was key to avoiding constant and continual maintenance: At the moment we tend to be fixing them, just to find we have to fix them again in six months\u2019 time. We really do need federal funding support in a regular panel to help us. - from AAP Almost half of flu cases in Victoria among children Almost half of this winter\u2019s flu cases in Victoria have been in children under the age of 15, the state\u2019s health department said. In a health advisory published today, Victorian Health said that influenza A cases are likely peaking in the state, but influenza B cases \u2013 most common in young children \u2013 are increasing. Flu rates may continue to increase, especially in children, as they return to school after the holidays. Victoria Health said: In most children, flu causes mild to moderate illness with symptoms such as fever and cough. Some children can develop severe illness, particularly babies and children with underlying medical conditions. Flu can increase the risk of rare invasive bacterial infections such as Group A streptococcal disease and meningococcal disease, so influenza vaccination can also help reduce this risk. Traditional owners sign Crocodile Islands agreement Traditional owners have held a ceremony on Rapuma Island to mark the dedication of environmental protections for the Crocodile Islands, AAP reports. A newly signed Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) includes 20 islands, covering more than 78,000 hectares of land and 730,000 hectares of sea country on the archipelago off the coast of north-east Arnhem Land. Environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the government was following through on its promise to establish 10 new IPAs and double the number of Indigenous rangers by 2030: It\u2019s fantastic to see the protection of over 800,000 hectares of land and sea country in the Top End. The Crocodile Islands are home to over 20,000 migratory waterbirds every year and provide vital nesting beaches for turtles. The islands\u2019 mangroves, mudflats, coastal floodplains, monsoon forests, eucalypt forests, shallow seas and reefs are home to 44 threatened species, including turtles and dugongs. Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney said the IPA would support the Maringa people to realise their vision of managing their traditional lands and harnessing opportunities for local people to work on country. Many thanks to Rafqa for taking us through a big day! I\u2019ll see you through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. That\u2019s all from me on the blog today \u2013 thanks for following along. Handing over now to Emily Wind, who will take you through the evening\u2019s news. Flu vaccines will be free for all Queenslanders amid concern about the disease spreading among children as students return from holidays, AAP reports. There have been more than 51,400 cases of influenza recorded in the state this year \u2013 that\u2019s compared with less than 44,450 cases in 2022. Since the start of July, almost 80 children aged between six months and four years were hospitalised with the flu \u2013 50 with the B strain, and only one was vaccinated. Health minister Shannon Fentiman said about half of the people hospitalised with influenza B this season had been under 20. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the B strain was particularly severe and experts had warned of low vaccination rates in the state: I don\u2019t want there to be any barriers to getting the flu jab, which is why I am reinstating free flu vaccinations for all Queenslanders. The move comes after an 11-year-old girl died on the Sunshine Coast earlier this month after contracting the flu, which followed reports of the death of a student on the NSW Central Coast. Western Australia implemented a free influenza vaccine program in May and June, while other states and territories provide complimentary jabs for at-risk groups. Theories abound over mystery metal object The internet has been speculating on the mystery metal object washed up on a remote Western Australian beach \u2013 and Reddit has come to the consensus that it could be the third stage of India\u2019s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket. One user says the PSLV rocket has launched 57 times in total \u2013 most recently in April. They point to a launch that dropped the third stage in the Indian Ocean, \u201cfairly close to Australia\u201d. Another user, who says they work with large fibreglass tanks, says the tank looks to be 20-30 years old \u2013 or is not as old, and just battered by the ocean. This is all wild theorising on the internet \u2013 not fact. Western Australia police force is \u201cactively engaged in a collaborative effort with various State and Federal agencies to determine the object\u2019s origin and nature\u201d. More to come. Yes and no campaign essays to be published on Tuesday The referendum essays from the yes and no side will be published tomorrow, ahead of the official referendum pamphlet being delivered to voters later this year. The no side says they\u2019ve submitted their essay to the electoral commission, promising their essay will be a \u201csimple and clear message\u201d. As Daniel Hurst reported this morning, the yes essay was described by its authors as a \u201csimple, hopeful message\u201d. The essays, 2,000 words written by politicians who voted yes or no in the parliament to the constitutional alteration bill, will be collated by the AEC and sent to all homes before the vote. The no essay, led by Coalition senators Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Paul Scarr, was submitted on Friday. \u201cAfter careful consideration of the input and views of all members of the committee, I believe the essay we have produced outlines the strongest case against the divisive Voice with a simple and clear message,\u201d Nampijinpa Price said in a statement. \u201cOur case informs voters of serious reservations held by those on all sides of politics, the significant risks inherent in the proposal and the divisive nature of such a massive change.\u201d Scarr claimed the no essay was \u201cvery strong... simple and persuasive\u201d: It reflects the arguments which have been made repeatedly by members of the Coalition against changing our constitution \u2013 the division, legal risk, lack of details and permanency. Both matters of principle and practical issues are covered.\u201d We\u2019ll bring you more on the yes essay when we have it. What could it be? Here is a look at the mystery metal object we have been talking about. Tweet me your theories on what on earth it could be @At_Raf_ Police doubt a mystery metal object washed up on a remote WA beach is from the infamous vanished flight MH370 \u2013 but they are treating it as hazardous. At this stage, it appears the object did not originate from a commercial aircraft, the WA police force said in a statement. The police force is coordinating a joint investigation into its origins, and officers are guarding the object in an effort to maintain the integrity of the investigation. This measure has been taken to ensure the preservation of potential evidence and facilitate further expert examination. Until the origin of the object can be established, it is being treated as hazardous. We want to reassure the community that we are actively engaged in a collaborative effort with various State and Federal agencies to determine the object\u2019s origin and nature. The investigation is ongoing, and until further information is available, we urge everyone to refrain from drawing conclusions. WA police urge people to keep a safe distance. Senate committee frustrated with lack of information from WeChat A Senate committee looking at foreign interference through social media has given platform WeChat a deadline to answer questions on censorship and Chinese Communist party ties, AAP reports. The committee has been frustrated with a lack of information from WeChat, despite repeated requests. Committee chair and Liberal senator James Paterson said the platform had been asked to answer 53 questions in detail by Friday: WeChat and its parent company Tencent demonstrated contempt for the parliament of Australia through its refusal to appear before the committee last week, but has now committed to providing responsive information to the committee in writing. I intend to hold them to that commitment. The questions seek explanations on WeChat\u2019s links to the Chinese Communist party, whether it censors content critical of the Chinese government, promotes CCP propaganda, and whether the application is used to surveil and target Australian users critical of the regime. The committee is due to report on 1 August with its recommendations. These recommendations could include legislation to ensure the integrity and transparency of all social media platforms operating in Australia, Paterson said. China\u2019s recovery from the widespread Covid lockdowns last year (worse than Melbourne\u2019s) is being watched by many, not least in Australia. China, after all, is about as big a market for Australian exports as the next four or so nations combined. Anyway, China\u2019s June quarter GDP numbers have just landed, and they are again on the weak side. Its economy expanded 6.3% from a year earlier but that\u2019s shy of the 7.3% economists surveyed by Reuters had expected. Those pandemic disruptions make comparisons with a year ago look rosier than the underlying momentum. For the first half of the year, the total value of exports was 1,989.8bn yuan (A$388bn), down by 8.3%, underscoring how weak demand is overseas as major economies slow. Imports were 1,498.5bn yuan, down by 2.6%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. As treasurer Jim Chalmers told Insiders on the ABC on Sunday: The global economy is in a pretty precarious place right now. The Americans are proving to be resilient, the Chinese economy has shown some worrying signs, Europe\u2019s in recession and others as well. Those worrying signs probably got a bit more concerning today.

The Australian national team was in training this morning at their team base for the tournament, the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre in Brisbane. Midfield veteran Tameka Yallop, who took a heavy knock in the Matildas\u2019 warm-up against France on Friday, did not train with the team but a spokeswoman indicated that Yallop was uninjured and would be fit for the opening match. Two other players were missing from training \u2013 Kyah Simon (ongoing return from injury) and Charlie Grant (illness). Launching a report on the legacy of the tournament on Monday, Football Australia chief executive James Johnson told reporters that Australia had bid to host the Women\u2019s World Cup because it wanted to \u201cdrive change for the sport\u201d. Johnson said: This has to be more than just a month of football \u2013 we know this will be a great month of football, this will be the biggest ever Women\u2019s World Cup. But this was not why we bid. We bid because we want to create a legacy for the tournament. And, to get you started, here\u2019s a guide to the ten venues across nine cities in Australia and New Zealand that will host matches during the tournament: Things are getting a little personal in the parliamentary inquiry into consultants. Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neil and Greens senator Barbara Pocock have focused on the huge salaries senior partners are making. The senators argue this issue is in the public interest because consultancy firms like Deloitte have profited from the outsourcing of work once done by the public service. The value of this work has increased significantly in recent years as the bureaucracy has become more dependent on them. O\u2019Neil has taken issue with Deloitte chief executive Adam Powick\u2019s multi-million dollar salary. O\u2019Neil: Are you really worth seven times the salary of the prime minister? Powick: No. I don\u2019t set my salary and I never have set my salary. My salary is set to be commensurate with others who play a similar role in our profession. I happen to recognise, deeply recognise, that I am incredibly fortunate to earn what I do, for what I do. A man has died during a siege near Lithgow this morning that lasted almost 48 hours. NSW Police confirmed they had gained entry to the Bowenfels property, on the outskirts of Lithgow, on Monday morning at around 9am where they located the body of a man, believed to be aged 29. It is reported he had sustained a gunshot wound, which is suspected to be self-inflicted. In a statement, they said: About 12.15 pm yesterday (Sunday 16 July 2023), officers from Chifley police district were called to a home at Bowenfels, following reports a man and woman were fighting at the property. Police were told the man was in possession of a firearm and concerns were raised for his welfare. On arrival, officers spoke briefly with the pair from a distance before they went inside, locked the doors, and refused to come out. A perimeter was established, and assistance was requested from specialist resources, including police negotiators and the Tactical Operations Unit (TOU). About 4.20pm, a number of shots were fired from the home in the direction of police, with police returning fire. No one was injured during the exchange. Just before 8.50 am today (Monday 17 July 2023), the 20-year-old woman came out of the property and provided information to officers at the scene. More to come In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14 Deloitte offers support for review of tougher regulatory oversight Deloitte chief executive Adam Powick has told a parliamentary inquiry that the consultancy firm would welcome a review of regulatory oversight. A scandal over the misuse of confidential tax policy information at PwC has triggered a broader investigation of the entire government services industry. Earlier today, former ACCC boss Allan Fels called on the government to break up the sector to deal with conflicts of interest and to ban political donations. Deloitte chief executive Adam Powick has not endorsed those proposals, but has offered some recommendations to help restore public trust in the sector: Firstly, we would be supportive of a government review to strengthen the regulatory oversight of our profession. Secondly, reviewing government procurement policies for greater clarity and accountability on the delivery of value through any engagement. The review should also consider the adequacy of powers to penalise tenderers. Thirdly, reviewing conflict and confidentiality requirements while working with government, this could also extend to an annual formal review by the ANAO (Australian National Audit Office) of our relevant systems. A patient is being airlifted to Hervey Bay hospital in a stable condition with multiple wounds to their limbs and torso from dingo bites, QLD Ambulance have said in an update after a woman was attacked by a pack of four dingoes at K\u2019gari this morning. The Blue Mountains line is back on track, after trains were not running between Lithgow and Bathurst this morning, due to \u201ca police operation at Lithgow\u201d according to NSW TrainLink West. The delays come after reports of a siege in the area. Large mystery object washes ashore in WA A mystery metal object has washed up on the Western Australian coast, Sunrise on 7 reports. It stands at 2m high and 2m wide, with what looks like scorch marks on top, and barnacles coating the bottom half. It was found on Saturday afternoon, and reported to police yesterday, Sunrise on 7 reports. The Defence Force and Australia Transport Safety Bureau are reviewing pictures to identify the missing object. Sunrise on 7 say some viewers have likened the object to a Boeing 777 system \u2013 but authorities are yet to connect the object to the missing MH370 flight, and there is no evidence to suggest a connection. If you have any clue as to what it could be, tweet it my way @At_Raf_ Police operation delays trains in NSW\u2019s Blue Mountains Blue Mountains line trains were not running between Lithgow and Bathurst from around 5.53am to 9.20am this morning, due to \u201ca police operation at Lithgow\u201d according to NSW TrainLink West. The delays come after reports of a siege in the area. A rescue helicopter is on its way to K\u2019gari after a woman was attacked by a pack of four dingoes on Monday morning. The woman is understood to have suffered multiple bite wounds while running along Orchid beach, on the north-east side of the island, formerly known as Fraser Island, at about 9.15am. The ABC has reported that the woman ran into the water and was followed in by two of the dingoes. Information about her condition is not clear. The helicopter is en route. Paramedics were responding to reports of a patient suffering \u201cmultiple bite wounds\u201d, the Queensland Ambulance Service said. Deloitte stood down employee who misused confidential government information Deloitte has provided more detail about its misuse of government information, which was first revealed last week. At a Senate hearing, the firm\u2019s leadership team confirmed the information was considered confidential. They did not reveal which department the information came from. Deloitte chief executive, Adam Powick, said the misuse of information was not motivated by commercial gain and the person involved was sacked. Here\u2019s how chief risk officer, Sneza Pelusi, described the breach: The incident did relate to a breach of our protocols in relation to the handling of government information. We did identify this matter and we obviously reported it to the department. For certain engagements, we do have confidential information management plans in place. In this case, the protocols in place were inadvertently breached. We worked with the department to go through the investigation and share the investigation with them, including the outcomes, which included deleting the information, standing down the individual [responsible for] the inadvertent breach, and further disciplinary action outside of that as well. The breach occurred when someone who had access to confidential government information shared it with someone else within Deloitte without authorisation. This post has been amended from an earlier version, to clarify that the employee was stood down rather than sacked Security breach prompts delays at Melbourne airport We have more on the security breach at a Qantas terminal that briefly triggered delays and long queues at Melbourne airport this morning. Guardian Australia understands a bag containing a laptop went through security screenings unchecked, due to human error. Airport security used CCTV to track down the passenger and re-screen their bag. Screening was paused for around 30 minutes while this happened. The backlog cleared quickly and things were back to normal by 8.30am. Qantas had a small number of short delays as a result. Former ACCC chair Allan Fels has described political donations from big consultancy firms as \u201cunhealthy\u201d, given the businesses are simultaneously bidding for work from the government. PwC has announced it will ban political donations to restore public trust after a scandal over the misuse of government information. PwC\u2019s acting chief executive, Kristin Stubbins, said the ban would ensure \u201cthe highest standards of governance\u201d. So far, the other big four consultancies have not followed PwC\u2019s lead and will continue to make political donations. Here\u2019s what Fels told the inquiry about the practice: They look unhealthy. What I would favour is a significant restriction on them and possibly a ban for some time. I think government legislators should come down hard on the industry, almost too hard at the beginning, rather than leaning on the soft side. It\u2019s better to start with some tough approaches like a break up [of the businesses], but also restrictions on donations, maybe for several years. Donations seem to be linked with buying influence. I don\u2019t think the donations reflect any kind of ideological commitment. They are an investment to get a return, and that makes us very worried about them. Two arrested for allegedly using drone to traffick drugs into prison Two people have been arrested for allegedly using a drone to traffick drugs into a Victorian prison, according to a Victoria Police media statement. It\u2019s alleged a milk carton was located in a corrections facility in Truganina, which contained a quantity of illicit drugs and nicotine patches. The alleged incident is reported to have occurred in March this year. Detectives from the north-west metro regional crime squad have been investigating. Two search warrants were conducted last week in Mount Waverley and Brunswick West, resulting in the arrest of two people. During the search warrants, police seized the following items: One drone 4g of methyl amphetamine 3.2g of heroin 11 Buprenorphine strips Quantity of prescription medication One sword Several identification documents in various names Several mobile phones A 39-year-old Mount Waverley man has been charged with trafficking a drug of dependence, introducing an item into a prison, possess drugs and prescription medication, handling stolen goods, dealing in the proceeds of crime, possessing prohibited weapon, failing to answer bail and committing an indictable offence while on bail. He is expected to appear at Ringwood magistrates court today. A 31-year-old Brunswick West woman has been charged with trafficking a drug of dependence, introducing an item into a prison and possessing drugs. She has been bailed to appear at the Melbourne magistrates court on 26 October. North-west metro regional crime squad detective inspector Patrick Watkinson said: We know there are people who will go to great lengths to attempt to bring items into prisons, and we work very closely with Corrections Victoria to prevent and detect any criminal activity within the prison system. If you are involved in drugs, make no mistake, we have our eyes on you. For those who attempt to breach the security of our prisons we will work hard to ensure that you face becoming a resident and not a guest at one of the facilities. Former competition tsar accuses consultants of self-interest Former ACCC chair Allan Fels is continuing to attack the big four consultancy firms, accusing them of acting in self-interest and extracting higher profits from government departments and taxpayers. The previous Coalition government spent $20.8bn outsourcing more than a third of public service operations, an audit found earlier this year. The value of contracts awarded to the big four consultants has grown by around 400% in a decade. Fels has told the inquiry that consultancy firms have used their bargaining power to pursue self-interest and profit. A really important driver is just the profitability for partners. Of course they have to do a good job, but looking at it as an economist (...) they\u2019ve got a lot of bargaining power. That\u2019s a situation that has really arisen as governments have made themselves more dependent on big consultancy firms, when they could have actually got a better deal from a good, lower paid public service. As they became more and more dependent on the big four, the big four were able to extract higher prices. [Consultancy firms] are [not] keen for this information to become public, but the public needs to understand, and governments need to understand, what is going on. The finance minister Katy Gallagher has admitted the over-reliance of consultancy firms in the public service was worse than expected, AAP reports. The comments came as Deloitte chief executive Adam Powick and chairman Tom Imbesi are scheduled to face a Senate committee which is looking at problems with the federal government\u2019s use of consultants, in the wake of the PwC tax advice scandal. The firm said in a submission to the inquiry it was aware of two incidents of conflicts of interest. You can learn more from Henry Belot\u2019s reporting here: Gallagher said while she was aware of an over-reliance on consultancy firms being used for government projects, the scale became apparent after she won office. \u201cIt is a problem \u2013 it is worse than I thought,\u201d she said on ABC RN this morning. We\u2019re taking steps to rectify that, but it\u2019s going to take a bit of time because of the way the imbalance has occurred over particularly the last five to seven years. Gallagher said the government was trying to bolster in-house consultancy for the public service. There will always be things that you need to seek external advice from, but at the moment, the balance is out of whack. Former competition watchdog Allan Fels has told a parliamentary inquiry that the federal government must act now and break up big consultancy firms to avoid conflicts of interest. The inquiry was triggered by the scandal involving the misuse of confidential tax policy information at PwC, but has a broad remit and is examining the conduct of the entire sector. Fels has been raising concerns about government consultants for many years, including their access to sensitive information and financial data while also providing a range of services to other clients that interact with government. He has told the inquiry that consultancy firms must be broken up to ensure they focus solely on auditing: I believe there is a need to act now on the break-up. I\u2019d like to draw an analogy with the situation that arose with banking and finance surrounding the [royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry]. It found, on investigation, that there was a severe conflict of interest between financial institutions and the interests of customers. It was not resolved by self-regulation and government oversight. It could only be served by a break-up, and that\u2019s now happened with banking. They largely, or totally, got out of the most conflicting activities. There needs to be a clean break-up. Fels is referring to the decision by all four major banks to stop providing financial advice to customers after the royal commission, which revealed serious misconduct and led to multimillion-dollar compensation payments. Divers are trying to retrieve hundreds of drones that plunged into Melbourne\u2019s Yarra River over the weekend due to a technical error. The drones were part of a light show for the Matildas\u2019 game against France on Friday night but fell into the river due to a technical glitch. The retrieval operation began on Sunday and is continuing on Monday. Yarra River keeper Charlotte Sterrett told 3AW radio there were significant worries about the leaking of chemicals: We want to see all drones taken back out of the river because we know if they are left there they will leach chemicals which can damage the environment. WA to stand alone in keeping no-fault evictions Renters in Western Australia will continue to face no grounds evictions, after South Australia became the fifth state to set about outlawing the practice, AAP reports. No-fault evictions allow landlords to end a tenancy without giving a reason. It can happen if they believe they can charge new tenants more. Queensland and the ACT recently joined Victoria and Tasmania in banning no-fault evictions. NSW has promised to end the practice this year. And over the weekend, South Australia revealed plans to stipulate tenancies could only be ended for a prescribed reason \u2013 including any breaches by the tenant, or the landlord wanting to sell, renovate or occupy the property. But the WA premier Roger Cook said his Labor government wasn\u2019t looking to follow, as it introduces its own protection package for renters: We want investors to come into the market to take advantage of the great demand for rental accommodation. But we don\u2019t want to stifle that by putting unnecessary burden (on landlords). We believe we\u2019ve struck the right balance and we\u2019ll be implementing our reforms in the near future. The WA reforms will outlaw rent bidding, ban rent rises more than once a year and allow tenants to make minor modifications and keep pets at rental properties. Angus Taylor welcomes Michele Bullock\u2019s RBA appointment Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor welcomed Michele Bullock\u2019s appointment as Reserve Bank governor on ABC RN this morning. He focused in on the need for an independent governor \u2013 following opposition leader Peter Dutton saying he would not support an appointment of a federal department secretary (and treasurer Jim Chalmers saying Dutton\u2019s \u201crelentless negativity\u201d bordered on \u201cpathological\u201d) last week. \u201cWe know historically an independent Reserve Bank delivers lower inflation,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe data on this has been very, very clear.\u201d It\u2019s not appropriate to have a secretary of an economic department who has been formulating government policy to become the governor. What we need though, most of all, is a government that brings down policy that reduces inflation. The United Kingdom is now a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership after two years of negotiations. The 11 original CPTPP members and the United Kingdom signed an accession protocol at a meeting in Auckland on Sunday. The new membership into the trade deal enhances the UK\u2019s engagement in the Indo-Pacific, according to a statement from the minister and assistant minister for trade. It builds on the foundations of the Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement, which entered into force on 31 May 2023, the statement reads. The CPTPP trade deal has eliminated 98% of tariffs in a trade zone that represents a combined GDP of $11.8tn, and a population of over 500 million people. The minister for trade and tourism Don Farrell says: I congratulate the United Kingdom on becoming the first economy to accede to the CPTPP. The accession of the UK to the CPTPP is a major milestone, as it expands the trade partnership beyond the Pacific rim. Australia is strongly committed to ensuring the CPTPP continues as a high-calibre trade framework \u2013 a key element to maintaining this high standard is a robust accession process. Finance minister Katy Gallagher says the appointment of Michele Bullock as new Reserve Bank governor is \u201chistoric\u201d and will bring a \u201creform agenda\u201d to the central bank, on ABC RN this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic appointment, a highly qualified economist, very experienced leader,\u201d Gallagher says. \u201cShe does have a reform agenda, that\u2019s been provided through the RBA review.\u201d She says the new governor will remain under high scrutiny, following outgoing governor Philip Lowe: I think any job at this level is going to bring incredible scrutiny \u2013 as it should. I think part of the strength of those recommendations is an acknowledgement that communication and transparency and explaining those decisions is an important part of the role, not just of the governor but of the board as well. The search for a missing boater off Western Australia is continuing a day after his mate swam and walked through the night to raise the alarm, AAP reports. The men were returning to the Dampier boat ramp about 11pm Saturday when their boat overturned, possibly after hitting a mooring. One of the men swam about an hour to the West Lewis Islands off the state\u2019s north-west coast and then walked across rocks to where some friends were camping, raising the alarm at about 6am. The upturned vessel was located on Sunday but a wide-scale search had not found the second man before nightfall. Police believed the men, both aged in their 20s, were not wearing life jackets. The search, involving WA authorities and commercial vessels, will resume at first light this morning across land and sea. Supporters of an Indigenous voice to parliament say they are \u201cready to prosecute their simple, hopeful message\u201d and will submit the official yes case to the Australian Electoral Commission on Monday. Both the yes and the no camps have been drafting their competing essays, limited to 2,000 words each, with the two documents to be published online by the AEC on Tuesday. These essays will form the basis of a referendum pamphlet to be mailed to all households several weeks before the vote, which is to be held in the final three months of 2023. It is understood all crossbench MPs or senators who voted yes to the constitution alteration bill were offered briefings, led by the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. Burney described it as \u201ca collaborative process that has brought together the best reasons why Australians should vote yes for constitutional recognition through a voice\u201d. Crossbench MPs Kate Chaney, Zoe Daniel and Helen Haines said they had appreciated the opportunity to contribute to the official yes case. Recent polls suggest a drop in public support for the proposal, but Haines said: \u201cI believe the clear, factual information we have provided will answer the important questions people have about a constitutionally-enshrined voice to parliament.\u201d The Liberal and National parties formally oppose a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, seeking to make the case that it is legally risky, lacks detail and won\u2019t make a practical difference. The no camp has experienced some public pushback about its writing process, with Pauline Hanson and Lidia Thorpe both requesting more substantive input. \u2018Accidental security breach\u2019 at Melbourne airport causes queue delays The security screen at Qantas terminal one was closed from 6.25am to 6.50am at Melbourne airport this morning, due to an \u201caccidental security breach,\u201d an airport spokesperson told Guardian Australia. The security screen is now reopened, and the queue is clearing up. The spokesperson says the airport is not anticipating any missed flights due to the delay. Half of women working in media in Australia dissatisfied with their career progress Almost one-third of women in the media are thinking about leaving their job, a new survey shows. An industry insight report by Women in Media also shows more than half (54%) of women in the industry are either unsure about or explicitly dissatisfied with the progress of their careers. The report shows that three times more women cited limited access to training opportunities and mental health issues or stress as barriers to career progression in 2023 compared with the year prior. Women in Media strategic advisor Petra Buchanan said the industry cannot ignore the barriers faced by women in media. The findings highlight deep concerns about gender equality and a lack of industry support that continues to hinder women\u2019s career progress. The statistics speak volumes \u2013 with an entrenched gender pay gap above the national average and increased bias and discrimination, nearly one-third of women are considering leaving their jobs in media. It\u2019s a critical moment for employers and the media industry to step up; the departure of women from media is a loss society cannot afford. And welcome to a new week of Guardian Australia\u2019s live blog. Here are the stories at the stop of today\u2019s news list to get us into it.

Many people with money to spare are choosing to reduce the amount they owe in an effort to tackle the spiralling rates that have left so many others with huge bills once their fixed-rate deal ends and they go on to a new product. But, at the same time, many banks are offering the best deals on savings accounts in years. So is overpaying your mortgage a good way to deal with the threat of bill shock? Or are you better off putting any spare money aside in a savings account? How does it work? Mortgage repayments are not set in stone. They can often be increased, so that more is taken off the total amount owed, and therefore the term of the mortgage is reduced. The last two years have seen turmoil in the financial markets. Since December 2021, interest rates have gone from 0.1% to 5%. As a result, lenders have increased the cost of borrowing, and many people who have come off cheap fixed-rate deals have faced huge increases in the amounts they have to pay. There has been a big increase in the number of people overpaying in an attempt to reduce their debt burden. For example, \u00a36.7bn was overpaid in the last three months of 2022 after the September mini-budget, which was the first time the quarterly figure has exceeded \u00a36bn since 1999, says the Equity Release Council. David Hollingworth of broker firm L&amp;C Mortgages says people who are on a fixed rate should make preparations now for when it ends. \u201cAlthough rates could ease back if inflation is brought back under control, there is no guarantee as to when that may be, and it doesn\u2019t spell a return to the historic lows of base rates that we\u2019ve been used to in recent years,\u201d he says. He adds: \u201cAdjusting the amount of a monthly budget allocated towards the mortgage will help to squeeze more value out of the current deal. That could be through making overpayments each month, or saving a regular amount to build up a fund that can be used to reduce the mortgage at the most appropriate moment.\u201d The advantage of overpaying is that money will not only be taken off the total, but also interest will not have to be paid. Adam French of NerdWallet, a financial advice site, says that the higher the rate, the bigger the savings with an overpayment. \u201cIf you have a mortgage debt of \u00a3250,000 over 25 years, assuming this remained on 2%, making a one-off overpayment of \u00a310,000 will save \u00a36,257 interest over the lifetime of the mortgage, and reduce the term by a year and three months,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a \u00a310,000 overpayment, on the same \u00a3250,000, at 6%, will save \u00a331,723 over the lifetime of your mortgage, and reduce the term by two years and one month.\u201d What are the limits? Lenders typically limit the amount people can overpay on fixed-rate deals \u2013 traditionally it is capped at about 10% a year. But this depends on the lender. \u201cMost deals will carry an early repayment charge during the fix, but the majority will have a facility that allows a certain degree of overpayments without incurring a penalty,\u201d says Hollingworth. \u201cIt will typically be 10% of the balance each year, but it can be more depending on the lender. For example, NatWest recently moved to 20% a year for all borrowers, and Metro and Atom Bank are offering up to 20%. That will usually give plenty of flexibility.\u201d Where the borrower has the money, they can avoid any limits or fees when they come off their fixed rate, as standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages \u2013 you usually default on to the SVR \u2013 typically don\u2019t have any restrictions. So, in theory, you could come off a fixed rate, make an overpayment and then sign up to another fixed-rate deal. Sophie Waugh, at mortgage adviser John Charcol, says someone coming off a fix with a \u00a3200,000 mortgage with 25 years remaining, would pay \u00a31,609 a month on an SVR of 8.49%. \u201cIn comparison, if you were to take a new two-year fix at 6.18%, your monthly payment would be \u00a31,310. For many, this would be a large increase from their most recent payments. \u201cFor each of these rates, if you were to pay off \u00a320,000, this would take the monthly payments down to \u00a31,448 and \u00a31,179 respectively.\u201d Why not just save? Rates on savings accounts and Isas are at their highest levels in years, leading many to see what they could make by putting the money away, compared to taking it off their mortgage. A key rule, put forward by Martin Lewis\u2019s MoneySavingExpert, is that if your mortgage rate is close to, or higher than, a savings rate, then it is a good idea to overpay. \u201cGiven just how low some mortgage rates will have been, and the fact that savings rates have been rising, it may make sense to consider whether putting the cash into a savings account would deliver a return that could outstrip paying off the mortgage,\u201d says Hollingworth. \u201cWhen considering that, it makes sense to not only look at whether the savings rate exceeds the mortgage rate, but to factor in any tax on the interest. \u201cThe personal savings allowance will often mean that isn\u2019t a problem, but with rates climbing, it could affect more, especially higher-rate, taxpayers.\u201d Another advantage of overpaying is that it can decrease the property\u2019s loan-to-value (LTV), meaning that better rates may be secured when it does become time to take on a new fixed deal. But overpaying is not for everyone. It is important to ensure you always have enough cash in savings in case of an emergency. And if there are more expensive debts \u2013 such as credit cards or loans \u2013 it is vital these are cleared first. MoneySavingExpert warns borrowers who are committed to overpaying that they should tell their lender that they want to reduce the term of the mortgage. After that, overpayments can usually be done via online banking."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d875b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/the-secret-kingdom-review-even-an-army-of-pangolins-cant-liven-up-this-kids-tale", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Secret Kingdom review \u2013 underground world with army of pangolins in spooky kids\u2019 tale", "lead": "When a 12-year-old moves to a new house and gets sucked into a bizarre underworld, you might expect excitement to ensue.

But, like its title, this film is mostly bland and semi-forgettable \u2013 with scenes more than a little familiar from the fantasy back catalogue, adding no real flavour of its own. It\u2019s set in 1960s Australia, where Peter (Sam Everingham) is an anxious 12-year-old who\u2019s just moved to a spooky house in the countryside. On the very first night in his new bedroom, the floor rips open, swallowing up Peter and his little sister Verity (Alyla Browne). Their bed careens Goonies-style down tunnels, landing in an underground world inhabited by an army of pangolins (a nice choice for military mammals, with their armour-like scales). The pangolin general greets Peter as a king, just in time to save the land from an evil force. But isn\u2019t Peter just a scared kid in a dressing gown? So begins an epic journey in which Peter must solve riddles, collect magical stones and find his inner brave. But somehow even this quest fails to inject much energy into the movie, which feels weirdly without atmosphere. It\u2019s also fairly talky, exposition dragging several scenes into dullness. Still, there are flashes of invention, like the moment Peter arrives at a fort guarded by massive stone hands straight out of Monty Python. Peter challenges the hands to a game of rock-paper-scissors. The Secret Kingdom is a film with well-intended things to say about childhood anxiety and fear, but lacks much spark or fun. Peter\u2019s sister Verity is also fairly annoying (for reasons that only become clear in a twist at the end, she\u2019s a complete goody two-shoes). Still, for under-eights, too young for Harry Potter or Narnia, this might work as gateway fantasy. I was irrationally irritated by Peter repeatedly using the modern jargon phrase\u201cthink outside the box\u201d \u2013 in the 60s!

Exhausted by the city and the seething anxiety from which she has suffered ever since she was a girl, she longs for the awkward embrace of her somewhat complicated family: her divorcee father, now lonely enough to be on the dating apps; her mother, an amateur artist with bohemian leanings who has recently taken yet another younger lover; her older sister, Marylou, who though in possession of both a husband and two small children, is also having a one-day-a-week affair with a man who works in a fancy dress shop (he comes to her for joyful afternoon sex in her greenhouse, disguised as a bear, or a wolf, or a ghost). From here, Jourdy spins out an exquisite soap opera of a graphic novel, a story she tells in both traditional strips \u2013 if you\u2019re a fan of Posy Simmonds, you\u2019ll fall instantly in love with these \u2013 and in a series of extraordinarily beautiful, Matisse-inspired watercolours of the town where the action takes place (it\u2019s never named, but Jourdy spent her childhood in Dole, near the Jura mountains: think red roofs, geranium-filled window boxes and old-fashioned, slightly louche bars). What follows is often plangent; by the time Juliette returns to Paris, more than one heart will have been broken. But Jourdy also has a gift for farce, and her book is at moments richly comical. The scene in which Marylou\u2019s lover, wearing one of his ridiculous costumes, is discovered hiding under her son\u2019s desk is masterly. Juliette\u2019s family love her, but they\u2019re all so busy, caught up in their own lives. How should she spend her days? Soon after her arrival, she meets Georges, a dishevelled loner who spends his time between his squalid flat and the Tropicale bar, where he drinks too much, struggles to win darts tournaments, and picks up women. Georges takes an unaccountable shine to Juliette \u2013 usually, he prefers relationships without strings \u2013 and uses an abandoned duckling they find in the park as bait to ensure she continues to visit him (he adopts it). Unlike everyone else, he isn\u2019t tired of hearing about her panic attacks, her sudden conviction that she can\u2019t find her pulse and is about to die. Will they fall in love? This, too, is complicated: Georges isn\u2019t exactly marriage material. I\u2019m absolutely mad about this book, the best graphic novel I\u2019ve read so far this year (its translator is Aleshia Jensen). So many longform comics want for a shape, a real sense of narrative. But Jourdy knows exactly where she wants to take us, and how. Oh, but the detail involved in her rooms and streets! Every frame is drawn with such artistry and care, a work of art in its own right. I can\u2019t think when a cartoonist has ever paid such attention to simple domestic objects, or made them so psychologically revealing. And yet there is a gorgeous simplicity at play here, too. It hardly matters that her characters are often inarticulate: she has the skill to make their faces speak fathomless volumes. Sad and funny and somehow profoundly French, all I can tell you is that Juliette is vraiment g\u00e9nial: a book to be read, reread, and pressed on everyone you know.

It expected United will be asked to pay about \u20ac70m for 20-year-old, who scored nine Serie A goals last season after joining from Sturm Graz. A defensive midfielder is also on Erik ten Hag\u2019s wishlist and Fiorentina\u2019s Sofyan Amrabat is among those under consideration but that position is less of a priority than a goalkeeper and centre-forward and a signing is likely only if at least one of Fred and Donny van de Beek leaves. Fred has interest from Premier League clubs including Fulham and from Galatasaray and Saudi Arabia. Amrabat, who impressed for Morocco at last year\u2019s World Cup, also has admirers in Spain but Fiorentina will demand a significant fee and there is no indication his La Liga suitors have the money to do the deal. West Ham have asked to be kept informed of developments and other clubs in England are monitoring the situation. Once Onana signs, United will allow Dean Henderson to leave and they will hold talks with Nottingham Forest over a transfer for the 26-year-old, who spent last season on loan at the City Ground. United would then want a new back-up goalkeeper and have Japan\u2019s Zion Suzuki, who plays for Urawa Reds, among their options."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d875f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/brisbane-olympics-drone-show-cancelled-melbourne-yarra-river-fail", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Brisbane Olympics drone show cancelled after hundreds fall into Melbourne river during Matildas display", "lead": "Event marking nine years until Olympics and Paralympics stopped after 350 drones fell into Yarra River on Friday", "author": "Eden Gillespie and Adeshola Ore", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 07:06:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626032", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3a6ae70624d5d85a4b163a30d1beef8703ae5a/606_0_4528_2718/500.jpg", "body": "A drone show to mark nine years until Brisbane hosts the Olympics and Paralympics has been cancelled, after hundreds of the devices plunged into a Melbourne river over the weekend due to a technical glitch. The Australian Traffic Network (ATN) had been hired to put on a drone show over Brisbane\u2019s Story Bridge on Saturday night to celebrate the city hosting the 2032 Olympics. More than 500 drones were set to illuminate the night sky with the Olympic rings and the Paralympic agitos over the Brisbane River as part of the display. But the event was cancelled after 350 drones fell into Melbourne\u2019s Yarra River during a light show for the Matildas\u2019 game against France on Friday night, ahead of the Women\u2019s World Cup. As of Monday, divers were still trying to retrieve the drones amid concern about the damage their batteries could cause to the environment. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Charlotte Sterrett, the Yarra riverkeeper, said the incident was a \u201creal worry\u201d for the waterway. \u201cWe want to see all drones taken back out of the river because we know if they are left there, they will leach chemicals, which can damage the environment,\u201d she told 3AW radio. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the size of the drones but we think it\u2019s the equivalent of 18,000 AA batteries. This is significant.\u201d Sterrett called for a stop to drone light shows, saying it did not make sense to \u201ctrash\u201d the river. On Sunday ATN said divers were in the process of retrieving the drones. \u201cThis is the first technical situation we\u2019ve had in the 18 months that we\u2019ve been in the business,\u201d ATN\u2019s Vic Lorusso said. The Brisbane 2032 organising committee said ATN has advised that it would not put on further shows until the cause of the equipment malfunction is identified. The committee president, Andrew Liveris, said while it was disappointing to cancel the Brisbane show, safety must remain the priority. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure that there are still plenty of ways for people right across south-east Queensland to enjoy the \u2018Nine Years to Go\u2019 milestone and celebrate the Olympic rings and Paralympic agitos making their Queensland debut,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunities right across Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast will have plenty of opportunities to see large-scale structures of the rings and agitos and get their photo with them, as well as participate in a range of Olympic and Paralympic sports. \u201cA host of Olympians and Paralympians will be joining in the celebrations and all of the details, times and locations can be found on local Brisbane, Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast council websites.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8760", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/17/jekyll-and-hyde-review-glasgow-botanic-gardens", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jekyll and Hyde review \u2013 Shakespearean style shows another side to Stevenson thriller", "lead": "Bard in the Botanics stages Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s gothic novella as a tense three-way struggle that asks big questions about human nature", "author": "Mark Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 07:00:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626050", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/72d2702f2b4c1b116ec5e1c265b380d491f1ddde/0_93_2953_1772/500.jpg", "body": "It is not quite a Dylan-goes-electric moment, but for the first time in two decades neither of the plays being staged by Bard in the Botanics, the summer repertory company, is by Shakespeare. In a mini-Victorian season, you can see The Importance of Being Earnest on the outdoor stage, while here in the 150-year-old Kibble Palace glasshouse Jennifer Dick has adapted Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Notwithstanding the change of author, Dick gives the Robert Louis Stevenson thriller a Shakespearean sense of oratory. Our point of entry is the lawyer Gabriel Utterson, a narrator who eases us from the prose of the novella into a stripped-down drama for three actors. Played by an excellent Stephanie McGregor as confidant and conscience to Adam Donaldson\u2019s arrogant Dr Jekyll, Utterson speaks in the vivid language of a storyteller, all lengthy sentences and iambic rhythms, calling on the breath control of an experienced classical actor. The approach suits the heightened gothic melodrama and, along with Sam Stopford as a weaselly Mr Hyde, the performers create a tense three-way struggle. All adaptations of this book wrestle with the challenge of making explicit what Stevenson only implied. For the purposes of the drama, Dick allows Jekyll and Hyde to argue with each other as if they were independent characters rather than two sides of the same coin. Being less interested in the mechanics of the transition from respectable doctor to fun-loving murderer, she focuses on the moral implications of separating the good and evil sides of human nature. Blinded by his own ambition, the upright Jekyll ends up as degenerate as the hedonistic Hyde. By contrast, Utterson reveals a sense of right and wrong that goes beyond the lawyerly. Behind her shock at her friend\u2019s experiments is a deeply felt plea for moral responsibility.

Unlike the opulent thobes elsewhere in the gallery, it\u2019s a thoroughly worn garment created for everyday wear. But it\u2019s also a fascinating window into the life of a rural woman from the Gaza region in the 1930s: the knee patches replace fabric worn away from field and domestic work, while the gaps by the chest panel show alterations made for breastfeeding. The embroidered patterns are likely samples from past dresses or hand-me-downs from relatives. As with all of the embroidered clothes and items currently on view, it\u2019s an expression of class, gender and sociopolitical change. \u201cEmbroidery is a practice that in itself feels so humble: the repetitive binding of thread to fabric,\u201d says curator Rachel Dedman. \u201cAnd yet, when you start to look at the garments, the people who make them, you start to understand the big picture events in history.\u201d Boasting more than 40 items across three rooms, Material Power is the first major exhibition of Palestinian embroidery in the UK for over three decades. Some of the dresses, on loan from collections in Jordan and the West Bank, are on show here for the first time. Through up-close displays, archive photographs and video footage of textile workers in action, visitors can trace the history of what is now one of the region\u2019s most prominent cultural outputs, from early village tradition to formidable tool of resistance. Drawing on Dedman\u2019s expertise as curator of contemporary art from the Middle East at the V&amp;A, the story is told in rich detail, with attention paid to regional variations in technique and motifs. As colonialism and changing technologies take hold, styles begin to change, as seen in the dress alterations and new hybrid patterns; a process that continues towards more recent national conflicts. In the second room, the embroidery becomes more overtly political. During the first intifada in the late 1980s, women would stitch symbols of resistance on to their clothes for protests; a striking collection of dresses bearing the then-forbidden Palestinian flag and colours line the back wall. \u201cWhen we make something to take to protests now, it\u2019s characterised by speed \u2013 scrawling a sign or printing something out. But these would\u2019ve taken years to make, in really difficult circumstances,\u201d Dedman says, explaining how women might have teamed up to buy different colours of thread so as to not draw attention to themselves, before stitching secretly at night. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the longevity of the making of it that reflects the nature of the struggle.\u201d Much like some of the historical dresses, which have been reworked for new generations and changing standards and tastes, the exhibition is a living history, encouraging renewed reinterpretations of the craft. Exhibited alongside the garments are contemporary embroidery works by artists from the Levantine region and its diaspora, like Mona Hatoum\u2019s delicate lattices of human hair and Majd Abdel Hamid\u2019s abstract cross-stitch series, which uses white thread on white canvas to confront and \u201creactivate\u201d the practice. Abdel Hamid began the project in 2015 and plans to continue until his hands cease to function. \u201cIt\u2019s a repetitive gesture that allows you the space to think,\u201d he says, pointing to the increased popularity of the craft on a global scale during the Covid lockdowns. \u201cEmbroidery can be a way of dealing with a lot of traumas.\u201d Stitching also forges room for him to connect with his Palestinian heritage after years of displacement. \u201cIt\u2019s a very subtle way of feeling home.\u201d Meanwhile, Lebanese-British artist Aya Haidar reimagines her family history through vibrant threads and chintzy fabric on embroidery hoops. Inspired by the stories her mother and grandmother would share as they taught her to stitch, the series pieces together their first-hand experiences of surviving through Lebanon\u2019s civil war. In one piece, family members wear pots and pans as makeshift helmets in the living room; another hoop depicts them seeking shelter under a bed frame in case the ceiling falls down. Rendered in wobbly stitching and colourful thread, the scenes are surprisingly soft and intimate. \u201cYes, I talk about big topics like conflict and migration, but really it\u2019s about pinpointing those smaller stories that humanise a situation,\u201d she says. While she made the hoops, Haidar followed in her ancestors\u2019 footsteps and shared her family stories and embroidery skills with her own children. \u201cTalking about their histories while they stitched was the way in which stories were passed down,\u201d she explains. \u201cCraft gave women a voice before society ever did.\u201d As much as the history of Levantine embroidery is one of female resistance and labour, the exhibition includes embroidered objects made by men held as political detainees in Israeli prisons, who use the medium to express both national pride and affection for their family members. A tender collection of stationery and everyday items customised by Karam Al-Maloukh while imprisoned draws on the Palestinian colours and features the hand-stitched initials of himself and his wife. Made between 2005 and 2008, they capture the show\u2019s overarching message: that embroidery can be much more than a simple, domestic hobby. \u201cThere\u2019s something universal and familiar about textiles,\u201d says Dedman. \u201cBut in this particular part of the world, they have this meaning that goes beyond what you might expect from a craft or something handmade.\u201d Material Power: Palestinian Embroidery is at Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge, until 29 October"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8762", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/17/cricket-report-a-shocking-wake-up-call-this-is-how-all-sports-can-do-better", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cricket report a shocking wake-up call: this is how all sports can do better | Cath Bishop", "lead": "Testimonies that reveal misogyny, racism and sexism should jolt every sporting body into listening to excluded voices", "author": "Cath Bishop", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 07:00:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626088", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f2279b43352c0ad0dbd8d8dece12f5df77d0e0/817_333_3314_1989/500.jpg", "body": "While the relative merits of Bazball continue to be debated, focus has swung away from arguably the most critical challenge that the sport faces: the findings from the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (Icec), published at the end of June. Its report, Holding Up a Mirror to Cricket, concluded that: \u201cCricket is not \u2018a game for everyone\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s not the first major review of a sport with shocking findings, and it won\u2019t be the last. Numerous Olympic and Paralympic sports have had such reviews and been heavily criticised over the past decade. Anne Whyte, a KC, spent two years reviewing the mistreatment of gymnasts, revealing appalling stories of abuse. You\u2019d think by now that sports leaders would be experts, alert to the traps and mistakes of the past. The Icec report reminds us that\u2019s not the case, uncomfortably pointing out that similar issues had already surfaced in the 1999 \u201cClean Bowl Racism\u201d report yet never been addressed. There are sweepstakes on which sport will be next up to face a culture crisis, with an ongoing review into swimming already uncovering heartbreaking stories. We continue to sit in a vacuum, waiting for leaders in sport to step up and start leading the way in creating ethical, value-based, inclusive cultures that enable sport both to push the boundaries of human performance and play its part in contributing to what society needs from sport: strong values brought to life daily; connected, inclusive communities where we have each other\u2019s back regardless of where we have come from; and equal access to ensure everyone has the opportunity to find their place in sport and explore their potential. Although the Icec report highlights a stubborn constituency who remain in denial of the problem, there must surely be many sports leaders thinking that, even if they don\u2019t have a crisis now, what should they be doing? We\u2019ve heard the shocking testimonies that reveal misogyny, racism and sexism, plus the unfathomable fact that England\u2019s women have never played a Test match at Lord\u2019s, the \u201chome of cricket\u201d, while privately educated schoolboys get annual outings there. Behind those headlines, three key areas resonate loud and clear from the report, which also remind me of lessons from the Whyte review and, for that matter, Louise Casey\u2019s report on the Metropolitan Police Service. The first is the need for effective leadership in the sense of people in senior positions role-modelling and caring about the values of their organisation as much as they do the profits or short-term targets. The report unpicks naive assumptions that EDI (equity, diversity, inclusion) work and wider commercial goals would always complement each other. Without explicit EDI goals, growth and revenue generation took precedence, which may have felt good in the short term but incurred heavy human costs over the long term which never appeared on the spreadsheets. There\u2019s a specific recommendation to develop a set of cultural values (principles and expected behaviours) that go beyond the \u201cspirit of cricket\u201d, exposed here largely as a fudge and tied up with the existing discriminatory culture. The report demands leaders to be \u201cexplicit about the culture the game aspires to build and the behaviours it expects and rejects\u201d. It\u2019s ultimately the living and upholding of those values through thick and thin that will create the shift: with those at the top of the organisation leading as visible role models, challenging those who don\u2019t display those values, regardless of their status in the game. The second area that leapt out at me is the \u201coverly defensive\u201d attitude towards complaints. My role on the oversight board at British Gymnastics, set up to oversee the implementation of the Whyte recommendations and cultural reform, has shown me that it\u2019s a crucial litmus test of any organisation\u2019s culture: how it responds to and deals with complaints, big and small. It\u2019s not an easy area to get right from the positions in which BG and the England and Wales Cricket Board find themselves \u2013 and it\u2019s clear that greater independent expertise and support is needed in this area \u2013 but shifting mindsets towards seeing complaints as an opportunity for insight and improvement is a crucial first step. Continuous learning is a well-known pillar of high\u2011performance sport out on the field of play. Curiously, it seems much less deeply embedded in the way sports are run. This is an obvious area for change. Integral to the complaints process is the vulnerability required to share difficult personal experiences \u2013 which only happens when there\u2019s \u201cpsychological safety\u201d. Based on a growing body of academic research (spearheaded by Prof Amy Edmondson at the Harvard Business School), there is growing awareness of the importance of psychological safety across society. It provides a deeply human perspective from which to see your school, workplace or sports environment and understand whether it has a culture where people can thrive while bringing their best efforts. It\u2019s based around the simple question: is it safe to speak up, whatever your role, background, class, gender, race or disability? Whereas sport has traditionally been seen as ahead of the curve on all matters performance\u2011related, in the cultural space and areas such as psychological safety it still seems well behind the curve. Psychological safety is a useful if challenging qualitative metric for leaders \u2013 measurable, but only by tuning into experiences. This links to the third area which lurks behind most discussions I have with leaders about culture, whether in sport or professional service firms: metrics. Our obsession with measuring and amassing high volumes of data has exploded over the past decade and pervades Whitehall departments, City firms and sports organisations alike. Attitudes towards metrics deepen our beliefs daily that \u201cwhat gets measured, gets done\u201d, and \u201cwhat matters is what gets measured\u201d. Charts, spreadsheets and league tables have led us away from looking at insights based on lived experiences. The Icec report reminds us that this is actually what really matters, the review discovering and amplifying human voices otherwise unheard. The report\u2019s annexe \u201cIt\u2019s not banter: lived experiences of discrimination in cricket\u201d is full of further incontrovertible experiences. The most powerful part of sport is always the human stories. We must realise that\u2019s the case off the pitch as much as on the pitch. We need to bring a broader range of stories into sport\u2019s boardrooms and committee rooms on a regular basis, not just in culture reviews. Then there\u2019s a chance to redefine and redesign future sporting success in terms of the stories for which cricket could be the catalyst, the stories we\u2019d like to hear about experiencing cricket for the first time or the thousandth time, and how it might feel for those who\u2019ve always felt excluded, to finally feel that they belong.

Shaddock left La Paz in Mexico in April and was attempting to reach French Polynesia, more than 5,000km away, when his boat was damaged by the storm.

Jesse Langford, from Sydney, was 19 years old when he joined his father Anthony, 51, mother Kristine, 46, and sister Winona, 17, on a family trip to New Zealand aboard the Royal Caribbean cruise liner Ovation of the Seas in December 2019. Langford was left with burns to his hands, back and thighs, with his father, mother and sister killed during a day trip to the Whakaari-White Island volcano located off New Zealand\u2019s northern coast. Langford\u2019s video interview with police in April 2020 was played to Auckland District Court on Monday where Whakaari-White Island\u2019s owners, ID Tours and Tauranga Tourism Services are accused of safety breaches that resulted in the deaths of 22 people, including 14 Australians. The island\u2019s owners, the Buttle family, ID Tours and Tauranga Tourism Services Limited have been accused of breaching health and safety regulations. The six individuals and entities have pleaded not guilty to charges of failures of health and safety law. Like previous Australian witness Annie Yongan Lu, Langford said he was given no indication of any dangers before going on the trip and had only a short safety briefing on the day with no plans for emergencies. He said his tour group including his family members were caught in a relatively flat and open area on their walk down from the crater when the volcano erupted. Langford said he was thrown over a mound by the force of an eruption before curling up in the foetal position and covering his head with his hands after being hit in the face by a flying rock. \u201cI was being hammered by this sandstorm like in the movies where you can\u2019t see two metres in front of you. I was in so much pain,\u201d he said. Once the eruption clouds lifted the island returned to the clear day it was before, except everything was covered in grey ash. \u201cDad was sitting up and struggling to breathe while trying to get his gas mask off. Mum was not moving at all,\u201dLangford said. He said he sat with the group for 15 to 20 minutes thinking about what he could do while feeling his whole body shot through with pain. \u201cI made the decision that I couldn\u2019t physically help anyone but I could let people know others had survived ... it still bothers me making that decision to get up and walk away,\u201d Langford said. After finding help at the pier and reaching a hospital Langford fell into a coma for eight days and woke up back in Australia in an intensive care unit. His sister\u2019s body was never found. The trial began last week and has heard from other survivors. In March, ID Tours failed in a bid to have the charges against the company dismissed. It said its role in the tourism \u201csupply chain\u201d did not extend to what happened on the island, a claim the judge rejected. Several other companies involved in facilitating the trip to Whakaari have already admitted to charges against them. They will be sentenced after the current trial, which is expected to take four months. If convicted, the organisations face maximum fines of NZ$1.5m ($930,000/\u00a3720,000) or NZ$300,000 for individuals."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8768", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/17/deloitte-declines-to-tell-senate-which-government-departments-information-it-leaked-internally", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Deloitte declines to tell Senate which government department\u2019s information it leaked internally", "lead": "Greens senator repeatedly asks firm to reveal which department was implicated but question taken on notice", "author": "Henry Belot", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:03:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626199", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d002f645621e5d00e2b766a322b5938e3bc8eaa9/0_331_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "The consultancy firm Deloitte stood down an employee who shared confidential government information without permission but has so far refused to reveal which government department was involved, drawing criticism from senators. Deloitte\u2019s leadership has told a Senate inquiry that the internal breach \u2013 which occurred at some stage in the past financial year \u2013 was not motivated by commercial gain. It was not reported to regulators as it \u201cdid not fit within the reportable framework\u201d, Deloitte\u2019s chief risk officer, Sneza Pelusi, said. \u201cFor certain engagements, we do have confidential information management plans in place. In this case, the protocols in place were inadvertently breached,\u201d Pelusi said. \u201cWe worked with the department to go through the investigation and shared the investigation with them including the outcomes, which included deleting the information, standing down the individual [responsible for] the inadvertent breach, and further disciplinary action outside of that as well.\u201d Greens senator Barbara Pocock repeatedly asked Deloitte to reveal which government department was implicated, but the question was taken on notice. Pocock told Deloitte\u2019s leadership that they knew this information would be asked for and came to the inquiry unprepared. \u201cThat is one of the reasons why there is distrust about large consultancy firms,\u201d Pocock said. \u201cYou are opaque in the information you provide.\u201d Pelusi told the inquiry that Deloitte reported only one of the 121 substantiated misconduct cases in the past financial year to regulators. That case involved fraud and not the misuse of government information. Deloitte\u2019s chief executive, Adam Powick, said there was \u201ccertainly a lack of clarity\u201d about regulatory oversight and said the firm would support a government review to strengthen accountability. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill said the lack of reporting to Asic or Chartered Accountants raised the prospect of people who were fired by Deloitte continuing to work with government at different firms. \u201cThese people that you exited could well be a consultant that can get another job with the government and say \u2018I used to work for Deloitte\u2019,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cHow are we ever going to find out who the people are that you exited because they were not sufficient to meet the standards of Deloitte?\u201d Powick said he \u201cdid not have a clear answer\u201d to that question. Break up the big four, former competition chief says Alan Fels, a former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has urged the government to break up the big four consultancy firms to reduce conflicts of interest and to ban \u201cunhealthy\u201d political donations from the sector. Fels told the inquiry it was problematic for a consultants to simultaneously work for government and businesses that interact with departments. He has proposed a model similar to that recently adopted by PwC, which sold its government services division for just $1. \u201cI think government legislators should come down hard on the industry, almost too hard at the beginning, rather than leaning on the soft side,\u201d Fels said. \u201cIt is better to start with some tough approaches like a break up [of the businesses], but also restrictions on donations, maybe for several years.\u201d In his opening statement, Powick said Deloitte would not break up its business. \u201cWe believe our global multi-disciplinary model enables us to deliver high-quality services to meet the rapidly expanding needs of our clients. And it is for this reason, that we have no intention of ringfencing any part of our businesses,\u201d Powick said. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the government\u2019s reliance on consultancy firms was far worse than she initially thought. \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps to rectify that, but it\u2019s going to take a bit of time because of the way the imbalance has occurred over particularly the last five to seven years,\u201d Gallagher told the ABC. \u201cThere will always be things that you need to seek external advice from, but at the moment, the balance is out of whack.\u201d Fels told the inquiry that imbalance has given consultancy firms greater bargaining power and in return, higher profit margins. \u201c[Consultancy firms] are [not] keen for this information to become public, but the public needs to understand, and governments need to understand, what is going on.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8769", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/17/womens-world-cup-2023-matildas-path-to-final-schedule-winning-scenario-pool-chances-odds-rankings-matchups", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Path to Women\u2019s World Cup glory: breaking down the Matildas\u2019 possible route to the final | Jo Khan", "lead": "Australia will have to beat several high-ranked teams if they are to lift the trophy, whether they top Group B or qualify in second place", "author": "Jo Khan", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:01:43", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626219", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90050ecc6c3608501394b004bc617c5bd9ed76ef/0_258_3868_2321/500.jpg", "body": "Tony Gustavsson\u2019s Australia are in Group B along with Canada, Nigeria and the Republic of Ireland. Canada are the only other team in the top 10 of Fifa\u2019s world rankings at seventh, while Ireland are in 22nd spot and Nigeria sit at 40th. The Matildas are ranked 10th, and will have to beat multiple teams ranked higher to reach the final. It\u2019s been called the \u201cgroup of death\u201d \u2013 lower-ranked Ireland and Nigeria are certainly capable of upsets \u2013 but Australia are expected to finish either first or second to move to the round of 16 along with Canada, which presents two speculative paths to the final to explore, both based heavily on Fifa\u2019s current world rankings. Pathway one: Matildas finish top of Group B Round of 16 v Denmark If Australia finish on top of their group, they will play the second-placed team from Group D in the round of 16, which will most likely be Denmark, on 7 August at Stadium Australia in Sydney. Denmark are ranked 13th and when the Matildas beat them 3-1 in October it was the first time they had defeated a top 20 team in more than a year and the first win against a European side since 2018. It was a turning point for the team and indicated coach Tony Gustavsson\u2019s vision and planning might be starting to come to fruition. Denmark\u2019s captain and star midfielder, Pernille Harder, was only on the pitch for a short time during that friendly and has since been in great form for her club Chelsea. Like Kerr, Harder is her country\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer, and will be hard to stop during the World Cup. Quarter-final v France From here it gets more challenging \u2013 with Australia\u2019s potential opponents all ranking higher than them. Assuming fifth-ranked France top Group F ahead of Brazil, and then win their last-16 match, they will face the Matildas in the third quarter-final on 12 August in Brisbane. Australia were able to get a good look at Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s side when they beat them 1-0 in last week\u2019s send-off game in Melbourne. Facing them in the tournament will be a different matter, but if the Matildas can fine tune a few aspects of their game they would be a chance to beat them again. If Brazil finish top of Group F and make it through the last 16, Australia can confidently look back to late 2021 when they secured a win and a draw in a two-game friendly series, knowing they are playing significantly better now. Semi-final v Germany Australia\u2019s potential semi-final opponent could depend on the outcome of a Euros final rematch between No 2 Germany and No 4 England. Either nation would pose a serious challenge for Australia to progress to the decider but the Matildas have beaten several top teams already this year, including England. Without captain Leah Williamson, as well as Beth Mead and Fran Kirby, Sarina Wiegman\u2019s England side looks quite different to the one that defeated Germany 2-1 to win Euro 2022. Germany have announced a strong, mostly unchanged squad but will also miss a key player after Bayern Munich\u2019s Carolin Simon was ruled out with an ACL injury sustained in the team\u2019s shock pre-tournament loss to Zambia. Final v USA Barring any major upsets, Sweden, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands and maybe even Japan will probably progress to the knockout stage of the tournament. Of course, the reigning world champions, USA, will be there too, and hungry to be the first nation to lift a third consecutive World Cup trophy at Sydney\u2019s Stadium Australia on 20 August. Pathway two: Matildas finish second in Group B Round of 16 v England Should England top their group and Australia finish second, the two teams would meet in the round of 16. The Matildas may have beaten England just months ago but this match-up would pose a difficult hurdle to overcome straight out of the group stage. Quarter-finals v Germany A win against the Lionesses would set up a likely clash with Germany or Brazil in quarter-final. Semi-final v France It could be a familiar team waiting for Australia in the semi-final on this path: France or Canada. Australia will have played Olympic gold medallists Canada in the group stage and they know France well from their friendly last week. Final v USA With the team the Matildas could potentially face in the final coming from the other side of the draw, things would not change from the first pathway scenario."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d876a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/small-wonder-brothers-launch-model-boats-to-circumnavigate-antarctica", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Small wonder: brothers launch model boats to circumnavigate Antarctica", "lead": "Ollie and Harry Ferguson from Aberdeenshire took inspiration for 12,500-mile journey from Ross scientific expedition of 1839-43", "author": "Sophie Zeldin-O'Neill", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:00:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626238", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3c960a64265b56ba2d7d2e4a985c4e2f161a9815/0_0_2048_1229/500.jpg", "body": "A pair of model ships built by two young brothers have launched on a mission to circumnavigate Antarctica, in what is thought to be a world first. Ollie Ferguson, 13, and his younger brother Harry, 11, from Turriff in Aberdeenshire, took inspiration from the Ross scientific expedition of 1839-43 where HMS Erebus and HMS Terror discovered the Ross ice shelf. They have built 1 metre-long replicas of the two vessels, which will follow the circumpolar current around the coastline of Antarctica, a journey of more than 12,500 miles that could take up to two years. During the journey, the boats will transmit scientific data back to the boys \u2013 including location, air temperature, ocean temperature and the water\u2019s pH, which can be markers of climate breakdownn. The brothers have had support from their father, MacNeill Ferguson, an ecological specialist, and mother, Vicki, a school principal, but they say the boys are very self-motivated. MacNeill (Mac) said: \u201cHarry was insistent we have a camera on board, as he wants to see penguins or whales. \u201cOllie has recently been very interested in climate change, so we wanted to do something that was productive in that sense, too.\u201d The process of building the vessels, having them transported to the Southern Ocean, and waiting for official approval for the project, has taken two years and the boys were \u201cecstatic\u201d when the boats were finally launched last week. Harry said: \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting. We\u2019ve been trying to do it for two years now and we\u2019ve finally got them in and it feels amazing. \u201cWe\u2019re interested to collect data about climate change and also just trying to see what happens to the boats and the end result and to see if we will ever see them again.\u201d The boats have been crafted from a 200-year-old piece of elm wood, and use copper \u2013 just as the original vessels would have \u2013 to avoid fouling (damage from underwater plant and animal life). The boats are fitted with bespoke tracking and monitoring devices developed by the tech company Icoteq, with a battery life of more than six years, and cameras that will be able to send about one image a month. The boys originally included masts and rigging but took them off for the voyage as they would not have withstood the conditions. Their father said: \u201cOn the boys\u2019 previous model boat voyages, the batteries died, and we realised that this time we needed to build our own tracker \u2013 one that would last several years in case the vessels get caught in ice. \u201cWe were also very mindful not to litter, and committed to using sustainable materials throughout.\u201d After the boats were completed, they were shipped to family friends in the Falkland Islands until the family received official approval from authorities that they could be launched into the Southern Ocean. The Pharos SG, a South Georgia fisheries patrol vessel, then transported them out and launched them into the circumpolar current on Tuesday 11 July. The boats\u2019 antennas were quickly attacked by a pair of wild petrels which seemed to think the boats were food, but fortunately the birds soon lost interest and flew away. The Ferguson brothers, who previously set the world record for the longest distance travelled at sea by a toy boat, are trying to tick off a list of 500 adventures before they turn 18. They have completed 456 so far, but say this was \u201cby far the hardest\u201d. Previously, they sailed their Playmobil pirate ship Adventure more than 3,700 miles across the Atlantic to the Caribbean. They have also slept in caves, sent Lego up to Mars and down to the sea floor, sent toys around world and back, ticked off 20 forms of transport, caught lobsters for the Queen, slept for weeks at a time in hammocks, and written a book. Later this summer, they plan to go fossil-hunting and seek out dinosaur footprints, something Harry is particularly excited about as he hopes to be a palaeontologist when he grows up. Mac said: \u201cThe boys had a big hand in deciding on the activities, and most are designed to be done outdoors. They are willing to try new things, and getting more and more proficient at outdoors life. They both have a real spirit of adventure and put huge amounts of effort into all that they do. \u201cThe sheer amount of learning and skills the boys had to learn to make these boats, and to build them, and to test them, and the understanding of how all these things work \u2026 It\u2019s just a joy to see.\u201d He added: \u201cBoth boys are absolutely delighted that the boats are in the water and we check a couple of times a day to see how they are doing.\u201d Mac also noted that reaction to the \u201cbucket list\u201d has been extremely positive. \u201cWhen they hear about the boys\u2019 adventures, people are always very positive and kind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about making memories and traditions. It feels really important that children get out into the world and have fun doing hands-on activities, rather than spending their days staring at screens.\u201d Anyone wanting to see where the boats are, find out more about the project, or donate to their adventures, can do so at https://www.icoteq.com/project-erebus/ and via their Facebook page."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d876b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/17/how-can-we-get-wizz-air-to-pay-the-money-it-owes-us", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How can we get Wizz Air to pay the money it owes us?", "lead": "We submitted a claim to a dispute resolution scheme, which ruled in our favour", "author": "Miles Brignall", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:00:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626256", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/92f2a6faa37202230508e31b2f666bd08fe5322a/0_0_4259_2556/500.jpg", "body": "In June 2022, my partner and I were due to fly from London to Athens with Wizz Air, but as we were sitting in the terminal waiting to board, it cancelled the flight.

The Wizz Air executives we saw said they were committed to putting matters right, and a host of changes to improve customer service had been made. They confirmed your case was a mistake and that your claim would now be paid. They were also keen to remind passengers that some of the problems customers experienced were caused by the fact they used online travel agents to book \u2013 which sometimes meant the airline did not have the customer\u2019s contact information when a problem arose or a refund was due.

Consumer confidence fell by 1.7 points to 101.6 in June, according to the YouGov/Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) index, a reading that remains in positive territory. The biggest drag on the index was homeowners\u2019 pessimism. Confidence in property values dropped by 5.8 points for the month and 10.3 points for the coming 12 months. Sentiment had been knocked by the slew of negative economic news, said Kay Neufeld, the CEBR\u2019s head of forecasting and thought leadership. Consumers trying to buy a house or remortgage at rates that have surpassed those in the aftermath of the mini-budget last year were particularly affected, she said, with the result that \u201cunsurprisingly, the two house value indicators have taken the largest hit this month\u201d. The latest Rightmove house price index showed that the average asking price of a property coming on to the market in July declined by 0.2%, or \u00a3905, to \u00a3371,907. The monthly fall was slightly worse than the 0% norm for this time of year. The run of base rate rises, the most recent of which took it to 5%, was starting to bite, the property website said. The number of sales agreed in June was 12% lower than the corresponding figure for 2019, in contrast with the better-than-expected start to the year. Tim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s director of property science innovation, said: \u201cThe interest rate brakes being applied more strongly to slow the economy are now beginning to bite. The unexpectedly stubborn inflation figures and the surprise of further mortgage rate rises when many felt that they had stabilised have contributed to the fall in prices and number of sales agreed.\u201d However, Bannister said buyer demand remained resilient at 3% above the more normal market of 2019, buoyed up by a shortage of high-quality properties for sale and housing need. Sales of larger properties had suffered more as those who did not have to move reassessed their budgets, but demand for smaller homes with two bedrooms or fewer has been less affected. Rightmove said this trend highlighted a continuing determination among many first-time buyers to navigate the unsettled mortgage market and get on to the property ladder, particularly with rents at record levels. Chris Druce, a senior research analyst at Knight Frank, said the residential property market was as \u201cprice-sensitive as it\u2019s been since before the pandemic\u201d but he added that \u201cdeals are still being struck and pricing is proving resilient\u201d. Nonetheless, the estate agency is forecasting that house prices will fall by 10% over this year and next as more fixed-rate mortgages are renewed at higher rates."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d876d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/17/i-dont-qualify-for-london-living-rent-so-pay-more-to-a-private-landlord-what-are-my-options", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I don\u2019t qualify for London living rent, so pay more to a private landlord.

I am a single mum and have been renting from a private landlord in Hounslow since 2016, paying \u00a31,100 a month for a one-bedroom flat for most of the time, until the rent was increased to \u00a31,300 a year ago. I thought that the concept of London living rent would be the perfect thing for me, until I read that I cannot qualify for a one-bedroom apartment that is part of the scheme locally with a monthly rent of \u00a3987.74 (which I know I can afford) because my salary of \u00a330,000 is less than the \u00a336,000 minimum household income requirement. I find it tragic how I am deemed unsuitable even for London living rent, not even talking about ever getting a mortgage. What is a person like me supposed to do? My only option is to keep on paying even higher rent to a private landlord and thus crushing any hopes of ever making any savings: I cannot understand why poor people are excluded from qualifying for cheaper rents. AS A If you are not thinking of ever getting a mortgage \u2013 and so not hoping to buy somewhere \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that the London living rent (LLR) scheme is for you. According to the mayor of London\u2019s website:\u201cLondon living rent is a type of intermediate affordable housing for middle-income Londoners who want to build up savings to buy a home. London living rent provides high-quality rented homes on stable tenancies [of a minimum of three years, maximum 10] with rents based on a third of local household incomes.\u201d According to the developers L&amp;Q Homes: \u201cThe main benefit of the scheme, is that through LLR you can go on to purchase the property you already call home via shared ownership or on the open market.\u201d More up your street may be the type of scheme \u2013 called SimpliCity \u2013 offered by Notting Hill Genesis, which is said to be \u201can affordable private let and not a social let\u201d. The scheme offers low-cost rental homes with a choice of one- to three-year tenancies, which are reserved for households that do not already own property and have an income of less than \u00a360,000. A similar scheme offering lower-rent homes \u2013 typically 20% less than market rents \u2013 is the SmartRent scheme from Network Homes. You can find other forms of affordable housing (exclusively for Londoners) by using the Homes for Londoners search tool on the mayor of London\u2019s website."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d876e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/17/bergamo-and-brescia-an-active-trip-to-italys-joint-capitals-of-culture", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bergamo and Brescia: an active trip to Italy\u2019s joint capitals of culture", "lead": "Football feuds and pandemic pain have been replaced with walks, hilltop feasts and culture in these cities, making them superb places to enjoy an active Lombardy holiday", "author": "Nazia Parveen", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:00:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626310", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/63d1b2a30b7e3206866ae3f28c3852d1a6b3657e/82_156_1888_1132/500.jpg", "body": "Wearing a crimson and sunshine-yellow flower crown, the young man is surrounded by his family, before there is the pop of the vino frizzante and the royal blue cups are filled for a merry toast to celebrate his graduation. The fading afternoon light dances on this scene taking place near the small central Fontana Contarini in Piazza Vecchia, in Citt\u00e0 Alta in Bergamo, the medieval upper part of the city. With its 16th-century Venetian walls and flourishing restaurants under large stone archways, the area invites people to pour in from every direction. I arrive in the square in a tuk-tuk as part of a tour with guide Elisabetta Campanini and we wander past the Campanone, the city\u2019s clock tower, whose bell I\u2019m told will chime 100 times at 10pm, a perennial reminder of the closure of the city gates during the Venetian domination. At the top, accessible by foot (230 steps) or more comfortably in the lift, there is a vista across the city and a bird\u2019s-eye view of the handsome basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore below. We make our way down and into the basilica \u2013 built almost nine centuries ago in gratitude to the Virgin Mary for warding off infections from a plague spreading across Europe. A work of unashamed opulence, large tapestries in deep greens and golds adorn the walls. They were woven by hand in craft workshops in Florence and further afield in Flanders, and everywhere you look there are frescoes and stuccos designed by the Italian Renaissance painter Lorenzo Lotto. But, for me, the basilica\u2019s most curious features are the medieval paintings next to its portals. Hidden for centuries after being painted over, some have now been restored. The colours are flatter in these works but they are no less beguiling than their more recent counterparts. We spend the afternoon strolling across the city as Elisabetta explains that Bergamo and its neighbour, Brescia, have always been somewhat overshadowed by Milan, capital of the northern region of Lombardy. But in just a few hours, watching the Bergamese go about their daily lives and later, during an afternoon in Brescia \u2013 known for its arts scene and Roman relics, including the Santa Giulia Museum, part of a complex that was granted world heritage status in 2011 \u2013 it is obvious both are teeming with fascinating architecture and good food, and offer ample access to nature. This year, the cities are pausing a 900-year-old feud (more recently fuelled by the rivalry of supporters of its football teams, Brescia Calcio and Bergamo\u2019s Atalanta BC) to become Italy\u2019s first joint capitals of culture. Both cities were badly affected by the pandemic: they were at the heart of the first wave of coronavirus in Europe, with ambulance sirens pealing out across the region day and night. Thousands lost their lives. The episode continues to haunt many of the residents, a look of deep sorrow passing across faces every time it is mentioned. Yet, there is a general sense of trying to shake off the pandemic with tourism and a new 80-mile (130km) hiking trail, La Via Delle Sorelle (The Way of the Sisters), has been created to link the two cities. Matteo Zanga, a mountain leader, is to be my guide for a 12-mile walk along the trail, and we set off one early morning from the provincial village of Olera. We weave our way through the hillsides with the scent of wild garlic in the air and white wood anemones providing a carpet. The route meanders alongside farms and through woodlands and we take a detour to see Ristorante Pighet, which is being revamped and is due to reopen later this year. As we make our way back on to the trail there is another opportunity for a pitstop and a glass of wine at an alpine festival, taking place in an opening alongside the trail. It is recommended that the trail, in the north-eastern corner of Lombardy and which features works of contemporary art, is completed in six stages, with places to sleep and eat along the way. It passes through four parks and reserves, sloping down toward Lake Iseo, and joins up with the Strada del Vino, a path that passes through the Franciacorta, Valcalepio and Terre del Vescovado wine-making regions, with opportunities to stop off for tastings. After passing a group of female friends, who are intending to complete the trail, we make our way back into the Citt\u00e0 Alta, and go for lunch at Baretto, in the upmarket, hilltop San Vigilio suburb, and this is where my opinion of the city, and the region as a whole, is cemented. Making our way through the hubbub of people waiting for the funicular railway down to the Citt\u00e0 Alta, we take a seat on the restaurant\u2019s terrace, where I order the traditional bergamasco appetiser of polenta, butter and anchovies, with the silvery seafood providing a nice hit of sharpness to the dollop of nutty cornmeal. The mango sorbet cleanser is exquisitely fresh as is the tiramis\u00f9 del Baretto and there is much good-humoured laughter from Matteo when I order a cappuccino to finish, as Italians apparently only drink milky coffee in the morning. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more here than just religious buildings: it is all about the food and the people,\u201d says Matteo. \u201cEvery place has its own speciality and when they do something, they do it very well \u2013 that is the best we have to share,\u201d he adds. It\u2019s true. During my visit I find people celebrating local ingredients in everything they create. During a guided tasting at Bu Cheese Bar, Pedro Domenghini Albano, introduces me to delightful morsels, from a soft stracchino, which has the consistency of melted butter and an undertone of fresh mushrooms, to the strachitunt from the Taleggio valley, with its grassy, sweet flavours. There is anticipation in his face as he waits for my verdict after each tasting, and excitement as he tells me about a new project offering in-depth tours in the region\u2019s \u201ccheese valleys\u201d. There are similar experiences in the well-located Trattoria Sant \u2018Ambroeus and at the more traditional Ol Giop\u00ec e la Marg\u00ec, where the food is delightful. My favourite meal comes at the end of my trip, at the simple Osteria al Bianchi in Brescia, run by the Masserdotti family since 1976. It might be because you can still buy a glass of wine for \u20ac1 (85p) if you drink it standing at the bar; or the fact that it is a humble affair of good ingredients cooked simply, from the malfatti al burro versato (balls of spinach and ricotta in a lemon butter sauce) to the melt-in-the-mouth costata alla griglia (grilled and finely cut ribs) washed down with glasses of sparkling Franciacorta - the grapes for this are grown on the hills between the southern shore of Lake Iseo and Brescia. In the end, I decide, it\u2019s the people. After the meal we take our drinks outside and as the light dips behind the buildings painted in warm shades of pink and yellow, and a family enjoys a lively meal on a terrace above, there is a chance meeting with Barbara Cavellini, who happens to be the granddaughter of Italian artist and collector Guglielmo Achille Cavellini. Barbara speaks affectionately of her grandfather and how he once had his portrait painted by Andy Warhol, as her partner, Giovanni, fills our glasses with the elegant Arcari e Danesi wine that he is producing on the slopes of Lombardy. There is a wonderful warmth in the conversation, a willingness to include and to share, and this has been my experience all along. Two cities that will not allow themselves to be shackled by the devastating impact of the pandemic, but are determined to invite outsiders in and show them that sometimes, out of the worst circumstances, something beautiful can exist.

A Rifle and a Bag is about the life of a quiet Indian couple, Somi and her husband Sukhram, who have one son and a baby on the way. They are looking for work and are concerned about schooling for their children, but their condition is more complex than most: they are former Naxalites, ex-members of a Maoist guerrilla group that operated in the remote and forested areas of central India, fighting for land and employment rights for the poor. But the couple took advantage of an amnesty offer to any Naxalite who agreed to renounce their membership, and now they are apparently poised to embark on their new lawful life. But the film shows that something is terribly wrong. Their eldest son is temporarily enrolled in a strict school which encourages the children to chant nationalist slogans, but he will only be allowed to stay there, or in any school, if Sukhram can produce his \u201ctribal caste certificate\u201d. Having this document will also be vital for their baby\u2019s upbringing and their own chances of employment. But he is unable to get it; Kafkaesque problems mean the bureaucracy obstructs him at every turn. Sukhram is assured he could procure this piece of paper if he went back to his home village (an almost Joseph-and-Mary situation looms) but it wouldn\u2019t be certain even then, and in fact old acquaintances in that village, resentful of his revolutionary past, might cause problems if they recognised him. So the couple are drifting into a kind of internal statelessness, an unperson condition that the state has semi-intentionally inflicted on them. The film is cool and crisply shot and lit; a calm and cerebral look at marginalised lives. \u2022 A Rifle and a Bag is available from 21 July on True Story."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8770", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/17/sick-of-this-conservative-government-that-shouldnt-stop-you-having-tory-friends", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sick of this Conservative government?

OK, there aren\u2019t as many as there used to be, since no one likes to back a loser. But there are still a few, and I rather cherish them. I often think about this whenever I\u2019m in the hyperpartisan, Balkanised world of social media full as it is of people calling Tories scum (and worse) and collecting a bountiful harvest of retweets and likes on the back of it. I\u2019m not about to vote Conservative myself (I\u2019m a wishy-washy centrist who liked Tony Blair\u2019s early work and has since mostly voted Labour, with an occasional swing to the Liberal Democrats and Greens) but I reckon a having a few friends on the right is good news. For starters, I would much rather have a political discussion with a Tory than with my own tribe, with whom I\u2019m either going to agree or argue furiously over small differences. But when I hang out with my west London Tory friend, I know the political banter will always be spicy. I\u2019ll be provoked, challenged and robustly rebutted. Like all good opponents, she improves my game. Even better, you sometimes discover surprising points of agreement. One Conservative pal is vehemently against London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (which, as a cyclist, I\u2019m very much in favour of) but, like me, thinks Brexit was a terrible idea. It\u2019s not a grand coming together, but it\u2019s a start. Socialising with the right also disabuses you of fashionable \u201cbubble\u201d notions. Chat to actual Tories and the oft-repeated refrain that Keir Starmer is a Tory starts to feel ridiculous. You can learn from them, too, even in the party\u2019s current parlous state. Tories rarely believe they have a monopoly on virtue (there\u2019s a reason \u201cLabour scum\u201d is not commonplace) and I\u2019ve always admired their ability to flex ideologically, coalesce behind a leader and focus on winning (although Boris Johnson has demonstrated the practical limits of this). But the main point is, that in an ever-more polarised world, friendships with people who don\u2019t think like you are great. It\u2019s very easy to \u201cother\u201d people when you never meet them, but far harder when you\u2019re having a pint with them. Finally, if you are going to be machiavellian about it, there has never been a better time to win over wavering Tories. It hardly needs saying that converting a Tory in a swingable \u201cblue wall\u201d constituency is electorally far more valuable than preaching to the choir in a Labour stronghold.

Imprinted on her memory, along with the hurt, is the understanding that she had to scream really loudly \u201cbecause my mother wouldn\u2019t hear\u201d. Her mother\u2019s hearing loss took place over many years, and Earth grew up knowing that the same might happen to her. \u201cI saw my mother\u2019s experience,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much loss and pain. And I decided: I am not doing that.\u201d In a sense, Earth, an academic, has prepared all her life for her own possible future deafness. She was 27 when a screening identified hearing loss, but the loss was gradual, so \u201cit\u2019s not easy to define when I stopped being able to hear,\u201d she says. Her work and travels have taken her to 33 countries. In her 50s, she taught at a college in Thailand, but hearing students\u2019 questions had become \u201cimpossible\u201d. Life was \u201can increasing struggle\u201d. Earth decided that if she were to spare herself the loneliness and pain she had witnessed in her mother, she needed to act. So she moved from Thailand to Hawaii to learn American Sign Language (ASL) and now, with her 60th birthday some way behind her (she does not want to give her exact age to avoid discrimination when looking for work), she has reached \u201ca functional level\u201d. The language is \u201cvery hard\u201d, she says over video-call via an ASL interpreter (a colleague in her new job at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), New York), much harder than Swahili, which she learned while doing a doctorate in Tanzania in her 40s. \u201cThere is a huge difference in the sign language of someone who is born deaf. I don\u2019t have those connections from my brain to my hands and eyes.\u201d Finger-spelling is difficult. \u201cThe hand movements are so subtle. I often can\u2019t catch it,\u201d she says. Along with learning a new language, Earth has spent the past decade or more placing herself in a community. After the ASL course, she became a graduate student at Gallaudet university, Washington, which has a bilingual approach to learning, then worked on a history of deaf people in Hawaii. One deaf woman Earth visited in the nursing home \u201ccried and cried because no one signed there\u201d. Earth realised: \u201cI need to be around other deaf people.\u201d For a long time, even in her 50s, Earth could still hear some sounds: low frequencies, \u201cgarbled and meaningless\u201d. But a few years back, those went too. \u201cI was very frightened,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt my ears close for the last time. Any sound grounds you. I felt like I was floating; nothing firm.\u201d Last year, Earth, who at the time was living in Athens, Ohio, decided to start \u201ca new life\u201d. She was the only deaf person in the town. \u201cI felt alone,\u201d she says. She had cared for her father for five years, despite the challenges of communicating with care professionals. When he died at 99, she applied to the Deaf Hub at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at RIT, where she has started a postdoctorate in reproductive health experiences. \u201cMy colleagues are all deaf and ASL is used for everything,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a second life. I learn more, I sign more. It\u2019s progress.\u201d Not having grown up with sign language means \u201cit\u2019s very easy to feel like an outsider. But not here,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different, and they value diversity.\u201d Earth has \u201calways accepted challenges and jumped into adventures\u201d. As a child, she owned a globe. \u201cI would spin it and try to imagine the place where my finger landed.\u201d Her determination from a young age to be prepared for what lay ahead has brought restrictions, however. \u201cKnowing I was going to be deaf prevented me from getting really involved with partners,\u201d she says. \u201cNot getting married, or something like that.\u201d Earth had moved to Hawaii with her long-term partner, only to realise that the relationship had run its course. \u201cThat was really painful,\u201d she says. And old friendships with hearing friends are \u201cnot the same\u201d \u2013 they inhabit different sensory worlds, different social realities.

But while the appearance of the new machine is a step up, it falls far short of expectations when it is turned on. The new tablet starts at \u00a3249.99, undercutting Apple\u2019s cheapest iPad by more than \u00a3100 and just half of the price of the 10.9in model. While every other Fire tablet has been made of plastic, the Max 11 has an aluminium body. It is thin, feels well made and is relatively light for the size. The larger 11in LCD screen is also crisper and higher quality compared with the Fire HD 10, with good viewing angles. Films and video look great, while a set of stereo speakers in the top are loud and clear. The screen isn\u2019t overly bright, being fine indoors away from direct light but struggling outdoors. The screen is wide and short, which fits films and TV shows perfectly. But it is not as well suited to using apps and the browser than the squarer ratio used by an iPad and others. This is a problem for Amazon as it is pitching the Max 11 as a productivity machine offering keyboard and stylus accessories to turn it into a laptop surrogate. Here is where things really start to fall apart. The accessories are generally fine for the money. The \u00a390 ($90) keyboard is solid but the trackpad is a bit too sticky, meaning your finger skips when trying to scroll or point. You also can\u2019t click and drag like you might on a desktop to select text, which is annoying. The kickstand struggles to hold it steady while typing on your lap but is fine on a desk. The \u00a335 ($35) stylus is likewise solid. It is responsive on-screen and magnetically attaches to the side of the tablet when not in use. The big issue is the software. The Max 11 runs the same Fire OS 8 based on Android 11 as other recent Fire tablets. You can do basic split-screen multitasking using the recent apps menu but is has no ability to have free-floating windows and there\u2019s no app dock or taskbar, or any of the now-standard things on competitors aimed at productivity. The home screen doesn\u2019t support widgets or gesture navigation, relying on rather retro touchscreen buttons to get around. But it is Amazon\u2019s app store that really lets the Max 11 down. As is the case with all Fire tablets, it has no official access to the Google Play Store or the firm\u2019s apps. While Amazon\u2019s store has most of the video streaming services you would want apart from Paramount+, it simply isn\u2019t the case for productivity apps. Fire OS has solid support from Microsoft with Office, Teams, Outlook and a few others available but if you don\u2019t work within Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem things get tricky. The included mail app is extremely basic and doesn\u2019t support business Gmail accounts. There\u2019s no Amazon note-taking or drawing app for the stylus and few options in the store. Almost every app I use for work or personal productivity is not available, including Evernote and similar tools. Chat apps are few on the ground, with no Slack or WhatsApp. There aren\u2019t any banking apps, two-factor apps or password managers, which makes logging in to things a faff. You can use web apps instead but Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is the only option on the tablet. Most web apps worked fine but more complex tools had bits that just didn\u2019t work. A bigger problem is Silk isn\u2019t supported by some, which refuse to run and demand you install Chrome, Firefox or Safari, such as Google Chat or Meet. You also can\u2019t have two Silk windows open side by side, which means if you are working in two web apps you can\u2019t have them split-screen. Chrome on Android and Safari on an iPad offer this, so there\u2019s no excuse for Amazon. The app store is also fairly weak for games. There are a few high-quality, big-name titles available, such as Minecraft, Stardew Valley and Asphalt 9. But there are also mountains of poor quality clones or rubbish packed with ads and in-app purchases. Specifications Screen: 11in (2,000 x 1,200) LCD (213ppi) Processor: Mediatek MT8188J RAM: 4GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 128GB + microSD card Operating system: Fire OS 8 based on Android 11 Camera: 8MP rear and front cameras Connectivity: Wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C Dimensions: 259.1 x 163.7 x 7.5mm Weight: 490g If you can find the right app combination, the low-power MediaTek chip manages quite well. The Max 11 feels noticeably snappier than other Fire tablets and didn\u2019t get bogged down too much with two apps on-screen. Battery life is reasonable, lasting about seven hours of productivity or more than 12 hours of video streaming. Sustainability The Fire Max 11 will receive software and security updates for at least four years after it is last available new from Amazon. The battery is rated for at least 500 full charge cycles. However, consumers can\u2019t get the device repaired by Amazon out of warranty. The company will provide a 15% discount on replacement units for returned devices, which are then repaired, refurbished, reused or recycled depending on their condition. The device contains 55% recycled aluminium and 34% recycled plastic. The company offers trade-in and recycling schemes and publishes information on its various sustainability efforts. Price The Fire Max 11 costs \u00a3249.99 ($229.99) with 64GB of storage with ads on the lockscreen, which cost \u00a310 ($15) to remove. For comparison, the Fire HD 10 starts at \u00a3149.99, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 costs \u00a3199, the ninth-gen Apple iPad costs \u00a3369 and the 10th-gen iPad starts at \u00a3499. Verdict The Fire Max 11 is the best tablet Amazon has made. It looks and feels nicer, sounds better and has a good fingerprint scanner in the power button \u2013 a first for an Amazon tablet. But with those improvements comes greater cost and greater expectations. Pitched as a productivity tablet, it falls flat because the software just isn\u2019t good enough. Amazon\u2019s app store is also useless for productivity apps outside Microsoft\u2019s office suite. There are no good password managers or two-factor apps either, and the Silk browser isn\u2019t great. Amazon has a lot of work to do to solve these problems. The Max 11 wants to compete with an iPad but is miles behind. If you want an Amazon tablet for media consumption, save the \u00a3100 and buy the Fire HD 10. Pros: good screen, good speakers, good battery life, microSD card slot, USB-C charging, aluminium body, fingerprint scanner. Cons: poor software for multitasking, lack of key productivity apps with no access to Google Play, very slow charging, other Amazon tablets far better value."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8773", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/17/after-the-floods-the-future-looks-bright-truck-art-in-pakistan-a-photo-essay", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "After the floods, the future looks bright: truck art in Pakistan \u2013 a photo essay ", "lead": "Ali Salman Anchan and his team of artists travelled to meet some of the people affected by last year\u2019s devastating monsoon rains in Sindh province.

His \u201ctruck art\u201d \u2013 known as Phool Patti in Urdu \u2013 appears in buildings in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia. Most recently, his vibrant designs have brightened up the Pakistan embassy in Beijing. But it was a commission to paint a van used to transport medical supplies after last year\u2019s devastating floods in his home country that has been the most fulfilling, he says, adding: \u201cIt was an honour to be part of this project.\u201d Top: the team prepare the former mobile clinic and artist Ali Salman Anchan begins the painting, which will tell stories of real people affected by last year\u2019s floods; bottom: the portraits start to take shape Truck art dates back to the 1920s, when Bedford trucks imported from the UK were embellished with colourful floral patterns and landscapes, animals and birds. Over the years, the indigenous art form has become a method of storytelling, used to share messages or celebrate moments and milestones. The designs, often painted by hand and largely by self-taught artists, can be seen on vehicles across the country, including tuk-tuks and buses. In January, Anchan was asked by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), an umbrella group of UK charities that coordinates funding appeals, to tell the stories of some of the survivors of Pakistan\u2019s worst floods on the sides of a vehicle that was used as a mobile clinic. A boat carries people to land in Sindh during the devastating floods in September 2022. Photograph: Akifullah Khan/DEC Between June and August last year, monsoon rains killed at least 1,700 people, damaged 2m homes, and destroyed crops and livelihoods. Sindh and Balochistan provinces were worst affected. Anchan, founder of the Phool Patti, a social enterprise project to promote Pakistani truck art around the world, was sent photographs of potential subjects to paint, and in May he and his team of artists travelled to Sindh to meet them. Anchan says hearing their stories was \u201ceye-opening\u201d. A portrait of farmer Maula Dinno, who lost his cotton crops and all his animals in the floods, takes shape Maula Dinno*, a farmer in Sindh, says he thought he was \u201cwitnessing judgment day\u201d when the floods arrived. \u201cSo much water entered our homes. We could not even sit on our charpoys [woven beds] as the water rose above them. \u201cEverything was destroyed in the water. The cotton crops we had sown, the animals \u2026 we lost it all. I saw people falling so ill. We were compelled to seek shelter in tents on the nearby main roads. My family \u2013 my mother, my wife, Nusrat, and our children \u2013 spent two months living on the road. \u201cMy land was inundated, and by the time the water dried, the land was barren and unusable. We did not have the funds to plough the land or purchase the seed. The situation was so dire that I gave up. I felt as if I would never be able to use the land again.\u201d Top: the portrait of Maula Dinno is one of hope and shows him sprinkling seed in his cotton field, which he was able to start cultivating again with donated saplings, seed and fertiliser from Concern Worldwide. Bottom: Anchan assesses the progress of the work Dinno received saplings, seeds and fertiliser from the NGO Concern Worldwide, and one year on, crops are beginning to grow back. \u201cYesterday, I carried mountains of troubles and trials, but now I am relieved [of them] and I am in a happy phase,\u201d he says. Arslan, 11, remembers flood waters reaching as high as his neck. \u201cI had never seen so much rain in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt really scared. I didn\u2019t know what would happen.\u201d He says there was little food. \u201cWe could not get food like vegetables or rice or oil. I love to eat bhindi [okra] but nothing like that was available. The water had some dead fish in it but we were scared we would get sick if we ate that. Even flour was so expensive. Our school was damaged and we were really worried that we would not be able to continue our education.\u201d Maula Dinno, his wife, Nusrat, and their children at home in Sindh Arslan, whose family are still living in a tent after their home was destroyed in the floods, is studying in a temporary school set up by Save the Children. \u201cI remember my first day at the tent school. I was so happy, I felt as if my dream of becoming a police officer was still possible. When it felt like we would not receive an education, I thought I would lose that and I would have to do manual labour to earn a living like most of the people in the village.\u201d Artists Ali Salman Anchan, right, and Shakeel Ahmed discuss the portrait-in-progress of mother and daughter, Sultana and Ayra Fatima When Lakshmi, 35, returned to her village six months after the floods, she found it in ruins \u2013 homes had been destroyed, crops gone and livestock killed. But she says the tragedy formed new bonds between people. \u201cEveryone was so devastated by loss that the distinctions were erased,\u201d says Lakshmi, who lives with her husband and seven children. \u201cWhether you were Hindu or Muslim, it didn\u2019t matter. We forgot all the things that separated us or made us different and we had to come together as a community to take care of ourselves. We had all lost everything \u2013 that was the common factor.\u201d Sultana stands in the spot in her house where she was when the roof began to collapse during the heavy rains. Photograph: Khaula Jamil/DEC Sultana says her house was \u201cinundated with water\u201d that stayed for about four months. \u201cThe water was as high as my knees and it was everywhere. We were afraid to go out on to the roads to seek shelter because there was so much water surrounding us,\u201d she says. She worries how much damage could occur during this year\u2019s rainy season, which has already killed more than 50 people. Sultana\u2019s daughter, Arya Fatima, 10, had to be taken to a clinic after she contracted malaria from the mosquitoes that bred in the stagnant water surrounding their home. She also became malnourished. \u201cI vividly remember carrying her in my arms into the clinic. She was not conscious, and I feared for her life,\u201d says Sultana.

Bottom: an artist adds details to one of the paintings on the truck. Photographs: Zoral Khurram Naik and Khaula Jamil/DEC Arya Fatima recovered and Anchan says he remembers the excitement and joy on her face when she saw her portrait on the van. \u201cShe was excited, but also the whole village was excited. She was a celebrity on that day because everyone, all the other girls, were congratulating her,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was still recovering from malaria, but after everyone saw her, she felt better.\u201d Painting the van was a \u201cbrilliant idea\u201d, says Anchan, \u201cbecause the villagers in the affected areas are suffering a lot of things. But when we parked the truck up, the villagers celebrated and were all so excited. \u2018Sometimes projects change your thinking\u2019: Ali Salman Anchan and farmer Maula Dinno with local children and the cricket bats they painted \u201cEveryone came to see the truck to see if they could recognise who has been painted, if they knew someone.\u201d Anchan says the project has changed his life. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I want to do more social projects after this. Sometimes projects change your thinking. I saw this devastation my own people suffered and I decided I can do more, not just through painting and art, but through any type of voluntary work.\u201d The back of the completed truck with scenes from last year\u2019s floods * All interviewees are referred to by their first names only to protect identities"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8774", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/17/albert-hammond-jr-honest-playlist", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I hate karaoke!\u2019 Albert Hammond Jr\u2019s honest playlist", "lead": "The Strokes guitarist grew up on Phil Collins and has Cat Stevens as his alarm tone, but when it comes to the bedroom, he prefers a long player", "author": "As told to Rich Pelley", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:00:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626424", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bc376519c1de398d8cec4b17888e45eaa0c29df1/0_34_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "The first song I remember hearing I would have been four or five, so I\u2019m not sure if I can actually remember hearing Every Breath You Take by the Police, or whether it\u2019s just a memory of my dad who got a copy and played it over and over. Memories are weird like that, especially when you\u2019re really young. The first single I bought Once again, tough, but it was probably We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire by Billy Joel when I was eight or nine. The one I clearly remember buying when I was a little older was Regulate by Warren G. The song I do at karaoke I hate karaoke. The best song to play at a party? That depends on the party, what vibe you\u2019re trying to do. I\u2019m not great at dancefloor parties, but I\u2019m pretty good at curating a vibe at a gathering. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a specific song that\u2019s great to play at a party. It\u2019s the variety that creates the vibe. The song I streamed last I\u2019m a creature of variety, so Leave Me Alone by New Order. The song I secretly like, but tell everyone I hate I don\u2019t hide like that. Growing up, I loved Elton John and Against All Odds by Phil Collins but it\u2019s not something I find embarrassing. The song I can no longer listen to Probably all the ones I\u2019ve had as my ringtone, including Sound and Vision by David Bowie, Homeward Bound by Simon and Garfunkel and Trouble by Cat Stevens. My phone\u2019s ruined these songs for me. Now I have the theme tune to Knight Rider; I\u2019m never going to listen to the whole song, so it\u2019s fine. The song I wish I had written Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven. The best song to have sex to I have sex for longer than one song. I would say listen to an album, such as the Cars\u2019 debut. It\u2019s well paced. Side one ends with Don\u2019t Cha Stop so you\u2019ve got a good ramp there. Then you flip it over and you have a good ramp to the end. It\u2019s always nice to have music on, whatever you\u2019re doing. The song that changed my life I would say the band that changed my life was Guided by Voices. Why? There\u2019s no answer for this kind of stuff. It\u2019s like: why did you fall in love? Why did you do this? Who knows? If you could answer, you would probably disappear into the universe. I guess the whys for me are when there\u2019s a gut feeling more powerful than language can describe. The song that gets me up in the morning I\u2019ve told you this before: I have Homeward Bound by Simon and Garfunkel and Trouble by Cat Stevens as my ringtone. So those are the two songs that get me up in the morning. The song I want played at my funeral I always find that weird. I mean, I\u2019ll be dead, so I don\u2019t really care.

Last week the United Nations discovered a mass grave in Sudan\u2019s West Darfur in which 87 people were buried, prompting the UN high commissioner for Human Rights to demand a \u201cthorough and independent investigation\u201d into activity in the region. It is the latest troubling news to come out of the country, which has been in a state of conflict since April, when fighting broke out between rival groups. In the three months since, 3.1 million people have been displaced, thousands are thought to have been killed and even more wounded, with entire neighbourhoods destroyed. UN agencies have received credible reports of 21 incidents of conflict-related sexual violence against at least 57 women and girls \u2013 in one of the incidents as many as 20 women were reportedly raped in the same attack. There have been reports of extrajudicial killings, ethnic violence, and widespread hunger, with a former UN humanitarian coordinator describing what is happening in Sudan as having \u201call the signature characteristics of genocide\u201d. Peace talks were suspended last month as both sides continued to violate ceasefires. Over the weekend, representatives for the Sudanese army reportedly returned to Saudi Arabia for peace talks, indicating that they are open to diplomatic avenues for ending the conflict, though expectations are low. As humanitarian organisations, NGOs and foreign governments watch on in dismay, the conflict shows little signs of ending, with both the army and the Rapid Support Force (RSF) engaging in a bloodthirsty battle to the end. But as the violence threatens to tip into an all-out civil war and plunge the region into crisis, neighbouring countries have been asking how order might be restored. Today\u2019s newsletter examines the state of play in Sudan, three months into the conflict. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | Explosions have reportedly hit the Kerch bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula to Russia, a heavily guarded road and rail link that is among the Kremlin\u2019s most important infrastructure projects. The head of the Russian-controlled administration in Crimea, said traffic had been stopped because of \u201can emergency situation\u201d. Two people have been killed and a child was injured. Environment | Southern Europe is bracing for a second \u201cheat storm\u201d in a week. Record temperatures across the Mediterranean could be broken on Tuesday, and people in Italy have been told to prepare for most intense heatwave \u2018of all time\u2019.

Iran | Iran\u2019s \u201cmorality police\u201d have returned to the streets 10 months after the death of a woman in their custody sparked nationwide protests. It comes as authorities announce a new campaign to force women to wear the Islamic headscarf. Hospitals | The government is on track to break a key election promise from Boris Johnson to build 40 new hospitals in England by the end of the decade, a damning report by the public spending watchdog has found. Music | France\u2019s favourite \u201cpetite Anglaise\u201d, the British-born singer and actor Jane Birkin, has died at her home in Paris aged 76. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, paid tribute to Birkin, saying she \u201cembodied freedom and sang the most beautiful words in our language\u201d. In depth: The battle for control of Sudan, over 90 days in The conflict in Sudan began in the middle of April, with a power struggle between two rival military factions. The Sudanese army, led by the country\u2019s de facto leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, went head to head with the RSF, a collection of militia who follow Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. In 2019, the two groups were largely in alignment, as they helped oust Sudan\u2019s former authoritarian leader Omar Bashir to create a tentative power-sharing government with civilian groups. This dissolved in 2021 after a military coup involving the Sudanese army and the RSF, which derailed Sudan\u2019s short-lived move into democracy. In the years since the factions have turned on each other, after negotiations to integrate the RSF into the Sudanese army soured \u2013 the primary question being who would defer to who in their new setup. The fault line became fatal in mid-April, after the two groups began battling for control. Over 90 days later, the battle continues. *** War crimes The international criminal court\u2019s (ICC) prosecutor announced that he is investigating new war crimes and crimes against humanity in the country\u2019s West Darfur region \u2013 a part of Sudan that 20 years ago was ravaged by atrocities and violence \u2013 after a mass grave was found. The 87 victims were mostly Masalit, a largely African farming ethnic group which has been the target of attacks by Arab militias. The ICC\u2019s prosecutor said that the world and Sudan is \u201cin peril of allowing history to repeat itself\u201d. As the RSF fights the Sudanese army in the country\u2019s capital, Khartoum, the paramilitary group has been accused of waging another war in Darfur where the Janjaweed militias \u2013 the group that the RSF evolved out of \u2013 were accused of genocide nearly two decades ago. The RSF are being accused of continuing that same war now, attacking civilians in their homes and levelling huge parts of El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur. Those who speak out can expect a brutal, even fatal, response: seven activists have been killed in El Geneina after reportedly receiving threats from the militias. And last month a regional governor, Khamis Abakar, was abducted by men in RSF uniforms and murdered hours after he publicly accused the paramilitary group and its Arab military allies of genocide (the RSF has denied involvement in the death of Abakar and of any genocidal activity). The ICC is also looking into the burning of homes, looting, and is giving priority to crimes against children and sexual and gender-based violence. *** A route to peace? Several countries that neighbour Sudan \u2013 Ethiopia, Chad, Central African Republic, Libya, and South Sudan \u2013 have been affected by their own political upheavals and conflicts in recent years. As such, there are fears that prolonged and intensified fighting in Sudan could further destabilise a region that is already in a precarious position. Egypt is particularly worried about the fallout of this conflict, particularly on its economy and border. Last week, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi led the most high-profile meeting about the conflict, attended by leaders of the other six countries closest to Sudan (those above, plus Eritrea), in an attempt to establish a lasting ceasefire. Neither the RSF nor the Sudanese army attended the summit, but they did praise the gathering on social media. El-Sissi encouraged the two sides to come to the table during an African Union-led negotiation during which all fighting would stop. The summit has not been welcomed by everyone, however. Before it took place, Sudan\u2019s ambassador to Egypt responded frostily to the cross-country discussions about Sudan\u2019s situation, saying that \u201coutside forces\u201d were effectively meddling and that including so many parties was further complicating the situation. *** Life for those still in Sudan Before the conflict even began, Sudan was facing political unrest, rising inflation and extreme weather shocks. For the tens of millions of Sudanese people still in the country, their living conditions have declined even further over the last three months. The UN is predicting that between 2 and 2.5 million more people are likely going to face acute hunger in the coming months. Despite the adverse effects on the economy, civilians, and the infrastructure of Sudan, neither side has shown any inclination of backing down. Towards the end of last week, the military shelled a market in Omdurman, the country\u2019s most populous city, killing 30 people, mostly women and children. Residents described it as the worst week for civilian casualties since the conflict began. The previous weekend, 38 people were killed in the same city during an airstrike.

Current and former female prisoners are excluded from discussions on women\u2019s rights, they say. This has led to a lack of the funding and policy reforms needed to address the alarming increase in the criminalisation of women and the number of children detained with their parent. The number of women and girls in prison has grown by almost 60% since 2000, nearly three times the increase in the male prison population of about 22%. The global female prison population increased by more than 100,000 in the 10 years up to the end of 2020. Evidence shows women\u2019s incarceration is closely linked to domestic violence, poverty and discriminatory laws. The acclaimed Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga and the Ugandan human rights advocate and poet Stella Nyanzi are, with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, among nearly 250 signatories calling on the organisers of the Women Deliver conference, which begins in Kigali on Monday, to ensure \u201chigh-level forums on women\u2019s rights are inclusive of all women\u201d. Women Deliver, which emerged out of the sexual and reproductive health movement, has grown into one of the world\u2019s most high-profile organisations promoting gender equality and the rights of women and girls. The letter, signed by 115 organisations from across the world, also calls for action by those involved in the six \u201caction coalitions\u201d launched at the Generation Equality Forum in 2021, where five-year plans to speed up progress were launched. The forum, hosted by UN Women and the governments of Mexico and France, was the largest to be held on women\u2019s rights in 25 years. Billions of dollars were pledged by philanthropists and governments to support gender equality. But, the letter says: \u201cA key group of women and girls were left out of this process \u2013 criminalised, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women. \u201cWomen with lived experience of the criminal justice system were invisible throughout the forum,\u201d it added. A midpoint meeting to assess progress towards the Generation Equality goals will be held in September. Susan Kigula, a signatory to the letter who was wrongly convicted for the murder of her husband and spent 16 years in prison before becoming a lawyer in Uganda, said it was sad that organisations and individuals still looked down on women who went to prison and did not include them in policy decisions. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to punch someone a second time by rejecting them and not wanting to associate with them. We are all human beings,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should understand formerly incarcerated women need to be included. These people should not be judged by their past.\u201d The letter, coordinated by Women Beyond Walls, a platform to end over-incarceration and over-criminalisation of women worldwide, says applications submitted by some of the signatories to hold an official event on the issue at Women Deliver, which thousands of people are expected to attend, including ministers and UN officials, were not accepted. The signatories call on member states, UN agencies, intergovernmental bodies and organisers of future high-level assemblies, including the forthcoming midpoint meeting and the United Nations\u2019 Commission on the Status of Women in March, \u201cto ensure that women\u2019s incarceration is included as a priority topic\u201d. Claudia Cardona, director of Corporaci\u00f3n Mujeres Libres, an organisation that defends the rights of women affected by the prison system, said society considered women in prison or who had been in prison as not worthy of being heard. \u201cHowever, we have the lived experience to enable us to construct a world where all women are given opportunities and have their rights protected,\u201d she said. Cardona, who spent almost a decade in prison, added that ignoring this group of women had direct repercussions. \u201cIt limits policy reform, [our ability to] obtain funding and [stops us] building our movement, which aims to build global solidarity and elevate the voices, experiences and ideas of women who have been deprived of their liberty,\u201d she said. Research by Women Beyond Walls revealed that more than 60% of organisations working with women in prison were in a precarious financial situation, with more than a quarter saying they may be unable to continue operating due to a lack of funds. More than 70% said they did not receive any funding from women\u2019s rights or feminist foundations."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8778", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/17/starwatch-summer-triangle-northern-hemisphere", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starwatch: the summer triangle rises to prominence", "lead": "Deneb, Vega and Altair, which star in a Chinese folk story, are riding high in the northern hemisphere", "author": "Stuart Clark", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626499", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3028077b8eded45b43eaa8fc8b1bffff1ece492d/0_250_5400_3241/500.jpg", "body": "The most prominent star patterns are sometimes not constellations at all.

The term was popularised by the British astronomer Patrick Moore in the latter half of the 20th century.

Patterns of stars that are not recognised as marking out traditional constellations are called asterisms.

After the claims against Warburton emerged 15 months ago, many locals complained that he was barely seen in the Somerset constituency, with some even putting up mock \u201cmissing\u201d posters. Warburton claimed at the weekend that allegations of sexual misconduct against him had been withdrawn. He has admitted drug-taking but denies any sexual misconduct. While Warburton denies he neglected local issues, Dyke, speaking on a visit to the Godminster organic dairy farm just outside the small town of Bruton, says that as a local councillor who has been the Lib Dem candidate for more than a year, she has fielded numerous queries. \u201cEverybody that I\u2019ve spoken to has said they\u2019ve tried to email him, they\u2019ve tried to write to him, they\u2019ve tried to knock on his office door, and every single route came up with a blank,\u201d Dyke says. \u201cSo they turned to me.\u201d Another curiosity is that of the three byelections taking place on Thursday, bookmakers and pundits are near unanimous in agreeing that Somerton and Frome is the easiest to call, with Dyke set to win \u2013 despite the Conservatives defending a 19,000-plus majority in a heavily rural seat they have held since 2015. Lib Dem campaigners are understandably cautious, stressing that the wait for Warburton\u2019s resignation has left little more than four weeks to persuade numerous Labour and Green supporters that they should vote tactically. \u201cThe last week is going to be crucial,\u201d one activist said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone well so far but there is a lot still to be done.\u201d Even with two other seats to defend, in Selby and Uxbridge, the Conservatives are not giving up. Chatting in a pub in Wincanton, another of the handful of towns dotted around the Somerset constituency, the Tory candidate, Faye Purbrick, recounts visits from a string of ministers including Michael Gove and Grant Shapps. Purbrick, also a councillor on Somerset council, argues that such ties make her a better bet for local people than a Lib Dem who, she argues, would be left \u201cshouting from the sidelines\u201d in Westminster. \u201cI\u2019m connected to a lot of people and if people vote for me they\u2019ll get an MP who is going to hit the ground running, and knows where to go and what to do to make things happen,\u201d Purbrick says. Perhaps understandably, Purbrick insists that Warburton and his record are not a prime concern for locals. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conversation I\u2019ve been having with people,\u201d she says. Despite the increasingly short odds of a Lib Dem win, Somerton and Frome is a complex area to campaign in, with its stark mix of often significant deprivation and notable wealth, much of the latter coming via incomers from London, increasingly so since Covid. This is particularly notable in parts of Frome and in Bruton, the location last weekend of the orange confetti-interrupted wedding of the former chancellor George Osborne, who has a home there. Much of the seat is rural, which is home turf for Dyke who comes from a farming family. Touring Godminster, she chats knowledgeably to Peter Cheek, the manager, about how the farm plants a \u201csalad bowl\u201d of mixed grazing plants to improve the dairy cattle\u2019s health, as well as boosting biodiversity. As ever with Lib Dem byelection campaigns, if the party does win, a good part of the reason is likely to be the energy and resources put into campaigning. Such is the volume of Lib Dem literature pushed through letterboxes that some locals have started referring to them as \u201cthe Daily Sarah\u201d. Purbrick, the Tory hopeful, says that when she knocked on one door recently, an exasperated local pushed nine Lib Dem leaflets into her hands and asked if she could find a place to recycle them. Much of this onslaught of paper is intended to reinforce the impression that it is a two-horse race. While Labour is fairly obviously focusing on Selby and Uxbridge, the Greens have fielded a popular local councillor, Martin Dimery, and are pushing hard. Frome, Dimery\u2019s home turf, has Green posters and placards on show, but elsewhere in the constituency it is almost all Lib Dem orange. One Conservative sign has reportedly been spotted \u2013 the mischievous theory is that it was erected out of spite by the disgruntled ex-partner of a Lib Dem councillor. There are already some signs that the recipe is in place for another Lib Dem win \u2013 tactical voting combined with at best apathy among habitual Tories. Returning home from the shops in Frome, Liz Rostand, a retired former radio journalist, said she was likely to not vote Conservative for the first time since 1997. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly impressed by anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t vote Labour. I won\u2019t vote for the Tories. I guess it could be Lib Dem, but maybe also Green. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Chris and Becky Battle, both teachers, were more clear: they are Labour supporters but will vote for Dyke this time. \u201cWe just want to get the Conservatives out, and unfortunately tactical voting is the only way to do it,\u201d Becky Battle said."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d877a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/17/teachers-in-england-will-have-to-tell-parents-if-children-question-their-gender", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teachers in England will have to tell parents if children question their gender", "lead": "Kemi Badenoch says guidance will ensure parents know what is \u2018going on with their children\u2019 at school", "author": "Pippa Crerar Political editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626537", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/34007d0c2d3ba5dea8bf3a27917fd5370553a654/0_250_7081_4249/500.jpg", "body": "Teachers will be forced to tell parents that their child is questioning their gender even if the young person objects under new guidance for schools in England, the equalities minister has indicated. Kemi Badenoch said that the guidance, which is expected to be published this week, will ensure that parents know what is \u201cgoing on with their children\u201d at school. Under the new plans, headteachers are expected to be told that parents must always be consulted if a child wants to be called another name, or wear a different uniform. It has also been suggested that schools will not be able to use the child\u2019s new preferred pronouns until parents give their consent. The guidance advises teachers that any pupil who wants to self-identify as a different gender should first undergo a period of reflection, according to reports. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show, Badenoch said: \u201cWe are producing guidance for schools to know how to deal with children who are experiencing gender distress. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of confusion about what the law says and it is important that parents are aware of what\u2019s going on with their children and what\u2019s happening to them at school, so what we\u2019re doing is making sure we have robust guidance that\u2019s going to be able to stand up to scrutiny. That will be coming shortly.\u201d When told it might be possible that trans students feel teachers are \u201couting\u201d them to their parents against their wishes, Badenoch replied: \u201cThe fact is that this is not a trivial thing; this is very different from sexual orientation and what is right is that parents know what is going on with their children at school.\u201d Schools have faced an increase in the number of children questioning their gender in recent years, and teachers have called for more clarity on how they should support trans children. In 2021-22, the NHS reported more than 5,000 referrals to the gender identity development service run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust, up from just under 250 a decade earlier."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d877b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/17/uk-investors-backtrack-support-climate-resolution-oil-firms-chevron-exxonmobil", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK investors backtrack on support for climate resolution at oil firms\u2019 AGMs", "lead": "Asset management firms accused of sacrificing climate action by voting against shareholder resolution at Chevron and ExxonMobil", "author": "Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626555", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a4726e3c16151c13220e98ab4884c17553d83558/0_182_6609_3965/500.jpg", "body": "Some of the UK\u2019s largest investors have backtracked on their support for a shareholder resolution that would force the big oil companies to cut their carbon emissions, according to a campaign group. Asset managers at Legal &amp; General, abrdn and Janus Henderson voted against the climate resolutions put forward by Follow This, a Dutch shareholder activist group, at the annual general meetings of the US oil companies Chevron and ExxonMobil this year, having voted in favour of them in previous years. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, claimed that the investors had chosen to sacrifice climate action in favour of \u201cshort-term profits\u201d, which have rocketed after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year. Van Baal said: \u201cThis is a false dilemma: shareholders can enjoy dividends from oil and gas while oil majors invest these profits in renewables to drive down emissions at the same time. Taking short-term fossil fuel profits and addressing long-term climate risks are not mutually exclusive.\u201d Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) said it rejected the claim that it had chosen short-term profits over its commitment to climate action. It said: \u201cTo the end of May 2023, LGIM had supported 70% of shareholder resolutions on climate, and will be voting against almost 300 company directors for not meeting our climate expectations. We are supportive of the basic principles of the Follow This proposal, but still have concerns about the text of the 2023 proposals.\u201d A spokesperson for LGIM did not clarify the company\u2019s specific concerns when approached. Follow This has targeted all leading oil and gas companies with a shareholder resolution calling on their boards to cut their emissions in line with the scale of reductions required by the Paris climate agreement. The 2015 accords call for all countries to limit their emissions in order to stop global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels by 2050. Many oil companies intend to increase the amount of oil and gas they produce until 2030. Andrew Mason, the head of active ownership at abrdn, said the investor had reservations about the implications of shareholder climate resolutions because they were raised separately from financial statements or annual report and accounts. Mason said: \u201cThis can sever the fundamental link between the climate and corporate strategy, risking a lack of robust governance procedures for all vital strategic decisions. Additionally, the full evaluation of climate strategies demands significant resource; over a short period, this could lead to asset managers outsourcing responsibilities for evaluation.\u201d HSBC Asset Management was the only large UK investor to continue its backing of the Follow This resolution, Van Baal said. The asset manager voted in favour at the shareholder meetings for BP, Shell, France\u2019s Total Energies, as well as Chevron and ExxonMobil.

Experts said \u201cinhumane\u201d waits are putting a generation of neurodiverse children at risk of mental illness as they are \u201cpushed to the back of a very long queue\u201d for children and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). UK children with suspected neurodevelopmental conditions faced an average waiting time of one year and four months for an initial screening in 2022, more than three times longer than the average wait for all Camhs services, according to research carried out by the House magazine and shared with the Guardian. Half of all trusts responding to a freedom of information request had an average wait of at least a year, and at one-sixth of trusts it was more than two years. The Nice guidance for autism and mental health services stipulates that no one should wait longer than 13 weeks between being referred and first being seen. The research also revealed a postcode lottery. Children with suspected ADHD in Belfast are waiting an average of five years for an initial appointment, and the longest wait for neurodevelopmental treatment was seven years. The longest wait for a child in Oxford was five years and 14 weeks. Coventry and Warwickshire had the worst record in England \u2013 an average wait of 142 weeks for all neuro first appointments. An Oxford health trust spokesperson said: \u201cThe number and complexity of referrals to our services have increased significantly and our funding has not increased.\u201d Henry Shelford, the CEO and co-founder of ADHD UK, said people with ADHD were at greater risk of taking their own lives, with 24% of females and 10% of males with ADHD attempting to do so. \u201cYet we are hearing again and again that unless a child is at serious risk of harm they are not a priority, they are pushed to the back of a very long queue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inhumane to make children wait until they are suicidal before helping them.\u201d He said children\u2019s futures were being blighted by a lack of diagnosis and help. \u201cDiagnosis can bring enlightenment, essential support and legal protection to help these children negotiate their way through life,\u201d Shelford said. \u201cDenying them this is the casual cruelty of the system. It leaves them vulnerable to crime, poor mental health, addiction and family breakdown.\u201d The House asked 74 UK trusts about waiting times for children with suspected neurodevelopmental conditions: 58 responded, with 31 providing figures for 2022. Twelve said they did not collect the data and many were unable to file complete figures on all questions, said the publication. The figures collected showed referrals rose by 226% between 2017 and 2022. New NHS data has revealed that across all age groups 140,000 people were waiting for an autism assessment in England in December 2022 \u2013 a 40% increase in one year. Dr Elaine Lockhart, the chair of the child and adolescent psychiatry faculty for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said regional inequalities were letting families down. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be that huge variation from one child to another of how long they are waiting. In some areas it does seem to come down to how they are managed,\u201d she said. She added that Scotland and Wales now had \u201cnational service specifications\u201d for children with neurodevelopmental conditions, which set out seven standards of care for neurodivergent children, while NHS England did not. \u201cIf we don\u2019t understand what the problem is, we can\u2019t track change. We should be learning from areas that are doing this well,\u201d she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said integrated care boards and NHS trusts were responsible for commissioning services for autistic people and people with ADHD in line with Nice guidelines. \u201cWe know how vital it is to have timely diagnoses for ADHD and autism and we are committed to reducing diagnosis delays and improving access to support. We\u2019ve made \u00a34.2m available this year to improve services for autistic children and young people,\u201d the spokesperson said. The shadow mental health minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, said Labour would bring down waiting times by recruiting more staff and putting specialist support in schools. \u201cIt is a damning indictment of over a decade of Conservative government neglect of our public services that young people are waiting years for a vital autism or ADHD assessment,\u201d she said. \u201cGrowing waiting lists are failing patients and damaging children\u2019s futures.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d877d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/jul/17/hoovering-up-the-canapes-like-zuck-picking-up-twitter-users-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hoovering up the canapes like Zuck picking up Twitter users: Edith Pritchett\u2019s week in Venn diagrams ", "lead": "Let the battle begin \u2026", "author": "Edith Pritchett", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626592", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ed0faf81d7587956c105c956457da131ad9de995/170_9_1633_980/500.jpg", "body": ""}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d877e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/weather-apps-addiction-climate-crisis-anxiety", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018We used to check every day, now it\u2019s every minute\u2019: how we got addicted to weather apps", "lead": "As unprecedented weather leads to increasing climate anxiety, there\u2019s a raft of different apps catering for every kind of forecast", "author": "Hannah Marriott", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626611", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9cd9aeb5414215b63ae40905e036c32591de4ea4/248_1026_3925_2355/500.jpg", "body": "One day in 2020, close to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Matt Rickett realized he was checking weather apps all the time. He immediately understood why: \u201cEverything felt so unpredictable, so out of control,\u201d he says. \u201cJust knowing that something was going to happen, tomorrow, that people said was gonna happen, was reassuring.\u201d The next year Rickett, who lives in Austin, Texas, decided to stop using social media: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the control it had over my life,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I still had the energy, the need to look at my phone, for some reason. So I got even more into weather.\u201d He checks apps roughly every couple of hours. After much trial and error, he\u2019s decided he likes Weather Underground and Forca the best. He also uses apps\u2019 radar functions to try to track storms and precipitation. When he boards a plane, he checks the flight path using radar, too, so he has a better sense of whether to expect a bumpy landing. The temperature in Austin has been in the 110s Fahrenheit (40s Celsius) for weeks; he\u2019ll keep checking the apps, even when he knows no change is likely. Or else he looks at the weather in other places, where it is less hot, and he has family, and will think: \u201cOh, maybe I can just go there for a little bit.\u201d It\u2019s behavior that Jess Green, who lives in Liverpool, England, might relate to. During last summer\u2019s unprecedented heatwave in the UK, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of talk of: \u2018will we make it to 40C?\u2019 I kept checking in the hope that we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She would watch the numbers rise on her app, with trepidation, and would then feel relieved to see them peak, thinking: \u201cwe\u2019re on our way down; and things haven\u2019t burst into flames.\u201d She would check different locations. \u201cI would think: so it\u2019s not a record temperature in Liverpool today. That\u2019s great. But what about London?\u201d She has three weather apps on her smartphone, but recently a widget has started popping up, unbidden, on Microsoft Edge on her computer. \u201cIt asks: \u2018do you want to know about record temperatures today?\u2019\u201d Then a quiz appears, asking whether the day\u2019s temperature is above or below average, historically. \u201cThat has made my obsession quite a lot worse,\u201d she says. In many ways, she points out, it would be odd not to feel anxious, given the climate emergency. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit like the pandemic. It\u2019s unprecedented, so it\u2019s hard to tell if your anxiety is proportional to the threat you\u2019re feeling.\u201d Preoccupation with weather apps is commonplace in our current unsettled atmosphere. On social media there is almost as much chat about weather apps as there is about the weather: much of it is ire about inaccurate forecasts; some of it is from users who admit checking weather apps more than seems logical. There is still palpable grief, in the wake of the closure of the short-term weather prediction app Dark Sky, late last year, after its acquisition by Apple. In April, when Apple\u2019s weather app went down, there was such outrage that the temporary glitch became an international news story. Fifty per cent of US smartphone users regularly use weather apps; according to Statista, weather apps will make approximately $1.5bn in revenue in 2023, a leap from $530m in 2017. Jeremiah Lasquety-Reyes, a senior analyst for Statista, says this new weather app ecosystem is only going to grow, owing to the climate crisis, as well as a general trend towards \u201cdigitizing one\u2019s life and schedule\u201d. There are certainly plenty out there, catering to a variety of needs: more than 10,000 apps have the word \u201cweather\u201d in the title in Android and iPhone app stores. Jennifer Simms lives in Texas where, she says, \u201cit\u2019s fucking hot, girl. It\u2019s soul-sucking.\u201d One of her favorite apps is called What the Forecast??! and provides light relief on sweltering hot days with forecasts that read, along with the temperature: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look. I\u2019m fairly sure the thermometer just says: \u2018Satan\u2019s butthole\u2019.\u201d You can understand why Simms might appreciate a bit of gallows humor, having lived through two tornadoes, including one which \u201cblew out all the windows in the back of my house. Little shards of glass stuck in the walls. It was hard.\u201d She has also experienced storms with baseball-sized hailstones which \u201ccreamed everybody\u2019s cars \u2013 mine was totalled,\u201d she says. Simms is 65; when she was in her 40s and 50s, she says, she didn\u2019t care about the weather at all. Now she checks three apps, watches storms on their radar functions, is signed up to severe weather notifications from the National Weather Service and watches the weather on TV. \u201cFrom March through to October, I\u2019m a weather channel whore,\u201d she says. Her primary concern is keeping her car safe from hail. The climate crisis fuels her anxiety. \u201cOur weather is so crazy now,\u201d she says, of the recent 116F (46C) Texas weather. She adds that poor infrastructure means that there are no longer tornado sirens in her town, so extreme alerts on her phone are a matter of survival. Weather apps with personality are a burgeoning subsection of the market. One, Carrot Weather \u2013 which, like Dark Sky before it, has an ardent social media fanbase \u2013 also aims to lighten the mood. (\u201cJesus fire-breathing Christ, it\u2019s sunny,\u201d read my forecast, one bright Wednesday when it was 86F (30C) in Brooklyn.) People like \u201cthe unexpectedness of it\u201d, says the app\u2019s developer, Brian Mueller. He makes a point of including jokes that \u201cpoke fun at climate change deniers\u201d. There is also a considerable element of gamification: users can unlock \u201cachievements\u201d, many of which involve living through terrible weather \u2013 three days straight of rain or a day with a dangerously high UV index. The premium version has maps, radars, notifications, widgets and a lot of customisation capability, as well as a weather time machine, enabling users to check the weather, on this day, in their location, as far back as 1930. Weather apps offer multiple data points, from the timings of sunrise and sunset, to phases of the moon, to local pollen levels. Some feel increasingly important as the weather gets worse, like the \u201cfeels like\u201d stat, which estimates how unbearable, or otherwise, the heat really is, taking variables including humidity and wind into account, or air quality index maps that much of the east coast became glued to during the Dune-like hazy days of smoke from Canadian wildfires. Sometimes these data points can feel a little bit vague. What the Forecast??! has a \u201cbee index\u201d, as well as indices for swimming, cold and flu, campfires, sinus, golf and arthritis, though precisely what those indices mean is not always immediately clear, nor are their sources cited. To some extent this boom of information is reflective of real developments in the meteorology world. Eric Floehr, the CEO and founder of ForecastWatch, a company which analyzes the accuracy of weather forecasts, says forecasts are more accurate now than ever before, and they update more often, too \u2013 some as frequently as every 15 minutes. \u201cSo that\u2019s more relevant and timely. And because it\u2019s more relevant and timely, you want to look at it more,\u201d he says. Floehr, who lives in Ohio, \u201cobsessively\u201d checks one app, RadarScope, for tornados when there are nearby storms. He says a recent boom in accessibility and real-time access to radar technology has played a huge role in the boom. Dark Sky was a pioneer of \u201cradar tribulation\u201d \u2013 looking at a radar image and a storm\u2019s velocity to predict when it will arrive \u2013 which felt like magic to many when they first used it. It also made weather forecasting feel like a news feed to be followed. \u201cThey were one of the first \u2018always-on apps\u2019,\u201d says Floehr. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just check once a day, you checked every minute.\u201d Little wonder that weather apps may be getting some people hooked. Anna Lembke, the psychiatrist and author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence, says weather apps are very attractive to our dopamine-seeking brains. \u201cNot just the quantification but also the way that those numbers are displayed, the graphs and the charts. The brain has a way of really glomming onto numbers,\u201d she says. It is perhaps ironic, then, that even as many become highly attached to weather apps, the question of whether they actually work very well remains unclear. Many say that it is merely our hyperawareness of the weather \u2013 our heightened expectations of accuracy now that we have an hour-by-hour forecasts in our hands \u2013 that gives the impression that forecasts are getting worse. Even today, with more sophisticated weather forecasts than we have ever had before, there are things forecasting models don\u2019t do well, including long- and medium-term predictions of \u201cconvective thunderstorms\u201d, and predicting \u201cprecipitation amounts, especially with snow\u201d. Forecasts are also better at \u201cclimatologically normal\u201d forecasts, rather than at predicting extremes, Floehr says. And in certain areas, where there is a microclimate, or less radar coverage, they are less likely to be accurate. Many meteorologists say they won\u2019t use apps, however; they advise checking the National Weather Service\u2019s website as a first port of call. Though many apps use the same data as the National Weather Service, it is often unclear which parts of the data they use, and how their models tweak it. There is an argument, too, that presenting the weather largely as a series of numbers, or symbols, is an oversimplification that confuses the average smartphone user (for example: some see 50% next to a rain cloud on an app and think it will be raining for 50% of the day, but, as a human meteorologist delivering a forecast would explain, it actually means that there is a 50% chance of precipitation). Even if they are, occasionally, a bit inaccurate, says Green, checking them feels like it helps. \u201cIt definitely gives you a sense of control.\u201d After three years of lockdowns and canceled plans, wildfires, storms and heatwaves no wonder many of us are frequently checking weather apps, out of fear, out of hope, acutely aware of the rarity of perfect conditions. Perhaps it\u2019s no bad thing. \u201cI think people are more in tune,\u201d says Floehr. \u201cThey see that the weather is becoming more extreme. Hopefully that will result in action. But for now, at least, it\u2019s resulting in interest.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d877f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/17/country-diary-a-great-migration-at-my-feet", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Country diary: A great migration at my feet | Mark Cocker", "lead": "<strong>Buxton, Derbyshire:</strong> I moved with tai-chi-like slowness among the grass, which seethed with tens of thousands of baby frogs and toads", "author": "Mark Cocker", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:30:18", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626629", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9552cd30501a6ed28dca2fe5ca45ffafe8f598/0_142_3283_1971/500.jpg", "body": "The largest of the four ponds at Lightwood reservoir has consistently held the highest numbers of spawning frogs and toads in the last few springs. Yet once the tadpoles are metamorphosed, they are obliged to leave the water or drown, and their exodus is thus as urgent as it is challenging. Last week I estimated that the whole migration involved tens of thousands. There were particular bottlenecks where dozens of them were gathered briefly in confusion. Everywhere along the path encircling the pond \u2013 and even in any grass patch that I bothered to scrutinise \u2013 were amphibians measuring about 1cm each. A single breeding female toad or frog averages 6,000 or 4,000 eggs respectively. Were all to survive to adulthood, I guess we would reach the plague numbers of the Book of Exodus. Even so, it was moving to see the snot-like dribbles of black on grass stems, or what looked like gnarls of tar squirted on to stone, and realise how many were already lost before they had begun. Never have I been more aware of the gross nature of my human condition, and I manoeuvred with tai-chi-like slowness to avoid crushing a single one. I lowered on to a gritstone seat and held a crouching vigil until it was painful, not daring even to adjust a foot or hand without checking for consequences. Waiting to see who passed through the grass-stem forest was the best and most affecting way to intercept their momentous odyssey. I learned subsequently that, contrary to appearances of the full adult stage, the all-dark ones were toadlets, while the more golden, black-patterned individuals were baby frogs. Each had lungs no more than a gnat\u2019s width and perfect wart-smothered limbs as frangible as soft rush stems. Yet with luck and time a toadlet can grow in size and condition to swallow mice whole, or live beneath the doorstep of a naturalist\u2019s house (Thomas Pennant) for 36 years. Even stranger to contemplate is the baby frog, whose destiny, when full grown and having passed through the neural pathways of a Nobel laureate (Seamus Heaney), was to cause the death of a naturalist, and survive in poetic form. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8780", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/17/womens-world-cup-fifa-rainbow-armband-ban-football-australia", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football Australia boss criticises Fifa ban on rainbow armbands at Women\u2019s World Cup", "lead": "James Johnson expresses disappointment at Fifa\u2019s refusal to allow players to wear rainbow armbands during the 2023 tournament", "author": "Kieran Pender in Brisbane", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:13:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626647", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3f08250cf229396cd0c6de7323efc442f13bcad6/95_0_4345_2608/500.jpg", "body": "Football Australia\u2019s chief executive, James Johnson, has expressed disappointment at Fifa\u2019s refusal to allow players to wear rainbow armbands during the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, which begins on Thursday. Fifa recently confirmed players wearing a rainbow armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights would face on-field sanctions, such as yellow cards, as was the case at last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar. Instead, Fifa has invited players to choose from eight Fifa-sanctioned armbands highlighting social causes including \u201cpeace\u201d, \u201czero hunger\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d. Speaking in Brisbane on Monday while the Matildas trained, Johnson said the armband options did not go as far as players had hoped. \u201cRainbow armbands \u2013 we were at the table for that discussion, with countries like England, Sweden, the Netherlands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was important to us and we wanted to solve the issue before it became an issue, because we know there were issues as the World Cup in Qatar was kicking off. \u201cWe welcome the framework that Fifa has put in place, because it\u2019s broad and it allows players to select an issue that they care about. On the other hand, though, we do acknowledge that they didn\u2019t go as far and specifically focus on LGBTQI.\u201d Johnson said FA and the Matildas were \u201caligned\u201d in their position. \u201cWe do have to recognise that there was movement made since the last World Cup and we welcome that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think where the conversation started to where it ended, there was definitely improvement. I think we\u2019ve landed in a place that\u2019s acceptable, but having said that it didn\u2019t go as far as what we would have liked.\u201d The FA boss also hinted the governing body was weighing up bids for other major Fifa tournaments, off the back of what is expected to be a successful event over the coming month. \u201cThe focus right now is on ensuring this Women\u2019s World Cup is the best Women\u2019s World Cup we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIn Australia alone I think we can get close to 1m tickets sold \u2013 the KPI was 1.5m for the whole tournament. We\u2019re well on our way to hitting that mark.\u201d Johnson listed the 2029 edition of the revamped Fifa Club\u2019s World Cup and the 2034 men\u2019s World Cup as potential options. The FA is also bidding for the 2026 Women\u2019s Asian Cup. \u201cThe men\u2019s World Cup is an obvious one \u2013 one day Australia will bid again, I\u2019m absolutely sure of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there have also been new competitions established by Fifa that I think we need to look at.\u201d Johnson, who has previously held senior roles at the Asian Football Confederation, Fifa and Manchester City, batted away a question about whether he would apply for the Fifa secretary-general role. The position will soon be vacant after the incumbent, Fatma Samoura, announced she was stepping down, but Johnson insisted he was focused on delivering a successful Women\u2019s World Cup."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8781", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/14/banksy-voice-story-podcast-bbc-radio-4-fwiw", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Podcast claims it may have first recording of Banksy\u2019s voice", "lead": "A 2005 radio clip from a man claiming to be the artist is \u2018a bit of a find\u2019, according to a new BBC series", "author": "Alexi Duggins", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:09:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626665", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/94feb161fec59ae9f0f3cdfc40c7e6f8cf49c6ee/0_1037_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Mystery has shrouded the entire career of the street artist Banksy, but a new BBC podcast and Radio 4 series may just have revealed something about him: his voice. The Banksy Story features a 2005 recording that has only ever been broadcast in the US, and which, according to the show, is \u201ca bit of a find\u201d. The clip is from the All Things Considered news show on the NPR (National Public Radio) station, which was broadcast on 24 March \u2013 a few days after the artist exhibited his own work in the Met, AKA New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cWe assume that you are who you say you are, but how can we be sure?\u201d asks the host, to which the person claiming to be Banksy retorts: \u201cOh, you have no guarantee of that at all.\u201d The three-minute interview features the supposed voice of the artist claiming to see himself as a \u201cpainter and decorator\u201d, who explains his penchant for gluing his artworks to the walls of institutions such as the Louvre because: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get stuck in the same line of work your whole life long, do you?\u201d He claims that his aim with exhibiting his work in the Met was for it to stay on display for 42 days, based on a supposed incident in which he believes they once accidentally hung a work by Henri Matisse upside down for that length of time. Comparing his work to Matisse is clearly not an issue for the interviewee. \u201cI mean, I thought some of them were quite good, that\u2019s why I thought: put them in a gallery,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019d just stay at home and no one would see them. If you wait for other people to latch on to what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019d be waiting for ever.

But this was clearly not the case in 2005, judging by the outro to the interview. \u201cBut what you\u2019re doing is illegal!\u201d challenges the host. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it good fun,\u201d he retorts. \u201cYou can\u2019t make an omelette [without breaking some eggs], can you? But it\u2019s not in my interests to get arrested very often. It\u2019s all about keeping going as long as you can. So, yeah, you have to think about these things. That\u2019s the thing: mindless vandalism takes a lot more thought than most people would imagine.\u201d While it\u2019s not certain that the interviewee is Banksy, the host of the BBC show certainly sounds excited. \u201cIs this Banksy\u2019s actual, actual voice?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 but if it is him, it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever heard him!\u201d The Banksy Story is available now on BBC Radio 4."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8782", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/17/more-betting-firm-logos-in-televised-football-games-than-thought-study-finds-premier-league", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Betting firm logos shown on TV up to 3,500 times in Premier League matches, study finds", "lead": "Average was once every 16 seconds across 10 matches last season, with a total of 3,522 in West Ham v Chelsea", "author": "Rob Davies", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:00:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626685", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/656c832e1c68c5baa8adaedffde3ef0033342310/15_141_2944_1768/500.jpg", "body": "Betting company logos appear as often as 3,500 times during the course of a televised football match, the majority on pitchside hoardings, prompting renewed scepticism about top-flight clubs\u2019 plan to give up front-of-shirt betting ads only. A study led by psychology experts from four universities measured the volume of gambling adverts during 10 matches that took place last season, featuring every Premier League club. West Ham v Chelsea featured by far the most betting logos, a total of 3,522, or 37 for every minute of the game. The figure was particularly high because of West Ham\u2019s deal with the online bookmaker and casino firm Betway, whose logo is plastered around the club\u2019s home, the London Stadium. According to the analysis, the average game featured a gambling logo every 16 seconds. The study, which also looked at cryptocurrency and financial trading adverts, found that digital pitchside hoardings were by far the most common location for company logos, accounting for more than half of those seen during a game. By contrast, team shirts accounted for only 6.9% of visible gambling logos. Premier League football clubs agreed a ban on front-of-shirt betting sponsors earlier this year. The voluntary measure does not kick in until 2026 and will still allow firms to advertise on shirt sleeves, pitchside hoardings and other sites around a stadium. The Big Step, which campaigns for football clubs to cut ties with the betting industry, said the study showed football clubs were not taking gambling\u2019s links to addiction, financial problems and suicide seriously enough. \u201cThis disgusting level of gambling advertising around football stadiums is a national shame and shows why removing the ads from shirts is nowhere near enough,\u201d a spokesperson for the group said. \u201cEvery one of those 3,500 nudges to gamble is a potential hook into addiction for young fans, their parents and even players. The harm gambling advertising causes is no longer ignorable; the government needs to step in and end all gambling advertising in football.\u201d The Premier League declined to comment. Betting industry representatives have repeatedly said there is no evidence of links between advertising in football and addiction, but multiple studies have drawn a connection between sponsorship and participation, including \u201cproblem\u201d gambling. Football\u2019s heavy promotion of betting has become increasingly controversial in the light of high-profile cases of players with a gambling addiction. The Brentford striker Ivan Toney was banned from the game for eight months earlier this year after placing bets on games, including some in which he played. The ban was reduced to eight months after the Football Association took his gambling addiction into account. Nine Premier League teams including Toney\u2019s Brentford will have a gambling company\u2019s logo on their shirts in the 2023-24 season, either as the main shirt sponsor or on the sleeves. Clubs including Aston Villa have signed new gambling deals this season despite the looming ban in 2026, although Chelsea pulled out of a shirt sponsorship with the controversial cryptocurrency gambling firm Stake.com after pressure from fans\u2019 groups. The study, led by Jamie Torrance of the University of Chester, analysed gambling, cryptocurrency and financial trading logos in football. Betway was the most featured gambling brand in football, accounting for 31.2% of visible logos, while Stake topped the crypto league with 28% and FBS was the most widely displayed financial trading logo. Only 4.4% of gambling logos were accompanied by some form of harm reduction content, such as messages advising greater caution when gambling. West Ham\u2019s home game against Chelsea featured the most gambling advertising, with 3,522 appearances, while Arsenal\u2019s match against Nottingham Forest featured the fewest, with 219. Cryptocurrency was most visible at Wolverhampton Wanderers v Brighton, with 1,682 appearances, and least visible at Fulham v Liverpool, where a crypto logo was shown only once. Manchester City v Aston Villa featured the most financial trading logos, 832, while Everton\u2019s game against Southampton and Brentford v Bournemouth included none. The study used a different methodology from a previous study that found gambling logos appeared 700 times in a game. The previous study counted the appearance of one company\u2019s logo on screen only once, even if it appeared multiple times. The new study counted each iteration."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8783", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/the-underground-crimean-tatar-group-taking-up-arms-against-russia", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The underground Crimean Tatar group taking up arms against Russia", "lead": "The Atesh guerrilla group is active behind Russian lines, and leaders of the Indigenous movement say they are ready if they can get the weapons", "author": "Julian Borger in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:00:18", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626705", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b9a63520354a45fb70b754baf1d7b01515a6c628/0_274_5968_3581/500.jpg", "body": "A Crimean Tatar-led underground movement is already active behind Russian lines and hundreds of young Tatar men are ready to take up arms to liberate the occupied peninsula, a veteran community leader has said. Mustafa Dzemilev, widely seen as the godfather of the Crimean Tatar rights movement, pointed to operations by the Atesh guerrilla group, comprising Crimean Tatars, Ukrainians and Russians, in Crimea and other occupied Ukrainian regions. Atesh, which means \u201cfire\u201d in Crimean Tatar, was created in September last year, primarily to carry out acts of sabotage from within the ranks of the Russian army. It claims more than 4,000 Russian soldiers have already enrolled in an online course on how to \u201csurvive the war\u201d by wrecking their own equipment. There is no evidence linking the group to the latest attack on the Kerch Bridge, early on Monday morning, but the group has claimed a string of smaller-scale attacks, blowing up Russian checkpoints, assassinating Russian officers, setting fire to barracks and feeding sensitive information to Ukrainian intelligence. It recently accused Russian sappers of laying mines in the Krymskyi Titan chemical works in Armiansk, northern Crimea. An explosion there could spread an ammonia cloud across the land bridge between the peninsula and mainland Ukraine. \u201cAtesh is very deep underground,\u201d Dzhemilev, 79, told the Guardian in an interview in Kyiv. \u201cThere was not a single arrest among Atesh members, but they are working inside Crimea territory blowing up targets.\u201d Dzemilev said the 300,000-strong Crimean Tatar community had been the focus of resistance to Russian occupation since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea, not least because of its experience under Moscow\u2019s rule. The Crimean Tatars are the Turkic-speaking native people of Crimea, absorbed by the Mongol Golden Horde in the 13th century. They adopted Islam and broke away as the powerful Crimean Khanate in the 15th century. After Russian annexation in 1783, the process of persecution and expulsion began under imperial rule, and it was continued under the Soviet Union. In 1944, Stalin deported the entire Crimean Tatar population, mostly to Uzbekistan, including Dzemilev\u2019s family, when he was six months old. As a human rights activist, he spent years under surveillance and in penal colonies. He is no longer the chairman of the Crimean Tatar assembly, the Mejlis, but remains a member of parliament and the pre-eminent elder of the community. On 12 March 2014, two weeks after Russian soldiers wearing no insignia seized strategic points in Crimea and four days before a \u201creferendum\u201d was held on the peninsula to endorse its \u201cindependence\u201d, Vladimir Putin spoke to Dzemilev by phone. \u201cHe told me he saw Crimean Tatars as pacifists and he hoped there would be no violence,\u201d Dzemilev recalled of the 45-minute conversation. \u201cI told him, wait a minute, it\u2019s non-violence when you are defending your civil rights in your own country. But when an enemy\u2019s boot steps on your land, that\u2019s a completely different matter.\u201d Dzhemilev said Crimean Tatars are bearing the brunt of the Russian occupation. They account for 13% of the peninsula\u2019s population, but he said 85% of political arrests and illegal searches were targeted against them. Crimean Tatar activists have disproportionately been the victims of kidnapping and disappearances. Dzemilev said 49 activists were missing and only eight of their bodies had been found so far. Political leaders and dozens of activists have been jailed. Despite the level of control and persecution, Dzemilev said if Crimean Tatars felt liberation was close, the ranks of the partisans would grow significantly. \u201cAt the current moment, around 1,000 young men are ready to take up arms as soon as the Ukrainian army arrives, if they are able to get the weapons,\u201d he said. Refat Chubarov, the current Mejlis chairman, warned against outside powers seeking to negotiate the future of Crimea without the participation of its Indigenous people. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another Yalta,\u201d Chubarov told the Guardian, referring to the 1945 meeting in the Crimean summer resort, where Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill accepted Joseph Stalin\u2019s assurances that democratic elections would be allowed in eastern European countries. Chubarov said there were \u201cthousands\u201d of Crimean Tatars ready to fight any attempt to leave their homeland under prolonged Russian occupation. The Ukrainian counteroffensive is under way and Kyiv\u2019s forces are making territorial gains, but are still far from the formidable fortifications Russian forces have built along the road to Crimea. The region\u2019s liberation does not appear imminent, and even if Ukraine suddenly makes a breakthrough and reached Crimea, some of Kyiv\u2019s backers in Washington and a few European capitals are nervous at the prospect of Russian occupation forces being driven out, lest it makes Putin desperate enough to use a nuclear bomb or some other weapon of mass destruction. As with Russian volunteers fighting with Ukrainian support on Russian territory, the military role of the Crimean Tatars as a highly motivated partisan force would be a way to put Moscow under additional pressure without alarming allies. \u201cThe Crimean Tatars are of extreme importance in the future liberation of Crimea, from the ideological, political and other points of view,\u201d the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. \u201cThey are very active and effective in terms of the preparation for the future liberation of Crimea. Dzemilev and Chubarov are actively cooperating with the presidential office and Ukrainian central government in those preparations. \u201cCrimean Tatars are serving in the armed services of Ukraine and take an active role in partisan operations in Crimea. There is quite a wide network within Crimea right now, that is very useful. Certain incidents are happening there that are proof of that.\u201d After liberation, Crimean Tatars will be seeking greater recognition, including a constitutional change that would make Crimea a \u201cnational republic\u201d in which they, as the Indigenous people, would have special status. Dzemilev said the creation of such a republic would be irrespective of whatever role his community plays in liberation. On that score, however, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s government has made no specific assurances. \u201cIn wartime it is forbidden to change the constitution,\u201d Tamila Tasheva, a Crimean Tatar activist who currently serves as the president\u2019s permanent representative to Crimea, said in an interview in Kyiv. \u201cThere is a lot of talk about the status of Crimea after liberation, but right now there is no final decision. Right now, this question is on hold.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8784", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/fame-makes-you-paranoid-michael-cera-on-barbie-drunk-fans-and-not-owning-a-smartphone", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Fame makes you paranoid\u2019: Michael Cera on Barbie, drunk fans \u2013 and not owning a smartphone", "lead": "In 2007, the success of Superbad and Juno made Cera a celebrity, and it was such a shock that he almost gave up acting altogether.

The new and much-anticipated Barbie film resurrects Allan, along with Midge, the girlfriend who later became his wife. Allan made a couple of comebacks over the decades, but in the real-life history of the Barbie doll \u2013 58m of which are still sold each year \u2013 he remains a minor character. \u201cSomewhat of a marginalised figure,\u201d says Michael Cera, who plays him in the film. \u201cIt turned out people didn\u2019t need to go deeper into Ken\u2019s world.\u201d An Allan doll, which the actor bought on eBay, sat in the hair and makeup room, as inspiration and \u201ca sort of mascot, until after shooting, when I took him home\u201d, says Cera. \u201cI definitely wanted to have my own Allan.\u201d He has a broken sandal, says Cera, with a touch of sadness, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 he\u2019s like 60 years old or something\u201d. Cera jumped at the chance to be in the film. The script was fun, he says, and he loved the thought of working with Barbie and Ken \u2013 Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, a friend and fellow Canadian \u2013 and the indie director Greta Gerwig. \u201cI was desperate to be a part of it,\u201d he says, speaking over Zoom from his home in New York, before the Hollywood actors\u2019 strike. It is the most obviously commercial film Cera has made since the 2007 teen-virgin comedy Superbad. Still, despite the hype and its big budget, Barbie appears to have some arthouse sensibilities. Gerwig, who co-wrote as well as directed, had \u201cher stamp all over every single part of it\u201d, Cera says. He loved going on to the sets \u2013 Barbieland on a massive scale. \u201cI would stand there and marvel, and never got tired of looking around and finding new little details. It was one of the most stunning things I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The story is that Barbie leaves Barbieland and enters the Real World. Cera\u2019s other recent role, in the first episode of the new Black Mirror anthology series, also plays with the idea of the multiverse \u2013 in it, he plays a version of himself, in a world in which celebrities digitally license their faces for a computer-generated TV show. Cera has played himself several times, including in a YouTube sketch in which he is sacked from the film Knocked Up and the apocalypse comedy film This Is the End, and even a piece he wrote for the New Yorker. \u201cI think I\u2019m over it now,\u201d he says with a laugh, \u201cbut it can be fun.\u201d What appealed to him? He seems quiet and thoughtful \u2013 at best ambivalent about fame, at worst hostile. Maybe it was a way of putting distance between his real self and his celebrity self? But no, he says, it is just that the idea always seemed amusing. Maybe it feels more pertinent, now we are in the era of deepfakes and on the precipice of uncontrolled artificial intelligence (AI). Cera says he asked an AI service recently if we were living in a simulation and its reply was: \u2018It\u2019s totally likely that you are.\u2019\u201d The other thing that that Black Mirror episode said is that culture is becoming targeted at what we think we want to consume. Cera says he prefers to stumble across stuff, or hear from friends, not an algorithm. \u201cI think that things are a little too optimised,\u201d he says. \u201cEven with parenting\u201d \u2013 he has a young son \u2013 \u201cyou have a million questions when you have a new baby and you look online, and there\u2019s always some highly optimised answer about whatever problem you\u2019re having.\u201d He prefers the idea of muddling through, working it out for himself \u201cand not trying to do everything perfectly, and have everything become this sort of homogenised version. I kind of miss when things were a little sloppier.\u201d This goes back to what he had been saying earlier about the way Gerwig worked on Barbie \u2013 sequences that could have been done by animation or CGI were created with moving sets and puppetry, \u201ca throwback to that classic way of doing things, those special effects that are sort of a lost art, but there are still people that are brilliant at it\u201d. It\u2019s inevitable that computers are taking over, \u201cbut it definitely makes me appreciate things that are made by human beings a little more.\u201d Cera is 35 and must be one of the few millennials not to own a smartphone. I fire questions at him about how he survives. Google Maps? \u201cThat\u2019s the thing everybody always asks. I just figure it out ahead of time.\u201d Sometimes he draws a map. Social media? He doesn\u2019t do it. Endless photos? He bought himself a camera while his wife was pregnant and taught himself how to use it, \u201cand now I love that as a hobby\u201d. What about when he has a spare 30 seconds and desperately needs to save himself from agonising boredom? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Sometimes I\u2019ll just be bored.\u201d He laughs, as if it\u2019s no big deal. It gives him space to process things, he says. Checking email? He has a computer at home for that, \u201cand I waste a lot of time playing chess. It\u2019s completely got its tentacles in my brain, but at least I leave it at home.\u201d Does he look around at the rest of us, staring into our phones and feel sorry for us? He isn\u2019t judgmental, but says: \u201cI feel sorry for my son, I feel sorry for the world. I think it\u2019s getting very lonely.\u201d Sometimes he will look around the subway and \u201cdo a head count of how many people are looking at their phones and it makes me feel lonely. Even being with friends or with family, you\u2019re with someone you love and haven\u2019t seen in a while, and they\u2019re with their phone. It\u2019s like they left the room. I think it bums a lot of people out, honestly. I feel the loneliness creeping in.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t know how to survive, I say. Cera looks wise. \u201cThat\u2019s the triumph of the Apple corporation. It has done a good job of making people feel they can\u2019t exist without its product.\u201d Cera grew up in a suburb of Toronto, with an older and younger sister and \u201ca normal amount of Barbies in the house \u2013 a baseline of probably five\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have specific memories of playing with them, but says: \u201cWe played with everything that was around. They were just part of the texture of our life \u2013 everything is just this big soup of plastic on the floor.\u201d As a child, he started doing weekend drama classes, which he found fun and \u201csomething I really felt good doing, because I was pretty inept at a lot of other things\u201d. Encouraged by his teachers, he started getting jobs in adverts, then was in a children\u2019s show, but it felt casual, rather than a career path. There was never any pressure, he says, and he maintained a normal life at school with his friends, even if the jobs started getting bigger, such as a part in George Clooney\u2019s film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Cera was about 14 when he got a part in the TV comedy Arrested Development, playing George Michael Bluth, the son of the heir-apparent (played by Jason Bateman) to a dysfunctional family corporation. He and his mother would spend half the year in the US, \u201cand that was destabilising in a way, because we would be so far away from home, and away from school and my friends, and fall out of touch with everything. But I also loved it because I was so excited to be on the show. I was just thrilled by the people that I was getting to be around \u2013 that\u2019s always been one of the things I\u2019ve loved most.\u201d The show was a slow-burn success, so \u201cI always felt like we were just hanging by a thread and we always feared that we wouldn\u2019t get to keep making it.\u201d There was no danger Cera would become arrogant, even if that were in his nature. When he did find sudden fame in 2007, after Superbad and Juno, in which he played the boyfriend of a pregnant teen, he was 19 and it wasn\u2019t a particularly enjoyable experience. \u201cThat was sort of overwhelming,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to handle walking down the street. Fame makes you very uncomfortable in your own skin, and makes you paranoid and weird. There were lots of great things about it, and I met a lot of amazing people, but there\u2019s a lot of bad energies, too, ones that I was not equipped to handle.\u201d What does he mean by \u201cbad energies\u201d? \u201cDrunk people would be a classic example,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, if people are drunk, and they recognise you, and they\u2019re very enthusiastic, but it can be kind of toxic too. When you\u2019re a kid, people also feel they can kind of grab you \u2013 they\u2019re not that respectful of you or your physical space.\u201d At 19, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to respectfully establish my own boundaries.\u201d The weekend Superbad came out, Cera went to a bar with friends \u201cand it was a mistake. It was like a burning feeling the whole time, just like everybody was so aware of me.\u201d He is not complaining about it, more acknowledging that bigger fame was not necessarily right for him. Did he make a conscious effort to step away from more commercial projects? \u201cA little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a point where I wanted to stop taking jobs that would make me more famous.\u201d Around this time, he was asked to host Saturday Night Live and turned it down, to the dismay of his agents. \u201cI was kind of having a bit of a crisis \u2026 I was really not enjoying the level of heat.\u201d At one point, he says, \u201cI really didn\u2019t know if I was going to keep being an actor.\u201d But he had already signed up for Edgar Wright\u2019s 2010 film Scott Pilgrim vs The World, which essentially pulled him through. \u201cI was already committed to it, and went and did it, and obviously feel so grateful that that happened.\u201d He did a Kenneth Lonergan play, two films in Chile with the Chilean film-maker Sebasti\u00e1n Silva, co-created a YouTube comedy channel where he posted shorts he\u2019d written or directed, and joined an indie band. That period, he says, was about trying to work out what he wanted. \u201cI knew that it wasn\u2019t just like constantly fanning the flames to get bigger and bigger. I knew that wasn\u2019t really my goal. I think I wanted to be a working actor who can enjoy my day-to-day life, and the world that I\u2019ve created for myself. I think that was the overall thing I was trying to figure out.\u201d He seems to have succeeded. Cera has worked steadily, in lots of interesting projects, and with many of his heroes, including David Lynch and Harold Ramis; earlier, on Arrested Development, he was thrilled to work with David Cross, whose comedy Mr Show was a big part of his childhood. \u201cI\u2019m like the biggest fan of people,\u201d he says. He loved the British comedy Peep Show, and has been working on a project with its creators, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, which he hopes will get made. He is also trying to raise finance for a film he has written with two friends and hopes to direct. That other side, what he calls his \u201cday-to-day life\u201d, also seems fulfilling. He and his wife, Nadine, met in a bar in Paris, where she was studying and he was promoting Arrested Development. \u201cWe trip out about that all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unlikely that we would ever meet.\u201d She didn\u2019t know who Cera was. \u201cShe thought I was Swedish, until we spoke. I didn\u2019t know if she would speak English, and if we would even have a chance to talk, and it was very lucky that she did because we wouldn\u2019t have a son, we wouldn\u2019t have a relationship.\u201d Their son is nearly two and starting to talk. \u201cSometimes I think of myself as like an old man remembering this time, like this was the greatest time ever. I already feel the nostalgia that I\u2019m going to feel,\u201d says Cera, somewhat mournfully, then smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to shock yourself into being present and appreciating it, or something.\u201d He talks with overwhelming gratitude that he has been able to create a career he loves, but also to build a life alongside it. Take it from Allan \u2013 one day you\u2019re the hot new doll, the next you\u2019re discontinued. It\u2019s the real world that matters.

Heat pumps, which are powered by electricity and work rather like fridges in reverse, are considered the most efficient way for the UK to shift to low-carbon heating and away from the gas-fired boilers that heat the majority of homes. With gas prices still at high levels, heat pumps are cheaper to run than gas boilers, though more expensive to install, and could be cheaper still with further changes to the electricity market. At current rates, the UK has little chance of meeting the government\u2019s target of 600,000 heat pump installations a year by 2028. However, according to analysts from the MCS Charitable Foundation, which approves low-carbon certification standards, gearing up to do so could create 50,000 new jobs, up from only about 2,000 jobs in the industry today. The MCS report, titled Heat Pump Rollout in France and the UK 2023, called on the government to make heat pumps mandatory for all new homes, scale up and extend grants to install heat pumps in existing homes, introduce new loan schemes for homeowners, and embark on a countrywide awareness campaign to explain heat pumps and the incentives on offer. The existing boiler upgrade scheme must be extended to be effective, the report said, and ministers must bring in the long-awaited future homes standard from 2025, with a clear end-date for the sales of gas boilers. David Cowdrey, the director of external affairs at MCS, said: \u201cHeat pumps are an extremely efficient technology for cutting carbon and bills, but the UK has so far not capitalised on their potential. With other countries such as France surging ahead, the race is on for the UK to step up. We need a much more comprehensive set of policy measures to meet the government\u2019s targets.\u201d The UK\u2019s market for heat pumps grew by about 40% in 2022, but from a very low base, with only 1.9 heat pumps installed for every 1,000 households last year, compared with 20 for every 1,000 households in France, and nearly 70 in Finland. MCS said it was not too late for the government to meet its targets, pointing to an 80% increase in France from 90,000 installations in 2018 to 175,0000 in 2019 after the introduction of a grant scheme available to all households. Jan Rosenow, the director of European programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project thinktank, said: \u201cLeading heat pump markets around the world have one thing in common: a stable and clear policy and regulatory landscape. If the policy package is right, consumer demand and industry investment follows, as experience from other countries shows very clearly. The UK can be a global leader on clean heating but this requires long-term policies to drive consumer demand and supply chain expansion.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cWe\u2019re investing billions to improve energy efficiency across the country, with over \u00a370m in vouchers issued to installers in the first year of our boiler upgrade scheme. We are fully confident of meeting our aim of 600,000 heat pump installations a year by 2028 \u2013 and consumers can now install one for an increasingly similar price to a gas boiler.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8786", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/17/eddie-joness-jumpstart-of-australian-rugby-remains-on-blocks-after-latest-defeat", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Eddie Jones\u2019s jumpstart of Australian rugby remains on blocks after latest defeat | Angus Fontaine", "lead": "The coach likened his team to a Datsun 1200 after the loss to Argentina but there is still grounds for optimism before they face the All Blacks", "author": "Angus Fontaine", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 03:51:56", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626759", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2eb2fd60691add0b282a94bc4076b41012e960/0_217_6516_3910/500.jpg", "body": "Michael Hooper arrived just in time to see the sticker-licker pin the parking ticket under his wiper. It was the captain\u2019s run on the eve of the Test against Argentina but Australia\u2019s co-captain hadn\u2019t run at all. Days before, in the Wallabies\u2019 43-12 walloping by South Africa in Pretoria, the 125-Test legend had tweaked a calf. It meant on the final lap of his storied career, Hooper would miss a home game farewell. With a rueful smile at the ticket, he copped it sweet \u2013 again. When your luck is out, your luck is out. What is sure to hurt Hooper more is the 34-31 loss to Los Pumas he watched from the sidelines on Saturday night. It is Australia\u2019s second straight defeat under new coach Eddie Jones, the first time they\u2019ve been beaten back-to-back by Argentina and their fifth successive defeat in the Rugby Championship, where they sit dead last in 2023. It drops the Wallabies to eighth in the world rankings 54 days out from the World Cup and keeps the much-ballyhooed Jones\u2019s jumpstart of Australian rugby on blocks. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re miles away from we need to be,\u201d a philosophical Jones said post-match, refusing to blame bad luck or the referee\u2019s failure to go to the TMO to confirm Argentina\u2019s controversial last-gasp try. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no-one more despondent than me right now\u2026 but all this is going to make us harder and more hungry to get it right. We\u2019re not where we should be, but we\u2019re on the right track. We\u2019ll get there.\u201d Jones is right. In a high-quality game against a formidable opposition, the Wallabies were harder and hungrier. They got a lot of things right and they are getting there. But will it be enough to fulfil the Jones mission: a smash and grab on the William Webb Ellis trophy come September? And can they make up those miles before they face off against the All Blacks on 29 July in Melbourne and 5 August in Dunedin? There were signs on Saturday night that it\u2019s possible. Last week, Australia were a rabble and the Springboks turned them to boerewors inside an hour. Against Argentina they were brave in defence and audacious in attack but dumb errors and poor composure hobbled them. But with 32% possession, it was a miracle they got as close to winning as they did. Still, Wallabies fans have grounds for optimism. Winger Mark Nawaqanitawase, the Waratahs wonderboy of Fijian and Italian parentage, had a blinder with his speed on the edges, enterprise in the middle and skill in the air. His late 90-metre intercept almost stole it. \u201cEvery time he got the ball, he lit the stadium up,\u201d Jones said. \u201cKids are jumping off the edge of their seats. He\u2019s that sort of player. Fantastic!\u201d Carter Gordon is also one of those players. Introduced early when Len Ikitau left with a broken shoulder, the Rebels flyhalf played inside-centre all night and made things happen every time he went near the ball, with a dervish display of try-saving tackles, sharp inside passes, goal-line intercepts and a 60-metre scoop and scamper that went within metres of delivering a match-winning touchdown. Yet Gordon will continue to play super-sub while Quade Cooper shows such sorcery. Calm in the clinches and defiant in defence, the veteran flyhalf\u2019s sublime hands and super boots were the key to Australia\u2019s improved attack. Cooper also slotted all five attempts at goal, set up two tries with cut-outs and support play and regularly dug his team out of trouble with huge reefing kicks into touch. If Jones wants \u201cattack that\u2019s unpredictable to the opposition\u201d then Cooper, even at 35, is the man to orchestrate it. Australia\u2019s forwards also found new gears. Will Skelton played his best running Test yet, Rory Arnold was dominant at the line out and Rob Valetini was an 80-minute wrecking ball. Into that improved set-piece, super troops are returning: Angus Bell made a welcome return as frontrow finisher, while his prop partner in crime, Taniela Tupou, is also primed to pack down against the All Blacks. Hooper too will be back, with Fraser McReight bottling his energy and menace from the bench. After a five-day turnaround (and a 1,336-metre drop in altitude) between his first two games, Jones has a fortnight to juggle his side for the twin Tests against the All Blacks. Ikitau is sidelined for eight weeks so Jordan Petaia must get his shot at inside-centre while Tom Wright\u2019s fullback jersey may be under threat from Andrew Kellaway. Sure, Saturday was a loss but it was a good one, gifting Jones more answers than questions. This Wallabies side, Jones reckons, is like his first car, a Datsun 1200. \u201cYou\u2019d fix the handbrake, next day the windscreen wipers would break.\u201d Jones has found some full-throttle stars. Now he must fix on a final 15 and panel-beat it into a purring gold speed wagon because the All Blacks don\u2019t issue parking tickets. They just run right over you."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8787", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/17/taylor-swift-becomes-first-woman-to-have-four-albums-in-us-top-10-at-once", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Taylor Swift becomes first woman to have four albums in US Top 10 at once", "lead": "Singer is just third artist in history to have four albums in top 10 concurrently, with Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) becoming her 12th album to reach No. 1", "author": "Sian Cain", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 03:24:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626777", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/af0cf31ae042e30422060fa3d827db693cc26107/15_0_3761_2257/500.jpg", "body": "Taylor Swift has become the first woman, and only the third artist ever, to have four albums in the Top 10 of the US album chart simultaneously, while also beating a record set by Barbra Streisand to become the female artist with the most No 1 albums in history.

The only other artist to have placed at least four titles in the Top 10 concurrently is Prince, who had five albums reach the Top 10 shortly after his death in 2016. Swift has now also surpassed Streisand as the female artist with the most No 1 albums in history, with the two women previously tied with 11 each.

The term, borrowed from Cory Doctorow, perfectly captures the trajectory of the major platforms, all of which provide a significantly crappier experience than they did even a few years back. As everyone knows, Elon Musk bought Twitter for a preposterous $44bn (seemingly to impress his rich-idiot buddies) and then set out destroying each and every feature its users actually liked. Since then, Reddit has cut off access to much-loved third-party apps, with its CEO Steve Huffman telling NBC that he saw in Musk\u2019s efforts \u201can example for Reddit\u201d. (He didn\u2019t quite shout \u201cFollow that lemming \u2013 it knows where it\u2019s going\u201d, but he might well have). As for Threads, Jason O Gilbert neatly summed up Meta\u2019s attempt to fish in Twitter\u2019s troubled waters as \u201ccasual Friday on LinkedIn\u201d. Determined to avoid the whiff of Weimar increasingly associated with his rival, Mark Zuckerberg has opted instead for corporate blandness, creating the social media equivalent of the music playing in a particularly respectable elevator. To date, Threads lacks Instagram and Facebook\u2019s intrusive, obsessive ad placement (where the algorithm assumes that because you bought a mattress once you\u2019re interested in nothing at all apart from bedding). Rest assured, though, it will be coming soon enough. We tend to think about media disruption as driven by technological innovation. But the enshittification of our socials shows that the tech itself plays a relatively minor role. Twitter launched in 2006; Facebook dates from 2004. In theory, the internet today can do all kinds of stuff that, back then, no one imagined possible. So why haven\u2019t the sites become correspondingly better, instead of, well, kind of merde? The problem, of course, pertains not to the technology but the ability \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of that technology to make someone money. \u201cBuild a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door.\u201d That\u2019s always been the mantra of capitalism\u2019s apologists. Their system, they say, fosters innovation, monetising (and thus encouraging) every advance in rodent extermination. In reality, the relationship between capital and technology has never been that simple. The profit motive traditionally stifles as many mousetraps as it nurtures them, even back when the economy offered something like a level playing field. Today, the dominance of ruthless monopolies in almost every industry means that innovations rarely get used to their full capability, at least not in ways that actually help people. We\u2019ve reached, you could say, the faecal stage of capitalism, an era of general shittification. Artificial intelligence provides another example. Had you demonstrated Chat GPT to, say, an audience of science fiction novelists circa 1961, they would have hailed a future of permanent leisure, in which suave robot butlers topped up the martinis while we humans debated existentialism and listened to free jazz in our bath robes. Nowadays, though, everyone knows that the wizardry of neural networks will simply make tomorrow like today, except slightly worse. The proliferation of AI-driven clickbait websites hints at what\u2019s coming, as entrepreneurs seize on the facility of natural language generators to amplify what David Graeber once called \u201cbullshit jobs\u201d. Spam emails, corporate guff, website help chats: all of that will be automated and intensified, throwing low-paid workers on to the scrapheap and driving everyone else insane. In that sense, enshittification relates to Mark Fisher\u2019s notion of a \u201cboring dystopia\u201d, a condition simultaneously awful and mundane. The fantasies about an all-powerful AI taking over the world go wrong precisely because they\u2019re too exciting. If you want a realistic scenario, don\u2019t picture an action movie. Instead, think of querying your power bill \u2026 and then imagine you\u2019re talking to Chat GPT because your utility company sacked its human staff. Capitalism is unlikely to end with a robot rebellion or gladiatorial Hunger Games competitions: it just plods on, getting slowly but steadily grimmer. Mind you, it\u2019s worth recalling the famous scene in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s novel The Sun Also Rises in which the war veteran Mike Campbell gets asked how he went bankrupt. \u2018Two ways,\u201d he says. \u201cGradually, then suddenly.\u201d Enshittification can be like that, too. The early attempts to motivate climate action \u2013 films such as The Day After Tomorrow \u2013 focused on catastrophic tsunamis and other apocalyptic outcomes. But most of the time, warming just makes everything slightly shittier. There\u2019s less of the Amazon than there used to be; the Great Barrier Reef doesn\u2019t extend quite so far; birds, animals and insects don\u2019t appear in the numbers we remember from a few years ago. Nevertheless, at a certain point, quantity turns into quality \u2013 and, as they say, the shit hits the fan. Given what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world, should the fate of Twitter be something about which we give a crap? No, probably not \u2013 except that it\u2019s a reminder of why we can\u2019t have nice things. William Morris once speculated that capitalism would culminate in a \u201ccounting-house on the top of a cinder-heap\u201d. Cinders or shit, the point still stands. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8789", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/south-korea-floods-flooding-death-toll-cheongju-road-tunnel-search", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "South Korea floods: president urges climate crisis action as death toll hits 40", "lead": "President Yoon Suk Yeol calls for overhaul of national preparedness as extreme weather becomes \u2018commonplace\u2019", "author": "Justin McCurry in Tokyo, and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 02:46:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626816", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2fe791f12f55257f1b58def18a35aba2ff705b/0_281_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Rescuers in South Korea have recovered a total of 13 bodies from a flooded road tunnel in a central city, as the death toll from flash floods and landslides triggered by days of heavy rain rose to at least 40 on Monday. The devastation prompted the country\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, to warn that the climate crisis had made extreme weather a fact of life. \u201cThis kind of extreme weather event will become commonplace \u2026 we must accept climate change is happening, and deal with it,\u201d Yoon said as he prepared to visit flood-hit North Gyeongsang province. Yoon said the idea that extreme weather linked to climate change is an anomaly and can\u2019t be helped \u201cneeds to be completely overhauled\u201d, while calling for \u201cextraordinary determination\u201d to improve the country\u2019s preparedness and response measures. Authorities in the central city of Cheongju said 13 people had been confirmed dead so far after their vehicles became trapped in the 685-metre-long Osong underground tunnel. Up to 15 vehicles, including a bus, were swamped by a flash flood when a riverbank broke on Saturday evening. About 900 rescuers, including divers, continued to search the tunnel, which fire officials estimated filled with water in as little as two or three minutes. Yoon ordered authorities to make an \u201call-out effort\u201d to deal with the floods and promised support for recovery work, including designating special disaster zones in the hardest-hit areas. Residents and families of the victims were heavily critical of local authorities, accusing them of presiding over a \u201cman-made disaster\u201d for not preemptively closing the tunnel amid torrential rain and rising water levels in a nearby river. Police said they would launch an investigation into the fatal flooding, the Yonhap news agency said. They asked why the North Chungcheong provincial government had not closed the low-lying tunnel, located just 600 metres away from the Miho river, even after a flood warning was issued for the river four hours before the accident, according to the Korea Times. In response, the provincial government said that its emergency response manual did not require the tunnel\u2019s immediate closure under those conditions. \u201cIt is not always mandatory to implement entry restrictions in the event of a flood warning,\u201d Kang Jong-geun, a provincial official, told reporters at the weekend. \u201cWe review the overall road situation and make decisions based on close monitoring,\u201d \u201cThere did not seem to be particular issues until the breach of the embankment \u2026 and due to the rapid influx of water, we did not have enough time to stop the cars from entering.\u201d But Jang Chan-gyo, a local resident, said more should have been done to prevent the river from bursting its banks. \u201cThey have been warning us to be prepared for the rainy season from a week ago, but it doesn\u2019t make sense why the authorities did not preemptively build a strong levee that could have prevented the disaster,\u201d Jang was quoted as saying by Yonhap. Yoon blamed local authorities for failing to follow disaster response rules, saying the situation had been made worse by poor preparation in vulnerable areas. \u201cWe have repeatedly emphasised access control in dangerous areas and preemptive evacuations \u2026 but if the basic principles of disaster response are not kept on the spot, it is difficult to ensure public safety,\u201d Yoon told an intra-agency meeting on Monday. Heavy rain has pummelled central and southern regions of South Korea since Thursday, as the annual rainy season reached its peak. The interior ministry said nine people were missing and 34 injured. Thousands have been evacuated. Yonhap said the rains had forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate. The downpours have damaged more than 139 homes and swept away 146 roads, the agency said. Photos and video footage from the scene in Cheongju showed rescue workers establishing a perimeter and pumping brown water out of the tunnel as divers used rubber boats to move in and out of the area. Yang Chan-mo, an official from the North Chungcheong provincial fire department, said at the weekend the tunnel was filled with four to five metres (13-16ft) of water dense with mud and other debris. Workers were proceeding slowly to prevent any victims or survivors from being swept out, Yang said. More than 60cm (24in) of rain has been measured in the South Chungcheong provincial towns of Gongju and Cheongyang since 9 July. Cheongju, where the tunnel is located, received more than 54cm (21in) during the same period. The Korea Meteorological Administration said central and southern parts of the country could receive as much as 30cm (12in) of further rainfall through Tuesday.

Compared with a year earlier, China\u2019s GDP in the April-June period was 6.3% larger, the national bureau of statistics said on Monday, quickening from the 4.5% annual growth pace for the first three months of 2023. Economists had forecast growth to accelerate to 7.3%, according to a Reuters survey. For the June quarter alone, growth slowed to 0.8% from a 2.2% quarter-on-quarter clip in the March quarter. That pace, though, exceeded predictions of a 0.5% expansion. Over the past three decades, China\u2019s growth has underpinned the global economy, providing a generation of new demand. Given last year\u2019s extensive Covid lockdowns, 2023 is widely expected to see the country post a rapid rebound. Now trailing only the US\u2019s in size, China\u2019s economy underpins prices for many commodities. It is also the source of an increasingly sophisticated array of goods from electric vehicles to aircraft and renewable energy plants and so weaker demand at home may result in more of those products being exported. Australia, one of the rich world\u2019s most China-dependent economies, is among the nations watching developments closely, Jim Chalmers, Australia\u2019s top economic minister said on Sunday. \u201cThe global economy is in a pretty precarious place right now,\u201d Chalmers, Australia\u2019s treasurer, told the ABC. \u201cThe Americans are proving to be resilient, the Chinese economy has shown some worrying signs, Europe\u2019s in recession and others as well.\u201d The trade sector recorded particularly weak figures; in June alone, it fell about 6%, with exports slumping 8.3% to just shy of 2tn yuan (US$280bn) and imports off 2.6%. Also for June alone, China\u2019s retail sales grew 3.1% compared with May\u2019s 12.7% surge. Analysts had expected growth of 3.2%, Reuters said. Louis Kuijs, S&amp;P Global\u2019s chief Asia economist, said the consumption numbers were among the disappointing ones. \u201cWe had double-digit retail sales growth in April and May from a very low base, and that has petered out to have only 3.1% nominal retail sales growth, indicating consumers remain quite reluctant,\u201d Reuters reported him as saying. Betty Wang, ANZ\u2019s senior China economist, said household deposits rose by almost 18% in the first half of 2023, compared with a year earlier, to a decade high. \u201cThe outstanding amount is equivalent to more than 30 months of retail sales,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWith few signs of a recovery in the property sector and an uncertain job outlook, the accumulation of household deposits suggests widespread pessimism among households.\u201d The moderate growth numbers are likely to stoke expectations of further government efforts to stimulate the economy to ensure a 5% growth target is reached for 2023. Monday\u2019s preliminary numbers show the economy grew 5.5% for the first six months. NAB, an Australian bank cuts its forecast for China\u2019s growth in 2023 to 5.2%, from 5.6% previously. It left its forecasts for 2024 (4.5%) and 2025 (4.8%) unchanged. The central bank has already lowered borrowing rates several times in a bid to shore up demand in an economy where inflation has largely evaporated in contrast to many other parts of the world.

Lehrmann is currently suing Network Ten, Lisa Wilkinson and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in the federal court, alleging they defamed him by wrongly suggesting he raped Brittany Higgins in Parliament House in 2019. The case is still in its early stages and the parties are currently examining a significant volume of material obtained through subpoena. On Monday, the federal court heard that lawyers for Network 10 have subpoenaed the raw footage of a recent Channel Seven Spotlight episode featuring an interview with Lehrmann. That episode, broadcast last month, also featured CCTV footage from Parliament House on the night in question and leaked audio recordings from a pre-interview meeting between Wilkinson, her producer, Higgins and Higgins\u2019 partner David Sharaz. The broadcast prompted an angry response from Network Ten and Wilkinson\u2019s lawyers, who said it may have amounted to contempt of court in the ACT. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Tim Senior, representing Network Ten, said his team were still reviewing the Spotlight material and are yet to determine whether the subpoena had been fully complied with. \u201cThere have been two tranches of material produced \u2013 we are still reviewing the second tranche from the last occasion so I wanted to raise it with your honour just to flag that it might not be spent,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, lawyers for Wilkinson and Network Ten suggested they may want to question officials from the Department of Parliamentary Services over a failure to produce CCTV vision of the night of the alleged rape. Sue Chrysanthou SC, acting for Wilkinson, said her team was \u201cvery concerned that the Department of Parliamentary Services says it does not have that CCTV footage\u201d. \u201cIt seems to us that CCTV footage of Parliament House on 23 March 2019, having regard to the fact that Ms Higgins complained shortly thereafter, and having regard to the fact that we saw some of that footage broadcast by Channel Seven a few weeks ago, it\u2019s concerning to us that there isn\u2019t full production by Parliament House in relation to that footage and we will be pursuing an application to analyse that response. But on Monday, Senior signalled the defendants no longer wanted to question DPS officials. He said it was satisfied DPS had undertaken searches for the material in response to the subpoena and that it couldn\u2019t be found. \u201cWe had some correspondence after the last hearing with the representatives of the Department of Parliamentary Services about the efforts that have been made to identify documents falling within the scope of that subpoena and the correspondence that we received indicated what those efforts have been, they searched various servers,\u201d Senior said. \u201cIt is apparent that the material that was the subject of that particular subpoena was not quarantined in any way and was automatically overwritten so that material doesn\u2019t exist and searches have been carried out to see if that material was on a server somewhere, but it\u2019s not.\u201d Snippets of the footage have been received from Channel Seven. The court heard DPS had also provided documents in response to a second subpoena, which the defendants were yet to inspect. Justice Michael Lee asked: \u201cSo it didn\u2019t respond to the terms of the first subpoena, but now that a more targeted subpoena has been indicated the material in respect of which you make a complaint has now apparently been produced?\u201d Senior responded: \u201cWell, subject to our inspection, I think that\u2019s right your honour.\u201d The matter will return next month."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d878c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/16/lionel-messi-unveiled-as-inter-miami-player-in-front-of-crowd-of-thousands", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lionel Messi unveiled as Inter Miami player in front of crowd of thousands", "lead": "Lionel Messi followed in the footsteps of Dwyane Wade, Dan Marino and LeBron James on Sunday as he was unveiled as Miami\u2019s latest sporting superstar", "author": "Tom Lutz", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 01:14:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626873", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e33081c8025d271397522b716efd106c751fb7fc/0_329_6211_3727/500.jpg", "body": "Lionel Messi followed in the footsteps of Dwyane Wade, Dan Marino and LeBron James on Sunday as he was unveiled as Miami\u2019s latest sporting superstar. Messi is in the twilight of his career, and is unlikely to match the achievements of those three stars during his time in Florida, but he comfortably equals them in pedigree. His first official appearance as an Inter Miami player \u2013 he announced his decision to join the club in June \u2013 was televised live, and took place in front of thousands of cheering fans at Fort Lauderdale\u2019s DRV PNK Stadium. There was a slight delay as one of Florida\u2019s familiar summer storms pounded the area before the Argentinian took to the stage to roars of appreciation from the packed stands and a firework display in the skies above the stadium. \u201cI\u2019m very moved to be here in Miami,\u201d Messi told the crowd in Spanish, a language spoken by around two-thirds of the local area\u2019s population. \u201cI want to thank you for the kindness and love that you have given me. This has happened so fast \u2026 I\u2019m anxious to train and compete. Our objective is to be here and win. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have a wonderful experience.\u201d Messi\u2019s contract ties him to the club until the end of the 2025 season, and will pay him between $50m and $60m a year. The deal also includes a signing bonus and a stake in the team. He is expected to make his debut for his new team on Friday against Mexico\u2019s Cruz Azul in the Leagues Cup. Although the 36-year-old is past his prime, he is one of the greatest football players of all time. After a wildly successful career at Barcelona, where he won a haul of Champions League and domestic titles, he joined Paris St-Germain where he struggled compared to his best years in La Liga. However, he cemented his legacy last year, when he led Argentina to victory at the World Cup. Messi has scored 715 goals in 885 club games and won the Ballon d\u2019Or, the most prestigious individual prize in football, a record seven times. Inter Miami are part-owned by David Beckham, one of the few footballers who can rival Messi for global fame. The move also represents a publicity coup for MLS as it continues its push to become a major player in US sports with the US co-hosting the World Cup in 2026. The last time the league attracted a player of Messi\u2019s fame was when Beckham joined Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. \u201cThere will always be a before and after Lionel Messi,\u201d said Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas before his new signing took to the stage. Earlier on Sunday, Inter Miami announced they had signed Messi\u2019s former Barcelona teammate, Sergio Busquets. The 35-year-old captained Bar\u00e7a during a golden era for the club, during which he won La Liga nine times and captured three Champions League titles. He also lifted the 2010 World Cup with Spain, for whom he won 143 caps. \u201cThis is a special and exciting opportunity that I\u2019m very excited to take. I\u2019m looking forward to this next step in my career with Inter Miami,\u201d said Busquets, whose contract lasts through the 2025 season. \u201cI was impressed by the club when I came with Barcelona last year and now I\u2019m happy and ready to represent the club myself. I can\u2019t wait to help bring the success that this ambitious club strives for.\u201d The next few weeks may be a comedown for Busquets, Messi and new Inter Miami coach Tata Martino, who was also at one point the pair\u2019s manager at Barcelona. They join a club that sit bottom of MLS\u2019s Eastern Conference, last won a league game on 13 May and still do not have a permanent home. However, fortunes can turn around quickly in MLS, a competition that is designed to have more parity than the European leagues Messi is used to. Still, Inter Miami are 12 points adrift of ninth place, where they would qualify for an elimination game to make the end\u2011of\u2011season playoffs. The project looks like a long-term one."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d878d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-509-of-the-invasion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 509 of the invasion", "lead": "\u2018Fierce battles\u2019 in eastern Ukraine as fighting intensifies, Kyiv says; Russia seizes control of shares in Danone and Carlsberg subsidiaries", "author": "Guardian staff and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 00:22:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626891", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/64e0f4e86ec7662ec3d4d93e8b7274bd2fa4398d/0_173_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "Fighting in eastern Ukraine has \u201csomewhat intensified\u201d as Ukrainian and Russian forces clash in at least three areas, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said.

The president also said Russia had a \u201csufficient stockpile\u201d of cluster bombs and that Moscow reserved the right to use them if such munitions were used against Russian forces in Ukraine. He added that Russia had not yet used the weapons although Russia was accused of using cluster munitions in last year\u2019s deadly Kramatorsk railway station attack. The Russian state has taken control of French yoghurt maker Danone\u2019s Russian subsidiary along with beer company Carlsberg\u2019s stake in a local brewer, according to a decree signed by Putin. Danone said it was investigating the situation while Carlsberg said it had not been officially informed of the move. The UN-brokered deal under which Moscow allowed Ukraine to ship its grain across the Black Sea is due to expire late Monday.

But in recent years, New Zealand has become increasingly vocal on issues including human rights, the international rules based order and potential militarisation of the Pacific. On Monday, Hipkins said a small country like New Zealand cannot work alone, and the government recognises the importance of building partnerships and inclusivity to address global challenges. That New Zealand\u2019s approach will often align with that of our most likeminded partners, with whom we share many common interests and values, should not be a surprise, he added. \u201cCommon interests and concerns do not mean we will always take the same approach.

It is understood all crossbench MPs or senators who voted yes to the constitution alteration bill were offered briefings, led by the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. Burney described it as \u201ca collaborative process that has brought together the best reasons why Australians should vote \u2018Yes\u2019 for constitutional recognition through a Voice\u201d.

Starmer said on Sunday that he was \u201cnot changing that policy\u201d, when asked if he would scrap it if Labour wins the next election. His shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, had condemned it as \u201cheinous\u201d just last month. Labour had come under fresh pressure to promise to scrap the cap after it emerged that one in four children in some of England and Wales\u2019s poorest parliamentary constituencies live in families left at least \u00a33,000 a year out of pocket as a result. Starmer\u2019s decision to rule out lifting the cap caused alarm among anti-poverty campaigners and despair in the Labour ranks. It would cost about \u00a31.3bn but the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is said to have concluded it would be unaffordable due to the state of the economy. The Labour leadership\u2019s decision came as a major academic study into the effects of the two-child cap concluded the policy had been a \u201cpoverty-producing\u201d initiative over the past six years, which had caused hardship and anxiety to tens of thousands of low-income families. The research, published on Monday morning by academics from the Universities of York, Oxford and LSE found both the two-child limit and the benefit cap had failed to meet their own stated aims, having had no positive incentive effect on employment, nor produced a reduction in fertility among poorer families. The benefit cap, first implemented in 2013, places a cap on the amount a household can receive in benefits if they have no, or low, earnings, with the average household losing \u00a350 a week. The two-child limit was introduced in 2017 \u2013 an estimated 32,000 households containing 110,000 children were affected by both policies at the same time in March 2022. Ethnic minority and larger families were disproportionately likely to be hit by the two-child limit and benefit cap, typically leaving them unable to afford essential items for their children, such as food, clothes and heating, with a consequent negative effect on children\u2019s emotional and physical development, the study found. Ruth Patrick from the University of York said: \u201cOur research evidence makes clear that the two-child limit and benefit cap are poverty-producing policies, which fail to meet their stated aims. Both policies need to be removed urgently, as part of a broader commitment to addressing child poverty and investing in children and families.\u201d Alex Beer, welfare programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research, said: \u201cThe two-child limit and the benefit cap are not incentivising families as the government intended and instead is leaving them unable to afford even basic necessities and affecting their mental health. These policies should be placed under review, and ideally removed.\u201d The stance is seen by some in the party as an indicator of the lack of strength of its determination to tackle child poverty. However, one party insider suggested Starmer could revisit the policy if the public finances improved. In February 2020, Starmer said he wanted to scrap it in order to help \u201ctackle the vast social injustice in our country\u201d. But this month he hinted that Labour would stick to the Tory policy. His latest remarks to the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Kuenssberg show appeared to confirm that position. Senior Labour insiders said they agreed that the policy was \u201chorrible\u201d and would not exist \u201cin a perfect world\u201d but said the party was not making any spending commitments it was unable to deliver on. \u201cI can see why colleagues might feel uncomfortable with this but we\u2019ve got to be realistic about the state of the economy,\u201d they said. One shadow cabinet minister said Starmer had to be able to \u201cslay shibboleths\u201d over public spending but admitted it was a tough position for MPs with constituents in poverty to defend. \u201cThese things are not easy for the MPs because they do genuinely hurt families in their constituencies,\u201d they said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t end child poverty unless we have more money to do it \u2013 and that\u2019s not going to happen, frankly, in the first term of a Labour government.\u201d Concern over the policy has long been an issue within Labour ranks. Forty-eight MPs, just under a quarter of the parliamentary party, defied their whips and voted against the welfare bill at second reading in July 2015. They included three current shadow cabinet ministers and the mayor of London. Later in his BBC interview, Starmer said that \u201cof course\u201d it was worth ruffling feathers within the party to win the next election, saying his \u201ccentral promise\u201d to members when he took over was to change the party to make it electorally viable. \u201cThe Labour party was created to give working people not just representation in parliament but a government in parliament that can govern on their behalf and change the lives of millions of people for the better,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been changing the Labour party to put us in a position where we are now credible contenders for the next election.\u201d Starmer did not rule out lifting the freeze on housing benefit, which has been in place since 2020 even though rents have soared, saying he would wait until closer to the general election to decide. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to that here, I\u2019m not writing our manifesto here,\u201d he said. Lynn Perry, the chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s, said: \u201cEven before the cost of living crisis intensified in 2022, more than one in four children in the UK were growing up in poverty. That just not acceptable in a country with the sixth largest economy in the world. \u201cResearch shows that the two-child limit is one of the leading causes of child poverty. We urge the current government and the opposition to reverse this policy, focus on supporting families who are struggling, and restore hope to the next generation.\u201d Imran Hussain, the director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, said: \u201cAny government serious about tackling child poverty will eventually have to confront the cruel reality of a policy that is designed to actively stop poor children receiving assistance to meet their minimum needs. \u201cAny government serious about strengthening our society and our economy knows child poverty is hugely damaging to public services and public finances. Poverty drives huge costs in schools and the NHS and damages our nation\u2019s skills base, which weakens our economy by many times more than the money saved by this policy.\u201d Starmer refused to commit to further spending under a Labour government, amid growing calls from unions for him to back more of their policy priorities. However, he said: \u201cA Labour government will always want to invest in its public services.\u201d The leader has been emphatic about prioritising \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d over reckless spending as the party seeks to reassure voters it can manage the economy. He suggested he was relaxed about being described as a fiscal conservative. \u201cI don\u2019t mind what label people put on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want to make my argument. My argument is this: What was absolutely plain from last year\u2019s mini-budget is if you lose control of the economy, it\u2019s working people who pay.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8791", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/17/labour-plans-new-taskforce-to-target-contractors-linked-to-hostile-nations", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour plans new taskforce to target contractors linked to hostile nations", "lead": "Exclusive: Yvette Cooper to tell RUSI thinktank that economic security and national security go hand in hand", "author": "Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:06:11", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626965", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4f1be2124967c967dcc0a8a99869c2cd4c770926/0_352_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Contractors linked to hostile foreign powers such as China will be targeted by a new security taskforce if Labour wins the next general election. In a joint initiative from the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the new body will aim to anticipate risks to Britain\u2019s national security. It comes just days after the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said China represents the \u201clargest state-based threat\u201d to Britain\u2019s economic security. The government intervened in eight attempted takeovers of UK firms by Chinese buyers last year over national security fears. The taskforce will examine reliance on foreign contractors in public procurement. It follows the revelations that the police network in England and Wales is vulnerable to spying because of reliance on Chinese-made technology and the row over Huawei\u2019s contract to roll out 5G across the UK. In a speech at the defence and security thinktank the Royal United Services Institute [RUSI] on Monday, Cooper will make the case that economic security and national security go hand in hand. \u201cBritain has some of the best security agencies in the world, but we face new threats and risks \u2013 including economic threats to our national security \u2013 which can\u2019t simply be dealt with through traditional intelligence methods. The government is failing to get ahead of the economic risks to our domestic security, which has meant that our response to a fast-changing security landscape has often been disjointed, disorganised and delayed. \u201cThis new taskforce will ensure we are acting to stop Britain being a safe haven for criminal money from serious organised crime, terrorism or hostile states, as well as ensure we are preparing for the threats of the future including in sensitive supply chains,\u201d she said. The new body will also target money laundering on behalf of terror groups, organised criminals and individuals connected to state threats. The National Crime Agency estimates that \u00a312bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK and hundreds of billions of pounds of money is laundered each year. Members of the taskforce will include ministers, members of the security services, the National Crime Agency and businesspeople, Labour said. Cooper will also announce plans for a law to stop extremist groups using AI for radicalisation and terror threats. \u201cLabour will criminalise those who purposely train chatbots to spout terrorist material, with stronger action to monitor and stop radicalising chatbots that are inciting violence or amplifying extremist views,\u201d she will say. The shadow home secretary will build on the argument put forward by the shadow chancellor in Washington DC in May that geopolitics and the rapid advance of new technology require a more active state and a renewed commitment to the development of strong partnerships with international allies. She will say that Labour will seek to build a new consensus on national security, governing in the public interest rather than pursuing division or short-term games. Reeves said: \u201cFor too long the economic and financial security of our country has been weakened. \u201cIn the face of an uncertain world, the work of Labour\u2019s new taskforce will not only prioritise our economic strength and resilience, but also protect Britain against wider criminal and security risks so families can feel more secure across the board.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8792", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/airport-expansion-no-boost-productivity-growth-report", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Airport expansion does not boost UK growth or productivity \u2013 report", "lead": "Researchers argue that industry claims about benefits of more flights should be taken with pinch of salt", "author": "Gwyn Topham Transport correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.626983", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9268cec6907edc47e2ccaf1310c328a5042b56ee/0_281_4200_2519/500.jpg", "body": "Claims that airport expansion will help grow the UK economy should be treated with scepticism, according to a report that finds air travel does not increase productivity or growth. Declining business travel and lower wages in aviation undermine claims made by the industry for the value of increased air connections, say researchers at the New Economics Foundation. A report by the NEF due to be published this week says that despite booming air travel in the past few decades, only one in 12 flights in 2022 was taken for business purposes \u2013 half the proportion in 2013 \u2013 while the number of associated jobs was lower than in 2007. Wages fell faster in real terms between 2008 and 2022 than in any other UK sector. Far more passengers are flying on holiday abroad than into the UK, with the NEF report finding a \u00a332bn \u201ctravel deficit\u201d in net spending between outbound and inbound tourism in 2019. Airports around the UK are seeking to expand, despite the recommendation of the Climate Change Committee that there should be no additional capacity to meet the country\u2019s 2050 net zero targets. Britain\u2019s biggest airport, Heathrow, has permission to build a third runway, although it says the plans are under review. Last week, Gatwick submitted an application to develop a second runway for full-time use. London City, Luton and Bristol are among other airports planning to expand, while terminal redevelopment at Manchester and Birmingham will also bring more passengers. Gatwick says its growth plans would \u201cinject \u00a31bn into the region\u2019s economy every year\u201d, while Bristol claims that extra flights will create up to 5,000 jobs in the region and provide a \u00a3430m economic boost. According to government-endorsed figures in the Airports Commission\u2019s report, Heathrow\u2019s runway would add \u00a361bn in growth over six decades. But the NEF report suggests that since the government\u2019s previous comprehensive assessment of the economics of air transport growth, \u201cstrong evidence, grounded in government data and academic research, suggests that the economic merit of expanding the UK\u2019s air transport sector has diminished considerably\u201d. It recommends that the government pause all airport expansion until it has conducted a review of the economic evidence and compatibility with policies on climate change and levelling up. Dr Alex Chapman, a senior researcher at the NEF, said: \u201c[The government has] let the air travel industry balloon in size, based on dangerously outdated claims that it is boosting the UK\u2019s economy. The reality is declining business air travel, declining wages for air travel workers, declining job numbers, and declining domestic tourism spending in the UK. And that\u2019s before you consider the rise in noise, air pollution and dangerous emissions.\u201d He said the beneficiaries were \u201cthe highly paid executives, the private shareholders and the wealthy minority of ultra-frequent flyers\u201d."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8793", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/17/young-women-seeking-mental-health-help-called-dramatic-uk-survey-finds", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Young women seeking mental health help called \u2018dramatic\u2019, UK survey finds", "lead": "Others asked if they are \u2018overthinking things\u2019 or told their issues could be hormonal, charity says", "author": "Dahaba Ali Hussen", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627001", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5190e79b8421d2c30a40f576bc70548629e68543/0_9_640_384/500.jpg", "body": "A fifth of young women who have sought help for their mental health say they were told they were being \u201cdramatic\u201d, research shows. The survey also found that 27% of those who had spoken up about a mental health crisis over the past five years were told their issues could be hormonal. Recent ONS statistics showed suicide rates among women under the age of 25 in the UK are increasing and stand at one every two days. Mental health charities and campaigners say this is in part because stereotypes about women mean that when they seek help, their feelings and symptoms are often not seen or are dismissed. The YouGov survey, commissioned by the suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm), asked more than 2,000 women about their experiences when speaking up about a mental health crisis such as panic attacks or manic depression. It found that many women did not feel they were taken seriously when they attempted to seek help. A third said they were asked if they were \u201coverthinking things\u201d and 20% were asked if they were on their period. The survey found that 22% of the women feared being seen as \u201cattention-seeking\u201d. Simon Gunning, Calm\u2019s chief executive, said of the suicide statistics for young women: \u201cThese are shocking and serve as a stark reminder that we need to do more to protect young people and make suicide prevention a national priority. \u201cOur research shows that even when they do speak up, young women\u2019s feelings and symptoms are frequently dismissed and ignored \u2013 often disregarded as over-emotional, hormonal or attention-seeking. These damaging preconceptions are leaving young women unheard and unsupported and lives are at risk like never before.\u201d He added: \u201cWe must take immediate action and strive to overcome the stigma that hinders women from receiving the recognition they deserve during times of crisis. By providing them with the necessary support, we can ensure that no woman has to face her struggles alone.\u201d The charity cited some of the leading factors of mental health crises in women aged 18-34 as body image, loneliness, relationship issues, money worries and comparing themselves to others on social media. Prof Louis Appleby, a government adviser on suicide prevention, said: \u201cSuicide in young women is a national priority. Although the rate is not high compared to other groups, there has been a marked rise over the last decade or so. The causes are likely to be complex \u2013 including mental ill-health, abuse, online experience \u2013 and prevention too has to be wide-ranging. It\u2019s a reminder that suicide is constantly changing and we must be vigilant.\u201d To highlight the rising rates of female suicide in the UK, Calm teamed up with the England footballer Fran Kirby who stars in a short film that aims to highlight how women can feel invisible when they seek help. Kirby said she wanted to help shine a light on the issue of suicide. \u201cLike any team, we all have our part to play in making sure young women feel seen when they reach out,\u201d she said. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Ecojet, styled as a \u201cflag carrier for green Britain\u201d, will launch early next year with a 19-seater plane travelling on a route between Edinburgh and Southampton. The planes will run initially on kerosene-based fuel for the first year, before being retrofitted with engines that convert green hydrogen into electricity. Vince founded the UK\u2019s first green energy company, Ecotricity, in 1995 and has spent his career launching low-carbon and ethically minded ventures across energy, transport, food and football. He is the chair of League Two\u2019s Forest Green Rovers, known as the \u201cworld\u2019s greenest football club\u201d. Vince told the Guardian: \u201cWe want to prove that one of the last frontiers [of decarbonisation] can be broken and that it\u2019s not insolvable. \u201cA lot of people seem to think that people who are eco-conscious want everyone to live a life of self-denial in a cave. Green living is not about giving things up \u2013 everything we like to have in this life can be done in a net zero life.\u201d The airline will launch with several green-striped 19-seater planes capable of travelling for 300 miles. Vince hopes to expand the number of routes out to cover all of Britain\u2019s big cities. Staff will wear environmentally friendly uniforms, and serve plant-based meals. A second phase, 18 months later, will result in 70-seater planes capable of flying to Europe being introduced. The company is in the process of applying for a licence from the Civil Aviation Authority and securing takeoff and landing slots at airports. However, the process of launching an airline is regarded as slow, and Ecojet will not launch as an electric plane operator, starting by using kerosene-based fuel instead. Vince admitted he was not entirely happy with starting the project by burning fossil fuels but said that the airline needed to launch quickly to secure planes and landing slots and \u201ckeep up the momentum\u201d of the project. \u201cIt does feel like a contradiction but at the heart of this project is upcycling existing planes and retrofitting them. This is the pragmatic approach, which means we won\u2019t lose time. We will build up the infrastructure, get the planes in the air and swap in the engines when they are available.\u201d The aviation industry is examining various options to decarbonise, including electric flight and the use of sustainable aviation fuel, a biofuel that can be made from agricultural products. Vince labelled SAF \u201cbullshit\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is nowhere near enough land to grow the crops you\u2019d need.\u201d A collection of startups and aviation companies, including the engine maker Rolls-Royce in the UK and a charter firm in Australia, have been working on electric flight. Vince said that while there was \u201ca lot of hype and guff about the hydrogen economy, mainly from fossil fuel companies\u201d, it was well suited to flight as it was \u201csuper light\u201d and the significant energy needed in its production was justified in allowing green aviation. Vince said Ecojet would \u201cprice match\u201d existing airlines on air fares and was intended to attract a mass market, beyond environment-conscious consumers. He said he would invest \u00a31m initially but plans to raise further funds next year. The Virgin Atlantic founder, Richard Branson, reportedly once remarked: \u201cIf you want to be a millionaire, start with a billion dollars and launch a new airline.\u201d Vince said: \u201cThey say the same about football clubs. \u201cI want to prove that it can be done and it\u2019s worthwhile. We do not think it will be loss-making. Our priority is to be in the air with this newfound ability to fly without a carbon footprint. This will complete the [low carbon] puzzle for us \u2013 the emotional impact will be big.\u201d To protect the environment, Vince does not take flights but he intends to when his airline launches. Labour has come under pressure in recent months for taking \u00a31.5m from Vince over 10 years.

Delays to projects mean the target is unlikely to be met, with work on buildings in the second cohort of the scheme yet to have started as of May, according to the National Audit Office. The approach to achieving objectives at the lowest possible cost could also result in hospitals that are too small, the watchdog warned, as modelling assumptions may be unrealistic about the extent to which care in future will be provided outside hospitals. The government failed to achieve good value for money, with the scheme having cost \u00a31.1bn by March this year, and progress has been slower than expected, the report concluded. Steve Barclay\u2019s department was said to have taken a \u201cmaximum risk\u201d approach to the project. Analysis by the NAO found that of the 32 projects announced in 2020 that are being taken forward, just 11 qualify as \u201cwhole new hospitals\u201d. It said 20 amounted to rebuilds of existing hospitals, erecting major new buildings at existing sites or a major redevelopment of existing buildings. One scheme did not meet any of those criteria, according to the report. The watchdog cautioned that larger hospital projects may have to take place simultaneously \u2013 making it harder to find builders and ramping up costs. The hospitals could be forced to run at very high occupancy levels, as much as 95%, which were said by the NAO to be \u201chighly undesirable and indicative of crisis\u201d. NHS England has prioritised reducing occupancy rates to 92% over the current financial year, leading the report to warn: \u201cThere is a risk that running hospitals very full in future may affect their smooth operation and reduce the amount of spare capacity for coping with normal variations in demand, unexpected shocks and health crises.\u201d The claim will ignite concerns that the new hospitals would struggle to cope in the event of another pandemic, given England already has one of the highest rates of hospital bed occupancy among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cBy the definition the government used in 2020, it will now deliver 32 rather than 40 new hospitals by 2030.\u201d In May, a reset of the scheme was conducted by Barclay. He revealed eight of the original cohort of 40 hospitals would be delayed into the next decade. In a bid to save face and claim the government would still hit its target, he included five other hospitals in the programme. Five are built with concrete that is well past its 30-year lifespan, and three are schemes for mental health facilities. Trusts will be concerned by the findings in the new report and are already being forced to stump up \u201ceye-watering\u201d sums to patch up out-of-date facilities, said Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers. He argued ministers \u201ccould have better managed expectations\u201d about funding issues with the project \u2013 given the delayed timelines and impact of inflation. Hartley added: \u201cThe government must future-proof new hospitals and care settings and heed the NAO\u2019s warning that hospitals may be too small given high levels of bed occupancy.\u201d Labour said the report showed just one hospital is on track to be built by the general election. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives have overpromised, under-delivered, and they\u2019ve been found out. Meanwhile patients are being treated in outdated, crumbling hospitals. Labour will make our NHS fit for the future.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cThe NAO\u2019s report acknowledges that, despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme\u2019s innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320bn of investment \u2013 helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker.

It said that consultants were prepared to be \u201cin this for the long haul\u201d and that more dates would follow. The BMA says consultants\u2019 take-home pay has fallen by 35% since 2008-09 and that the government must make an offer that addresses their pay erosion. It also wants a commitment to reform the pay review system and restore its independence from government. Dr Vishal Sharma, the BMA consultants\u2019 committee chair, said the offer was insulting, adding: \u201cConsultants have always been clear that industrial action is a last resort but in the face of a government intent on devaluing consultants\u2019 expertise and their lack of regard for the impact this is having on the NHS, we have been left with no choice. We\u2019ve had our pay cut year after year, put our lives on the line during a pandemic and now are managing a record backlog of care. \u201cThe prime minister says cutting these waiting lists is a priority but then undermines his own policy by showing he doesn\u2019t value those charged with delivering it. Cutting pay [in real terms] once again shows the government\u2019s complete disregard for the profession.\u201d NHS bosses fear that the strike by consultants \u2013 the first in 50 years \u2013 will lead to even more treatments being postponed than the 49,000 a day as a result of the junior doctors\u2019 action, which runs until 7am on Tuesday. The backlog has risen from 7.2 million, when Rishi Sunak first made his pledge to bring down waiting lists, to almost 7.4 million. Sharma said, given successive real-terms pay cuts over the past 15 years, the latest proposed rise for consultants could offer \u201cno better demonstration of the need to reform the pay review system\u201d. He added: \u201cThis \u2018final offer\u2019 and flat refusal to engage in further talks has left us with no option but to continue our action \u2026 The future of the NHS depends on there being consultants within it, but attacks on their pay will drive them away \u2013 from the health service and from the country \u2013 with devastating consequences.\u201d The BMA consultants\u2019 committee previously indicated it would accept the same above-inflation pay deal \u2013 a 12.4% rise \u2013 offered to junior doctors in Scotland.

As revealed by the Guardian, Rishi Sunak will announce proposals on Monday to curb the numbers enrolling on so-called \u201clow value\u201d courses on the basis of data about each course\u2019s graduate employment and dropout rates. Sunak\u2019s plans will require the Office for Students \u2013 the higher education regulator for England \u2013 to \u201censure that courses which fail to deliver good earnings are subject to stricter controls\u201d, according to the announcement. The prime minister will also announce significant funding cuts to many foundation-year university courses, which are popular among mature students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds who lack academic qualifications. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThis is simply an attack on the aspirations of young people and their families by a government that wants to reinforce the class ceiling, not smash it. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 appalling record on apprenticeships means it can\u2019t be trusted to deliver the overhaul that our young people need, and the new role for the Office for Students will be to put up fresh barriers to opportunity in areas with fewer graduate jobs. \u201cLabour will enable our young people to seize the opportunities of the future through our reforms of the skills system and higher education funding \u2013 your background will be no barrier to getting on under a Labour government.\u201d Sunak will say: \u201cToo many young people are being sold a false dream and end up doing a poor-quality course at the taxpayers\u2019 expense that doesn\u2019t offer the prospect of a decent job at the end of it. \u201cThat is why we are taking action to crack down on rip-off university courses, while boosting skills training and apprenticeships provision.\u201d However, the government also confirmed it would not bring in minimum exam requirements for school leavers going to university, after a consultation. \u201cResponses to the consultation suggested a minimum eligibility requirement would likely have disproportionate impact on some groups,\u201d it said. Rachel Hewitt, chief executive of the MillionPlus group of modern universities, welcomed the dropping of minimum entry requirements, saying their use would have \u201cflown in the face of social justice\u201d. Hewitt said her members, including the universities of Bolton and Sunderland, rejected limiting student numbers based on employment data. \u201cIt does not capture the full range of graduate employment patterns, including in sectors such as the creative industries, nor does it accommodate regional pay disparities. \u201cIt also takes no account of the non-monetary benefits of higher education and the family background of graduates. Equally important, it ignores the fact that the salaries of teachers, and the many socially valuable graduate professions in the NHS and the public sector, are limited by the budgets provided by central government.\u201d Many foundation-year courses will have tuition fees cut by 38%, from \u00a39,250 to \u00a35,760. While subjects such as medicine and veterinary sciences will be exempt, the government argues that \u201ctoo many people are encouraged to take a foundation year in some subjects like business where it is not necessary\u201d. The Foundation Year Network membership body described the move as \u201ca massive blow\u201d to social mobility that would affect potential students from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cWe are dismayed that the government has taken no account of the many foundation years that provide the specialised, tailored support that enables thousands of mature, nontraditional and multi-disadvantaged students every year to thrive and succeed at university, in a way that no other route can,\u201d a spokesperson for the network said."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8798", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/17/uk-survivors-of-terrorist-atrocities-say-compensation-scheme-is-broken", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK survivors of terrorist atrocities say compensation scheme is broken", "lead": "Survey of those affected by 11 major incidents finds most are unhappy with Criminal Injuries and Compensation Authority", "author": "Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627092", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/112adf6642b89b3614825799305c468b2cfd1ba0/0_0_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "People who suffered life-changing injuries or mental anguish after being caught up in terrorist atrocities have condemned the UK\u2019s compensation system for being \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cunmanageable\u201d, according to a report released on Monday. A survey of those affected by 11 major terrorist incidents found that more than two-thirds felt that the compensation scheme overseen by the Criminal Injuries and Compensation Authority was unfair and unreasonable. People who were severely injured in bombings, shootings and stabbings or are suffering from PTSD have complained about the low levels of compensation and the length of time it takes to receive money after traumatic incidents. Many have been unable to work for long periods following the incidents. Brendan Cox, co-founder of Survivors Against Terror and co-author of the report, said CICA should be replaced. \u201cCICA is broken. There can be no other conclusion from the data and the testimonies we have gathered. \u201cAn organisation that is supposed to be helping survivors recover and rebuild is instead consistently doing them harm. If the organisation had poor processes and procedures but scored well on other areas, there would be hope for reform. There is not. \u201cSurvivors deserve better. They have been attacked \u2013 not because of who they are, but as proxies for the British state. Therefore, the British state has a responsibility to ensure that they are supported,\u201d he said. Survivors Against Terror (SAT) distributed the survey among survivors caught up in major atrocities including the 7/7 London Bombings, the Fishmonger Hall stabbings, the Manchester Arena attack, and the terror attacks in Paris, Tunisia, Mumbai and Bali. The charity received 132 responses from survivors to questions about their experiences with CICA and found: Sixty-eight per cent felt that the process was unfair and unreasonable, only 9% felt the opposite. Sixty-two per cent did not feel treated with respect and empathy \u2013 compared with only 17% who felt they were. The requests for evidence from CICA as \u201cproof\u201d of physical and psychological injury were experienced as unmanageable, unreasonable, and the time limits set by CICA were experienced as unreasonable. More than half said they were unable to speak to someone from CICA for help. Lisa Bridgett, the manager of a boating park, is among many survivors of the 2017 Manchester Arena attack who have complained about the compensation scheme. More than five years after the bombing, which blew off a middle finger and left her with facial scarring, a broken ankle, lifelong breathing difficulties and PTSD, she rejected a \u00a317,350 award from CICA. \u201cI\u2019ve been unable to bring myself to accept the offer made to me by the CICA so far as I feel it\u2019s simply an insult. It\u2019s like offering scraps of help,\u201d she told WalesOnline in March. \u201cIt\u2019s all done by working to a spreadsheet and a table of payments dependent upon the physical and psychological injury suffered. \u201cThey give you 100% of the set award for what they class as your first injury, 30% for your second injury and then 15% for your third injury. They have offered me \u00a313,500 for mental injuries, which they have classed as not lasting for more than five years, \u00a33,300 for my broken ankle as the second injury and \u00a3550 for the loss of my finger as the third injury,\u201d she said. Since 2017, CICA has paid almost \u00a34.6m to victims of terrorism in the UK and overseas. The scheme is one of last resort and intended for those who are unable to seek or obtain compensation for their injuries by other means, such as through a civil personal injury claim. Compensation can be awarded up to a limit of \u00a3500,000 and is subject to eligibility criteria. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWhile no amount of compensation can make up for the ordeal suffered by victims of terror, it is right survivors get the support they need including through the publicly funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme that has paid out more than \u00a3158m to victims of violent crime in the last year alone. \u201cThis includes \u00a34.6m for victims of terrorism since 2017, with a dedicated team helping victims of the Manchester Arena attack receive the compensation to which they are entitled. But we know more must be done, which is why the government is reviewing the support available, to better address victims\u2019 needs.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d8799", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/17/boris-johnson-criticised-bringing-honours-system-into-question-lords", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lords panel criticises Boris Johnson for bringing honours system into question", "lead": "Report expresses disapproval at former PM\u2019s attempts to fill upper house with his supporters", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627110", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a0c9ce9b1a930b9e06955447211b774b6755d152/0_0_3500_2099/500.jpg", "body": "A cross-party committee of senior peers has criticised Boris Johnson for bringing the honours system into question. In a report published on Monday, the six-member panel, including two former Conservative ministers, noted with disapproval Johnson\u2019s attempts to fill the Lords with his supporters. The report on the size of the second chamber said: \u201cIn recent months, there have been further developments which have brought the appointments system into question. Most notably, there was considerable controversy over the size and composition of prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation list, with over half of initial nominees not being approved by the House of Lords appointments commission [Holac].\u201d The Lords committee said Johnson \u201cshowed no interest\u201d in reducing the number of peers during his three years in No 10, and it noted that the number of new appointments he made \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the target set by the upper house. The report said Johnson\u2019s nominations were \u201cgranted predominantly to members of his own party\u201d. The damaging row over his honours lists has prompted one of the three byelections being held this week, and another is highly probable in the coming months. Johnson appointed seven new peers to the Lords, including a former political aide, Charlotte Owen, who at 29 becomes the youngest ever life peer. The list also included the former Tory London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, who attended a \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d Christmas party during the Covid lockdown of December 2020. Bailey, who has faced calls for his peerage to be blocked, has apologised for his attendance at the party. The event is being reinvestigated by the police after video that was filmed after Bailey left was leaked to the Mirror. More than half of Johnson\u2019s nominations to the Lords were not accepted by Holac. The peerages of the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries and the former Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams were reportedly blocked because of rules on not being able to sit in both chambers. Allies of Johnson accused Rishi Sunak of removing names from the final list; No 10 denied the claim. Adams resigned as an MP after the decision, prompting a byelection this week in Selby and Ainsty. Dorries announced her intention to quit as the MP for Mid Bedfordshire but has yet to formally resign. The Lords committee has recommended imposing a fixed-term limit, possibly of about 15 years, for service in the upper house and called for a fairer allocation of new appointments that are based on election results. It said reducing the size of the Lords had become a \u201csecond-order issue\u201d, with the priority to introduce a \u201csustainable\u201d appointments system, ideally via legislation or otherwise by consensus among the political parties. Peers in 2017 recommended that the numbers in the Lords be capped at 600 to make it smaller than the Commons. But the numbers have continued to balloon, with the latest report suggesting there are 824 members, making it one of the largest scrutiny chambers in the world. The committee has reiterated its call for an end to byelections for hereditary peers to help reduce the overall numbers in the Lords and provide a better gender balance, given all 90 are men. The prospect of Labour winning the next general election has raised the possibility of attempts being made to rapidly redress the political imbalance in the Lords. The report said Labour would be placed in a difficult position if it were to win a majority, given its 181 party-affiliated peers make up \u201cnot much more than 20%\u201d of the Lords. Their average age is 75, seven years higher than that of the Conservative group. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who has committed to abolishing unelected peers, has remarked on the \u201cimbalance\u201d in the Lords and his spokesperson has hinted that the party could need to steadily appoint peers to ensure it can get its legislative agenda through. The lord speaker\u2019s committee said gradual changes to the makeup of the house could ensure a party was not put in the same situation again. The committee suggested new appointments should be allocated on the basis of an average of each party\u2019s share of their Commons seats and the national vote at the most recent general election. \u201cThis would have a gradual impact on the political balance of the parties, reflecting each party\u2019s electoral fortunes over time while also allowing each party to refresh its own membership,\u201d the report said. Lords Burns, who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe political leadership should focus initially on putting in place a sustainable and fair method of allocating appointments. This will set the basis for a cap and a sustainable reduction in the size of the house.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d879a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/16/daniel-morgan-met-to-reportedly-pay-family-2m-over-corrupt-investigation", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Daniel Morgan: Met to reportedly pay family \u00a32m over \u2018corrupt\u2019 murder investigation", "lead": "No one has ever been convicted after private detective found dead in London pub car park in 1987", "author": "Nicola Slawson and Vikram Dodd", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 22:42:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627128", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/48bff95ed83aee9e3c288152af5b0afe84bf1ccc/0_78_1786_1070/500.jpg", "body": "Scotland Yard is reportedly to pay a \u00a32m settlement after admitting that the investigation into the unsolved murder of a private detective more than 35 years ago was corrupt and incompetent. Daniel Morgan was found dead in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham, south London in March 1987 with an axe embedded in his head. No one has ever been convicted. It is the most investigated case in British history. Five investigations by the Met have failed to yield a conviction. Sir Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, is reportedly expected to make a public apology this week for \u201ccorruption, incompetence and defensiveness\u201d in its response to the murder and the Times reported that Morgan\u2019s family will receive \u00a32m, one of the biggest payouts in British policing history. An official inquiry into the Morgan scandal which reported in 2021 found that the Met was \u201cinstitutionally corrupt\u201d and its commissioner at the time, Cressida Dick, was personally censured for obstruction by the independent inquiry set up to review the murder. The inquiry also found that the police force was more interested in protecting its reputation than finding out the truth about wrongdoing. The findings of the independent panel were a victory for the decades-long struggle for justice by the Morgan family, during which they said they endured being \u201clied to, fobbed off, bullied [and] degraded\u201d by those institutions they believed they had the right to rely on. Within hours, the Met rejected some of the report\u2019s key findings. The Met in 2011 accepted that corrupt officers shielded the killers and the panel said the inquiry into a murder that was probably \u201csolvable\u201d was undermined, perhaps fatally. In late 2021, the Morgan family sued the force, launching their civil claim alleging misfeasance in public office as well as breaches of the Human Rights Act. The lawsuit alleged widespread wrongdoing as identified by the inquiry. Their claim raised issues dating back to 1987 and alleged wrongdoing immediately after the killing. The reported settlement means the police force will avoid costly and lengthy civil proceedings. The solicitor for the Morgan family and the Met declined to comment. This week Rowley will launch a new set of initiatives designed to restore trust in the Met after a series of scandals and proven wrongdoing against officers."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d879b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/16/right-to-fight-review-the-hatred-these-female-boxers-faced-is-breathtakingly-awful", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Right to Fight review \u2013 the hatred these female boxers faced is breathtakingly awful", "lead": "This documentary about pioneering US fighters in the 70s tells its tale brilliantly.

Sky\u2019s new documentary, Right to Fight, written and directed by Georgina Cammalleri \u2013 and drawing on the research and archive of the former boxer Sue \u201cTiger Lilly\u201d Fox \u2013 is the story of the women who changed the sport. It is not a tale that has been told before. Fox has spent years painstakingly gathering scraps of evidence to form a coherent whole \u2013 since male historians of the sport have concentrated entirely on preserving the male record of what is perhaps the sport most dominated by men. Right to Fight tells it brilliantly, helped by the fact that every one of its subjects bursts with the kind of energy and charisma that is a gift to the camera. They have backstories, anecdotes and attitude that could fill a programme 10 times as long without it flagging for a moment. Cathy \u201cCat\u201d Davis broke with her Louisiana family\u2019s expectations (\u201cThey wanted me to stay a little doll. But I just couldn\u2019t do the girl thing\u201d) by moving to New York to train as a fencer. When a coach told her, \u201cI don\u2019t teach women or cripples sabre\u201d and slashed her leg with his weapon, she turned to a boxing manager, Sal Alighieri, who was keen to make women\u2019s boxing the next big thing. Marian \u201cLady Tyger\u201d Trimiar was born in Harlem and lived a hard life with her alcoholic father. Nevertheless, they began shadowboxing together as they watched Muhammad Ali. When she couldn\u2019t find a trainer willing to work with a woman, she had business cards made that read \u201cFirst Black Female Boxer\u201d and one gym agreed to take her. The men beat her up as an initiation rite and bored a peephole in the shower she used, but she wasn\u2019t deterred: \u201cI kept coming back \u2026 Eventually I earned their respect.\u201d Pat \u201cLiberation\u201d Pineda was molested as a child, married at 16, pregnant with baby number two at 17 and felt suicidal by 18. \u201cI was caged. There was no freedom.\u201d A friend sneaked her into a boxing gym where she channelled her rage and found her calling. Cammalleri does a wonderful job of telling the fighters\u2019 stories in a way that, as with all the most sensitively directed documentaries, illuminates much more than the ostensible subject. In Lady Tyger\u2019s business cards alone, we see the extraordinary confluences of aptitudes and abilities required to be a pioneer in any field \u2013 canny insight, confidence, cool-eyed detachment and perspective, as well as her indisputable talent and ambition. This is to say nothing of the determination: when the women are refused licences, without which they cannot switch from amateur to professional and earn a living, they battle to get the rules changed in the face of unyielding hostility from officialdom. Sexism pervaded the women\u2019s lives at every level. The level of resistance and hatred inspired by their desire to box professionally is breathtaking. There is contemporary news footage of men in the street and, more importantly, men on various athletic commissions (and, alas, Muhammad Ali), insisting that women are designed to serve men \u2013 and not physically or mentally capable of fighting. Pineda\u2019s manager hid from her client letters full of rape threats and hopes that \u201cyour babies die\u201d. It is best not to dwell on the fact that the only thing that seems to have changed in half a century is that women who step out of line can now expect to receive similar missives via their social media accounts or email. In their private lives, too, most dealt with abusive men, whether at home or at work (\u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of trainers that want to have sex with you. And if you don\u2019t go with them they would say you were gay\u201d). Lady Tyger fled her violent husband in the night when she found out she was pregnant. Davis\u2019s manager tried to strong-arm her into marriage, although she was (to her own consternation) gay and in love with a woman she had met on a university course. What Cammalleri draws out most delicately, however, is how Davis benefited from being white. Blond and good-looking, she became the acceptable face of women\u2019s boxing. She was awarded her licence first, although Lady Tyger\u2019s and other boxers\u2019 applications predated hers, and got all the publicity. And this was despite allegations that Alighieri was fixing her matches. Davis claims a stroke seven years ago has left holes in her memory about that. It makes a reunion between the three fighters in the closing minutes saddening as Lady Tyger presses her on various issues and Davis comes up short. However, the final scene, as Marian \u201cLady Tyger\u201d Trimiar is inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and roars to the heavens in triumph, is the perfect note on which to end.

Last year, that was particularly true. A recognisable face among the crowd there was a Czech player by the name Marketa Vondrousova, but she was not in competition. After undergoing a second wrist surgery nearly two months earlier, Vondrousova was in the midst of a six-month layoff. She made her trip from the Czech Republic as a tourist while supporting her best friend and doubles partner, Miriam Kolodziejova, with her wedding imminent. A year later, she returned to win the whole thing. \u201cWe did some sightseeing and some shopping, it was just a normal vacation, but I would have never dreamed of this moment,\u201d she said. Vondrousova\u2019s victory is a reminder that the pathway of a tennis player is far from direct. She is the first unseeded Wimbledon women\u2019s champion and a player who had previously struggled on grass, so her success may be one of the biggest surprises in recent years. Still, there have always been indications that she had been on the pathway towards achieving big things. A former junior No 1, Vondrousova was one of the first players of her generation to break into the top 100 and transition on to the main tour. She won her first title at 17, generating ample attention by winning a WTA 250 event in Biel, Switzerland, from qualifying while ranked No 233. Two years later she reached the French Open final at 19. Vondrousova is 11 days younger than Elena Rybakina, the Wimbledon champion last year, yet there was a time when the Czech was miles ahead during their development. As she faced Ash Barty in the 2019 French Open final, Rybakina had lost in the first round after qualifying for a grand slam tournament for the first time. Things do not always happen immediately. In Vondrousova\u2019s case, her progress has been affected by the two wrist surgeries, one right after the French Open run. But also by a general lack of conviction and the absence of a winning mentality in matches. Even with the hindsight of Barty subsequently rising to No 1, Vondrousova\u2019s flat performance in that 2019 final was extremely disappointing. Two years later Vondrousova performed at a spectacular level on the hard courts of Tokyo as she easily defeated Naomi Osaka, on home soil, and Elina Svitolina, who was ranked No 6, en route to the Olympic gold medal match. She had beaten better players than her opponent in the final, Belinda Bencic, and was playing at a higher level. Really, Vondrousova had everything in her power to win the match. She did not have the toughness to see it out. Between those big results, she has struggled to show those glimpses of excellence consistently. The 24-year-old arrived in the Wimbledon final having won only one WTA title, losing four consecutive finals before her triumph on Saturday. Such was her tendency to vanish in the bigger moments, even people around her were exasperated. After her victory, Vondrousova recalled a conversation with her mother after losing a doubles final in Berlin this year, her seventh consecutive defeat in a final at WTA level in singles and doubles. \u201cWe played a final in Berlin of doubles,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom was there watching. She was so upset. She told me: \u2018I don\u2019t want [you] to be second all the time.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK, Mom, we\u2019ll try today.\u2019\u201d One interesting detail in Vondrousova\u2019s story is that she won Wimbledon without a clothing sponsor. She had a deal with Nike until last year, when the company chose not to renew her contract, an event that helped to spur her on. \u201cIt was a bit sad when it finished but I was like: \u2018We\u2019re going to try to find something else, just show them I\u2019m going to be good. I\u2019m going to play good and we\u2019ll see what happens now.\u2019 But I also feel like maybe that\u2019s a good thing that drove me here.\u201d Now that she has finally arrived here, the definitive question for her career is whether she can consolidate this first great success and perform regularly at a high level to stay there. There is no doubting her game, which presents a refreshing retort to the powerful, first-strike players who have recently risen to the top. With her delicate hands, variety and lefty trickery, driving opponents mad with her drop shots and slice, Vondrousova showed that she can be a nightmare to play against while also possessing enough firepower to battle with bigger hitters. But in a sport where things move on quickly, the challenge of consistently establishing herself among the elite has only just begun."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d879d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/16/world-on-fire-series-two-review-this-epic-second-world-war-drama-is-totally-gripping", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "World on Fire series two review \u2013 this epic second world war drama is totally gripping", "lead": "This hugely ambitious attempt to show the war through the lives of ordinary people has an immaculate grasp of tension and character.

The idea that real-world events might intrude on its storytelling is apt, given that much of this sweeping, epic war drama is concerned with how conflict affects everyday life, and how adaptable people can, and must, be when everything is turned upside down. Writer and creator Peter Bowker (Blackpool, The A Word) has moved the action forward just slightly to 1941, and translator Harry Chase is temporarily back at home in Cheshire, having brought his new wife, Kasia (Zofia Wichlacz), back from Poland with him. Lesley Manville continues to play Harry\u2019s waspish mother Robina with a hint of the Maggie Smith/Dowager Countess to her; her compassion is not entirely absent, but it is buried deeply in the weeds of propriety and blunt proclamations about the state of things. \u201cI doubt that the Germans are interested in Cheshire,\u201d she says, drily, as bombs rain down on Manchester. She claims to be unafraid of strong emotion: \u201cI just disapprove of it.\u201d Manville\u2019s uptight snobbishness provides some great acidic balance. Harry (Jonah Hauer-King) doesn\u2019t have much to do as the series begins, other than mope around at home, but he is soon off to play his part once again, dispatched to north Africa by the episode\u2019s end. \u201cMother, I have no choice but to fight for my country,\u201d he says, as she explains that he is leaving quite the personal mess behind him. After fleeing her country and her role in the resistance to travel to Britain with Harry, Kasia is traumatised and struggling with what would now be identified as PTSD. She has nightmares that wake the house \u2013 Robina is not happy about this \u2013 and cannot work out where she fits into the war now that she is a refugee. \u201cI am a soldier, not a sister or a wife,\u201d she tells Harry, while wondering if fighting is the only thing she is good at. Kasia, with all of her flawed complexities, is one of the show\u2019s best characters. Lois, Harry\u2019s former flame and the mother of his child, Vera, is also grasping with the notion of what her role should be. She is an ambulance driver, dodging bombs to get victims to hospital, but taking increasingly reckless risks, unable to grieve properly for those she has lost. When her brother, Tom, returns he accuses her of not staying at home where she \u201cshould\u201d be. This is one of the many grains of sand in the \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d narrative; Kasia, too, finds that not all Mancunians have open arms when it comes to refugees, particularly if they insist on \u201cspeaking foreign\u201d. As is often the case here, one needn\u2019t look far for contemporary parallels. It sometimes leans towards the soapy side, such as in an awkward family gathering between Harry, Kasia, Lois and Robina, filled with pining looks. But its occasional soapiness works in its favour: it juggles its elements well, never seeming crass or imbalanced. It is compelling storytelling that flies by quickly demanding \u2013 and earning \u2013 the viewer\u2019s emotional investment in its characters almost immediately. As in the first series, it casts its net wider than the home front. In Berlin, it tells the story of schoolgirl Marga, recruited to the horrific Lebensborn programme, in which young women with Aryan qualities were selected to have children with SS officers, in the pursuit of \u201cracial purity\u201d. The tension is chilling, as her friend and teacher try to quietly intervene; everyone is afraid of their neighbours, or their children, reporting them to the authorities. It also spends time in Egypt, where British and Indian army regiments are supposed to fight as one against the Italians, who have snipers in the hills and have laid landmines on the road. The Indian soldiers are given the most dangerous tasks, and again, there is a sense that not everyone is in this together, even if they are on the same side. World on Fire is an ambitious series. It is multinational, multilingual, and treats the personal and political as one and the same. The idea behind it has always been to tell the story of the war through the lives of ordinary people, and it certainly provides a sense of how every single aspect of life must have been disrupted. I have been slightly spoiled for second world war dramas by the gregarious SAS: Rogue Heroes, and this does not share that bounce or spirit. But it does have an immaculate grasp of tension and character. As this is war, people come and go; they live and they die. By the end of the opening episode, I was fully invested in their fates. World on Fire aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d879e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/morning-mail-school-funding-bias-revealed-djokovic-dethroned-on-centre-court-australian-women-claim-ashes", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Morning Mail: School funding bias revealed, Djokovic dethroned on centre court, Australian women claim Ashes", "lead": "Government funding since the landmark Gonski education review has gone to the schools \u2018least in need\u2019; Carlos Alcaraz wins the Wimbledon title", "author": "Charlotte Graham-McLay", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 20:50:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627202", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0bd08c439c82346a71337f1b1ad6d2ab4c4ebaf1/0_0_6981_4189/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning.

The governor, Oleh Synyehubov, urged people to take to shelters. Russia had began bombarding the north-eastern Ukrainian city at 2am on Sunday, firing four S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. No one was injured as two were intercepted and the other two landed in a courtyard. Later on Sunday evening the Russians struck again, firing another two missiles. Synyehubov said a young man was killed and at least four people were wounded. Vapour trails were visible above Kharkiv\u2019s Freedom Square and the neo-classical regional administration building, which was bombed in the first days of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. Synyehubov said the victim on Sunday was a man born in 1999 who worked in a civilian enterprise. Three people were hospitalised with shrapnel injuries after the strike in the Osnovianskyi district of the city. A fourth was treated at the scene. Minutes later, there was a further air raid alerts, as Russia launched its third attack in less than 24 hours. Two blasts could be heard near the city centre. The governor posted: \u201cThe occupiers are again hitting Kharkiv. Move to the shelters.\u201d Ukraine recaptured much of the wider Kharkiv region in September, with Russian forces occupying now only a small strip of land there. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram that Russian forces have also been attacking in the direction of Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region for two successive days. \u201cWe are on the defensive,\u201d Maliar wrote. \u201cThere are fierce battles. The positions of both sides change dynamically several times a day.\u201d Maliar also said the two armies were pummelling one another around the ruined city of Bakhmut but that Ukrainian forces were \u201cgradually moving forward\u201d along its southern flank. She added that Kyiv\u2019s troops were also fending off Russian attacks elsewhere on the eastern front near Avdiivka and Maryinka."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/16/microsoft-activision-blizzard-sony-playstation-call-of-duty", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Microsoft agrees to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation ahead of Activision buy", "lead": "Software giant acquiesced after US trade commission expressed concern that Activision Blizzard acquisition would hurt gamers", "author": "Guardian staff and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 20:26:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627238", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/40abb141450439244f4947edba0f8da8f268b72d/0_123_3690_2214/500.jpg", "body": "Microsoft has signed a binding agreement to ensure that the Call of Duty video game franchise remains available on Sony\u2019s PlayStation platform after Microsoft\u2019s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the tech company said on Sunday, easing concerns from Sony and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). A tweet from Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming\u2019s CEO, read: \u201cWe are pleased to announce that Microsoft and @PlayStation have signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. We look forward to a future where players globally have more choice to play their favorite games.\u201d In the United States, the FTC had argued the acquisition deal would hurt consumers whether they played video games on consoles or had subscriptions because Microsoft would have an incentive to shut out rivals like Sony Group. However, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled on 11 June: \u201cThe FTC has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation, or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets.\u201d To address the FTC\u2019s concerns, Microsoft had agreed to license Call of Duty to rivals, including a 10-year contract with Nintendo, contingent on the merger closing. On Sunday, Microsoft did not disclose the duration of the agreement with Sony. \u201cFrom Day One of this acquisition, we\u2019ve been committed to addressing the concerns of regulators, platform and game developers, and consumers,\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, in a tweet. \u201cEven after we cross the finish line for this deal\u2019s approval, we will remain focused on ensuring that Call of Duty remains available on more platforms and for more consumers than ever before.\u201d Microsoft has a deadline of 18 July to complete the transaction with Activision Blizzard although both companies could choose to extend that deadline. Regulators in the EU had approved the takeover deal in May, a move that drew immediate protest from the UK counterpart, the Competition and Markets Authority, which had blocked the deal in April. However, the CMA said on 11 June that it was prepared to negotiate with Microsoft over the deal."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/wimbledon-a-dream-come-true-says-carlos-alcaraz-after-stunning-victory", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon a \u2018dream come true,\u2019 says Carlos Alcaraz after stunning victory", "lead": "The Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in almost five hours and told himself to raise his level after losing the first set 6-1", "author": "Simon Cambers at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 20:09:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627255", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/912b9873e32219e91fed2eaadc3b2a6528157071/0_171_5131_3079/500.jpg", "body": "A beaming Carlos Alcaraz said winning Wimbledon was \u201cthe happiest moment of my life\u201d. The 20-year-old Spaniard became the third-youngest man to win the title after Boris Becker and Bj\u00f6rn Borg, coming out on top after almost five hours on Sunday. \u201cRight now is the happiest moment of my life, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Alcaraz said, after his dramatic 1-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 victory. \u201cProbably in five years will change. Right now, I\u2019m 20, I didn\u2019t live too many situations like this, so I\u2019m going to enjoy this moment. \u201cMaking history that I did today, it\u2019s the happiest moment of my life. I think it\u2019s not going to change for a long time. Beating Novak, winning Wimbledon championship, is something that I dreamed about since I start playing tennis. That\u2019s why it is the biggest moment of my life. \u201cIt\u2019s great to win but even if I had lost I would have been really proud of myself for this amazing run, making history, playing in the final of this amazing tournament against a legend of our sport, it\u2019s amazing, a dream come true. For a boy of 20 years old, I didn\u2019t expect to reach this stage so fast. I\u2019m very proud of myself and my team. I am falling in love with grass right now.\u201d Alcaraz said he had given himself a talking-to after a first set in which he won just one game. \u201cAfter the first set I thought: Carlos, raise your level, or everybody would be disappointed,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cYou helped a lot. I\u2019m really proud to play in front of royalty \u2026 and Felipe [the king of Spain]. Felipe, you watched me twice and I won, I hope you come more.\u201d Djokovic had not lost on Centre Court since the 2013 final against Andy Murray and Alcaraz said he hoped his peers would be inspired by his win. \u201cI did it for myself, not for tennis generation, honestly. It was great. Beating Novak at his best, in this stage, making history, being the guy to beat him after 10 years unbeaten on that court, is amazing for me. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I will never forget, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s great for the new generation, as well, I think to see me beating him and making them think that they are capable to do it, as well. It\u2019s great for me and I think for the young players.\u201d Djokovic had a point to lead by two sets to love and then, in the final set, missed a break point that would have put him up 2-0, eventually missing out on what would have been a record-equalling eighth men\u2019s title and record-equalling 24th grand slam title overall. \u201cThe backhands kind of let me down, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cSet point, I missed the backhand. I should not have missed that shot. Some regrets. I had my chances. I think I could have closed out that second-set tie\u2011breaker better. But credit to him for fighting and showing some incredible defensive skills, passing shots that got him the break in the fifth. He was a deserved winner today, no doubt.\u201d Djokovic said he had been impressed by Alcaraz\u2019s maturity under pressure. \u201cAmazing poise in the important moment. For someone of his age to handle the nerves like this, be playing attacking tennis, and to close out the match the way he did \u2026 I thought I returned very well that last game, but he was just coming up with some amazing, amazing shots.\u201d Describing Alcaraz as a combination of himself, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, Djokovic said he hoped to get a chance for revenge soon. \u201cI hope we get to play in US Open. I think it\u2019s good for the sport, No 1 and 2 in the world facing each other in almost a five-hours, five-set thriller.

Marine rescuers were called to the scene at Traigh Mhor in North Tolsta, on the Isle of Lewis, to reports that dozens of the mammals were in difficulty there around 7am on Sunday. Initial reports suggested there were about 55 animals consisting of adults and calves, but it was soon discovered that only 15 remained alive. The British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) charity tried to refloat two of the more active whales that were low down in the water on the outgoing tide, and one got away. But the other subsequently restranded and died later on, as did three others. At around 3.30pm it was decided that the remaining whales should be euthanised on welfare grounds. The cause of the stranding is unknown but it is thought the pod may have followed one of the females. BDMLR said: \u201cOne of the dead whales appeared to have had a vaginal prolapse \u2013 so it\u2019s currently suspected that the whole pod stranded due to one female giving birth. \u201cPilot whales are notorious for their strong social bonds, so often when one whale gets into difficulty and strands, the rest follow.\u201d The coastguard, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, police and Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) were also at the scene on Sunday.

BDMLR added: \u201cAt about 3.30pm, the local vet along with the coastguard, fire and rescue, and a forensics vet came to the conclusion that the shallow beach and rough wave conditions made it too unsafe to refloat the remaining animals. \u201cConsidering how long the pilot whales had been out of the water in addition to the poor conditions, it was decided that they should be euthanised on welfare grounds. \u201cWe\u2019d like to extend our thanks to the Lewis community, Stornoway coastguard, police, Stornoway and Shawbost fire and rescue, SMASS, SSPCA, Civil Air Support, CalMac [ferry service] and of course our dedicated team of medics who all came together in their efforts to rescue these whales. \u201cA sad outcome for this pod and obviously not the outcome we were all hoping for.\u201d SMASS will now carry out postmortem examinations on the whales to investigate why they stranded.

Across almost five hours of mind-bendingly fine grass court play, seasoned with cussedness, crowd-snark and some wonderfully fine champion will, the future of men\u2019s tennis became the present too. It felt fitting that the end note of a beautifully high grade men\u2019s Wimbledon final was also unexpectedly tender. As Carlos Alcaraz crumpled on to his back on the Centre Court turf, Novak Djokovic walked across and hugged him, looking, for the first time since the first set four hours ago, back when the world was still young, like the only real grown up court. Ten years in the making, Djokovic had at least finally given the Centre Court what it wanted. Specifically, a defeat. But what a defeat this was, or rather what a victory for Alcaraz, who was simply sublime here. It is genuinely rare in sport to witness such an obvious meeting of grand talents heading in opposite directions, one somewhere close to the end, the other just stepping out of the doors and on to the surface of the moon. The changing of the guard stuff, the GOAT versus the kid, has followed both players through the draw. But if Djokovic did look below his best here at times, it would be wrong to attribute this to declining powers. The real cause, the real story was a brilliant display of champion nerve, and intuitive learning on the job from Alcaraz, who began the match looking callow and rushed, and ended in a rich seam of balletic, creative, endlessly varied grass court tennis. This was an astonishing tennis match. For half an hour Djokovic just seemed to be hustling his man off the court, taking the first set 6-1 in a blur. From there it became something entirely different, a match Alcaraz kept on winning, then kept not winning, dragged back by the dark arts, a refusal to bend a champion will so intense Djokovic eventually began to attack the court furniture, mangling his racket head on the net post as he went a break down in the final set, a man literally at war with the basic fittings and fixtures of tennis. At the end one thing is obviously true. Alcaraz is absolutely the real deal, a challenger to the Djokovic supremacy at any stage of his prime years not just the tail end. Could there be a better way to win this final as a 20-year-old, to go a set down to an all-time great out there in pursuit of a calendar grand slam, then end up winning this thing playing magically varied tennis at the far end of your physical limits? There will be other matches for Alcaraz on this court. To win this one is an act of empire building, the kind of victory that stays with you through the challenges to come. Both men are relentless, but somehow Djokovic always looked like an icon in the process of being torn down. No matter how hard he pushed, those startling shots and grabs and gets just kept on coming back. There is no escape from Alcaraz. And through it all strange things kept on happening. At one point Djokovic left the court for six minutes to have his leg tended to, then returned playing like a superhero, moving like a god. Alcaraz double faulted to cede the fourth set, from a position of near infallibility, then instantly regained his level, remembering what he was doing in those lighter, more sunlit moments, reeling off sublime volleys, drop shots, touch play, and becoming more creative as the pressure ratcheted up, seeing it all in 5D. Serving to go 5-3 up in the final set he produced a punched forehand winner of such startling power the air seemed to leave Centre Court, sucked up out into the sky by the collective gawp. Who does this? Who does it when they\u2019ve never been here before, so deep into this kind of day on this kind of stage? Centre Court had seemed a little sleepy at 2pm as the players emerged, the biggest cheer reserved for the appearance of the Princess of Wales, who has had a good fortnight here, who feels already like an apex piece of All England Club branding. And early on Alcaraz was over-hitting the ball, looking tight and overly aggressive. Wimbledon is won with your feet as much as your hands, the stuff that happens right down by the scrub, the bounce, the run of that tricksy surface under shifting south London skies. Djokovic played at a high, safe, gruelling level, taking the errors that came. Two key moments turned the match. First the second set tie-break. Djokovic came into this match having won his last 15 of them. He went 3-0 up in what felt like a matter of seconds. And still somehow Alcaraz won it from there, levelling the match at one set all with the most sublime backhand down the line. The second thing that happened was the longest game in the history of tennis midway through the third set, which went to 13 deuces, and may or may not have actually been the longest game ever, but certainly felt like it. Alcaraz finally took it. And in that moment something seemed to shift, as he found the freedom to reach those higher registers again. Who knows how far that talent can be stretched? The good news on a day of shifting tides is that Wimbledon will see much, much more of it from here."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/eu-deal-with-tunisia-help-stem-irregular-migration", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EU signs off \u20ac1bn deal with Tunisia to help stem irregular migration", "lead": "Ursula von der Leyen hails deal as an investment in shared prosperity and stability", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll Brussels correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 19:44:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627319", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/45f889158a74ade610b2bccb9c099805cbe0b828/0_0_2048_1229/500.jpg", "body": "The EU has signed off on a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m) deal with Tunisia to help stem irregular migration, as the president of the north African country denounced those who offer migrants \u201csympathy without respect\u201d for their goal to have equity in life. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, hailed the deal with Tunisia, including significant measures to stem deadly irregular migration across the mediterranean, as an investment in shared prosperity and stability. The partnership with Tunisia on migration comes just days after the country\u2019s president, Kais Saied, revealed the \u201cshocking\u201d scale of people-smuggling in his country, with officials revealing it was worth about \u00a3760m in the first half of 2023 in remittances from sub-Saharan Africa. Unveiling the deal in Tunisia in Sunday evening flanked by Von der Leyen and the prime ministers of Italy and the Netherlands, Saied denounced humanitarian organisations as spreading false facts on Tunisia instead of focusing their efforts on the criminal gangs behind the deadly business. He said people all over the world shared a need for coexistence and effective equity in their futures along with respect rather than sympathy. Thousands of undocumented people have headed for the coastal city of Sfax in recent months with the goal of setting off for Europe in boats run by human traffickers, leading to an unprecedented migration crisis for Tunisia. Libyan border guards have rescued dozens of people they say had been left in the desert by Tunisian authorities without water, food or shelter, Agence France-Presse reported on Sunday. Hundreds of people from sub-Saharan African countries were forcibly taken to the desert and hostile areas bordering Libya and Algeria after racial unrest in early July in Sfax, Tunisia\u2019s second-largest city. The migrants were visibly exhausted and dehydrated, sitting or lying on the sand and using shrubs to try to shield themselves from the scorching summer heat that topped 40C (104F). The group of at least 80 people was found in an uninhabited area close to Assah, a town near the Tunisia-Libya border, nearly 93 miles (150km) west of Tripoli. Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, said the deal would aim to stop people making the dangerous and often deadly journey across the seas to Italy and would disrupt the business model of smugglers. The three EU leaders flew to Tunisia on Sunday to sign a memorandum of understanding on a \u20ac1bn package agreed in June amid continuing controversy over the north African country\u2019s human rights record. Details included an agreement to resume talks on an association agreement between the EU and Tunisia and to give Tunisian students access to the Erasmus exchange programme. The \u20ac1bn package contained a significant element on strengthening efforts to combat the criminal gangs involved in trafficking and people-smuggling, said Rutte. Giorgia Meloni, the far-right Italian leader, hailed the deal with Tunisia as a model for new relations with north African countries, adding that she said this with \u201ca level of pride but a level of gratitude\u201d. Undocumented sub-Saharan African people in Tunisia received 3bn dinars (about \u00a3750m) in remittances from their countries during the first half of 2023, an official from the Tunisia national security council said in a meeting on Friday. The figure is higher than revenues of the vital tourism industry in Tunisia during the first half of the year, which amounted to 2.2bn dinars. At a meeting of the national security council at Carthage Palace in Tunisia on Friday, Saied said: \u201cThis figure is shocking and indicates that Tunisia is being targeted.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/16/keira-walsh-england-women-world-cup-barcelona", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Keira Walsh: \u2018Everyone\u2019s going to love you or hate you.

Sarina Wiegman\u2019s defensive midfielder is the increasingly not-so-secret jewel in England\u2019s crown. It was Walsh\u2019s pass that elicited more oohs and aahs than Ella Toone\u2019s sumptuous finish to open the scoring in the final of the Euros against Germany last year and Walsh\u2019s \u00a3400,000 move to Barcelona from Manchester City broke the world record for a transfer fee. Since that move Walsh has won a treble \u2013 La Liga, the Supercopa and the Champions League \u2013 and lifted the first women\u2019s Finalissima trophy with England. Yet four years ago she almost walked away from football, the heavy toll of the criticism she faced during the 2019 World Cup almost too much to take. Walsh had looked out of sorts in France, like the youngest of rabbits, frozen in the road, caught in the headlights of the first car they have seen. For those who had watched her across several seasons for Manchester City, there was no doubting she belonged in the England team, but those new to the game, in the stands and the press boxes, questioned Walsh\u2019s ability. Now, she is thriving and going into another World Cup laden with medals and praise that show it. How will she stop the experience of the 2019 World Cup from infiltrating her experience? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t do social media so much any more,\u201d Walsh says matter-of-factly. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive one for me. As much as you say you\u2019re not going to look, you look. And I think when you\u2019re in that headspace, whether it\u2019s good or bad you only click on to the bad comments. \u201cI\u2019ve just got more confidence in myself now. Everyone\u2019s going to love you or hate you; it\u2019s a game of opinions and I had to learn that. I was lucky at Man City because Nick [Cushing] really liked me and I\u2019d played under coaches that maybe don\u2019t as much and then do again. So, I\u2019ve maybe got more confidence in myself and what I bring. At the Euros I really enjoyed it, stayed in the moment, and hopefully that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do at the World Cup.\u201d Walsh has her cheerleaders. Cushing, now the manager of New York City, once said: \u201cI will not hold back: she is up there unrivalled with the most intelligent players I have ever worked with.\u201d When Lucy Bronze was named on the 2022 Ballon d\u2019Or list of the top 10 female players with her England teammate Beth Mead, she posted on Instagram: \u201cThanks but I don\u2019t deserve this. The best Lionesses player during the Euros was Keira Walsh. Should be the first English name in the list!\u201d Being appreciated and respected is nice, but being considered one of the best in the world does not come naturally for the 26-year-old. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in my own ability,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to a certain point I\u2019m just a girl from Rochdale. I never thought that I would be in those conversations and winning the Champions League, winning the European Championship. \u201cI always talk about Nick Cushing but he really instilled that confidence in me and gave me the foundation to go and achieve these things and I don\u2019t believe I would be where I am without him, I genuinely don\u2019t. I\u2019ve always believed in my own ability, but I\u2019ve had a lot of help along the way and been in the right place at the right time \u2013 that is really important as well. I joined City when the Super League wasn\u2019t so big and as a young player it was easier to get minutes.\u201d For Walsh, there is generally a lack of appreciation for the position she plays. \u201cThe position in general goes under the radar; look at Patri at Barcelona. It\u2019s the same in the men\u2019s game, too. Lena Oberdorf is probably the only one that does get mentioned. For me, Patri is the best player in the world, and nobody speaks about her. It\u2019s just part and parcel of the position we play. The personality goes with the position, too: we don\u2019t want to be the stars of the show.\u201d Walsh\u2019s next, but far less extreme, rabbit-in-the-headlights moment came when she took part in her first training session at Barcelona. \u201cThe first few training sessions I was like: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m good enough to be here, to be honest.\u2019 It did take me a while. I talk about Patri, Aitana [Bonmat\u00ed] a lot but Mariona [Caldentey], when you see the relationships she has with players it is so instinctive. She\u2019s not thinking when she\u2019s playing. \u201cAt first it really did take me some time just to find my confidence. It is such a big club with big players. It took me some time to find the feet. Lots of them have all grown up together playing the Barcelona way. Sometimes in training it\u2019s just so nice to watch; sometimes I\u2019m on the opposition and you can\u2019t help but clap.\u201d Walsh is having to think faster. \u201cThere were times at first where I probably missed opportunities to play forward and find the forward players. Everyone\u2019s constantly on the move. At City they would stand and wait in the pocket whereas at Barcelona they don\u2019t, so you always have to be checking your shoulder, thinking forward, thinking ahead before you\u2019ve even got the ball as to where the player\u2019s going to be. A lot of it is one-, two-touch, not many people are dribbling or taking a lot of touches. It is such fast play but towards the end of the season I kind of got to grips with that a little bit.\u201d The frenetic pace of the tiki-taka play didn\u2019t surprise Walsh but \u201cI was surprised at how aggressive they are,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone always just talks about Spanish or Catalan players being good on the ball, intelligent and being tactically very good. But for me it was the aggressiveness off the ball, the willingness, the wanting to put in all the work possible to get up to the ball and press and the tactical fouls and all of the street smarts. \u201cIn training in the Women\u2019s Super League we don\u2019t have that. Sometimes, for me, the intensity off the ball wasn\u2019t there. Whereas here, as soon as you touch the ball someone\u2019s behind you, they\u2019re kicking your heels, they\u2019re trying to get the ball off you and it forces you to think so much quicker. Even in training, even if it\u2019s just like a fun game of rondos and it\u2019s not serious, the girls will come in and they\u2019re slide tackling.\u201d Off the pitch, the mood is friendly. Walsh has not mastered Spanish \u2013 \u201cI have two lessons a week and still \u2026 terrible. Spanish and Catalan in a northern accent don\u2019t sound great anyway, to be honest\u201d \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t stopped her from being taken under the wing of her teammates. \u201cThe girls have honestly been unbelievable with me. From the start they\u2019d still invite me to go for dinner and brunch. Even the ones who can\u2019t speak English still try to speak to me. They understand that my family\u2019s not there, so they always make sure that we\u2019re doing stuff and are always invited.\u201d They don\u2019t coddle her too much though. \u201cHonestly, they laugh at me for everything,\u201d she says. \u201cMy nickname on the team is Ginger, because my hair is orange. I don\u2019t even get called Keira, I just get called Ginger. But it\u2019s nice that they feel comfortable enough to do that, to have that banter and to be able to laugh at each other. I think that\u2019s really important for the team culture. So, yeah, I don\u2019t get offended, I think it\u2019s probably a nice thing.\u201d Walsh\u2019s first year at Barcelona has exposed her to the best football in Europe, and arguably the world, going into a World Cup. How will England benefit from the new Walsh? \u201cI\u2019ve changed a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cPhysically I would say I\u2019m in better shape. I can move around the pitch a lot more, thanks to the demand that they put on, being an option on the ball all the time and seeing the game a little bit differently. At City I got told to stay central and hold that position, whereas at Barcelona, they\u2019ve kind of changed what it means to be a 6 a little bit. \u201cI just know how to be more available, take a few more risks playing forward and take my first touch forward more looking for those passes. It\u2019s also definitely improved my short game too. I\u2019ve always been able to play the longer passes but maybe have sometimes missed the combinations in central areas and that\u2019ll be key for England, trying to find the likes of Ella Toone and Georgia Stanway in those spaces. It\u2019s going to be really important for me to find those passes. At England, we have such important wingers that having the mixture of both will really benefit.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-music-career-je-taime-moi-non-plus-serge-gainsbourg", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Je T\u2019Aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus was the succ\u00e8s de scandale of 1969 \u2013 but Jane Birkin\u2019s music was far more than that", "lead": "In her collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg, Birkin left a permanent mark on pop \u2013 and her underrated solo albums of dark, strange songs are ripe for rediscovery", "author": "Alexis Petridis", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 19:00:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627358", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c17f5676b85d76fc4cebc918b360afc0c131e6f4/0_33_3058_1836/500.jpg", "body": "Serge Gainsbourg frequently had what you might charitably describe as complicated relationships with his female collaborators. There always seemed to be a problem: a joke or a satire on Gainsbourg\u2019s part to which they weren\u2019t entirely party, a level of controversy that Gainsbourg was willing to provoke but they were not. There was the 18-year-old France Gall, who he duped into singing a song that was evidently \u2013 to all but the innocent Gall herself \u2013 about oral sex, causing her to temporarily retreat from public life in mortification, and furnished with a succession of other songs that appeared to be viciously mocking their singer as she sang them (the Eurovision-winning Poup\u00e9e de Cire, Poup\u00e9e de Son, depicted her as a hopelessly naive puppet, whose fans didn\u2019t have a clue what they were doing). There was Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a passionate affair, who first recorded the scandalous duet Je T\u2019Aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus, then refused to allow it to be released, fearful of precisely how scandalous it was going to be. There was his daughter Charlotte, whom he corralled into recording a duet called Lemon Incest, then cast in a film, Charlotte for Ever, in which he played her father, reducing her to tears on the set during a scene in which he undressed her. And there was Vanessa Paradis, their working relationship so fraught that Gainsbourg took to calling her Vanessa L\u2019Enfer. But that never happened with Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. They were a couple for 12 years: their working partnership outlived their separation in 1980, lasting until Gainsbourg\u2019s death in 1991. The standard line is to call her his muse on account of the songs he wrote for her \u2013 Jane B, Ma Ch\u00e9rie Jane, La Fille aux Claquettes, Ballade de Johnny-Jane, Lost Song, D\u00e9pressive \u2013 or the songs she inspired: Birkin performed the role of, and was clearly the model for, the titular heroine in Gainsbourg\u2019s masterpiece, the 1971 concept album Histoire de Melody Nelson. But the word \u201cmuse\u201d implies a certain passivity that sells Birkin hopelessly short: she felt far more like Gainsbourg\u2019s co-conspirator. It was Birkin who modelled Gainsbourg\u2019s iconic latterday image. There seemed to be nothing he could come up with that she would baulk at. Singing the song that Bardot had refused to release, and riding out the resultant scandal, which grew far bigger than even Bardot had feared, encompassing not just radio bans, but condemnation from the Vatican. Demonstrating La D\u00e9cadanse, Gainsbourg\u2019s attempt at instituting a dance craze that involved the male lead grasping his female partner\u2019s breasts. Being photographed naked and chained to a radiator for Lui magazine, complete with accompanying text by Gainsbourg describing her as his \u201clittle hermaphrodite\u201d. Starring in the 1976 film that shared Je T\u2019Aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus\u2019 title, which explored the doomed relationship between a boyish girl and a homosexual trucker, involved a great deal of anal sex, and effectively scuppered Birkin\u2019s acting career for the next couple of years. Singing the astonishing Vie Mort et R\u00e9surrection d\u2019un Amour Passion, a 1978 song that seemed to lay their crumbling relationship bare in the starkest terms imaginable: \u201cWe are fucked \u2026 I told you \u2018kill me, kill me if you\u2019re a man\u2019, but you\u2019re just a mug, because you never could.\u201d Birkin had already enjoyed a small degree of notoriety \u2013 and evidenced a distinct lack of timidity \u2013 as an actress in Britain before she met Gainsbourg: she had appeared naked in both Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s 1966 film Blow-Up and the 1968 film Wonderwall, the latter remembered less today for her role than its experimental George Harrison-penned soundtrack. But it was her association with Gainsbourg that made her a star. He encouraged her to sing, making a feature of her high, untutored voice: if the notes Birkin issued occasionally wobbled, Gainsbourg\u2019s songs somehow made that work, playing on her youth, supposed innocence and her Englishness, casting her as the perfect vocal foil to his own husky sprechgesang. Je T\u2019Aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus was the succ\u00e8s de scandale of 1969 \u2013 it was Gainsbourg\u2019s only hit in the UK, reaching No 1 despite the fact that the label that initially released it withdrew it in the face of a BBC ban \u2013 but they made far better records together than that. Birkin\u2019s 1973 album Di Doo Dah was a brilliant confection of symphonic pop, filled with dark, strange songs every bit as fantastic as those on the albums Gainsbourg released under his own name in the early 70s, arguably the height of his powers: listen to the superb Encore Lui for proof. The 1977 single Yesterday Yes a Day boasted one of Gainsbourg\u2019s lushest, saddest tunes and the title track of the following year\u2019s Ex-Fan des Sixties was impossibly beautiful featherweight soft-rock, with lyrics that mourned the titular decade\u2019s casualties. She had a line in fabulous, orchestrated songs with melodies inspired by classical music: Physique et Sans Issue, Lost Song, Baby Alone in Babylone. You might have expected her musical career to end with Gainsbourg\u2019s death \u2013 Birkin had never made a record without his involvement \u2013 but instead it flourished, thanks to a combination of albums on which she re-recorded Gainsbourg\u2019s songs, and collections of original material, of which 2008\u2019s marvellously understated Enfants d\u2019Hiver may be the best. She benefitted from Gainsbourg\u2019s posthumous discovery in non-Francophone countries during the 90s, which rightly transformed him from being viewed derisively \u2013 a one-hit wonder, the author of a solitary smutty novelty smash who Private Eye satirised as Serge Forward \u2013 into a hugely influential figure who subsequently left his mark on everyone from Massive Attack to the Arctic Monkeys. As Gainsbourg\u2019s oeuvre began attracting fresh attention, so did Birkin, both as a style icon and a singer. You can get a sense of the kind of regard she became belatedly held in by the guest artists attracted to her 2004 album Rendez-Vous, who ranged from Bryan Ferry to acclaimed Canadian singer-songwriter Feist. The latter turned up again on Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited, a collection of English-language covers of Gainsbourg\u2019s songs that saw Birkin collaborating with Franz Ferdinand. Even so, Jane Birkin still feels faintly underrated. Her 70s and 80s solo albums aren\u2019t as well-known as Gainsbourg\u2019s own, which makes them ripe for rediscovery: he certainly didn\u2019t save his best work for himself. And perhaps she underrated herself: in her interviews, she had a tendency to make more of Gainsbourg\u2019s genius than her own contribution. \u201cIt was very flattering to have the most beautiful songs, probably, in the French language written for one \u2026 How much talent did I really have? Perhaps not much,\u201d ran a typical quote, which seems unfair. Her lack of vocal training and her naive but powerful style meant no one sang Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s songs like her, which means she left a permanent mark on pop music: if someone in 2023 describes as duet as \u201cvery Serge Gainsbourg/Jane Birkin\u201d, you know exactly what they mean, what kind of insouciant cool they\u2019re reaching for."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/16/bbc-should-stand-up-for-itself-more-says-tony-blair", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "BBC should stand up for itself more, says Tony Blair", "lead": "Former PM said response to Huw Edwards allegations did not mean broadcaster was \u2018now a bad institution\u2019", "author": "Haroon Siddique", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 18:43:50", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627377", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4969ccebbe6703968cfecaf0ffb0a3488d0dea94/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Tony Blair has said the BBC should \u201cstand up for itself more\u201d as it faces questions over its handling of complaints about Huw Edwards. The corporation faced a crisis last week after the Sun reported allegations that a then unnamed top newsreader paid a teenager for sexually explicit images. Despite police having said Edwards had no criminal case to answer, the BBC remains under scrutiny for its response to the allegations, which are the subject of an internal investigation. The corporation\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and other senior BBC figures will appear at a pre-arranged House of Lords communications committee session on Tuesday, with the \u201cBBC\u2019s governance arrangements\u201d added to the areas of discussion \u201cin light of recent events\u201d. Asked about the corporation\u2019s response to the situation, Blair told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: \u201cI think it\u2019s a great British institution \u2026 I mean, of course these things will hit them from time to time but I don\u2019t think it means that the whole of the BBC is now a bad institution. \u201cAnd I think, frankly, the BBC should stand up for itself a bit more, to be blunt about it. And also, by the way, abroad the BBC is still regarded as an important British institution, and given our need to make sure we keep as much of a position of power in the world as we can, so whatever my disagreements from time to time, I still basically support it.\u201d Blair had several run-ins with the BBC when prime minister, most notably over the war in Iraq, with Blair accepting an apology from the corporation in 2004 for Andrew Gilligan\u2019s reporting of allegations that Downing Street had ordered an intelligence dossier on Iraq weapons of mass destruction to be \u201csexed up\u201d. But under the Conservatives the corporation has faced persistent accusations of anti-Tory basis and also threats to its existence in its current form. Last year, the then culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, tweeted that the BBC licence fee would be abolished in 2027 before backing down after a public outcry. Tory politicians were also quick to join the backlash against the BBC over the Edwards story. Rishi Sunak told reporters in the middle of the Nato summit that he found it \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cconcerning\u201d. The party\u2019s deputy chair, Lee Anderson, described the BBC as a \u201csafe haven for perverts\u201d and the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, told the BBC \u201cto get their house in order\u201d. But there has been anger among BBC staff that the Sun\u2019s reporting has not been exposed to similar scrutiny despite the tabloid rowing back from the most serious allegation in its initial story about Edwards, that of \u201cpaying a child for sexual photos\u201d \u2013 an offence it said carried a penalty of up to 14 years in prison."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/16/jeremy-vine-settlement-twitter-user-bbc-presenter", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jeremy Vine agrees deal with Twitter user who falsely named him as accused BBC star", "lead": "Radio 2 presenter says he has received apology and man has also agreed to make donation to charity", "author": "Nicola Slawson", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 18:23:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627395", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee2d695f14e9dceca80004344c2797f132e1946/536_32_1781_1069/500.jpg", "body": "Jeremy Vine has agreed a settlement with a Twitter user who falsely identified him as the BBC presenter at the centre of claims he paid a young person thousand of pounds for explicit photographs. Vine, who hosts an afternoon programme on BBC Radio 2, was one of several BBC presenters, including Gary Lineker, Rylan Clark and Nicky Campbell, who were moved to publicly deny claims on social media that they were the unnamed TV star. On Wednesday, it was revealed that the presenter was the News at Ten anchor Huw Edwards. Vine said he received an apology from a Twitter user who had \u201clibelled\u201d him by wrongly claiming he was the BBC presenter in question. He said the user had agreed to make a donation to charity at his request. \u201cHe has now acknowledged that he was wrong and has apologised. At my request, he has also agreed to pay \u00a31,000 to [the Motor Neurone Disease Association] rather than paying damages,\u201d Vine said. Before Edwards was named by his wife, Vicky Flind, as the BBC presenter facing allegations over payments for sexually explicit images, Vine appealed on Twitter for the presenter to come forward. \u201cIt\u2019s his decision but he needs to come forward now, I think,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI had a situation: I was going to see Bruce Springsteen at the weekend and my wife said: \u2018Are you going to be safe there?\u2019 That\u2019s how serious this thing is, and she gave me a baseball cap and said: \u2018You\u2019d better wear this.\u2019\u201d Similarly, Campbell spoke about his \u201cdistressing weekend\u201d after he was falsely named. He said he had contacted police about being mentioned online in connection with the story and was having conversations with his lawyers in terms of defamation. Flind released a statement on Wednesday that identified Edwards as the person accused by the Sun of giving \u00a335,000 to a crack cocaine user in return for explicit images \u2013 claims that were later denied by the young person in question. Her statement elicited substantial sympathy from colleagues, former colleagues and members of the public after it revealed that Edwards was in hospital for mental health treatment. Edwards, who was paid \u00a3435,000 last year, faces a long and expensive battle to save his career amid further accusations of potentially inappropriate behaviour, including from BBC News colleagues. Although the police concluded he had no criminal case to answer, an internal BBC investigation may still find he breached the terms of his contract in ways that were not illegal. The broadcaster said it was continuing its \u201cfact-finding investigations\u201d into allegations about the presenter."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87a9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/16/wimbledon-mens-singles-final-2023-carlos-alcaraz-v-novak-djokovic-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final 2023: Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Carlos Alcaraz recovered from a set down to topple Djokovic 1-6, 7-6(6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 and win his first Wimbledon title in a battle for the ages", "author": "Daniel Harris", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 18:20:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627417", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/87666c5d8e77b73d81fa569e5b75136620a82aaa/113_360_4168_2501/500.jpg", "body": "Right then \u2013 that, I guess, is us. Thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 sorry I couldn\u2019t get to them all \u2013 not just today, but over the last fortnight. If anyone\u2019s got any ideas as to what on earth we do tomorrow, I\u2019m all ears, but in the meantime, congratulations to both our finalists \u2013 we might just\u2019ve seen the start of a new era \u2013 and congratulations of Ons Jabeur and Mark\u00e9ta Vondrousov\u00e1 too. Otherwise, that is Wimbeldon 2023; peace out. And breathe. Cradling his new baby, Alcaraz says this is a dream come true. It\u2019s great to win but even if he\u2019d lost he\u2019d still be proud of himself, making history, playing a final against a legend on this court. It\u2019s amazing for a boy 20 years old reaching this stage so fast, he\u2019s proud of himself and his team, the work they put in every day. After the first set he thought \u201cCarlos increase the level\u201d, and says he started playing tennis watching Djokovic, who inspires him a lot, winning tournaments even when he was born.He quotes Djokovic, who said the other day that \u201c36 is the new 26\u201d and what he\u2019s doing is amazing. He\u2019s proud to have the King of Spain supporting him, he\u2019s watched him twice and he\u2019s won twice so hopes he comes more often. Wimbledon is very special for him, he\u2019s delighted to now be a member, and he will come and visit outside of the tournament for sure. What a lovely young man he is. \u201cGood afternoon to everyone,\u201d deadpans Djokovic, congratulating the champ and the nonsensical manner in which he responded to pressure. \u201cAmazing, amazing \u2026 I thought I\u2019ll have trouble with you on clay and maybe hard, not on grass \u2026 amazing way to adapt top the surface, you played maybe once or twice before this year \u2026 amazing, well done to your team.\u201d He says he you never like to lose matches like this but when the dust settles, he knows he\u2019s won many matches like this, referencing 2019 against Federer, and has won many matches he should\u2019ve lost \u201cso this is even Steven.\u201d asked if he\u2019s proud of what he\u2019s achieved this year he says tomorrow he will be but not today. These are the moments you work for, he\u2019s been blessed with many great moments but today he lost to a better player and I\u2019ve no idea how he, or anyone in this position holds it down \u2013 my eyeballs are sweating and I\u2019m just sitting here typing nonsense. He\u2019s happy to see his son there still smiling, then pauses for a few seconds just to share a look, and I\u2019m absolutely done \u2026 so is he. \u201cI love you, thank you for supporting me. I\u2019ll give you a big hug and we can all love each other.\u201d Now here comes Alcaraz, he holds the famous trophy and gently raises it to the crowd. He is Wimbledon champions and whatever else happens before he dies, no one will ever be able to take that away from him. Mazal tov, old mate. Oh man, what a work of art that was. Nothing but sport can give us that. Gerry Armstrong, ending four years as referee, receives the applause of the crowd and a medal from Kate, likewise the umpire. Now here comes Djokovic, steeling himself for magnanimity. He raises his plate \u2013 he\u2019s won seven of these, and though you only do that if you despise defeat, he\u2019ll cope. The net, battered post and all, is taken down, now here comes the presentation. Alcaraz is in his box, his team going wild, leaping and dancing, and this is what it\u2019s all about. Imagine experiencing this joy, this love, the fulfilment of a dream in real time, for us all to watch. Sport is undefeated, the greatest gift humanity has given itself, and Alcaraz sits on his chair then unwraps his sweatbands like he\u2019s just finished practise, which reminds me of something Roy Keane once said of Ra\u00fal that when he won there were no histrionics because winning was what he\u2019d worked for and what his talent deserved. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 5-4 Djokovic The crowd go wild as Alcaraz returns to play the game of his life; every mile driven, every bead of sweat, every tear shed, was to bring him to this moment; can he cope? Well, he\u2019s soon 0-15 down \u2026 but then yanks Djokovic in with a drop before finding a luscious lob for 15-all like it\u2019s nothing. IT IS NOT NOTHING. Another drop follows, on the volley and on the stretch \u2013 these men are not human, they are awesome, half-man, half-amazing, and we wind up at 30-all. P-R-E-S-S-U-R-E. A booming serve follows, Djokovic unable to control a return on the stretch that soars long, then a colossal forehand forrces Djokovic to net, AND CARLOS ALCARAZ IS THE CHAMPION! WHAT A SENSATIONAL EFFORT FROM BOTH MEN! Alcaraz falls to the turf, he embraces Djokovic, he leaps, he kicks, and he races to share the moment with his team. What a moment, for everyone \u2013 not just Alcaraz but all the people who\u2019ve sacrificed to make this happen! Amazing, amazing, amazing! Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 5-4 Djokovic* Alcaraz lands a return marginally long for 30-0, a service winner makes 40-0 \u2026 and though a forehand then drifts wide, the challenger clubs one of his own over the sideline meaning, in 90 seconds time, Carlitos Alcaraz will serve to become Wimbledon champion. Good luck and godspeed, old mate. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 5-3 Djokovic Tennis\u2019 T-1000 makes a ludicrous backhand get for 0-15 but balloons a backhand return when the new ball rears higher than expected then goes long, and this is slipping away. Then at 30-15, yet another glorious drop, like he\u2019s playing with a kid in the garden, not just delicate but directed, wide away from Djokovic, raises game point \u2026 and an ace seals the deal. That is expletive rrrridiculous behaviour, holding to 15 from 0-15; one hold away. Djokovic will now serve to stay in the championships! Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 4-3 Djokovic* OH MY ABSOLUTE COMPLETE AN UTTER DAYS! Serving at 30-15, Djokovic sends Alcaraz to the forehand corner, comes in \u2026 and is passed by a forehand cross-court so violent it leaves singe marks in the air and children crying. So Djokovic serves out wide, cleaning up with a backhand to the opposite corner, and another backhand seals a hold of disquieting composure. I feel ill. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 4-2 Djokovic A fantastic approach from Djokovic, punkt onto the line, is good for 0-15, so a second serve at a mere 121mph is backed up with a dangerous forehand that brings parity. Djokovic, though, lands another decent return and Alcaraz goes long, but then handed a second serve, he does likewise, raising arms in anguish; 30-all. Ach, and offered another chance, the breeze holds the ball such that when he attacks it it drifts long, and Alcaraz secures the game with an ace. Two holds from glory, and he\u2019s shown not the slightest flicker of nerves here. The winning line, though, is now in sight, a spectre that does funny things. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 3-2 Djokovic* Up 40-0, Djokovic nets a backhand, but a backhand into the corner suffused with the disgust of those missed balls in his previous service game, means he holds easily. Over to you, Carlitos. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 3-1 Djokovic Carlitos is flying, and we\u2019re on his back! This is wonderful to see, a love hold sealed with an ace \u2013 an out of body experience for him never mind us. Three holds away. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 2-1 Djokovic* A murderous forehand forces Djokovic to chase out wide, but the job he makes of retrieving it means Alcaraz\u2019s follow-up backhand needs to be good \u2026 and of course it\u2019s even better than good. Djokovic, though soon makes 15-all, only for Alcaraz to find a wrongfooting backhand, backed up with a leaping overhead on the run \u2026 four and a quarter hours into the match. So Djokovic makes 30-all \u2026 then nets a forehand, and now it\u2019s the challenger with a chance to break! Can the champ find a first serve? What do you think? Of course he can! But, on top in the rally, he can\u2019t quite put the point away \u2026 Alcaraz won\u2019t permit him to put the point away \u2026 he then slips, gets up, and when he drops short with a forehand, Alcaraz punishes a backhand winner down the line for the blow that might just win him the championships! He again cups an ear at the crowd, Djokovic clumps racket into net post, shattering one and denting t\u2019other and is warned \u2026 but when all\u2019s said and done it\u2019s the challenger with the break! He\u2019s four holds away from the title! *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 1-1 Djokovic Djokovic makes 0-15 but yet another fit as you like drop brings Alcaraz parity. We wind up at 30-all, whereupon a deep return followed by a booming forehand into the corner raise break point. I said earlier Djokovic was Raputing, but now I\u2019m getting Max Cady, De Niro\u2019s character in Cape Fear, and yet another sapping, fluctuating rally, each player tipping it in their favour by upping the pace, ends when the champ takes a forehand out of the air having done all the hard work, only to net! Alcaraz salutes the crowd, in relief as much as in pride, then lays a drop that\u2019s so good it\u2019s actually funny to make advantage. He must have the resting heart-rate of a sloth, and two vicious, violent forehands secure the game after another fantastic Djokovic return looks to have snatched control of the point. We are privileged to be living in their time. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 0-1 Djokovic* Chale, here we go! It\u2019s rare a match lives up to the hype, but it\u2019s also rare a match seemed so certain to live up to the hype. There\u2019s a skill aspect, of course, and these two are overflowing with that, but what makes them them and this this is the competitive charisma of these two. Their presence on the court, their certainty in what they\u2019re doing, the ability to channel everything they\u2019ve ever thought and experienced into the racket they hold is what sets them apart, and as I type that, Alcaraz puts a way a touch volley for 30-all, then lovingly caresses a backhand winner down the line as Djokovic comes in! Break point! And just look at that! A second serve down the T is too good even at 76mph, but up advantage and with game point almost in the back pocket, Alcaraz finds delicious swazz on a forehand down the line, ball barely off the carpet. He\u2019s an absolute magician, but Djokovic again gets to within a point of the game and when a slice drops long, he\u2019s into the lead. He;s the better player again, and at change of ends we see that he\u2019s stepped forward a yard or so so is now hitting from inside the baseline. That\u2019s one reason he\u2019s dictating the rallies again; can Alcaraz adjust? *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-6 Djokovic Djokovic races in to flip a backhand winner down the line and a double means he\u2019s two points away from the set. It\u2019s absolutely mind-boggling what\u2019s going on here \u2013 Djokovic looked finished except he\u2019s never finished, the Rasputin of tennis, and an error from Alcaraz means he has three set points. The first is saved but the second yields a double, and after three hours and 54 minutes, we and they have to suffer through the decider we and they deserve. I am in absolute awe of these two meshuggners, I cannot wait to see what happens next and I\u2019ve not the slightest clue as to what\u2019s coming next. These are the days of our lives, people. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-5 Djokovic* The wind, we\u2019re told, has dropped, and it was Djokovic who was affected by it the more. At 15-0, he plays a really good point, again the more aggressive man, and it does look like the match is coming down to that: who can get off first. It\u2019s a love hold, and we\u2019ve had yet another momentum shift; Alcaraz will now serve to stay in the fourth. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 3-4 Djokovic Eeeeesh! Djokovic despatches an overhead for 15-all and Alcaraz slips into the jazz splits like MC Hammer \u2026 but he\u2019s fine, a service winner restoring his sense of (relative) wellbeing. From there, he closes out, cementing the game with an ace, and how on earth might we tackle a decider? Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 2-4 Djokovic* What Djokovic wouldn\u2019t give for a straightforward hold here, but at 15-0 Alcaraz again does that thing, shockingly increasing the venom on the forehand side for a cross-court winner that his opponent applauding. The intensity of this is almost tear-inducing, two absolute legends emptying their souls for our delectation, for the glorification of humankind, and Djokovic secures a crucial consolidation to 30! Will someone please hold me? *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 2-3 Djokovic Is Djokovic returning? A big forehand sets up a delicate volley, and he\u2019s hitting harder and flatter now, looking to regain the initiative. A poor backhand into the net means he\u2019s down 30-15, but an alcarazian error makes 30-all, then a forehand flies wide and Djokovic has break point! It\u2019d be the height of him to seize it, but he goes long on the backhand \u2013 just, but unnecessarily \u2013 then a tremendous return forces a netted riposte and here comes another opportunity. And Alcaraz lands his first serve but Djokovic plans a return close to the line, the challenger goes long, challenges \u2026 and the outermost fibre of the ball catches the outermost fibre of chalk! They replay the point, Alcaraz comes in behind his serve, winds up \u2026 and caresses a gorgeous drop \u2026 then nets again! The deuces in this match have been as good as in any match I can remember, and this is expletive wonderful stuff, Alcaraz again snatching momentum in the rally by suddenly upping pace, but this time Djokovic directs a fantastic backhand at his tootsies and he nets at net! The champ has his break! He blows a kiss at the crowd, Alcaraz clobbers his chair, and we\u2019ve yet another improbable twist! Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 2-2 Djokovic* At 30-0 I find myself shouting in a room on my bill, Djokovic apparently doing enough only for Alcaraz to stomp a huge stride and send his overhead screeching back across him and cross-court, racket almost vertical and shoulder-high! From there, it\u2019s soon 30-all, an ace out wide challenged and revealed to be fractionally wide. Djokovic, though, conjures an angle to whizz a terrific backhand winner to the corner \u2026 only to find something similar defeating his stretch, a slice bringing him in to set up the forehand winner from Alcaraz. No matter, Djokovic then does the necessary, running around his backhand to send a forehand into the corner which seals a crucial and probably title-saving hold. \u201cWhat do you make of the pre-serve shenanigans of the two players?\u201d asks Gavin Scott. \u201cDjokovic with up to 13 bounces from hand before a serve and Alcaraz collecting four balls then rejecting two, one to each ball boy? No wonder the match is taking so long.\u201d Real talk, I\u2019m rough and crook, so I\u2019m desperate for this match to be over, except I\u2019m also celebrating anything that makes it last longer because I spend my life seeking out contests like this, and on the odd occasion I\u2019m lucky enough to live one, I\u2019ll take anything that ups the drama and suspense. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 2-1 Djokovic What\u2019s so brilliant about this \u2013 OK, lots of things are so brilliant about this \u2013 but one thing that\u2019s so brilliant about this is Alcaraz doing to Djokovic what Djokovic did to him in Paris, turning his strengths against him to the point of exhaustion. Alcaraz is playing with such conviction now, coming in to punch a backhand volley then clobbering an ace for 40-15. And even when great work from Djokovic makes 40-30, he\u2019s made to play two more balls than he might\u2019ve done after which a backhand down the line goes into the top of the net \u2013 that was a chance \u2013 but he does work his way to deuce then, up advantage, Alcaraz doubles. Will he be punished? Er, maybe! Up advantage again, a forehand down the line hits the net cord and makes deuce, but then with the next rally pootling along, Alcaraz suddenly unloads the suitcase at a forehand, puts away the eventuating volley, closes out, and Djokovic looks anguished! Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 1-1 Djokovic* Alcaraz stays in the point, Djokovic-style, the error duly follows, and a ball onto the line makes 0-30. I daresay Djokovic now regrets that double-break game, and when Alcaraz annihilates a forehand winner he\u2019s left flat on his face like a lizard drinking. Two break points, and if one is taken, it\u2019ll be impossible to see a way back even for this obscene specimen of physiological perfection \u2026 but a backhand winner down the line saves the first and a long forehand the second. Deuce, and I\u2019m wincing at the prospect so can\u2019t begin to contemplate the evilness of the flashbacks Djokovic is experiencing, but a tremendous stretch-volley makes advantage and a big serve secures a hold of Ade Akinfenwa proportions. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to Wimbledon for over 60 years, I\u2019m from Wimbledon, and I worked at the Championships during student days,\u201d says Rob Lewis, \u201cand I don\u2019t remember such a long game - 32 points! Is that a record? I felt for your fingers, typing about it. Never mind the players, how could they withstand that pressure for so long?\u201d *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 1-0 Djokovic From 0-30, Alcaraz makes 30-all, then Djokovic nets and almost looks resigned. A service winner follows, Alcaraz dances to his chair, and he\u2019s playing like a boy \u2013 like a boy-man \u2013 who knows. Djokovic has never been beaten at Wimbledon from a set up, a ludicrous state of affairs, but he looks all but beaten this afternoon. Djokovic is back from what Tim termed \u201cthe bathroom break of his life\u201d \u2013 what an accolade that is! To the regiment I wish I was there! \u2013 and we go again. \u201cWhat a damp squib end to that third set from Djok - he just \u2018Kyrgyossed\u2019 the final game!\u201d reckons James W. \u201cAnd Carlitos, serving first in the fourth set, surely has to fancy himself now. Unless Djok Andy-Murrays himself from being down 2-1 in sets via a bathroom mirror, comin\u2019 right up! Needs a change of tactics I feel - Alcaraz is winning all the long rallies the last hour or so. Djok needs to keep points short. Get his first serve sorted.\u201d He needs to find a way of leading, whether by keeping Alcaraz moving or going for lines, because at the moment, it\u2019s the kid controlling the pace of the rallies by going big sooner. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 6-1 Djokovic* A forehand winner down the line makes 0-30, Djokovic nets a forehand volley, and now faces three set points; does he let this one go? I imagine he\u2019ll want Alcaraz to serve out and go first in the fourth, but at 40-15 a backhand pass catches him coming in, AND CARLOS ALCARAZ IS A SET AWAY FROM BECOMING WIMBLEDON CHAMPION! More than that, though, he\u2019s dominating \u2013 dominating in a way we rarely see Djokovic dominated \u2013 and shonuff, off he goes for a lag and a reset. Mates, what we\u2019re seeing here is spectacular; make sure to savour every last second of it. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 5-1 Djokovic The last thing Djokovic needs is a swift hold but Alcaraz races to 30-0, a netted forehand makes 40, and the hold is secured to 15! I daresay Djokovic will take a break of some sort at the end of this set; two sets down against Sinner last term, he went for a slash and had a chat with himself in the mirror, but this an entirely different affair. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 4-1 Djokovic* Djokovic makes 30-15, then 40-15 with a nice backhand volley. He needs to find a way of dictating the points because at the moment he\u2019s reacting, forced to dig out a hopeful pass that\u2019s easily put away at the net behind a booming backhand. Then, at 40-30, a backhand slices drifts wide, but a much more proactive forehand yields advantage, but one into the net brings us back to deuce. Djokovic isn\u2019t unloading on his groundstrokes now, and that tentative approach is allowing his opponent to dictate \u2026 though, as a I type that, a backhand down the line raises another game point, this one given up with a slice into the net. In his box, Goran looks concerned, and how is this only the third set? Somehow, it feels like we\u2019ve been playing three minutes but also three days, and an error from Djokovic means he\u2019s facing a point for a double break \u2026 saved when Alcaraz frames a forehand. This time, he\u2019s much more aggressive, a forehand onto the sideline doing the business \u2026 but a similar shot is then sent wide, and Alcaraz will know that this is his chance because these are not errors we see often, certainly not in such quantities. So, perhaps to get himself going, Djokovic picks a ruckus with the umpire, I think about the balls not being returned to him quickly enough given his struggles with the shot-clock \u2013 how dare time not bend to his will \u2013 and a double means he\u2019s facing another break point, saved when Alcaraz botches a forehand that has him chuntering at his box. This is now a stone-cold, bona fide epic, Djokovic netting a backhand to bring about a seventh deuce, and even if he moves through it, he\u2019s still behind, a sobering thought. But again, Alcaraz is on top in the next rally, a monstrous forehand the key shot, but a backhand down the line is well wide so brings us back to deuce. I\u2019m exhausted just watching these two absolute, complete and utter freaks of nature; to see sport played so well and so hard is among the most moving things on our planet, and when a ball flies into the crowd, the bloke who picks it up is publicly admonished for deciding it\u2019s now his. All he wanted to do was save it further punishment, but he\u2019s ordered to send it back, then Djokovic surrenders and saves yet another double-break point only to immediately yield another, and the pace is telling! A huge serve regains deuce and if he loses this game, I wonder if he lets the set leave so he\u2019s got something left for the fourth; opposite, Alcaraz grins, just getting started, and once more break point to the good; he\u2019s hitting the net a lot here, not getting to or hitting with the same pop as previously, and we\u2019re now at our 12th deuce; I am in total awe of these total nutters, their monomania equal parts inspirational and terrifying, and just as it looks like Djokovic, now up advantage, has sealed the game with a succession of forehands, Alcaraz unleashes a backhand like a hadouken then raises his seventh breaking opportunity in this Ben Hur of games, and THIS TIME, AFTER 32 POINTS, DJOKOVIC NETS! He roars to the heavens, relief and elation expanding his mind, and he\u2019s two games away from a 2-1 lead! The old man is tottering, and this is some of the most gloriously wild existing we can possibly imagine! \u201cI don\u2019t like Djokovic, for a good many reasons,\u201d begins Matt Dony, \u201cbut he is obviously a phenomenal player. And also one of the most mentally indestructible athletes I\u2019ve ever seen. He fairly often drops a set, or looks like he might have a wobble, but somehow you still almost always expect him to win. It\u2019s like he has some superhuman ability to put a poor shot/game/set behind him and go again. All elite sportspeople have got, by definition, a lot of self-belief. But Djokovic is on another level.\u201d Yup, but he\u2019s being tested here because as in Paris, it\u2019s Alacaraz getting off first now, and there\u2019s no cramp \u2013 admittedly caused by him \u2013 coming to the rescue. *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 3-1 Djokovic In comms, Todd Woodbridge notes that Alcaraz is varying his speed of shot to good effect, and even more than that, it\u2019s now him setting the agenda of the points \u2013 it feels a long time since Djokovic hit a winner from the back. But two errors leave him facing 15-30, and a test \u2026 then another error and two break-back points follow. The first is saved when a ball holds up in the wind and Djokovic nets, then one shoots through and he frames it! Deuce! Carlitos, these are the days of your life can you seize them? A drop makes advantage then a return loops long, and in Alcaraz\u2019s box, his little brother is on his feet! Imagine that, watching your big bro play the Wimbledon singles final; how do you even handle that? Well, I\u2019m pleased to report he\u2019s doing a fine job. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 2-1 Djokovic* Alcaraz is enjoying himself now, making 15-all with a flip down the line and slam-dunk smash, Djokovic then netting to give him another sniff. Quickly extinguished, at least in the first instance, a glorious net exchange settled by a stretching volley that cuts off a forehand cross-court. From there, Djokovic closes out, and he\u2019s still in touch in the third. This is like that bit on a roller coaster when you\u2019re chugging and clicking uphill\u2026 *Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 2-0 Djokovic Whatever happens from here, Alcaraz has made a statement today: he\u2019s ready. But is he ready enough? Gosh, at 30-15 a poor shot sits up to be punished but Djokovic, having to supply all his own pace, goes at it too hard, and shortly afterwards the consolidation is sealed via netted return. \u201cAlcaraz has started serving a lot better,\u201d reckons Coach Calv. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Djokovic was that amazing in the first, he was solid and Alcaraz served badly. He\u2019s doing better now and Novak is gonna have to get more aggressive cos Alcaraz is getting on top of him.\u201d Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) 1-0 Djokovic* Novak Djokovic just lost a tiebreak! Whatever next? Well, an ace for 30-15, then a ball that dies on him for 30-all, hitting a bit of grass rubbed away by footfall \u2026 then two monstrous forehands raise break point! Alcaraz is in the ascendancy now, can he capitalise? Er, not immediately, a tame backhand handing over deuce, but a sliced backhand then sets up a big forehand, and when Djokovic comes in, he\u2019s passed cross-court! Advantage Alcaraz \u2026 and after Djokovic has a let called \u2013 there\u2019s displeasure \u2013 a backhand into the net gives him the break! For the first time in the match, it\u2019s the challenger in charge! Don\u2019t forget: this isn\u2019t the only incredible sport bestowed upon us this afternoon. Alcaraz 1-6 7-6(6) Djokovic AND THERE IT IS! A first serve \u2013another first serve \u2013 out wide, but this time Alcaraz follows it and, as Djokovic comes in behind it, he spirits a colossal, match-shaping, life-changing backhand winner down the line! Do we got oursleves a ball-game? We got ourselves a ball-game, and now it\u2019s Alcaraz cupping ear to the crowd! What a match we have on our hands now! Don\u2019t you dare go away! Alcaraz 1-6 6-6 (7-6) Djokovic At 5-5, we know this breaker will come down to a moment, and when Djokovic wins a net-point at the end of a 17-stroker rally, the crowd chant his name as he prepares to play set point. Maybe it\u2019s reverse-psychology. And shonuff he nets for 6-6 the nets a backhand, and now it\u2019s his turn to serve at set-point down! Even the infallible fail sometimes! Alcaraz 1-6 6-6 (5-5) Djokovic Now then! Djokovic, a long way back, nets a disguised slice and it\u2019s ridiculous how surprising it is to see him pick the wrong option under intense pressure. A big serve, bigger forehand and delicate drop follow \u2013 those are hands \u2013 but Alcaraz sticks with it, flipping a wrongfooting forehand into the corner to keep us level. Next, a long rally, the kind Djokovic almost always wins, but this time, a fantastic drop disguised as a mass-murderous forehand keeps us on serve. And this time, Djokovic runs out of time to serve, so he\u2019s warned \u2026 then finds a fine backhand when in trouble in the rally, but at the net, Alcaraz can only net his volley. This is intense! Alcaraz 1-6 6-6 (2-3) Djokovic Immediately, Alcaraz goes long, ceding the mini-break, and two first serves follow; of course they do, and it\u2019s 3-0 Djokovic. A return then drops long, though, bringing the challenger into the breaker, and an ace sliced out wide keeps the deficit to one. Alcaraz 1-6 6-6 Djokovic* A break here would make a very strong point and a double at 15-0 invites Alcaraz into the game, but a lazy long return means Djokovic is two points away from a breaker. And he dominates the next rally too, but when he plays two identical forehands to the backhand corner, Alcaraz mixes up his response, a slice inciting the error, and now he\u2019s two points away from the set. From there, of course, Djokovic closes out in short order, and he\u2019s won 15 breakers straight \u2013 six in Paris without a single unforced error and six more here. Good luck, Carlitos old mate. *Alcaraz 1-6 6-5 Djokovic Yup, an unforced error hands Djokovic 0-15 and Alcaraz needs to focus here \u2026 and does, a monstrous backhand down the line setting up the point even though Djokovic gets it back; he can\u2019t, though, make his next forehand. It\u2019s unbelievable how hard Alcaraz is having to work for everything, likewise his capacity for that work and the alacrity with which he\u2019s embracing it, a brutal serve down the T securing the game and forcing Djokovic to serve for a second-set breaker. Alcaraz 1-6 5-5 Djokovic* Usually, new balls favour the server, but I wonder if Alcaraz will attack here \u2013 if he can. Well he doesn\u2019t have to to begin with, the extra zip taking a Djokovic forehand wide, but when a tremendous get to a fine attempted pass sits up for a backhand winner, he snatches at it, sending it cross-court but wide, before netting another opportunity down the line; 30-15. He makes 30-all though, then Djokovic butchers a forehand that\u2019s called out; he challenges and we see that it dropped onto the final fibre of the line or, put another way, he catches that clean and he\u2019s set point down. So we wind up at deuce, and I wonder if the match is here: Alcaraz has been handed three unforced errors, and if he can\u2019t parlay them into anything tangible, you\u2019d fear for him. And, well, oh Carlitos! He plays a slice when he shouldn\u2019t, perhaps spooked by the lad on the other side of the net, hits that net, and then when Alcaraz plays a luscious drop, Djokovic runs it down, just, somehow gets it back via net-cord, and when he finishes the point with another drop, flicked over and across, for the first time he looks despondent. I\u2019m not surprised, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m anticipating a break in the next game. \u201cPeople criticising Djokovic\u2019s behaviour and praising Rafa\u2019s?\u201d asks Oliver Loksa. \u201cRemember the absurd amount of time Nadal used to take before important serves? Each player has her\u2019his way to settler her/himself and destabilise the opponent. C\u2019mon...\u201d I agree \u2013 and, what\u2019s more, I enjoy it. *Alcaraz 1-6 5-4 Djokovic Between games, Djokovic shouts in Srrbo-Croat which makes me think BBC should employ a translator like fight promotions do so we can hear what\u2019s said in corners between rounds. Anyhow, Alcaraz nets, then dematerialises a forehand winner that Brad Pitt likes very much, and there\u2019s little praise richer than that. An ace out wide follows, and this is now a very serious contest, intense, punishing and enveloping \u2026 but a few Alcaraz errors from slipping away from him and us. As I type that, though, it\u2019s Djokovic who slips chasing a forehand and at 40-15, a service winner means he must now serve to stay in set two. Alcaraz 1-6 4-4 Djokovic* The shot-clock appears to stop when Djokovic is slow to serve, not in the action of it but in returning to the line once time is called. Naturally, he quickly makes 15-0, but then nets a backhand to bring Alcaraz into the game. So Djokovic ups the power on the forehand, which reminds me of a time I watched him play Murray at the o2 where, from high up, you get a really good idea of how hard they\u2019re hitting it. Murray\u2019s shots were noticeably more venomous, but of course Djokovic beat him, and he holds here to 15. Talking of Murray, I should say that he\u2019s in the house this afternoon because who doesn\u2019t want to watch this \u2013 what a shame injury robbed him of the ability to compete at this level. *Alcaraz 1-6 4-3 Djokovic Alcaraz played two perfect points at the start of that game, but it was nowhere near enough. This, though, is excellent, a love hold completed with an ace, and Djokovic is back serving again seconds after fighting his arse off for a hold. \u201cRe: Nole not winning any popularity stakes and people refusing to admire him for the insane tennis he is playing for over 15 years,\u201d says James W. \u201cSince when was professional sport about being popular, and not, like, I dunno, WINNING? I think Fed and Nad are to \u2018blame\u2019 for this. They were nice middle-class kids from nice comfortable Western European middle class upbringing, with nice hair, and manners (I wouldn\u2019t say Novak doesn\u2019t have manners either?). The social media angle amplified this and made this almost a prerequisite to being a great sportsman, when in no tennis decade was this ever necessary? Remember how McEnroe/Connors/Nastase used to behave? Does anybody say they were anything other than great tennis players (Novak doesn\u2019t berate the umpires or grab his crotch in front of the fans)? I don\u2019t think so. Novak\u2019s career will not be fully appreciated till he retires, maybe even a decade after he does so. And yet here is a man who invariably has warm victory/defeat speeches to impart, reads the room a lot better than people give him credit for at speaks (at least) seven languages (and does a lot for charidee)! And I say this as a Federer fan. Sure, some stuff like no vaccine and the Australia/Adria tour situation did not help his popularity, but he was mostly hated by the casual tennis fans (which is to say, *most* of them) way before any of that happened. Those things just amplified people\u2019s prejudices against him - their mind had long been made up about him. Confirmation bias?\u201d I don\u2019t think people refuse to admire his tennis, but for various reasons, some of which you list, he\u2019s never quite connected with many of the people others have. But the Wimbledon crowd never really took to Connors and McEnroe until they started losing, which is as mindblowing now as then. Alcaraz 1-6 3-3 Djokovic* Oh man, between games we learn that Annabel Croft, who\u2019ll be looking after the presentation ceremony, recently lost her husband, Mel; long life and godspeed, old mate. Back on court, another long rally to open game six, this time well won by Alcaraz, who then smokes an inside-out backhand onto the line for 0-30! We said earlier that the speed at which he learns is absurd, and he\u2019s already processed information he picked up in set one to compete in set two, only to cede his advantage in short order. That\u2019s the thing with playing Djokovic \u2013 everything is a fight \u2013 and two first serves elicit two long returns, and this set is already 42 minutes old! *Alcaraz 1-6 3-2 Djokovic Again, Djokovic goes in hard to the Alcaraz forehand and again he gets the result he wants, ball netted for 0-15; an ace quickly redeems the situation. We wind up at deuce and it feels like the champ is upping the ante again though, as I type that, Alcaraz plays a gorgeous backhand volley that his opponent theatrically applauds; what a mensch! He can\u2019t close out his first advantage, but he rushes through his second, and we\u2019re hitting a standard here \u2013 though for our drama, we need the challenger to find a way in this set. \u201cHave you noticed how Djokovic always plays the crowd, albeit subtly, to destabilise his opponent when he wants to mentally distract him?\u201d asks Josephine Pallandt. \u201cSo contrary to fair play, not worthy of any win really, I miss Federer and Nadal\u2019s professionalism and fair play so much. Cannot wait for Djokovic to be beaten properly for this righteous behaviour to leave tennis. No matter how much you win, a winner is something else altogether to me!\u201d I know what you mean but I love the theatre and the edge \u2013 it\u2019s a contest out there, with lots of different elements, and I\u2019m not sure Nadal was averse to deploying gamesmanship when it suited him. Alcaraz 1-6 2-2 Djokovic* Is Djokovic the greatest matchplayer we\u2019ve ever seen, any sport? Phil Taylor is up there, but there aren\u2019t many even in the same postcode \u2013 Floyd Mayweather, I guess, is there, Alex Volkanovski is building a case and Georges St-Pierre already has, but back on court, Alcaraz makes 0-30 then nets a forehand he ought to have made. He does, though, find himself at 30-40 \u2013 Djokovic isn\u2019t getting as many first serves in as earlier \u2013 whereupon we enjoy 29 shots of evil endurance before Alcaraz errs, Djokovic cupping an ear and noising up the crowd to appreciate his earth-shattering magnificence as much as he does. A lush riposte to a drop, flicked over and across the net, followed by a service winner, duly secure the hold, and this is becoming everything we hoped it\u2019d be. \u201cAlcaraz,\u201d begins Jeremy Boyce. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s overawed by the occasion, nothing seems to phase him. I think it\u2019s more he\u2019s just trying a little bit TOOOOO hard and needs to crank back down a notch or too. Put it down to yoof. And the fact that he\u2019s facing the ultimate tennis assassin.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019d go with the second point more than the first \u2013 he\u2019s been denied the scope to which he\u2019s used, and once it becomes a battle of consistency rather than strokemaking, there\u2019s only one winner. *Alcaraz 1-6 2-1 Djokovic Apparently the King of Spain is in attendance, which is surprising as I assumed Gilo would be watching the ODI. Oh, the other King of Spain. Alcaraz makes 15-all with a volley, saluting the crowd, and this time when Djokovic elasticlimbs another get, he\u2019s there to burn a forehand winner into the vacated space. He\u2019s a presence on court now, like he\u2019s just nutted a brick to guzzle a mushroom, and even when a net cord takes a forehand away from him, he\u2019s still able to make 40-30. Djokovic forces him to deuce, though, a lob sails long to raise break-back point, at at the end of another long rally, Alcaraz swipes a forehand topspin cross-court and wide, Djokovic roaring at the crowd for their audacity in wanting to see a contest. like mac before him, he\u2019s incredible at converting antipathy into points. Alcaraz 1-6 2-0 Djokovic* Now, can Alcaraz put pressure on the Djokovic serve? He did in the first game of the match, so knows he can, and what\u2019s that? A fault, followed by one of the worst deliveries you\u2019ll ever see landing two feet inside the advantage court! And when Djokovic goes long on the backhand, a chance for Alcaraz! Djokovic made just two unforced errors in set one and he\u2019s quickly back into stride here, a slice and a volley closing the gap in this game. AND HAVE A LOOK! Alcaraz opens shoulders to unleash a shrieking forehand, except Djokovic stretches into a phenomenal get, switches momentum with a backhand down the line and second later puts away a forehand at the net. I\u2019m sorry, that is obscene behaviour, absolutely soul-curdling for Alcaraz, who responds well when trailing 40-30, slamming down an overhead for deuce, and now then! Djokovic misses a riposte to a drop, sarcastically applauding the crowd when they cheer the prospect of a contest, before a service winner makes deuce again. Meantime in comms, they note that Djokovic is using every split second of his allotted service time, and when Alcaraz earns advantage, Djokovic drags a forehand wide! At the end of an eight-minute game, the challenger lands his first shot! \u201cI\u2019m not Djokovic\u2019s biggest fan,\u201d says Simon McMahon, \u201cthough you\u2019ve got to admire him if nothing else, and having watched my team lose their first competitive fixture of the new football season (!) yesterday to a side who were playing in the Scottish Lowland League last season, I was hoping Alcaraz might stop the Novak juggernaut today. Shows how much I know. Still, that picture of Stefan Edberg cheered me up.\u201d *Alcaraz 1-6 1-0 Djokovic This is more like it, Alcaraz making 40-15 before a high-kicking serve is framed wide. \u201cAlcaraz is playing some spectacular shots,\u201d writes Colum Fordham, \u201cbut the wily old champion Novak always seems to have the answer. The young Spaniard seems slightly overawed by the occasion, underhitting or overhitting his shots. The difference in experience is telling. But who knows? Alcatraz may still get out of jail.\u201d Yup, a 6-1 set is still only a set \u2013 provided Alcaraz can get himself going with a proper level of consistency. Alcaraz 1-6 Djokovic* At 15-0, Alcaraz shouts towards his box, trying to get himself going \u2013 though he\u2019s not playing badly, exactly, more his opponent is playing better and exploiting every little error he makes. A big second serve gives Djokovic 30-0, a netted return raises three set points, and a forehand onto the line yields an overhead despatched with minimum fuss and maximum prejudice. That is a sonning-off of a set if ever I\u2019ve seen one, an absolute lesson in how to play opponent and occasion. Meantime, Henry Searle of Great Britain has won the boys\u2019 singles, beating Yaroslav Demin 4 and 4. *Alcaraz 1-5 Djokovic It\u2019s hard not to watch this and think of GBG favourite, Ons, who was crushed by the pressure yesterday despite playing in her second one of these. I guess this time, it was the expectation \u2013 she thought she was going to win and celebrate the moment of her life \u2013 but the point stands: for all the incredible skills of these players is incredible, what\u2019s more incredible still is their ability to execute them, consistently, when it\u2019s as intense as this. Meantime, Alcaraz again faces 30-all and has to work like an animal for his putaway, before sticking a terrific forehand down the line for his first game of the match. It\u2019s taken him 31 minutes and already the crowd are going wild for him, feart that this\u2019ll be a blowout. Djokovic must now serve for the first set. Alcaraz 0-5 Djokovic* When I watch matches like this I think of what Jack Slack, the great MMA analyst says, about facing a serious opponent: take away what they do well. So Djokovic is going hard to the Alcaraz forehand, preventing him from winding up on it, and he holds to 15. And here\u2019s the thing: he can play better than this. *Alcaraz 0-4 Djokovic Alcaraz will be feeling it as he serves, and Djokovic increases the angst with a banging forehand return when sent out wide for 0-15 then, at 15-all, elicits a slip by dropping the dropper. Quickly, it\u2019s 15-40, and trouble for Alcaraz, who responds well saving both break points when Djokovic first goes long then nets a return. So to deuce, and a netted backhand \u2013 which follows a remorseless backhand onto the line \u2013 means a further break point, and when Alcaraz nets a backhand, that\u2019s the double break! I hate to say it but this is, so far a lesson for the youngster \u2013 he\u2019s not getting outplayed, exactly, but he is learning about the level of consistency it takes to challenge this bot on this stage. Alcaraz 0-3 Djokovic* Alcaraz makes 15-30, a development which precipitates the longest and best rally of the match so far, the ball screeching in pain as it\u2019s hammered back and forth before Djokovic steps in to force the error. Alcaraz then misses narrowly with a tweener, burning a challenge in the process, and a service winner closes out another tight service game; already the difference here is Djokovic on the big points. \u201cDjokovic is incroyable, of course,\u201d says Gregory Phillips, \u201cand quite possibly the GOAT, but I think too much is made of his head-to-head advantage over Nadal and Federer in particular. Federer\u2019s peak (04-09) was over by the time Djokovic\u2019s began in 2011. That said, and as difficult as it can be to warm to him, Djokovic is astonishingly good and it will take an amazing effort to beat him. But if anyone can do it...\u201d I think the thing with Djokovic is that what do you target if you play him? If I need someone to play a match to save my life, I don\u2019t even have to think about who I\u2019m picking. *Alcaraz 0-2 Djokovic (denotes server) Djokovic was already a pro when Alcaraz was born, that is rrrridiculous, and it\u2019s the youngster who looks tight now, overhitting a forehand then being passed with a forehand cross-court, ceding 0-30. That\u2019s why he opted to receive, and when a gust of wind catches a Djokovic groundstroke, the ball holds in the air and Alcaraz larrups long to hand over three break points. He saves the first when Djokovic goes long and the second with an inside-out leaping forehand winner, but when he leaves a half-courter, Djokovic punishes a forehand that he can only redirect over the baseline! First blood to the champ! Alcaraz 0-1 Djokovic* (denotes server) Djokovic begins with a service winner out wide, but a backhand down the line is good enough for 15-all. And have a look! Djokovic\u2019s second serve is perhaps his sole remaining weakness and Alcaraz devours this one, spanking a forehand winner cross-court as his man slips. It\u2019s soon 30-all though, at which point Djokovic arranges a backhand putaway at the net \u2026 only to hit that net! I said Alcaraz would be nervous, but you almost never see that man miss those shots; it gets to everyone. Naturally, a service winner quickly extinguishes break point, Alcaraz now kiai-ing his shots, shouting before rather than as he plays them, and after one game point is retreived, Djokovic closes out for a protracted hold. And \u2026 play! Alcaraz wins the toss and, as per the current vogue, elects to receive. I\u2019m not surprised he wants to ease himself in with a game he doesn\u2019t have to win, and the two men pose, arms around, for a photo at the net. Djokovic is affecting \u2013 and, no doubt feels \u2013 overwhelming confidence. Alcaraz still hasn\u2019t shaved, presumably because it\u2019s bein hametzarim, the three weeks \u2013 the period between the walls of Jerusalem being breached and the destruction of the temple. Here\u2019s a colossal tune in that regard. I\u2019m pleased to note that my post-McEnroe and Martina childhood favourite, Stefan Edberg, is in the house. In terms of gear, only Andre Agassi comes close. Here come our players! Big Suze in the house! And here\u2019s Freddie Windsor in 1996. Also going on: And there\u2019s been a development at the Rose Bowl! Regular readers will also have heard me whining about illness, so here\u2019s what I learnt from a GP mate this morning: if you\u2019re feeling nauseous, eat salty crackers. On which point, regular readers will be wondering where Calvin Betton, our resident coach, has got to with telling who\u2019s going to win and how, but wonder no more because here he is: \u201cWill hang on how well Alcaraz attacks. Novak will basically set his stall out then dare Alcaraz to win the match. He\u2019ll hit to a length and move him around. If Alcaraz attacks well I think he\u2019ll win. But I think Djokovic will probably win.\u201d On which point, I say this a lot, but tennis has the furthest to go in terms of explaining the technicalities of the game with a pro\u2019s eye. This pod does this better than anything else I\u2019ve heard or watched. Email! \u201cSo here we are, another Wimbledon final,\u201d says James W. \u201cI will take Djokovic to win, just, (7-5 in the fifth set). Pretty sure Alcaraz wins the first set. If not, It\u2019s Djok in 4.\u201d There are very few outcomes that\u2019d surprise me, but but Djokovic in four looks good. I\u2019d expect him to win the first though, because Alcaraz is more likely to be nervous, especially given what happened in Paris. Talking of Becker losing to Doohan, here\u2019s a Joy of Six from the vault taking in that and other upsets. Ah man, we\u2019re watching footage of Pat Cash winning Wimbledon \u2013 what a moment that was. I remember him saying that when Boom Boom lost to Peter Doohan \u2013 imagine the double defending champ playing on Court 2 these days \u2013 he knew no one left in the draw could beat him, and explains now that he was a pioneer in terms of having a team, who he went to greet at the moment of victory. This made me laugh. An apology: those of you who were following us on Friday might recall a riveting chinwag about how best to consume challah \u2013 I was, indeed, called a heretic for suggesting one might use it for a sandwich. For that, I feel no sorrow whatsoever, but I did omit to say that it is (also) tremendous when dipped in the sauce of whatever meat you\u2019ve cooked. It\u2019s raining in SW19, but for now, the roof remains open. Afternoon all and welcome to Wimbledon 2023 \u2013 day 14! Obviously we all say this every year, but what a fortnight it\u2019s been \u2026 and what a fortnight it still is. Because what we\u2019re about to see has the potential to be one of the great matches. Though excessive hyperbole is my job \u2013 to the extent I\u2019m even using the tautology \u201cexcessive hyperbole\u201d \u2013 please be certain, these are not words I use lightly. But contextually and actually, Carlos Alcaraz [1] v Novak Djokovic [2] is as compelling, thrilling and downright spectacular a match-up as exists in sport right now, and it\u2019s ours, all ours. Let\u2019s begin with the context. Though Alcaraz is just 20, he\u2019s very clearly a generational talent, a bouncing bundle of joy and aggression with a forehand like a sonic boom and a drop shot to marry your daughter. A month ago, he was a novice on grass, but since then has won Queens and rinsed his way to this final, perceptibly improving with every match. He\u2019s also already won his debut biggun, at last year\u2019s US Open \u2026 except missing from the field was Djokovic, prohibited from entering America because of his anti-vaxx stance. So today is his chance to expunge that asterisk from in the minds of all those who know just how ridiculous his opponent is \u2013 or, in other words, everyone. Djokovic, meanwhile, is seeking his fifth consecutive Wimbledon \u2013 that\u2019d give him a share of the men\u2019s record, with Bjorn Borg and Roger Federer, Martina Navratilova holding the women\u2019s with six \u2013 his eighth in total, which would again give him a share of Federer\u2019s leading mark and put him one behind Navratilova. And, already out alone as the, er, most winningest man in majors history, a triumph today would put him beyond Serena Williams and level with Margaret Court on 24 titles. Oh, and he\u2019s also on for a calendar year Grand Slam; it\u2019s a lot. Which is to say that men\u2019s tennis has, over the last couple of years, become a sometime benevolent dictatorship, Djokovic the ageing autocrat taking ever greater pleasure in squashing youthful exuberance and optimism. Triumph and happiness are for him alone. Generally speaking, dominant champions are good for sport, raising the levels of those around them and drawing the eyeballs of those keen to see if, finally, they can be bested. The problem here is that Djokovic is 36, and by annihilating the competition now, he is also compromising anything we might see in the distant post-him future. How can we get excited about a new big noise when they\u2019re orders of magnitude quieter than the previous one? Other hand, though, there\u2019s nothing sport, and individual sport in particular, loves more than a rivalry, and if Alcaraz can give us that, a surprise golden age is already upon us. So, if that\u2019s the contextual, what of the actual? Well, when these two met in the Roland-Garros semi-final, we were treated to some of the most devastatingly fascinating tennis imaginable, a battle of skill and will, of instinct and intellect, of fibre and charisma. Djokovic, a biological freak hewn from elasticated iron with a sadistic computer for a brain, is the most mentally impregnable sportsman of our time. His defensive flexibility is hilarious, his offensive precision revolting, and somehow, in the autumn of his career, he\u2019s sneakily become one of the greatest servers we\u2019ve ever seen. Yet, after two sets of their sensationally wondrous French Open semi, Alcaraz was in the ascendancy, his terrifying power and shocking touch giving Djokovic all he could handle. Except shortly after that, the stress of forcing himself to that level caused his body to break down, he cramped up, and was beaten down. That seems unlikely to happen today. Temperatures in London are cooler, rallies on grass are shorter, and if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learnt about the world number one, it\u2019s that he learns \u2013 and quickly. If anyone can hit through Djokovic, Alcaraz can; but if anyone can repel Alcaraz\u2019s hitting, Djokovic can. This could be epochal.

The 50-strong \u201cHenry Searle Barmy Army\u201d, decked out in matching T-shirts that they got a courier to deliver to the pub they were sitting in the night before Sunday\u2019s final, cheered every point, rose to their feet at every winner and generally behaved like this was the top game of the day, not the small matter of the men\u2019s singles final between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. Searle powered his way to a rambunctious 6-4, 6-4 victory against the fifth seed Yaroslav Demin, hitting nine aces, the fastest of which was recorded at 134mph (216km/h), faster than anything Djokovic has managed this tournament. And there were barely a break in play that was not punctuated with cries of, variously, \u201cKeep it rollin\u2019, Hen!\u201d, \u201cCome on big boy!\u201d and \u201cLight the candle!\u201d The unseeded teenager became the first British winner of the boys\u2019 event since Stanley Matthews Jr in 1962. And he did it without dropping a set, adding his name to an illustrious list that includes Wimbledon greats Roger Federer, Bj\u00f6rn Borg, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams. After he had won the second set to rapturous cheers from his troupe, a rather shell-shocked Searle thanked the crowd, his family and \u2013 naturally \u2013 his Barmy Army, and said he would try to keep his head during the added attention that this win would inevitably garner. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty special feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come too often so I\u2019m going to enjoy it. It was amazing being out on this court today.\u201d The celebrations carried on in the stands, and looked likely to continue into the night. Searle\u2019s brother and mother were overwhelmed with emotion, while others in the group were crying and hugging with abandon. Nick Morris, who coached Searle when he was younger, had almost lost his voice by the end of the match. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible, the dedication he has put into this and the hard work \u2013 we\u2019re just so happy to see him play like this,\u201d Morris said. The young champion\u2019s promise was apparent from an early age, he said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been unbelievable, always really competitive and he shows real attention to detail.\u201d Asked what his hopes were for Searle, Morris said: \u201cIf he can stay healthy and fit, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d The supporters\u2019 troupe only decided to get T-shirts made at the last moment, making an express order of 30, which they paid an Uber driver to deliver to them in a pub last night, said one of Searle\u2019s group. They were also asked, in vain, to calm down at one point by a steward. \u201cHe said \u2018quieten down\u2019, but who cares,\u201d one of the group said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Back in the Midlands, members of the Wolverhampton lawn tennis and squash club, where Searle still continues to play, said they were \u201cover the moon\u201d with his Wimbledon triumph. Marc Hughes, 57, the general manager of the club that Searle joined at the age of two and a half, said everyone at a \u201crammed\u201d screening of the match was proud of his performance. \u201cWe run a junior performance programme and Henry comes down and hits with them, the guy\u2019s just won at Wimbledon, two weeks earlier he was hitting with the juniors, that\u2019s the sort of guy he is.\u201d Hughes said. Outside No 1 Court after the match, Searle\u2019s Barmy Army huddled together and chanted \u201cchampion\u201d before following up with \u201cwe are Wolves\u201d \u2013 the football club the new Wimbledon champion and many in this group support. One of the group called out from the back of the huddle: \u201cTo the bar!\u201d Searle\u2019s brother, Oscar, was pulled into repeated selfies with spectators, despite his insistence that he was, in fact, not Henry. Encouraged by the group, he posed for pictures anyway \u2013 and the cheers continued."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87ab", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/iranian-academic-will-appeal-against-prison-sentence-for-criticising-government", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Iranian academic will appeal against prison sentence for criticising government", "lead": "Sadegh Zibakalam was sentenced for tweeting in March about the alleged poisoning of schoolchildren in Iran", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 18:06:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627473", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4a212c04a3ba14704c760c43d19a8cda93b74e1e/10_0_978_587/500.jpg", "body": "One of the most distinguished former political science professors at the University of Tehran, who was sentenced to a year in jail for tweeting about the alleged poisoning of schoolchildren, has said his sentence was inexplicable and he will appeal against it. Sadegh Zibakalam said nothing in his tweet directly accused the government of being behind the mysterious spate of alleged poisonings of schoolchildren that left hundreds in hospital and no one charged. There have been suggestions that some of the cases may be evidence of mass sociogenic illness \u2013 symptoms without a biomedical cause \u2013 stemming from the repression of schoolgirls who have played a leading role in the protest movement that convulsed Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. The appeal against his sentence will be heard next month. Zibakalam, 75, who has a substantial social media following and international reputation, tweeted in March: \u201cIn 1979, we firmly believed that the system that replaced the imperial system was superior not only to the humanism of the west but also to the socialism of the east. It was envisioned as a new model for humanity. \u201cIf someone had told us \u2026 that 44 years later, girls would fall victim to poisoning, what would our response have been?\u201d The prosecutors charged him with \u201cpublishing lies with the intention of disturbing the public mind\u201d. Several journalists were charged with similar offences. Zibakalam said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to prison. It is not something that I desire. There are many Iranians who want to become a champion, who want to become a hero. I don\u2019t want to become a hero. I want to write.\u201d Explaining his tweet, he said: \u201cIn 1979 we all strongly believed that the regime that was going to replace the shah\u2019s regime was much better than either western democracy and eastern socialism. It was something unique and far more advanced. If someone told you, as we were flying over the moon then, that 44 years later such an incident as the school poisonings would happen, you would think he or she was out of their mind. \u201cThat was the tweet, and a week later I was summoned by the public prosecutor to say that I had insulted the political establishment.\u201d He said the public prosecutors had nearly jailed him before after he gave a speech at the University of Isfahan describing Iran\u2019s nuclear programme as \u201ca disaster for the country since the nuclear programme had been turned into a political weapon to turn against America and the west. An energy programme had been manipulated into a political weapon. We were spending billions of dollars for our nuclear programme and it has no economic benefit for the country.\u201d Although the appeal court ratified an 18-month sentence for his speech, the sentence was not enforced. He was, however, banned from teaching at Tehran University. Zibakalam said that after observing the protests after the death of Mahsa Amini, \u201cone of the most striking social and political changes that has occurred in Iran has been the fate of religion. Religion has been a very powerful institution in Iran during the past 100 years. It was very powerful during the constitutional revolution. It was very powerful during the Mosaddegh uprisings, it was very powerful during the Islamic Revolution \u2013 so powerful that it actually captured that leadership of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Yet what we can more or less say that we are witnessing, we are observing, the end of religion as a powerful political and social establishment in Iran.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any fingerprints, any traces, of Islamic institution of religion in the Mahsa Amini uprising. Now, during the past 100 years, religious institutions, the clergy and the mosque have always been at the forefront of social and political struggle. It was very surprising that during the Mahsa uprising, we didn\u2019t see any clergy. We didn\u2019t see any religious slogans, or behaviour. \u201cFor better or worse in a way in Iran, in the beginning of the 21st century we are observing what we observed in Europe during the Renaissance, or the secularisation of Enlightenment. You could sense that, for some of the younger generation in their 20s, not all of them are anti-religion; the hijab and the political hatred against the Islamic regime has turned into a hatred of religion and Islam.\u201d He accepted that no social census had been completed, but said: \u201cYou can see they believe that religion must occupy a private section of our life. If you want to pray, go ahead and pray. But our economy mustn\u2019t be run by Islamic fundamentals. \u201cStrangely enough, despite four decades of propaganda day and night, it appears that this young Iranian generation, rather than hating the west, have become very much fond of western culture, western civilisation, western cinema, western music. They don\u2019t want to go to Russia, India, China. They want to go to the United Kingdom, they want to go to Canada, to Australia and to the United States.\u201d He believes this generation has turned away from classical political institutions. \u201cThey have become very much against the conservative, but interestingly enough, they have turned very against the reformists. Fifteen years ago, reformists were very popular in places of higher education. And [Mohammad] Khatami [Iran\u2019s president from 1997 to 2005] was a hero for them, but it isn\u2019t any longer. Many of them even hate Khatami more than religious figures because they say we trusted you and voted for you but you did not do anything for us.\u201d In the next parliamentary elections in March, most educated Iranians would not take part, Zibakalam said. But he added: \u201cI am very hopeful and optimistic about the future of Iran because in my opinion no political establishment has survived for ever by being dictatorial and ruthless. The changes will not come easily, and they will not come within the next couple of years.v"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87ac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jul/16/cage-director-banned-from-france-as-threat-to-public-order", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cage director banned from France as \u2018threat to public order\u2019", "lead": "Human rights campaigner Muhammad Rabbani accused of spreading conspiracy theories about \u2018Islamophobic persecution\u2019", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:57:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627491", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22ab0526f9d27b9aebd45469aecc277393662004/60_0_1800_1080/500.jpg", "body": "The director of the campaign group Cage was detained in Paris for almost 24 hours last week and then sent back to London after the French government accused him of spreading conspiracy theories about \u201cIslamophobic persecution\u201d. In 2020, Cage, which campaigns on behalf of communities affected by the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, overturned a French travel ban for its director, Muhammad Rabbani. But on arrival in Paris last Tuesday for meetings with French journalists and civil society leaders, Rabbani was told that the interior ministry had imposed a new travel ban preventing him from entering the country. He was questioned and then sent back on a flight to London. His treatment came days after widespread rioting in France in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Nahel Merzouk, a French teenager of Moroccan and Algerian descent. The interior ministry set out the reasons for the ban in a document dated 31 October 2022. It said: \u201cGiven the particularly high terrorist threat, his presence on national territory would constitute a serious threat to public order and the internal security of France.\u201d The ban was imposed a month after Rabbani criticised the French government for \u201cterrorising\u201d its Muslim community in what he said was a \u201cracist government agenda\u201d. During a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Poland in September 2022, Rabbani also accused France of joining China and India in launching \u201creligious persecution\u201d against Muslims. In its travel ban, France accused Rabbani of being part of a \u201cradical Islamist movement\u201d and \u201cspreading slanderous words\u201d about \u201csupposed \u2018Islamophobic persecution\u2019 and mass surveillance by western governments, including France\u201d. It accused Cage of helping to radicalise Mohammed Emwazi, the Islamic State terrorist known as \u201cJihadi John\u201d, who was responsible for decapitating western hostages held by the terror group. Cage strenuously denies the claim. The ban cited Rabbani\u2019s conviction in the UK for refusing to disclose his mobile phone passcode when he was stopped in 2017 under schedule 7 of Terrorism Act 2000. Cage said Rabbani spent almost 24 hours in French custody last week. It said he was sent to a migrant detention centre from where he recorded a video about his treatment. Cage said French police questioned him at the airport and at the detention centre. He was also questioned by an official from the interior ministry, it said. Cage described the ban as \u201ctotally absurd\u201d and an example of \u201cauthoritarian overreach\u201d. Rabbani said: \u201cFrance has banned me for delivering a speech at the OSCE conference, the world\u2019s largest regional security intergovernmental organisation, exposing the systematic obstruction policy \u2013 a maximum repressive policing strategy that overwhelmingly targets Muslims \u2013 in September last year. \u201cThe French government is clearly threatened by an NGO holding them to account. Our interventions and critiques are echoed across the board. Singling out a Muslim human rights defender for a ban smacks of the very same Islamophobia they are so offended to being accused of.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87ad", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/16/australias-use-of-extra-spin-rewarded-with-retention-of-womens-ashes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia\u2019s use of extra spin rewarded with retention of women\u2019s Ashes", "lead": "The tourists played three specialist slow bowlers to beat England, learning a lesson from their male counterparts in 2005", "author": "Geoff Lemon", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:54:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627512", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/072710e4dae3575fbc66e4ebb97d2588cc078ed3/97_628_5196_3118/500.jpg", "body": "With one ball to come in the 100th over of the match, it was Natalie Sciver-Brunt on her haunches holding the handle of her bat, puffing for air. She needed six to win, four to tie and force a super over. After her final swing of the match, one that didn\u2019t connect cleanly enough to find either variety of boundary, it was the whole ground that was short of air, one long exhale from the England-supporting crowd. Taking back the trophy had still been a chance, then it was gone. As the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Ashes series have unspooled side by side across the past few weeks, the comparisons to 2005 have not stopped. That year is still the emotional lodestone of cricket in England, for locals and Australians alike. Both English teams wrestled a series win from Australian opponents who at the time were so dominant as to seem unapproachable. This year, the close results have been the point of comparison. But this year, in the second-last match of the women\u2019s series, something went differently. In 2005, the Australian men were up against an English team with a huge weakness against leg spin, and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. Shane Warne took 40 wickets that series, but Stuart MacGill sat on the bench. After Glenn McGrath\u2019s injury before the second Test, conservatism saw an ineffective third seam bowler picked in each subsequent match instead of just picking the four best bowlers. This time around, when Australia\u2019s women had their target run down in Bristol to lose their third match in a row, the obvious missteps were recognised. That surface had been a slow and tacky one that favoured taking the pace off the ball. It looked that way before the match, and it has historically been similar. Yet still Australia went with two specialist quicks, Darcie Brown and Megan Schutt, to complement their seaming all-rounders, and left out the leg-spinner Alana King. With Georgia Wareham and Jess Jonassen already in the team, that natural tendency towards a certain structure was evident. After all, you can\u2019t pick three specialist spinners, right? Except that you can, and Australia should have. By the time they reached Southampton on Sunday, that is exactly what they did. Brown was left out, the decision probably aided by her wayward start in Bristol that donated extras to England\u2019s cause. Now Australia\u2019s approach would be to take the pace off, to keep control of the scoring, to make England force the pace. Before that, they had to bat. And the reason they ended up with a scoring bump \u2013 making 282 instead of the 263 at Bristol \u2013 was also down to their leg-spinners. Wareham routinely comes in down the order, but has for some time been one of the cleanest hitters on the Australian domestic scene. Her batting almost got Australia a win this series in the Oval T20, and in this match she looted three sixes and two fours from the 50th over of the innings, adding 26 to the total. Indeed, this is partly what got Wareham back in the side ahead of King, who bowled so well across formats during Wareham\u2019s long absence with a knee injury. But with the series on the line, Australia\u2019s selectors realised they needed the skills of both. \u2028So it proved in the defence. Wareham first, a flatter and skiddier bowling, knocking over Sophia Dunkley with persistence at the stumps. Then King, first with the slider to dismiss Heather Knight, then with a pearl of a delivery that uncurled past Tammy Beaumont\u2019s outside edge to take her off stump. She had Alice Capsey held in the deep to complete her three for 44, Wareham taking one for 47. With both of their allotments used up, there was no question as to the strategy as Sciver-Brunt chased the late win. More slow stuff, finger spinners Jonassen and Ash Gardner completing the job that could not have done without the two leggies. The 2005 team with the rigid thinking ended needing to win their last match to draw the series and retain the trophy \u2013 and didn\u2019t get there. Today\u2019s team have the trophy wrapped up, and can play the final match for a series win."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87ae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/carlos-alcaraz-novak-djokovic-wimbledon-final-singles-men-tennis", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic to win Wimbledon title in final for the ages", "lead": "Carlos Alcaraz is the new Wimbledon champion after a 1-6, 7-6(6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 win against Novak Djokovic", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Wimbledon", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:52:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627531", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/632f53c0c8d70fb895d5f16fd15e073f0f4062c4/0_199_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Over the past few years of men\u2019s tennis, as his great rivals have retreated from view, Novak Djokovic has spent his time destroying the hopes and dreams of nearly all younger challengers at the major tournaments. Not only has he continued to hold off the next generation, but he has relished his supremacy over them. It has been clear for a long time, though, that Carlos Alcaraz is just different. He is different both in terms of his peerless on-court talents and the supreme mental strength that underpins his success. A month after his body crumbled under the sheer tension of facing Djokovic at the French Open, Alcaraz recovered from a set deficit to perform at a remarkable level across five sets as the No 1 seed toppled Djokovic 1-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 to win his first Wimbledon title. It was an astonishing match and performance, a victory that required every immeasurable self-belief and sustained shot-making of the highest quality from Alcaraz while playing at a level of intensity that he has never experienced across five sets. \u201cIt\u2019s great to win but even if I had lost, I would be really proud of myself with this amazing run, making history in this beautiful tournament, playing a final against a legend of our sport,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s a dream come true, to be able to play in these stages. It\u2019s amazing, for a boy of 20 years old, I didn\u2019t expect to reach this kind of situation really fast. I am really, really proud of myself.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s career was already clearly on a trajectory that few 20\u2011year\u2011olds have matched, yet the top seed\u2019s performance at Wimbledon has somehow outpaced all of the deafening hype. His ability to learn, adapt and improve is startling. Less than four weeks ago, Alcaraz began the grass-court season just trying to figure out how to play tennis on the surface without being so preoccupied by his balance and movement. He nearly lost at Queen\u2019s Club against the No 83 Arthur Rinderknech. Since then, he has blitzed the entire field, learning with every match as he has established a 12-match winning run across Queen\u2019s Club and Wimbledon. Alcaraz is the first player to beat Djokovic on Centre Court in a full decade, since Andy Murray in the 2013 final. \u201cI have fallen in love with grass right now,\u201d Alcaraz said. At 20, he is the third youngest player to win the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles title, behind only Boris Becker and Bj\u00f6rn Borg. His second grand slam title means he is the first new male player to win multiple major titles since Stan Wawrinka in 2015. By halting Djokovic\u2019s four-year dominance at Wimbledon, he has denied the 36-year-old the chance of equalling Roger Federer\u2019s record of eight Wimbledon titles. \u201cI guess when all the emotions are settled, I have to still be very grateful because I won many, many tight and close matches in the past years,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cTo name a few, in the 2019 final against Roger, when I was match points down. Maybe I should have lost a couple of finals that I won. I think this is even-steven.\u201d In the early stages, it seemed that experience might triumph as Djokovic, the second seed, smothered Alcaraz with his incessant depth and retrieval skills. After just 27 minutes, Djokovic led 5-0 before he quickly closed out the set. But Alcaraz slowly began to find his range and the intensity skyrocketed in an incredible second set as they tussled in high\u2011octane rallies, Alcaraz forcing as Djokovic countered, with two of the best athletes in the game covering every blade of grass. Alcaraz gave the first indication of his mood in the second-set tie\u2011break. As he served well and attacked without hesitation, it was Djokovic who blinked with messy unforced errors. On set point, Alcaraz slotted a sweet backhand return winner past Djokovic before soaking up the crowd\u2019s applause. With a set secured, the Spanish player\u2019s game truly began to flow. He suddenly found more free points on his serve, and more nuclear forehands failed to come back. He marched through the set, winning an exhausting 26-minute game at 3-1 with 13 deuces and seven break points, which ended in Alcaraz breaking Djokovic\u2019s serve to secure a decisive double break. As expected, Djokovic responded with some of his best returning of the match in set four, breaking serve to take a 3-2 lead before blowing a kiss towards the crowd. Energised and alert, he forced a fifth set. Staring down the best player of all time in a fifth set, Alcaraz refused to cower. After missing a break point in the opening game, he immediately saved one himself with his outrageous, last-ditch defence that forced a drive volley error from Djokovic. As the intensity rose again, a breathless exchange at break point on Djokovic\u2019s serve ended with the Serb falling down, rising again and then watching as Alcaraz nailed a backhand down-the-line passing shot winner to break. While Alcaraz celebrated snatching a 2-1 lead, Djokovic cracked his racket on the net post. Against the best returner of all time, famed for his ability to recover from any deficit, Alcaraz kept moving forward. He found big serves and enormous forehands whenever he needed them. Then he lined up to the baseline at 5-4 without any hint of fear or nerves, and in a stunning game that included a bold drop shot and a lunging volley winner, Alcaraz served out the match of his life."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87af", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/16/rnli-accused-of-failing-to-tackle-violent-bullying-after-assault", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "RNLI accused of failing to tackle violent bullying after assault", "lead": "Victim resigned over handling of what he said was \u2018hate-filled attack\u2019 by colleague and its aftermath", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:33:30", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627549", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e105d21e85ebf565f2e6b2306faccfff350162a0/0_192_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has been accused of failing to tackle violent bullying, after a row about rescuing people crossing the Channel in small boats ended in a volunteer being beaten unconscious by a crewmate who remained in charge of a lifeboat, despite the assault being witnessed by a regional manager. The incident illustrates how the issue of rescuing people seeking refuge in the UK has fuelled tensions inside the RNLI. A leaked internal survey revealed staff anger at the \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d of some colleagues. The attack occurred at a family social event on Boxing Day for a RNLI lifeboat station in north-west England. One crew member began abusing another over his humanitarian work at sea. He shouted: \u201cI\u2019m fucking sick of you and the fucking migrants.\u201d He then head-butted his colleague so hard that the colleague was knocked unconscious and left with a broken nose and two black eyes. The assault was witnessed by an RNLI regional manager and a former full-time coxswain at the station, who continues to volunteer there. The manager, who is a long-term friend of the attacker, refused to call the police. When the victim recovered consciousness, he was told by the manager to go home. The victim was later treated in hospital, where he was given stitches on the bridges of his nose. Two days later, the manager went on a social boat trip with the attacker, according to postings on Facebook. The manager, who is responsible for nearby lifeboat stations, is accused by the victim of failing to intervene to stop the attacker remaining in post as the lifeboat station\u2019s stand-in coxswain for three days after the assault. The attacker was only suspended after a refusal by some members of the crew to serve on the lifeboat until he had been stood down. This threat was relayed to the RNLI\u2019s head of the region. The attacker was later fined by the police and given a caution for assault by beating, and ordered to complete a \u201cdiversionary course\u201d. He resigned as a volunteer in January before a disciplinary hearing could take place. The manager remains in post, where he is responsible for several lifeboat stations and dozens of crew. The victim, who had been a volunteer for 12 years, resigned in protest against the RNLI\u2019s handling of what he said was a \u201chate-filled attack\u201d and its aftermath. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: \u201cI spent days and days with a broken nose trying to get management to listen to me. They weren\u2019t interested, they just wanted me to shut up.\u201d As part of an internal complaint about the incident, he supplied screengrabs of a WhatsApp group that the manager, the attacker and other RNLI volunteers were all members of. They purported to show that the attacker posted abusive, homophobic and pornographic material to the group without challenge. The complainant accused the RNLI and the manager of doing nothing to tackle a \u201cvile old boys\u201d working culture. \u201cThe reason why I was assaulted was because I worked in the Mediterranean as a commander on migrant search and rescue boats,\u201d he said. His call for a full investigation into the working culture at the station was rejected by the RNLI. \u201cI think the reason they are refusing to investigate is that they are worried what they will find. It all stems from a whole attitude of being salty sea dogs \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of people they want in the organisation,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the RNLI said it had been made aware of the incident, and added: \u201cWe took the necessary robust action, standing down a volunteer and holding a thorough investigation. The volunteer left the RNLI permanently in January 2023. \u201cThe RNLI is confident that all appropriate actions were taken in relation to this incident. Acknowledging our duty of care and confidentiality to all individuals involved, it is not appropriate to disclose further details in relation to this matter.\u201d The attacker and the manager have both been approached for comment. In last year\u2019s RNLI staff survey, which was completed before the assault and was leaked to the Guardian, one responder said: \u201cThe RNLI has a culture of bullying and harassment. Institutional responses to reports of bullying and harassment are reflexively defensive and ineffective. \u201cPoor behaviour is not addressed, in part because of a management culture of bureaucratic incompetence in which loyalty to those with power is treated as more important than adherence to the institution\u2019s stated values and mission and policies.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/16/womens-ashes-2023-england-vs-australia-live-updates-odi-one-day-international-cricket-eng-v-aus-latest-score-scorecard-southampton-rose-bowl", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia retain Ashes as England fall three runs short in second ODI \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Over-by-over report</strong>: Australia have retained the Women\u2019s Ashes after beating England by three runs in a dramatic second ODI", "author": "Geoff Lemon and James Wallace", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:30:43", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627567", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/84f98210d0c4dd5a31244abee7a2c5947e2412a9/0_122_2641_1585/500.jpg", "body": "Huge credit to both sides, it\u2019s been a riveting series. Congratulations to Australia! Time for me to go, thanks for your company and correspondence. Enjoy your Sunday evening/Monday morning. Ashes retaining Captain, Alyssa Healy: Nat was great and our girls showed grit and determination. You talk about momentum, Wareham\u2019s innings allowed us to take a buzz. We were up and about and it was crucial at the back end. For Alana King to come in and perform right away shows our depth. I have no doubt that anyone in the squad of 15 can do the job. It was stressful in the end but I really enjoyed it! We pride ourselves on winning key moments. The bowlers were set in their plan in the end for which I\u2019m grateful. We still haven\u2019t played our best cricket. We came here to win the Ashes and we\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s exciting and congratulations to the group for getting it done. Heather Knight speaks: \u201cI Loved the way Nat batted and I thought we had it in the end, credit to Australia. Two brilliant sides, there\u2019s still an ODI series on the line. I was a bag of nerves in the dressing room. It\u2019s been the best women\u2019s series in my opinion. Unfortunately we are on the wrong side of the result. I thought after the way we pulled it back in the middle, we let it go in the end. I thought the score was gettable but sometimes you\u2019ve got to accept defeat and learn from these things. We\u2019re really disappointed with the series loss. We had the momentum and thought we\u2019d win. Ultimately, we can draw the series and win the ODIs which will be a big achievement. We\u2019ve played outstanding cricket, Australia have played really well and we are equal. It\u2019s a hugely positive effort. Alana King is Player of the Match: She was magnificent, taking 3-44 with real craft and skill. Her dismissal of Beaumont was a beauty. It\u2019s a big sense of relief! We are stoked that we\u2019ve won and retained the Ashes! It all comes down to match-ups \u2013 I just need to be ready when I can and take the opportunity when called upon. She talks about not playing but being a consummate squad member: You\u2019ve gotta control the controllables and you\u2019ve just got to be the best team-mate around and do the work behind the scenes. Q.Will you watch the Beaumont ball on loop? Maybe! just stoked to be back on the side. Q. How long will the champagne last? I don\u2019t know, ask the captain! Reaction from the post-match presentation coming up Report on the whistle: That was a hell of a game. Australia held their nerve at the end, they are made of steel in these situations. England look pretty disconsolate, they fought to the last. That 26 run assault off the last over from Wareham felt pivotal at the time and so it proved. Agony for Nat Sciver-Brunt and England. The ball was in the slot from Jonassen but Sciver-Brunt doesn\u2019t time it, it goes up to mid-on on the bounce and England can only take a single. Yet again Sciver-Brunt has kept England in a game singlehandedly but failed at the last. What a game. England fought bravely but Australia RETAIN THE ASHES. Two more to Nat Sciver-Brunt. England need 4 runs off the last ball to take it to a super over\u2026 A sweep for two by Nat Sciver-Brunt. Seven needed off two balls. Glenn gets a single to the mid-off. Sciver-Brunt on strike. FOUR runs! Slog sweep for four. 9 needed from 3! Jonassen to bowl it, Nat Sciver-Brunt takes a single off the first ball\u2026 49th over: England 268-7 (Sciver-Brunt 101, Glenn 21) Ash Gardner to bowl the penultimate over. Glenn gets a leg-bye off the first to bring Sciver-Brunt on strike. DROP! NSB is dropped by Wareham! England take two and are hanging on. 100 to Nat Sciver-Brunt! What a knock, can she England home? No time to celebrate. Two singles see Glenn on strike for the last ball \u2013 DOT. Right. One over to go: England need 15 runs from 6 balls to stay in the Ashes. 48th over: England 262-7 (Sciver-Brunt 97, Glenn 20) Jess Jonassen to bowl. NSB takes a single and Glenn dots up. A single to cover gets Sciver-Brunt on strike. FOUR! A low full toss is swept hard to the fence! Two more singles see Glenn on strike for the next over. 21 needed from 12 balls. Breathe everybody. 47th over: England 254-7 (Sciver-Brunt 91, Glenn 18) Ash Gardner with two to bowl. Sciver-Brunt clips to leg and motors back for two runs. Gardner sends down a wide but follows it up with two dots. Two further singles ramp up the tension! This game is going down to the wire. 29 needed from 18 balls. A couple of boundaries needed to break the shackles for England. Australia desperate for a breakthrough. On we go. How are your nerves? 46th over: England 248-7 (Sciver-Brunt 87, Glenn 17) Alana King to bowl her final over. A beauty! King fizzes one past Glenn that narrowly avoids stumps and edge. Three dots and three singles off it. Neither side will mind that too much. 35 from 24 is the equation. Well bowled Alana King, she finishes with 3-44 off her ten overs. 45th over: England 245-7 (Sciver-Brunt 85, Glenn 16) Tahlia McGrath spears in a wide and the crowd are up once more, cheering every run. Two singles and then a FOUR! Glenn chops down on a yorker and squeezes it past the Healy for a welcome boundary. Two more singles make it nine more runs off the total. 38 needed from 30 runs for England to keep the Ashes alive. 44th over: England 236-7 (Sciver-Brunt 83, Glenn 10) Alana King returns and tightens up for Australia but England still manage four runs from it. 47 needed from 36 balls. Palms are sweaty\u2026 you know the rest. 43rd over: England 232-7 (Sciver-Brunt 80, Glenn 9) Nat Sciver-Brunt is doing what she does, she looks calm and composed. Three singles precede another sweep for four! A single sees NSB steal strike for the next too. It\u2019s ramping up again \u2013 the crowd give a blast of Hey Jude. 42nd over: England 224-7 (Sciver-Brunt 74, Glenn 7) Sciver-Brunt sweeps for four, a full bunger by Wareham is punished. The closer England get the more crucial that last over damage by Wareham with the bat in hand will seem to be. 59 runs from 48 balls is the equation\u2026 simple eh? 41st over: England 218-7 (Sciver-Brunt 69, Glenn 6) England keep chipping away. Eight runs taken off the over, Glenn looking to attack and NSB rotating strike, she trusts her partner to pick up runs and hang about. 40th over: England 205-7 (Sciver-Brunt 66, Glenn 2) Georgia Wareham twirls away and a nervy looking Glenn manages to get Sciver-Brunt on strike. NSB is the silver tuna now, England won\u2019t do this without her. She collects a couple and keeps strike with a single. 39th over: England 205-7 (Sciver-Brunt 62, Glenn 1) Sarah Glenn joins Sciver-Brunt with England in deep strife. One brings two! Ecclestone misses a sweep and is pinned lbw. She decides not to review and trudges off. Double strike in the over for Gardner! Gardner returns and snares Jones almost immediately \u2013 a reverse-paddle is caught easily behind square. Partnership ended and Australia celebrate wildly, they are were just starting to get a bit twitchy. 38th over: England 203-5 (Sciver-Brunt 60, Jones 37) Handy over for England \u2013 nine runs off it. Amy Jones shows her class, a nudge for two is followed by a lofted-drive for four over long-on! DROP! Another lofted shot into the leg side just evades the fielder who I think lost the flight of the ball. 37th over: England 194-5 (Sciver-Brunt 60, Jones 28) Tahlia McGrath back into the attack and it\u2019s a good over from Australia, just five runs off it. Jones and NSB have done well to keep England in this, if they can take it deep then you never know. 36th over: England 189-5 (Sciver-Brunt 59, Jones 24) Amy Jones picks up a single and then a wide from Wareham is greeted with a round of applause by the crowd who are just starting to believe. Eight runs off the over. England need 96 off 84 balls. 35th over: England 181-5 (Sciver-Brunt 58, Jones 22) Schutt continues, can England go big again this over? Five singles off the first five balls and a boundary off the last make it a good one for England. Schutt drops short and Sciver-Brunt pounces and pulls for four! Still fighting\u2026 34th over: England 172-5 (Sciver-Brunt 52, Jones 19) England needed that previous over to give themselves a jolt back to life. Georgia Wareham continues, she has five overs left in the bank. Sciver-Brunt sweeps for a couple to bring up her FIFTY of just 53 balls. 33rd over: England 167-5 (Sciver-Brunt 49, Jones 17) Hello! What was in Amy Jones\u2019 drink? She picks up a couple of boundaries straight away after a slurp. She paddles Schutt behind the keeper for four and then pulls for four more! Pace back on the ball and England get their first boundaries in over seven overs. It seems NSB and Amy Jones have had a chat and are going to put their foot down here, especially against the returning pace of Schutt. 13 runs off the over! 32nd over: England 154-5 (Sciver-Brunt 48, Jones 5) Georgia Wareham has been a revelation in this game. She\u2019s followed up her cameo last over blitzkrieg with the bat with 1-16 off five overs with the ball. England can only pick up singles. The run-rate is now seven an over now. This pair have to get England somewhere close but boundaries are hard to come by. 31st over: England 151-5 (Sciver-Brunt 47, Jones 3) Gardner gets though her over at warp speed, Australia are rattling through and the required run-rate is only going one way for England. England take four runs but it ain\u2019t enough at the moment. 30th over: England 147-5 (Sciver-Brunt 45, Jones 1) Georgia Wareham back into the attack. Sciver-Brunt takes a single and Jones is off the mark with a push into the off-side. Eeeesh! Wareham rags one past the outside edge of Sciver-Brunt\u2019s blade. The Aussie spinners are well on top here. 29th over: England 144-5 (Sciver-Brunt 42, Jones 0) Amy Jones joins NSB in the middle with England somewhat in the mire, still needing 139 from 21 overs. Australia need five more wickets to retain the urn. Another one gone! Wyatt plinks to mid-on and is safely take. England slipping away here, all of their wickets so far have fallen to spin. 28th over: England 142-4 (Sciver-Brunt 42, Wyatt 7) King is bowling wonderfully, she has 3-37 from her eight overs. A match-winning contribution? England still have a sniff with NSB and Wyatt at the crease. They are watchful, ticking the singles. 27th over: England 139-4 (Sciver-Brunt 41, Wyatt 5) England re-building after that flurry of wickets. Ash Gardner into her fifth over, four runs from it. 26th over: England 136-4 (Sciver-Brunt 38, Wyatt 4) Alana King continues, she\u2019s got her dander up and is giving the ball a real fizz. England eke out three runs from the over. Here is that King snare of Tammy Beaumont: You\u2019re welcome. 25th over: England 132-4 (Sciver-Brunt 36, Wyatt 3) Sciver-Brunt goes deep in her crease and works Jonassen for four. A lot now rests on NSB\u2019s shoulders after that Capsey dismissal. Wyatt scores quickly if she gets in. England still need 151 runs from 25 overs, Australia need 6 wickets. King offers some width and is clattered to the fence by Sciver-Brunt. Uh-oh! Alice Capsey is gone! She tries to go big but mis-times King to be caught on the fence. England have lost three wickets in the last seven overs and their Ashes hopes are slipping away. 24th over: England 123-4 (Sciver-Brunt 30, Wyatt) 23rd over: England 115-3 (Sciver-Brunt 23, Capsey 1) Sciver-Brunt dances down and drives Jonassen for four. Lovely batting. Jonassen drags down again and is clipped for two, the left-armer is usually so accurate but has struggled with her length so far today. Seven runs off the over for England. What a ball! King channels The King Shane Warne with a ball that pitches on leg-stump and rips past Beaumont\u2019s forward poke to knock off the off-bail! I\u2019ll find a video of that and post it. It was so good. Beaumont has to go for a well made 60. Alice Capsey is the new batter, she\u2019s off the mark with a force through point. 22nd over: England 109-3 (Sciver-Brunt 17, Capsey 1) 21st over: England 107-2 (Beaumont 60, Sciver-Brunt 16) Jess Jonassen into the attack with some left-arm darts. She drags down and is punished by NSB who crunches away through the leg-side for four. England pick up singles and take eight off the over. 20th over: England 99-2 (Beaumont 57, Sciver-Brunt 8) England accumulating, Australia circling. Three off the over. \u201cThis is the second time (after the Perry nick at the Oval \u2013 where she knew she\u2019d hit it) that snicko has had the \u2018sound\u2019 not synched up properly with the picture, when Heather Knight also knew she\u2019d hit it.\u201d Writes Jim Luetchford. \u201dI suppose it could be just a coincidence, but this kind of sloppy technology doesn\u2019t seem to happen for the men \u2013 are the ECB short-changing the women yet again with a snicko they\u2019ve bought off Matt Hancock\u2019s landlord?\u201d 19th over: England 96-2 (Beaumont 57, Sciver-Brunt 8) McGrath pins NSB in front and it is given lbw! My oh my, this is a big moment. Sciver-Brunt sends for the review and it is MISSING! Reprieve for England. Sciver-Brunt then clips the next ball nonchalantly for four through mid-wicket! All happening. 18th over: England 89-2 (Beaumont 55, Sciver-Brunt 3) Heather Knight was livid as she walked off, she was certain she hit the ball. The DRS shows a tiny murmur but it wasn\u2019t enough to over turn the decision. Could be a crucial talking point in this game and this series. Nat Sciver-Brunt is the new batter for England. England\u2019s captain has to go! She goes down to paddle King but gets pinned in front of all three stumps. Knight thought she hit it and reviewed immediately but no dice, a flat line and three reds send her on her way. 17th over: England 86-1 (Beaumont 55, Knight 12) McGrath continues after drinks. England happy to accumulate, three singles off the over. 16th over: England 83-1 (Beaumont 54, Knight 10) Knight reverse-sweeps for a couple and Beaumont works into the gaps. England collect six off the over, it is cat and mouse stuff. Finely poised at DRINKS. 15th over: England 77-1 (Beaumont 52, Knight 6) Nearly cleans her up! McGrath bowls another tight over, the final ball of which nips back at Heather Knight who juuuust manages to get an inside edge on it and it races away for four. 14th over: England 72-1 (Beaumont 51, Knight 2) Georgia Wareham is bowling excellently here, the proverbial flight and guile. Getting the ball up above the eyes and dropping it on a good length. Tammy Beaumont was stripped of a couple of runs which is why you might have spotted her score pogoing around. She\u2019s gone to her fifty again. 13th over: England 69-1 (Beaumont 53, Knight 1) Testing over from Thalia McGrath, zeroing in on the stumps and giving no width whatsoever, England manage to pick up three singles. 12th over: England 66-1 (Beaumont 51, Knight 0) Heather Knight comes to the crease fresh off her match-winning knock in Bristol. Australia attack with a slip in place. Big appeal! NOT OUT \u2013 the ball was sliding past leg-stump. Phew. Gone! Dunkley\u2019s slightly torturous knock is over as she attempts to lap sweep Wareham and is cleaned up. Sounds odd but that might not be the worst thing to happen for England. 11th over: England 65-0 (Dunkley 13, Beaumont 50) FIFTY to Tammy Beaumont! A gem of a knock so far, can she go on to a big one and keep England in the Ashes hunt!? Dunkley is struggling at the other end \u2013 she\u2019s on 13 off 29 balls, you can sense her frustration building. Something\u2019s gotta/gonna give. 10th over: England 62-0 (Dunkley 12, Beaumont 49) Beaumont has been full of pizazz and confidence whereas Dunkley has been reserved and a bit stodgy at the crease. Annabelle Sutherland is into the attack and she ties Dunkley down, Dunkley is a bit all or nothing, needs to be better at getting off strike, especially with Beaumont flying at the other end. Just a couple off the over. 9th over: England 60-0 (Dunkley 11, Beaumont 48) Great use of the crease once more from Beaumont, she swivels back and sweeps Schutt for four. The fielder comes up from long-on, Schutt drops short and is PANNED away over mid-on for four more! That was more of a top-spin forehand you\u2019d see from Djokovic on centre court, amazing shot and comprehensive stuff from Beaumont. Four more! A fine glance off the pad beats Healy and runs away to the fence. Twelve off the over. 8th over: England 48-0 (Dunkley 11, Beaumont 36) King whirls away, she tosses one up above the eyeline, Beaumont loses her shape in trying to smear to the fence. Sophia Dunkley is itching to get a boundary and a half-tracker from King gifts her the opportunity she craves \u2013 a crunch through the covers for four. 7th over: England 43-0 (Dunkley 7, Beaumont 35) Schutt replaces Ash Gardner. Dunkley tries a booming drive but connects only with fresh air. Healy whips off the bails but Dunkley is safely in her ground. Schutt sprays down the leg-side to gift another run to England. Beaumont dances around in her crease like Fred Astaire and it puts off Schutt who drags one down and gets punished. Six off the over. 6th over: England 36-0 (Dunkley 6, Beaumont 30) Alana King replaces Schutt. Lovely to see some leg-spin on a Sunday afternoon. Beaumont drops to one knee to paddle for two to fine-leg. Brilliant shot! Beaumont opens the face and drives immaculately through the covers for four\u2026 and four more! King drops short and Beaumont rocks back and scythes through point for another boundary. Eleven off the over, England are counter-punching nicely here. 5th over: England 25-0 (Dunkley 5, Beaumont 20) Beaumont comes to the party! She launches Gardner over mid-off twice in the over to pick up identikit boundaries. A drive in the same region gets her two more. Ten off the over, Beaumont is ticking. 4th over: England 15-0 (Dunkley 5, Beaumont 10) Schutt is accurate, scudding the ball in at pads and stumps. Dunkley clips for one into the leg side and Beaumont reciprocates with a glide to point. Just two singles off the over. Pressure building\u2026 3rd over: England 13-0 (Dunkley 4, Beaumont 9) Shot! First four of the innings to Tammy Beaumont, she saunters down and lofts Gardner over the infield with a minimum of fuss. Productive over for England, they pilfer ten runs off Gardner\u2019s second over to inject some life into their run rate. 2nd over: England 3-0 (Dunkley 2, Beaumont 1) Megan Schutt starts from the opposite end. Alyssa Healy is up to the stumps and Australia have a ring-field. There are just a couple off it, a single each to Dunkley and Beaumont. Australia have started with a squeeze here, there\u2019s been none of the freebies that they gifted England in the last game. 1st over: England 1-0 (Dunkley 1, Beaumont 0) A fine start for Gardner and Australia, just a single off the first over. Dunkley clips to mid-on to open England\u2019s account. England need nearly six and over throughout. Ash Gardner is going to start with the new ball, spin for the Aussies first up. Let\u2019s play. Thanks Geoff and hello everyone. Can England chase these runs and take the Ashes down to a decider at Taunton on Tuesday? They\u2019ll have to go some \u2013 Georgia Wareham\u2019s 37 off 14 has swing the pendulum firmly in Australia\u2019s favour. The players are readying\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you what, that looked like England\u2019s day all the way up to the end of the 49th over. They were on track to chase something smaller than what they chased at Bristol. And suddenly, in the space of five deliveries, the equation has changed. Wareham came in like a wrecking ball. The 264 in Bristol was England women\u2019s biggest run chase on record, now they\u2019ll need to break that record again. It\u2019ll be a tough one, but they\u2019ll be up for it. That\u2019s me done for the day, James Wallace will take you through the second innings. 50th over: Australia 282-7 (Wareham 37, Jonassen 5) Last over of the match, Wareham on strike\u2026 \u2026 and she clobbers the first ball for six! Into her arc, on the pads, and sends it soaring over midwicket, clearing the fielder out there on the rope. Lauren Bell again, bowls the same ball, and gets the same treatment! Six more. Bell wants to smash the ball into the surface, take some pace off and leave it outside off stum. Wareham is one step ahead of her, and that step is backwards to the leg side, forehanding over mid off for four! Fourth ball, how\u2019s that sound off the bat? Best contact of the day! Six more, this time a bit straighter over wide long on. This is an incredible display of hitting! Once again the ball is straight into Wareham\u2019s hitting zone, at the pads. Fifth ball, it\u2019s another off side one, and again Wareham goes over mid off for four. The only one she doesn\u2019t marmalise is the final ball of the match, swinging and missing, aside from a tiny edge. Jones drops the catch, but they don\u2019t get a run. Hooley dooly. That\u2019s 26 from the over! 49th over: Australia 256-7 (Wareham 11, Jonassen 5) Sciver-Brunt to bowl the second-last over. Wareham pulls for one, Jonassen misses a drive. Gets a shot over square leg but only for one. Wareham is laying into the ball as hard as she can but it\u2019s only going for one at a time. 48th over: Australia 251-7 (Wareham 8, Jonassen 1) Difficult to come in and score from the get-go, but that\u2019s the task for the new pair. Wareham starts well, two through cover, then four over the top, backing away for room facing Bell. Leg bye past the keeper. Jonassen cuts two, turning fast for the second. 47th over: Australia 240-7 (Wareham 1, Jonassen 0) What an over! That pair put on 81, but Ecclestone gets them both in the space of four balls, and that might be what keeps Australia to a much lower score. Two in the over! Same thing, other side of the wicket. Sutherland completed her first ODI fifty before Perry got out, but not she follows Perry back into the sheds. Playing the team way, Perry uses her feet, decides the length is right, and tries to clear long off. Gets a lot of it but short by a couple of metres. England\u2019s substitute fielder takes the catch. No hundred for Perry today, after making 99 in the Test match. But then, her ODI career has never been about hundreds. 46th over: Australia 238-5 (Perry 91, Sutherland 49) Excellent bowling from Bell, she keeps hitting a yorker length and the Australians can only dig out two runs from the first four balls. Perry drives a run to deep cover. Will we see the scoops coming out to get something from this length? Sutherland tries to heave out a drive instead, hits it high in the air but it lands short of long on, rushing in. 45th over: Australia 234-5 (Perry 89, Sutherland 47) Shot from Perry, opens the face against Ecclestone to drive up and over point for four. Gets off strike, then Ecclestone keeps looping the ball almost into the blockhole for Sutherland, who can\u2019t get any power on her shots. 44th over: Australia 229-5 (Perry 84, Sutherland 47) Natalie Single-Brunt? Another over of ones, albeit thanks to the non-striker\u2019s stumps that get in the way when Sutherland belts a pull shot dead straight. 43rd over: Australia 223-5 (Perry 81, Sutherland 44) This is a gem from Sutherland. Chips two down the ground, then advances and smacks out to midwicket with such force that it bursts through Wyatt for four! The fielder gets there but is undone on the second bounce, a bit of spin, and so much pace on the ball. Races for another two runs over the bowler\u2019s head, then winds up and pings that wide long on boundary for four more! Throw in three wides thanks to a keeper\u2019s miss and Glenn\u2019s over costs 17 runs. 42nd over: Australia 206-5 (Perry 80, Sutherland 31) Good work continues from Sciver-Brunt, keeping them to singles by bowling that hard length that they can\u2019t pull but can\u2019t hit straight with any power. One run each ball, including a lofted one from Sutherland that lands pretty close to long on. 41st over: Australia 200-5 (Perry 77, Sutherland 28) Into the last ten overs. Can Australia go at six? At eight? Can England grab some wickets and slow them right down? Great start from Glenn, keeping them to three singles! 40th over: Australia 197-5 (Perry 76, Sutherland 26) Ball stays down from Sciver-Brunt but Sutherland gets her bat low enough in the attempted pull. Then loses that bat running through for a single. Perry gets low and sweeps fine, charges back for the second run and makes Sutherland hammer towards the non-striker\u2019s end as they take on Glenn\u2019s throw. Then they\u2019re putting Glenn under pressure again, a lift behind square that Glenn charges towards but can\u2019t reach on the full. She hits her head a bit on the ground I think, maybe the chin \u2013 has a quick doctor\u2019s check but she\u2019s ok to continue. Sutherland smacks a pull shot along the ground but Dunkley is at deep square. The field is well back now in most places, so there\u2019s a single every ball plus the two. 39th over: Australia 190-5 (Perry 72, Sutherland 23) Eighth over for Ecclestone. That means that Bell, Sciver-Brunt, Glenn, Capsey are the options for most of the final ten. Sutherland chips over extra cover for two. Three singles as well. She\u2019s changed the dyamic since coming in, has 23 from 22 balls. 38th over: Australia 185-5 (Perry 71, Sutherland 19) Nip and tuck. Sciver-Brunt comes back and slows the scoring right down again, only one run from it, Perry finding it really hard to time shots against the medium pace off the surface. The ball seems to be gripping, coming on slowly to the bat. 37th over: Australia 184-5 (Perry 71, Sutherland 18) Splat! So goes the ball over the rope down the ground, Perry hitting Ecclestone straight with the mid off up inside the circle. Five down, she\u2019s the key player, but Perry still willing to take them on. 36th over: Australia 176-5 (Perry 64, Sutherland 17) Battle of the Young Guns, and Sutherland takes it to Bell! First up, a straight hit back over the bowler\u2019s head. Secondly, an inelegant lift over the leg side that nonetheless reaches the fence at midwicket. Thirdly, a shorter ball pulled for four as Bell tries to adjust the length. Huge over for Australia. 35th over: Australia 164-5 (Perry 64, Sutherland 5) Perry steps down to Ecclestone, drives, and she\u2019s dropped again! England missed her twice in Bristol, now twice here, and this time it\u2019s Kate Cross. A hard flat drive, to the left of mid off. Cross gets across and gets both hands to it but it spills free, and she rolls over after a heavy landing, ending up with cramp in a leg. The physio eventually takes her off. Pickle juice time after bowling four overs. 34th over: Australia 162-5 (Perry 63, Sutherland 4) Gorgeous shot to start from Sutherland, the ball swinging in to the pads and Sutherland drives it through midwicket for four. This time Ecclestone hangs on! Gardner tries a baseball shot off a length, and doesn\u2019t get enough of it. The sound off the bat is no good, and the clunky shot loops to mid off. 33rd over: Australia 158-4 (Perry 63, Gardner 33) Whack! What a way to start after drinks, Perry driving through the line against Cross to hit the ball right back the way it came. Four runs, a couple of singles to follow, and Cross ends her day\u2019s work with 0 for 41. 32nd over: Australia 152-4 (Perry 58, Gardner 32) More from Glenn, to deep cover for a Gardner run. Tries to skid a faster one on to Perry but the batter cuts. Cover sweeper getting a workout, four singles there in the over\u2026 then Gardner finally gets the placement on one! Cuts it well in front of square, out through extra cover really and it beats the dive. 31st over: Australia 144-4 (Perry 56, Gardner 26) Perry comes down looking for a run and is sent back by Gardner, has to dive back in to beat Beaumont\u2019s throw. Then a good stop by Beaumont at backward point after Perry middles it a wide carve. Leg glance for one. Second-last over for Cross. Hits Gardner on the pad, going down leg, the appeal quickly fades. Then hits Gardner outside the line of leg stump and it nearly ricochets back onto the stumps! Inside edge on that, it\u2019s given as runs. 30th over: Australia 142-4 (Perry 55, Gardner 25) They\u2019re racing singles, Perry and Gardner, Capsey pinging at the non-striker\u2019s end but missing. Perry nails a cover drive but Knight dives to field it in one take. Three singles from this over. They\u2019re still going at close to five per over, the Australians, so they can still lift to a big total if they don\u2019t lose wickets through the next ten overs. 29th over: Australia 139-4 (Perry 53, Gardner 24) Cross keeps using that short ball to good effect, twice Gardner sways away. Only three singles. 28th over: Australia 136-4 (Perry 51, Gardner 23) Out through cover for two, leg side for one, Gardner off strike, and Perry is hit on the pad playing back to Glenn and missing. She\u2019s hit about halfway in front of leg stump, the umpire says it\u2019s going down leg, and while England review it shows an orange light on impact. Perry stays. Can\u2019t get runs, even a low full toss she clips straight at midwicket, chance wasted. Next ball she steps towards Glenn and smacks it straight \u2013 dropped catch again! Away to Glenn\u2019s left and low, hard to take return catches hit with force, but Glenn gets hands to it. Perry gets a run. 27th over: Australia 132-4 (Perry 50, Gardner 20) Kate Cross comes back, four overs left in her allotment. Again uses the bouncer, just the once, as a surprise ball. Works well as Perry goes under it. That\u2019s after Gardner picks off the straight ball through leg side a couple of times. 26th over: Australia 129-4 (Perry 50, Gardner 17) Up and running, Gardner plays the same shot to Glenn! Even better contact this time, for six. Rotates strike with the cut, then Perry pulls to deep square leg, hustles for the second run and makes it. Goes past her career average and raises half-century number 30 (yes, that\u2019s thirty) in one-day cricket. 25th over: Australia 119-4 (Perry 47, Gardner 10) Gardner attacks Capsey and the catch goes down. First miss today, they missed six in Bristol. Ecclestone at mid on gets across to the line of a straight lofted shot. In the end muddles her movement. Jumps at the ball and goes with one hand, where more decisive footwork might have got her in line with the ball and able to use both hands. Deflects it towards the rope, where Cross does good work to tap it back. As if to prove a point, Gardner goes again two balls later, same shot but hits it cleanly over Ecclestone for four. 24th over: Australia 110-4 (Perry 45, Gardner 3) Glenn keeps the scoring down. Gardner playing a shot a ball, but only gets one of those through the field, a cut for two. 23rd over: Australia 108-4 (Perry 45, Gardner 1) Alice Capsey on to bowl. It felt like the Australians let her bowl at them in Bristol, with her innocuous off spin, but from a few wickets down they had fewer options to take risks. Exact same scenario today. Perry pulls Capsey\u2019s first ball for four, slightly short, then sweeps one. Gardner drives her first run through cover. 22nd over: Australia 102-4 (Perry 40, Gardner 0) Australia would like Gardner coming to the crease after 35 or 40 overs, not this early. She\u2019ll have to adapt today. Usually an attacking player, here she can\u2019t score from five balls from Glenn, the bowler twice stopping a drive getting back past her. Trouble now for Australia! McGrath has been such a performer in the last couple of years but she goes cheaply here, top-edging a cut shot into the keeper\u2019s gloves. Glenn was expensive in her first over but gets a big wicket in her second. 21st over: Australia 102-3 (Perry 40, McGrath 5) Ecclestone tightens it up again. Three from the over, including a wide. 20th over: Australia 99-3 (Perry 39, McGrath 4) Sarah Glenn on for some leg spin. McGrath drives to deep extra cover, has a sweeper coming around to keep her scoring to two. Then another drive through the hands of Knight at cover, one more. Wickets falling regularly, but Perry won\u2019t hold back! Gets back to a drag-down ball and lumps it over wide long on for four! Adds two more to midwicket. 19th over: Australia 90-3 (Perry 33, McGrath 1) The previous partnership ends at 61 runs, a helpful start but not match defining. Tahlia McGrath gets going with a drive struck hard at cover, only half stopped. The biggest wicket of the day! It\u2019s not from Ecclestone\u2019s top drawer but it doesn\u2019t always need to be. A bit short, trending towards leg stump, and that\u2019s inviting Mooney to play the sweep. Hits it powerfully but airborne and flat, straight at short fine leg. 18th over: Australia 86-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 32) Heavy swing across the line from Mooney at Sciver-Brunt, after three more dot balls to start the over. Jones behind the stumps in vocal in approval, feels they\u2019ve pushed Mooney into a bad shot. Heather Knight though puts a fielder back there, and Mooney takes a single into the gap. 17th over: Australia 81-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 27) Again a first-ball four from Ecclestone\u2019s over, this time Mooney shifting across her stumps to sweep. Then dropping and running to cover, Perry on that replay would have been just short running to the striker\u2019s end had the throw hit. Perry using her feet again to Ecclestone, even just defending to cover. 16th over: Australia 76-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 22) Mooney drives to cover, Dunkley hits Perry\u2019s stumps at the far end but they don\u2019t take an overthrow. Mooney happy to back away to Sciver-Brunt and carve off the line of her stumps, but can\u2019t beat cover point. So she goes straight down the ground, swings it away for four. Dabs a run to keep the strike. 15th over: Australia 71-2 (Perry 31, Mooney 17) Everyone hydrated? On we go. Ecclestone bowling. Perry sweeps four first ball, and seems content with that while playing out the rest of the over. 14th over: Australia 67-2 (Perry 27, Mooney 17) Really quietening down before the drinks break. Perry taps one run to cover, Mooney just waits out the rest of the over after a ball from Sciver-Brunt goes past her outside edge. 13th over: Australia 66-2 (Perry 26, Mooney 17) Time for spin. England have ten valuable overs from Sophie Ecclestone. Willing to start using them if it means breaking this partnership. Mooney flicks a single first ball, Perry settles in before nudging another. 12th over: Australia 64-2 (Perry 25, Mooney 16) Sciver-Brunt to Perry. The field restrictions were done with a couple of overs ago, and the two batters look pretty happy to start the consolidation phase immediately. Just a couple of singles. \u201cI heard someone say after the last game that if we had a washout here the series would be 7-7 with the Taunton game to become the decider,\u201d writes Rocket from Melbourne. \u201cLooking at the poor weather predictions for Tuesday at Taunton I\u2019m starting to think that that game could yet be a washout, which would mean today\u2019s winner would win the series 9-7.\u201d Quite right, that is another consideration. 11th over: Australia 62-2 (Perry 24, Mooney 15) Cross will bowl a sixth over, again trying the short one but Perry gets her hands very high over the top of the bounce and pulls it down for one run. A square drive gets Mooney a single, good shot but there\u2019s protection back. Perry glides another. 10th over: Australia 59-2 (Perry 22, Mooney 14) Bell finishes after four overs, Nat Sciver-Brunt comes on, but struggles for accuracy at first, a couple of wides outside the off stump. Perry shovels three runs through midwicket off the top of the bounce of a straight ball. 9th over: Australia 53-2 (Perry 19, Mooney 13) Cross to bowl her fifth, in at the thigh pad of Mooney to start. Keeps the Australians to three singles, but there\u2019s the pressure release again, this time from the last ball. Leg stump and glanced for four. 8th over: Australia 46-2 (Perry 14, Mooney 11) Swing from Bell! Draws Perry into a big drive aimed at extra cover, beats her by a margin as the ball shapes away. Then inswing the next ball, Perry meeting it with the full blade. But the bowler keeps giving away an opportunity here or there, this time a leg-side ball that Perry can glance for four. Then Mooney climbs into a cut shot that Danni Wyatt has to chase back to keep the scoring to three. 7th over: Australia 36-2 (Perry 9, Mooney 8) Cross running in to Perry, a short ball that Perry plays down, then a cutter inward that beats the inside edge as Perry walks at her. Dunkley knocks down a cover drive and keeps the scoring to one. Mooney rescues the over for Australia with an off drive for four, just full enough for the shot. 6th over: Australia 31-2 (Perry 8, Mooney 4) Seems like Australia have relied more and more on Beth Mooney through the last few years. She\u2019s the reason they got a competitive score in Bristol. She\u2019ll have to do a job again. Starts with a crisp cover drive for four. What was Healy thinking there? Bell bowlers a shorter ball outside off stump. It\u2019s sitting there for a shot through the off side, and Healy elects for a little dab, running it off the face towards deep third. Except they\u2019ve brought that fielder up inside the circle. Did the batter just forget, or not notice? That\u2019s literally in the style of a catching practice drill for Capsey. 5th over: Australia 27-1 (Healy 13, Perry 8) Dicey shot from Healy against Cross now, thick inside edge between pads and stumps. Gets two runs, glides another. England doing a good job of keeping the pressure on. 4th over: Australia 24-1 (Healy 10, Perry 8) Near miss for Perry! She hasn\u2019t scored from her first six balls, so she gets forward to a straight ball from Bell and clips it hard through mid on, but aerial for a moment. Too straight for Sciver-Brunt at short midwicket. Then next ball, swinging away, takes the edge wide of slip! Two boundaries, two with some luck involved. 3rd over: Australia 15-1 (Healy 10, Perry 0) First boundary for Healy, off the pads from Cross. Repeats the dose a few balls later. Amy Jones comes up to the stumps in an attempt to mess with Healy\u2019s footwork. 2nd over: Australia 7-1 (Healy 2, Perry 0) Another early visit to the crease for Perry, who usually bats No4 when Meg Lanning is around but is first drop in this series. Can\u2019t beat short fine leg with a glance. Early blow for England! Lauren Bell bowls a wide, a leg-stump pie for Healy to flick for one, then a wide floaty delivery that Litchfield drives for four. But with those out of her system, she bowls one that comes the other way, back into the left-hander. Hits her in front! 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Healy 1, Litchfield 0) More accurate start for Kate Cross than when she opened the bowling in Bristol. Healy dabs a run behind point but Litchfield isn\u2019t game to play shots against the next five balls, all in the channel across the left-hander. Players on the ground, we\u2019re set to go. No changes for England. Australia drop fast bowler Darcie Brown, who was wayward in Bristol, and bring in Alana King for some more spin. That\u2019s the bowling lineup they needed a few days ago, will it do the job here? I suspect that Georgia Wareham will float up the order if Australia have wickets in hand in the last ten overs. She\u2019s the purest hitter. Australia Alyssa Healy + * Phoebe Litchfield Ellyse Perry Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath Ash Gardner Annabel Sutherland Alana King Jess Jonassen Georgia Wareham Megan Schutt England Tammy Beaumont Sophia Dunkley Alice Capsey Heather Knight * Nat Sciver-Brunt Danni Wyatt Amy Jones + Sophie Ecclestone Sarah Glenn Kate Cross Lauren Bell They want to chase again. It worked last time, so why not? And another important moment in the women\u2019s game, with this ICC announcement during the week. England\u2019s players are speaking with confidence now. This was my summing up of the situation, a few seats down from Raf. And had time to do a match wrap podcast with Melissa Story of TMS. If you need to revise, here\u2019s Raf Nicholson with the match report from the last dramatic day at Bristol. Here we go again. After Australia won the Test match and the first T20 in this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Ashes series, there was surely no way back for the other team. England weren\u2019t going to beat the world champions for five limited-overs matches in a row to overturn the points deficit. They won the first of those five. Fine, but not going to win four more, are they? They won the second. But not three? Yep, three. Two 20-over matches and one 50-over match, the latter coming with the closest finish as Heather Knight and Kate Cross reached the target in Bristol eight wickets down. Now, it\u2019s Australia who must win. The equation is simple. Whichever team loses today can no longer win the series, they can only draw it. And yes, Australia would retain the trophy with a draw, but they would hate that result after holding such a strong early lead. This is where it really gets interesting. The Australians looked rattled after that third loss in Bristol. Blowing that early advantage is now a real possibility. Will that throw them off, get in their way? Or will the jeopardy concentrate their approach, and see them produce the dominant performance we\u2019ve been expecting? All to play for today.."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-closing-train-station-ticket-offices-the-wrong-route", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on closing train station ticket offices: the wrong route | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Modernisation does not have to mean closures and cuts.

A token public consultation period for this proposal \u2013 risibly short at a mere 21 days \u2013 will end in less than two weeks\u2019 time. After that perfunctory nod to growing public disquiet, the process of pulling down the shutters at the vast majority of the country\u2019s 1,007 remaining ticket offices is due to begin. This is a process which needs to be stopped in its tracks. The train operators \u2013 pressured by a government which, here as in other matters, knows the price of everything and the value of nothing \u2013 have presented the closures as part of a necessary modernisation programme. It is true that most train tickets are now sold digitally or at station vending machines. But the suggestion that, from Purley to Preston, ticket office staff will be liberated to take up \u201cnew and engaging\u201d platform roles is for the birds. The transparent end goal is to save money by radically reducing the number of staff necessary to run a functioning station. The downsides of going down this path are multiple: confused passengers seeking expert help en route, or before departure, will be left to talk to the wall; disabled people relying on assistance and in need of a supportive travel environment will receive a far poorer service; women returning home in the dark will feel less secure; and the elderly, the less digitally savvy and the digitally excluded will find rail travel more difficult and more off\u2011putting. As a bare minimum, a full equality impact assessment should be undertaken before any closures take place. More broadly, at a time when the government should be thinking of ways to encourage more people to use public transport instead of their cars, the plans testify to an abject failure of imagination. \u201cModernisation\u201d does not have to mean closures and cuts, justified by a kind of digital determinism. In Switzerland, for example, the national railway company has collaborated with a food retailer to offer the full range of ticket services in station shops. Liverpool city region has used devolved powers to pilot similar schemes on the Merseyrail network. The Rail Reform Group, a campaigning body made up of senior rail professionals, has made the case for investing in stations as community hubs and information centres, incorporating ticketing services. When valued and peopled, train stations can be welcoming and energising places. They can be rethought and reconfigured for digital times, but preserving the human factor must be non\u2011negotiable. Or as the former Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson put it last week in a tweet: \u201cSo far all my assistance has gone well today. Do you know what made it work? People. People being at the station.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-a-water-crisis-uruguay-points-to-a-wider-issue-and-to-solutions", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on a water crisis: Uruguay points to a wider issue \u2013 and to solutions | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The South American country is running dry.

Now it is parched and desperate. Residents can cross the reservoir serving Montevideo on foot. The capital has declared a water emergency, with officials warning that it is a matter of days before it runs dry. For months they have been eking out tap water supplies by adding brackish estuary water, telling pregnant women and people with serious health conditions not to drink it. Authorities have cut taxes on bottled water and are distributing it for free to the estimated one in seven people for whom it is unaffordable. Others are turning to wells. The main culprit is the worst drought in more than 70 years. Though Uruguay is naturally rich in water, rainfall is highly variable due to the impact of La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns. The problems are exacerbated by global heating, which makes dry years drier and rainy years wetter, as well as increasing evaporation losses. Neighbouring Argentina is beset by shortages already. Many more countries around the world face similar challenges \u2013 or soon will. Climatic factors are only one part of this problem. Researchers and campaigners have been warning for years that the growing impact of export-led agriculture and forestry was unsustainable. Only a small proportion of Uruguay\u2019s water is used for human consumption. In 2019, rice, wood pulp, soy beans and meat \u2013 the main exports \u2013 used more than 50 times as much as went to drinking supplies. There is also anger about the construction of a new Google data centre, which critics say will use millions of litres of water a day, though officials say that the plans have been revised. Experts say that 2004\u2019s constitutional changes led to major improvements in what had been a hierarchical and fragmented water management system. But integration in planning has not been matched in implementation. Successive governments have failed to adequately invest in maintaining and overhauling infrastructure, perhaps in part because in previous droughts, rain arrived just as matters were getting really desperate: \u201cWe all fell asleep,\u201d admitted Jos\u00e9 Mujica, president from 2010 to 2015. But opposition from big business, as well as complacency, has played a significant role in the failure to establish a satisfactory long-term strategy. That will have to change if the country is to find lasting solutions. There is reason to be optimistic. The 2004 constitutional reforms, approved by more than 60% of the population in a referendum, also enshrined public management of water supplies, and were motivated in large part by the privatisation of drinking water and sanitation services. A coalition of civil society and political groups, the National Commission for the Defence of Water and Life, identified profit-driven water management and greed as a fundamental threat to the basic rights of citizens. This was a grassroots initiative that succeeded in the face of indifference from political leaders and the media \u2013 and outright opposition from business interests. In a country that has been ranked as the most democratic in the Americas, civil society could play an essential role in finding solutions again. The importance of access to clean water is a top priority for the public once more. Uruguay\u2019s crisis today is the future for more and more nations. They could learn a lot by looking to its past."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-a-tremendous-screen-presence-with-a-gift-for-creative-collaboration", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jane Birkin: a tremendous screen presence with a gift for creative collaboration | Peter Bradshaw", "lead": "Birkin made a sensational impact in Blow-Up, and went on to become a classy performer for a number of major French directors \u2013 notably Godard and Agn\u00e8s Varda", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:22:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627624", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d9e7f01a807fd933f537e98822896eecb0c21150/93_182_2127_1275/500.jpg", "body": "Jane Birkin was the elegant, delicate, heartstoppingly beautiful singer and movie star with a fascinatingly elusive and free-spirited screen presence. She was a performer with that interesting distinction of being Anglo-French, which somehow added to her unlocatable quality: she was quite at home with both languages, like other stars Charlotte Rampling, Kristin Scott Thomas and, indeed, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Birkin\u2019s daughter with Serge Gainsbourg. It was her destiny to be thought of as a public figure and national treasure in France, where she made a great many films, and to be placed on an odd kind of pedestal as icon or 60s darling. She had been a fashion model in real life and played them on screen, like the ones in Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s Blow-Up, where she made her startling first proper screen impression. And yet this doesn\u2019t do justice to her distinctive screen work, her later character roles and her tremendous capacity for creative friendship and collaboration with film-makers such as Agn\u00e8s Varda and Jean-Luc Godard. Birkin\u2019s sensational and notorious 1969 pop single with Serge, Je T\u2019Aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus, with its moany-breathy coital vocals, in fact mutated interestingly into a provocative movie of the same name, released in 1976 and written and directed by Gainsbourg. It\u2019s an essay on what might now be called queerness, with Birkin as the boyish Johnny, working in a cafe, who falls in love with a gay trucker, played by Warholian muse Joe Dallesandro, another performer who knew what it was like to be fetishised. But Birkin really started out as the wide-eyed ingenue in the 1966 classic Blow-Up, who simpers at David Hemmings\u2019s haughty photographer and trying unsuccessfully for a modelling gig. She was \u2013 again \u2013 a model in Joe Massot\u2019s non-narrative swinging-60s groovefest Wonderwall in 1968, with its George Harrison soundtrack and a very Beatles-ish name for Birkin\u2019s pert character, Penny Lane; she poses insouciantly for her boyfriend while being spied (and perved) on by her weirdo neighbour, played by Jack MacGowran. She was also considered to have burned a hole in the cinema screen as the enticingly innocent-fatale teenager Penelope, who sexily entrances Alain Delon\u2019s moody, disenchanted writer by the shimmering pool on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in La Piscine \u2013 a role replayed by Dakota Johnson in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s A Bigger Splash remake/rework. In the 70s, Birkin worked with Roger Vadim, that other great French player and impresario of liberation, who directed her in his gender-flipped Don Juan of 1973; it is quirky, freaky and a bit preposterous, with Brigitte Bardot as the woman who believes herself to be the reincarnation of the great seducer, and Birkin as one of the women s/he seduces. In the same year, Birkin found herself in the cult giallo shocker Seven Deaths in the Cat\u2019s Eye, directed by the prolific pulp-maestro Antonio Margheriti; it is set in a Hammerish Scottish castle, in which many creepy people are resident and a gorilla is kept in a cage. In later years, Birkin was held in great regard by producers and directors as a class act, able to deliver finely judged small character roles, and her presence may often have been instrumental in cementing international coproduction financing. She made witty, poised contributions to two Agatha Christie movies: Death on the Nile in 1978 and Evil Under the Sun in 1982, both with Peter Ustinov as Poirot. In the late 90s, Birkin acted for James Ivory, playing the idiosyncratic Mrs Fortescue in A Soldier\u2019s Daughter Never Cries, utilising Birkin\u2019s always very patrician English accent. But it was for the great directors of French cinema that she also did her most interesting work. In Jacques Rivette\u2019s La Belle Noiseuse (or The Beautiful Troublemaker), she plays the wife of Michel Piccoli\u2019s painter Frenhofer, who had abandoned a painting he began 10 years before when Birkin was his model \u2013 but is then inspired to complete it, with a new model, the comely young Emmanuelle B\u00e9art. The film makes a shrewd and poignant comment on what Birkin must have experienced only too often: the extravagant condescension and fickle cynicism of being thought of as a \u201cmuse\u201d. Godard then gave Birkin a cameo in his freewheeling 1987 cine-triple-sketch Soigne Ta Droite, featuring, firstly, a wacky director (played by Godard himself) carrying the cans of his film around; secondly, the French pop group Les Rita Mitsouko recording a track; and, thirdly, three actors performing a variation on the fable The Grasshopper and the Ant, with Birkin as a hedonistic young woman zooming around with her lover in a convertible. Birkin spoke with humour and generosity about the bizarre experience of being directed by Godard on his most cantankerous and difficult form. But the director who was most passionately committed to Birkin as a real screen presence, and who believed in her in a way that most of the industry didn\u2019t, had to be Agn\u00e8s Varda, who constructed one of her wittiest and most playful reveries around Birkin: Jane B par Agn\u00e8s V was a 1988 docudrama that was an \u201cimaginary biopic\u201d. It is a surreal kaleidoscope of images and personae, imagined and curated with real love and veneration by Varda. Perhaps it was impossible to capture exactly what Jane Birkin was to the French and to everyone else, but Varda came closest. Birkin was a unique, beguiling and energising force in music and movies."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/protests-and-pimms-wimbledon-winds-up-after-fortnight-of-on-and-off-court-drama", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Protests and Pimm\u2019s: Wimbledon winds up after a fortnight of on- and off-court drama", "lead": "This year\u2019s tournament has been eventful, with queueing chaos, curfew controversy and some cheer for British fans", "author": "Alexandra Topping", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:07:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627691", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a9ccc9e096014503e8d19c3a81fc53e17886db/0_169_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "New arrivals in Wimbledon in the past few weeks have been bombarded with a huge banner as they exit the station en route to the tennis. \u201cAlways like never before,\u201d it booms. That has certainly been true of the 2023 edition, in which there have been protests and geopolitical rows, breakout stars and sparkling runs, doily dresses and \u2013 quite possibly \u2013 a finale that will prove to be a pivotal moment in modern tennis. On the final day of the competition, fans were treated to a masterclass between the 36-year-old Wimbledon veteran Novak Djokovic and the 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz. The Spaniard finally triumphed in a five-set thriller watched by a deafening Centre Court crowd, who could hardly contain their joy at bearing witness to match for the ages. Alcaraz wasn\u2019t born the last time someone other than Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray or Djokovic won the men\u2019s singles, and played, as promised, with no fear. Speaking after being presented with the trophy by the Princess of Wales, he said it was a dream come true. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s great to win, but even if I had lost, I would be really proud of myself with this amazing run, making history in this beautiful tournament, playing a final against a legend of our sport.\u201d Djokovic, who saluted Alcaraz and his team, said he had shown great quality in serving out the match. \u201cYou deserve it, absolutely, amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I would have trouble with you only on clay and hard courts, but not on grass. But now it\u2019s a different story from this year obviously,\u201d he joked. The Serb, who at one point in the four-hour, 42-minute match broke his racket by hitting it into the net post in a moment of frustration, broke down in tears as he thanked his family for their support, adding: \u201cI will give you a big hug, and we can all love each other.\u201d The players were watched from the royal box by the Prince and Princess of Wales, joined by their eight-year-old daughter, Charlotte, making her first trip to Wimbledon, and her brother George. Alongside them sat Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI, whom Alcaraz hailed as a lucky talisman. The crowd was packed with stars, including the actors Brad Pitt, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz, the film-maker Guy Ritchie, the producer Jeremy Kleine and the rapper Stormzy. There was also something for the British public to cheer about when 17-year-old Henry Searle became the first British boys\u2019 champion at Wimbledon in 61 years, beating the Russian fifth seed Yaroslav Demin 6-4, 6-4 in the final. Boosted by a joyously rowdy 30-strong group of friends and family from Wolverhampton, Searle beat his fourth top-10 seed of the week and raised the trophy \u2013 a feat he managed without dropping a set. Searle, whose fastest serve was measured at 134mph \u2013 quicker than Djokovic\u2019s in this tournament \u2013 thanked his \u201cbarmy army\u201d for their support after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty special feeling and it\u2019s not going to come too often, so I\u2019m going to try to enjoy it. It was amazing in front of this crowd today,\u201d he said. Another British player Alfie Hewett\u2019s hopes of adding to his Wimbledon trophy haul were dashed in the men\u2019s wheelchair singles final when he was beaten 6-4 6-2 by Tokito Oda, who only turned 17 in May. On Saturday, the Czech Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 became the first woman to win the competition unseeded, emulating Boris Becker in the 1985 men\u2019s singles, after she beat the Tunisian Ons Jabeur. Neal Skupski became just the second Briton to win the Wimbledon men\u2019s doubles in the open era, while Hewett and his British partner Gordon Reid won their fifth Wimbledon wheelchair doubles title. The matches bring to a close an eventful two weeks that have seen no shortage of drama on and off the court. The tournament opened to glorious sunshine but there was unprecedented chaos in the normally polite and orderly queue. This year, organisers implemented stricter security measures, which included the use of undercover police officers, in an attempt to halt climate protesters who had already disrupted several events this year. The airport-style checks resulted in long waits to get in: some people complained they had been waiting for 10 hours, with little communication from organisers about when they could hope to enter the grounds. Wimbledon apologised and did a 360-degree reassessment of its procedures, although full bag searches continued throughout the week. They ultimately proved futile, with Just Stop Oil protesters disrupting play twice on the third day by running on to court 18 and throwing jigsaws bought in the onsite shop. It was time to focus on tennis, and unfortunately for British fans there was little to cheer after the early stages. The two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray went out in the second round, hinting that he may have played his last Wimbledon match, while Liam Broady and Cameron Norrie were knocked out on Fragile Friday. The British female No 1 Katie Boulter was the last of the Brits to vacate the competition on Saturday. Murray\u2019s departure led to more debate about the scheduling at Wimbledon and its 11pm curfew, after he lost to Greece\u2019s Stefanos Tsitsipas having taken the lead before their match was postponed at 10.40pm. He suggested live electronic line calling should be used at the competition, after a crucial call wrongly went against him \u2013 tournament organisers said they were considering the move. Fans found themselves implicated in a geopolitical row that bubbled beneath the surface as Russian and Belarusian players were let back into the competition as neutrals after being banned from playing last year. The Belarusian Victoria Azarenka faced some boos as she left the court after her defeat against the Ukrainian Elina Svitolina, who had a baby less than nine months ago and carried the hopes of a nation to the semi-finals, earning pride from her compatriots and disbelief from exhausted new parents. Azarenka said the treatment was \u201cnot fair\u201d as she was respecting Svitolina\u2019s decision to not shake the hands of any Russian or Belarusian players while Russian troops remain in Ukraine. The Belarusian suggested Wimbledon fans had drunk \u201ca lot of Pimm\u2019s\u201d when questioned about the seemingly misplaced boos at the post-match press conference. \u201cIf people are going to be focusing only on handshakes or [the] quite drunk crowd booing in the end, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d she said. The Guardian understands there are no plans to limit the amount of Pimm\u2019s for sale next year at SW19."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/16/tour-de-france-2023-stage-15-shadow-mont-blanc-cycling", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France: Vingegaard clings on to yellow jersey as Poels wins stage 15 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "On a 179km stage filled with tough climbs, Wout Poels powered to victory to take his first ever Tour de France stage win in a mountain-top finish at Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc", "author": "Amy Sedghi", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:01:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627710", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a18d29bf1635e569463813d3643c6e37652a07f4/296_612_5052_3032/500.jpg", "body": "Stage 15 report: The game of poker that is the 2023 Tour de France continued in the shadow of Mont Blanc as the defending Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard and his closest rival, Tadej Pogacar, bluffed their way to the summit finish of stage 15 at Saint-Gervais Mont Blanc.

I\u2019m going to wrap this up, thank you all for your messages and get ready for my post live blog bike ride. Vingegaard is coming round but Pogacar manages to roll over the line with him. There is nothing to separate these two, but Pogacar did well try. Rodriguez comes across not long after to cement his place as third on the GC. Pogacar goes again with 500m to go. He can\u2019t drop Vingegaard. Pogacar attacks. Vingegaard is on him. There\u2019s 700m to go. This is tense. It\u2019s 1km to go. What is going to happen? I\u2019m on the edge of my seat. It\u2019s 2km left for the yellow jersey group. The trio are still together, Yates is still away. Van Aert crosses the line second and is 2min 5sec down. Adam Yates has just ridden away from Pogacar and Vingegaard. Rodriguez is back. What\u2019s happening?? Wout Poels has taken the stage win! It\u2019s been a brutal day in the mountains, but the Bahrain Victorious rider has played a blinder. 1km to go: Poels is now more than 1min 30sec clear but van Aert is trying to hang on for second. Pretty remarkable ride from the Belgian given the amount of climbing in this stage. 2km to go: In the yellow jersey group, Gaudu, Rodriguez and Kuss have all been dropped. It\u2019s now just Adam Yates, Pogacar and Vingegaard. 3km to go: Poels\u2019 lead keeps increasing. It\u2019s more than 1min now. He looks unstoppable. Meanwhile, Hindley has dropped off the back of the yellow jersey group but Rodriguez and Gaudu are still in there. Could the final podium positions be decided today? 4km to go: Pidcock has just flown back into the yellow jersey group with a trademark descent. He\u2019d been dropped on C\u00f4te des Amerands. 5km to go: Back to the action. In the battle of the Wouts, Poels has extended his lead over van Aert to 40sec. It looks like the stage win could be his. 6km to go: As the lead riders start the ascent up Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc, it feels about time to share the words Tom from North Carolina sent me earlier.

Who do you fancy: Pogi or Jonas?\u201d 7km to go: UAE Emirates have now taken control of the yellow jersey group and are pushing hard up the C\u00f4te des Amerands. Poels has gone over the top of the climb with a 30sec advantage over Soler and van Aert.

Elsewhere, the chase group has hit the climb and Ciccone is eyeing up some more mountain points. 10km: Poels hasn\u2019t waited long. He\u2019s launched an attack and van Aert hasn\u2019t reacted. 11km to go: Here it comes\u2026the leading riders, Poels and van Aert, have started the climb. Soler is just behind, having been distanced on the descent. 18km to go: The lead group are approaching the C\u00f4te des Amerands. It\u2019s a second category climb as it\u2019s only 2.7km long but it has an average gradient of 10.9% and a max of 17%. It\u2019ll be a real stinger at this stage in the day. After this, they\u2019ll have a brief respite before going straight into the final climb to the finish. 24km to go: For those following the fortunes of Petit, he\u2019s still hanging on in the gruppetto (20min behind). 29km to go: Now that van Aert is in the lead group, the gap to the peloton has gone out to nearly 7min. Meanwhile, the remainder of the breakaway is 50secs behind and has 15 riders in it, including Ciccone, Guillaume Martin, Thibaut Pinot and Mikel Landa. The green jersey group is 19min behind. 36km to go: Neilands has been shown leaning up against a concrete wall but seems to be getting up gingerly. From the coverage, it looks like he was trying to grab a bidon from a motorbike and went over the handlebars. 42km to go: The lead group now contains Soler, van Aert, Krists Neilands and Wout Poels. 46km to go: Both van Aert and Woods have broken off the group to join Soler. Has van Aert been given the go-ahead to go for the stage win? Meanwhile, van Baarle continues to lead the main group up the Col de Aravis. The gap stays at around 6min. No major talking points in the GC battle yet. 47km to go: Marc Soler of UAE Emirates has attacked. Ciccone, van Aert and Woods are trying to limit the damage. 49km to go: We\u2019re back on the next climb \u2013 the Col de Aravis. Really didn\u2019t get much of a break, did they? Back in the peloton, Jumbo-Visma are setting a high pace with Dylan van Baarle on the front. The gap has been reduced to just over 6min from around 9min earlier. 54km to go: Ciccone goes level with Powless on the King of the Mountains classification. He\u2019ll want to secure a lead on the next climb, which is coming up shortly after a brief descent. 55km to go: Rui Costa is not going to repeat history as he has been caught with 1.5km to the summit. The chase group \u2013 now the lead group - has been reduced to 24 riders, including Ciccone and van Aert. 56km to go: Could Rui Costa be looking to repeat history? The Portuguese rider went solo up the same ascent 10 years ago to take the stage 19 win in the 2013 Tour de France. 57km to go: It has now been confirmed that Powless is off the back and about 1min 10sec behind the Ciccone group. He could be struggling to stay in the polka dot jersey today. 59km to go: False alarm. Powless is back in. Sorry for any distress caused. Rui Costa is now on his own and has a gap of about 45sec. 61km to go: Bad news for those fans from the USA, as Powless is dropping off the breakaway group. Rui Costa, however, has made it across to Haller and they\u2019re working together. 62km to go: Riders are trying to stay cool any way they can. 64km to go: Rui Costa of Intermarch\u00e9\u2013Circus\u2013Wanty has attacked to try and bridge to Haller. It looks tough and hot out there. In fact, this stage has the second highest amount of elevation of all the stages in this year\u2019s Tour. The highest amount of elevation comes on Wednesday\u2019s stage next week, a day after the individual time trial. 74km to go: Marco Haller of Bora-Hansgrohe has attacked on the latest descent. According to the commentary, he is a big Arsenal fan. The next climb, Col de la Croix Fry, is coming up in around 7km. It has been used in the Tour six times previously and was last ridden during the 2018 edition. 79km to go: Bryan Coquard of Cofidis has just had a bike change. His handlebars had snapped in half. Didn\u2019t look great and can only imagine how tense it must make him feel having an issue like that. 81km to go: Time for some more data from the Tour. 85km to go: Alaphilippe and Lutsenko have been caught. With 85km to go and four more categorised climbs to come, there are 39 riders now in the leading group. Ciccone and Powless will be keen to hoover up as many mountain points as they can. 87km to go: Powless, who along with Vingegaard held 54 points on the mountain classification, has now gone back into the lead and has 58 points. Ciccone though is hot on his heels and has pulled back a further two points with his sprint. I know there\u2019s quite a few of you tuning in from the USA and keeping an eye on Powless. 96km to go: Lutsenko reaches the summit of Col de la Forclaz de Montmin with Alaphilippe behind. They have a gap of 40 seconds on the chasers. Ciccone outsprints Powless for third place. 98km to go: With 2km to go on the climb, it\u2019s as you were with Alaphilippe and Lutsenko still holding a 35sec advantage. Ciccone is speeding up in the chasing group. 100km to go: With a subject header that has delighted me (\u201cAnnecy/Pastries/Weeping\u201d), Duncan has emailed in to share a story about Annecy, pastries\u2026and weeping. Here it is: \u201cOn the subject of pastries and Annecy, a few years back my wife and I each consumed a staggering mille-feuile (sic)\u2026we then set off immediately and rode the 17km climb from the lake up to the ski station at Semnoz. I could taste the custard all the way to the top and was weeping a little by the end.\u201d 103km to go: Alaphilippe and Lutsenko take a 30sec lead into the base of the first climb, Col de la Forclaz de Montmin. This climb might whittle that 35-man breakaway down a bit. 107km to go: Alaphilippe takes the win in the intermediate sprint and bags 20 points. Lutsenko follows and gets 17 points, while Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Pro) grabs 15 points. My soigneur (aka boyfriend) is very happy as he has Abrahamsen in his fantasy Tour team. There are five categorised climbs on the menu today\u2026Thankfully no hors cat\u00e9gorie climb for the riders today though. The first of the five is cropping up in around 7km. Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers: Col de la Forclaz de Montmin \u2013 A 7.2km first category climb with an average gradient of 7.3% and a summit at 1,157m. Col de la Croix Fry \u2013 An 11.3km first category climb with an average gradient of 7% and a summit at 1,477m. Col des Aravis \u2013 A 4.4km third category climb with an average gradient of 5.8% and a summit at 1,487m. C\u00f4te des Amerands \u2013 A 2.7km second category climb with an average gradient of 10.9% and a summit at 888m. Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc \u2013 A 7km first category climb with an average gradient of 7.7% and a summit of 1,372m. 113km to go: The peloton has really slowed the pace now and let the large breakaway group of 35 riders go. They are now about five minutes ahead, with Alaphilippe and Lutsenko a further 35sec up the road. 115km to go: The peloton just passed the second largest lake in France, Lake Annecy, and it is looking resplendent in the sunshine. I\u2019ve had a reader get in touch about local delicacies (especially pastries) of the area. I have been to the beautiful Lake Annecy a few times but it\u2019s been a while and I can\u2019t recall. Anyone else have any ideas? 117km to go: Jens Voigt on Eurosport has been speaking from the back of the motorbike and urges fans on the side of the road \u201cnot to step into the office\u201d of the riders. He says they should remember that the pros are the real spectacle, not them. Wise words. 124km to go: The peloton has slowed to allow the riders caught up in the crash to get back on. As a result the breakaway has gone out to 1min 30sec. 127 km to go: It looks like Nathan Van Hooydonck (Jumbo-Visma) came off worst in that crash. The TV coverage is telling us it was due to one of his team-mates being clipped by a fan taking a selfie on the side of the road. 133km to go: Alaphilippe and Lutsenko are off the front. Alaphilippe is doing one of his trademark descents and Lutsenko is trying to stay in touch. 140km to go: Petit is off the back of the peloton and looks to be in pain following yesterday\u2019s crash. It\u2019ll be a monumental effort if he finishes the stage today. 142km to go: Bill will be happy to see that van Aert has made it across to the front group. If anyone can make it stick, you\u2019d think it would be the Belgian rider. 145km to go: Politt is joined by Julian Alaphilippe, Aur\u00e9lien Paret-Peintre and Alexey Lutsenko. Can they make this four man breakaway stick? Various others are trying to get across, so maybe not. 149km to go: Nils Politt of Bora\u2013Hansgrohe has attacked solo and has around 22sec on the main group. He probably wishes somebody had come with him. There\u2019s still quite some way to go\u2026 151km to go: There were nine riders in the front group, including van der Poel and Powless. Lidl-Trek have been pushing the pace because they didn\u2019t want Ciccone to miss out and now it is all back together. Bill has been in touch via email and is hoping for more of yesterday\u2019s racing excitement in today\u2019s stage. He writes: \u201cWow! That was some too [sic] drawer thrilling heroics from Wout van Aert yesterday! Imagine doing all that work, seeing the end of your day, then having to unexpectedly go again! Marvellous stuff! \u201cIt really was a stage that got its stomp on from the beginning, then refining itself to one of the best days of racing I think I have ever seen\u2026more of yesterday\u2019s excitement, please!\u201d 162km to go: Felix Gall and Pello Bilbao, along with Sepp Kuss, are in the second group. It looks like the gap is coming down and they are all coming back together. 166km to go: The peloton has split into two and there is around a 30sec gap between them. It doesn\u2019t look like any of the favourites have been caught out, but I\u2019ll keep an eye on it. 168km to go: The peloton is very strung out at the moment, so anyone wanting to get in the breakaway will have to ensure they are not too far back. The pace looks rapid and is causing splits. 172km to go: Wout van Aert is on the front and is leading the peloton down a long descent, while Lidl-Trek look interested in getting Giulio Ciccone in the break today so he can chase that polka dot jersey. Interestingly, Bahrain Victorious have been told on the team radio to move up if they want a chance of getting in the breakaway. 176km to go: While we wait for the race to develop, here are a couple of interesting facts to chew on: Jonas Vingegaard is leading the mountains classification for the fifth time in his career but has never worn the polka dot jersey as he\u2019s been in yellow each time. He has 54 points \u2013 the same as Powless. At the start of stage 15, the gap between first and second GC ranking is the fifth smallest gap in the history of Le Tour after 2008. Pogacar is 10sec behind Vingegaard. 178km to go: The race proper has begun. Mathieu van der Poel has attacked. What are his plans for today? Rodriguez has lost one of his key domestiques in Dani Martinez (Ineos Grenadiers), who has not started today due to concussion following yesterday\u2019s crash. Even pro riders can\u2019t resist a selfie\u2026 Stage 15: The riders are off and it\u2019s a much nicer looking day weather wise for them. A bit hot but hopefully the roads won\u2019t be so slippery. Yesterday\u2019s stage saw seven riders abandon the Tour and a number of riders come down in a mass crash. There was also an epic GC battle. Plus, a first stage win for Rodriguez as he caught Vingegaard and Pogacar by surprise as he attacked on the descent of the final climb, the Col de Joux Plane. What have we got in store today? A bit of honest reflection ahead of today\u2019s stage courtesy of French rider Adrien Petit. He had a rather painful looking gash below his glutes after yesterday\u2019s mass crash. Hope he\u2019s not feeling too sore. Luckily, the second rest day is nearly upon the peloton. Welcome to stage 15 of the Tour de France\u2026Prior to today\u2019s live blog, I indulged in a spot of gardening as the sun is shining so brightly here in London. Unfortunately, I did get a splinter\u2026in a key typing finger. But, in the spirit of the Tour, we pick ourselves up and carry on. Let me know what you\u2019ve been doing to prepare (or not) for today\u2019s stage. There\u2019s a lot of climbs to come and it looks like it\u2019s going to be another testing day for the peloton. A little bit on Les Gets les portes du soleil, where stage 15 will begin: \u201cThe Haute-Savoie ski resort of Les Portes du Soleil has been on the Tour route many times, for final stages that have finished in Morzine and Avoriaz. For example, the latter last visited in 2010 when Andy Schleck was the victor. Three stages of the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 have also been held in Les Gets, including a prologue won by Alberto Contador at the start of the 2016 edition. \u201cIn winter, skiing is the main attraction and in summer the resort becomes a focal point for mountain bikers. The World MTB Championships were held here in 2004 and again in 2022. French colours featured prominently last summer, with Pauline Ferrand-Pr\u00e9vot taking two rainbow jerseys.\u201d Yellow: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) 57hr 47min 28sec Green: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) 323 points Polka-dot: Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) White: Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) Stage 14 report: Every second counts in the 2023 Tour de France, as the defending champion, Jonas Vingegaard, and his closest rival, Tadej Pogacar, again demonstrated as they fought their way through the Alps, scrapping over bonus seconds on stage 14, from Annemasse to Morzine.

David Gaudu is the rider French fans will expect to emulate Bardet, but if the overall contenders get involved that will be a big ask."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/16/two-child-benefit-cap-explainer", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What is the UK\u2019s two-child benefit cap and how has it affected families?", "lead": "A brief guide to the policy that Keir Starmer has pledged to keep despite widespread criticism", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627728", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/00090e2be5c5fdc488763652d3a7bb530d1827c3/0_339_5079_3047/500.jpg", "body": "Keir Starmer has created alarm among anti-poverty campaigners and despair in his own party by ruling out scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Here we take a look at the policy, why it is so unpopular and why there is so much anger at the Labour leader\u2019s decision to keep it. What is the two-child benefit cap? It prevents parents from claiming child tax credit or universal credit for any third or subsequent child born after April 2017. It was introduced by the former chancellor George Osborne in his austerity drive with the aim of encouraging parents of larger families to find a job or work more hours. What impact has the cap had? It has affected an estimated 1.5 million children, and research has shown that the policy has impoverished families rather than increasing employment. Last week a study found that as many as one in four children in some of England and Wales\u2019s poorest constituencies are in families left at least \u00a33,000 poorer by the policy. It also found that in the most ethnically diverse communities, 14% of children were hit by the cap. How much would it cost to scrap the cap? Abolishing the cap would cost \u00a31.3bn a year but would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, and a further 850,000 would be in less deep poverty, according to campaigners. The End Child Poverty coalition says removing the cap would be the most cost-effective way of reducing the number of children living in poverty. How much opposition has there been to the cap? More than 50 organisations have called for it to be abolished, including the Church of England, the TUC, the Children\u2019s Society and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The prominent social policy academic Prof Jonathan Bradshaw called it \u201cthe worst ever social security policy\u201d in a crowded field going back to the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Even David Freud, a Conservative welfare minister at the time of the policy\u2019s announcement, later called the policy \u201cvicious\u201d. He said it was foisted on reluctant ministers by Osborne\u2019s Treasury as the price of introducing universal credit and should be scrapped. What has Labour previously said about the cap? A number of Labour frontbenchers have roundly criticised the cap. Only last month, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cWe are very, very aware that this is one of the single most heinous elements of the system which is pushing children and families into poverty today.\u201d Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described it as \u201cobscene and inhumane\u201d, and in 2020 Starmer himself tweeted: \u201cWe must \u2026 scrap punitive sanctions, two-child limit and benefit caps.\u201d What has been the reaction to Starmer\u2019s announcement? Labour MPs have mostly been silent, but Labour members of the Scottish parliament criticised his comments and urged others to fight it. And the former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that we now need an honest and fundamental discussion in the Labour party about child poverty, its causes and the impact of the policies introduced by the Tories, including the two-child limit, because it\u2019s obvious some in the party don\u2019t fully appreciate its impact.\u201d The Green party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that it was \u201cstaggering that Starmer\u2019s Labour wouldn\u2019t even lift the 2 child cap on child benefit. Unspecified \u2018reforms\u2019 are no substitute for urgently needed public investment. And if he doesn\u2019t want to borrow, he could levy wealth tax on super rich \u2013 there\u2019s no hope here.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/16/pennsylvania-flash-floods-dead-missing", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "At least three killed and four missing after flash floods in Pennsylvania", "lead": "Torrential rainstorm swept through township in south-eastern Pennsylvania, killing several and leaving behind a slew of damage", "author": "Maya Yang", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:56:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627746", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aeade682fc1aaceb67065333f674c38438b39525/0_0_2768_1662/500.jpg", "body": "At least three people have been killed by a sudden flash flood in Pennsylvania while four others remain missing. On Saturday evening, flash floods as a result of a torrential rainstorm swept through Upper Makefield township in south-eastern Pennsylvania, killing several and leaving behind a slew of damage including submerged buildings. According to Upper Makefield township\u2019s police department, the worst of the damage occurred along Route 532 in the area of Stonebridge Crossing Road between Aqueduct Road and Wrightstown Road. \u201cIt is with great sorrow that we regretfully announce that three people who were swept away by the flood waters were found deceased,\u201d the police department said. Speaking to the Bucks County Courier Times, Bucks county coroner Meredith Buck confirmed the deaths, saying that two of the victims were found together in one area while another was found in a separate area. All three victims were discovered outside their vehicles, Buck said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s very possible it could be more.\u201d According to the police department, police and fire teams were able to rescue one woman who was trapped in her vehicle while search efforts continue for three to four people who are still missing. Local reports indicate that one of the missing individuals is a nine-month-old baby. In a statement to the Associated Press, Upper Makefield fire chief Tim Brewer said that the area received between 6.5 to 7in of rain in 45 minutes and that three out of 11 cars on the road at the time were swept away. \u201cIn my 44 years, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it \u2026 When the water came up, it came up very swiftly. We do not think that anybody drove into it, that they were actively on that road when it happened,\u201d said Brewer, adding that around 150 people were searching the creek on Saturday night and 100 people were involved in the search on Sunday. Following the floods, several roads have been closed, police said. \u201cAs for the roadways, Taylorsville Road from Route 532 to Route 295 is closed, River Road by Francisco\u2019s is closed, and River Road between Route 532 and Mt Eyre Road is closed. If you are driving in and around the township, please be careful as there is a lot of debris on the roadway,\u201d the police added. Nearby police departments have joined in on the search and rescue operations. \u201cOur department is assisting Upper Makefield Township Police Department with a search and rescue operation on Taylorsville Road in the area of Washington Crossing Road (Route 532) for missing persons lost in the flood. Avoid the area to allow emergency personnel to safely perform their duties,\u201d the Newtown township police department announced. \u201cAs a reminder, don\u2019t attempt to traverse through flooded roadways,\u201d it added. As of Sunday morning, several flash flood warnings have been issued across multiple counties in Pennsylvania including Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton and Philadelphia."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/australia-retain-ashes-as-england-fall-short-in-record-run-chase-in-second-odi", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia retain Ashes as England fall short in record run chase in second ODI", "lead": "England\u2019s hopes of a miraculous Ashes comeback ended with a dramatic three-run defeat at the Ageas Bowl", "author": "Raf Nicholson at the Ageas Bowl", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:52:45", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627765", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aca3db2762cf360d4c121fe9b860fa68706f8010/0_44_2395_1437/500.jpg", "body": "Australia retained the Ashes after beating England by three runs in this one-day international at the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, despite an unbeaten century from Nat Sciver-Brunt. England had collapsed to 203 for seven when Sarah Glenn joined Sciver-Brunt at the crease, with an unlikely 80 runs needed from the remaining 68 balls to achieve their highest ever winning chase \u2013 but Sciver\u2011Brunt took just enough calculated risks to keep them in the hunt. Put down by a sprawling Georgia Wareham at deep midwicket on 97 in the penultimate over, she brought up her hundred the very next ball, digging out Ash Gardner\u2019s yorker to long\u2011on for a single. The job was not done, though: 15 runs still needed from Jess Jonassen\u2019s final over. The pair ran hard, but though Sciver-Brunt\u2019s first slog\u2011sweep found the boundary off the third, she was left needing five off the final ball and could manage only a single. Australia now have an unassailable 8-6 lead on points in the series, with one match left to play. But though England\u2019s dream of a first Ashes win in a decade may be over, they once again lived up to the billing of their coach, Jon Lewis, whose mission is for his team to \u201cinspire and entertain\u201d. Heather Knight labelled it \u201cthe best series there\u2019s ever been in the history of the women\u2019s game\u201d. After a match that once again came down to the final ball, Knight said: \u201cThe Ashes are gone, which is disappointing, but I feel pride that we got so close. This series has showed that we\u2019re very evenly matched. \u201cIn terms of us as a group, we\u2019ve come a long way especially in terms of the mental side of it, being really calm and clear.\u201d England were left ruing their earlier efforts in the field, having allowed Ellyse Perry to reach 91 after a series of let-offs, before Wareham smashed 26 runs off Lauren Bell\u2019s final over to elevate Australia\u2019s final total to 282 for seven. This was a reinvigorated Australia side, armed with different tactics: Gardner was handed the new ball, while Alana King was brought into the XI after missing out in the preceding four white-ball matches, and pouched three of England\u2019s top five en route to figures of three for 44. Admittedly, Knight\u2019s dismissal was marginal: the England captain was given out lbw, reviewed instantly, and looked confused when the third umpire upheld the on-field decision, despite Ultraedge seeming to show a small spike as the ball went past her bat. There was no such doubt, though, when King sent down a ripper which drifted in and turned away from Tammy Beaumont to hit the top of her off stump, nor when Alice Capsey holed out to deep midwicket in the 24th over, as England sank to 123 for four. All seemed lost when Amy Jones and Sophie Ecclestone perished within three balls of each other in the 39th, both attempting the sweep to Gardner, until Sciver-Brunt\u2019s heroics gave the crowd something to cheer about. It had started so well for the hosts. Handed the new ball on a hard, bouncy pitch, Bell got off to a dream start by removing both openers early. Alyssa Healy looked every inch the tired captain under pressure, sending up an easy catch to Capsey at short third to leave her side 27 for two in the sixth over. But as they are wont to do, Australia\u2019s middle order dug in \u2013 Beth Mooney and Gardner contributing 33 runs apiece, before Annabel Sutherland struck a maiden ODI half\u2011century off just 47 balls as Australia gradually accelerated. Perry, of course, was the anchor, though oddly enough she never quite looked settled at the crease: she was put down on 50, 64 and 74 after sending a thick edge flying through vacant second slip just eight balls into her innings. Nonetheless, she remained stubbornly there, even as Kate Cross limped off the field after shelling her at mid-off, and after Glenn almost knocked herself out at deep fine leg flinging herself forward in an attempt to claim a catch. Ecclestone chimed in with a double-wicket 47th over, during which Perry and Sutherland sent the ball down the throat of long-off and long-on respectively. At 256 for seven with six balls left of the innings, England had every right to be hopeful. Suddenly, though, that dream start from Bell turned into a nightmare. Six, six, four, six, four from Wareham: the innings might have ended with a dot ball but the damage was done \u2013 to Bell\u2019s figures (her three for 85 the most expensive by an English woman in an ODI), and ultimately to England\u2019s Ashes hopes."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87b9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/16/opposition-grows-among-teachers-to-65-pay-offer-in-england", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Opposition grows among teachers to 6.5% pay offer in England", "lead": "Union members are concerned about funding for the below-inflation increase and the lack of a long-term agreement", "author": "Richard Adams Education editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:48:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627784", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/63c375b8f9046c37782d3921dd3a19ed42f1f19b/0_184_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Concerns over how the rise promised to teachers in England will be funded, and dismay at the lack of a long-term agreement on pay, has stirred opposition to the government\u2019s offer among union members. The deal announced between the government and England\u2019s four school teaching and leadership unions would mean an across-the-board 6.5% pay rise from September, with a slightly higher increase for new teachers to bring their starting salary up to \u00a330,000 a year. Mid-career teachers would get a rise of between \u00a32,500 and \u00a33,000 in their annual pay. But Rishi Sunak\u2019s rhetoric that public sector pay increases will not be funded by higher taxes or borrowing, and his comments that the government will \u201cfind this money\u201d through higher visa fees and surcharges on migrants, risks alienating teachers already angry at the below-inflation increase. Teachers on WhatsApp groups and social media have expressed concerns that their pay rises are being funded on the backs of immigrants, and whether it comes at the expense of existing school budgets. Groups within the National Education Union (NEU) have begun organising to oppose to the deal, with national executive members allied to the Socialist party campaigning for members to reject the pay offer in a union-wide ballot to be held later this month. The NEU\u2019s executive has scheduled an emergency online meeting on Monday evening to explain the details of the offer and funding to members. Kevin Courtney, the NEU\u2019s joint general secretary, stressed that the deal did mean more new money for schools, despite efforts to disguise it by Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. The deal assumes schools have budgeted for a 3.5% pay rise, with the extra 3% to come from the Department for Education\u2019s central budgets. The DfE has won permission from the Treasury to use its departmental budget underspends to part-fund the \u00a3900m required in 2024-25. The remainder will come from what the DfE described as \u201creprioritisation\u201d of future spending. Courtney said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been given guarantees by the government that none of the \u00a3900m will come from schools, it\u2019s not going to come from frontline services, with explicit guarantees that it\u2019s not coming from special education needs, early years, 16-19 [years], or school capital budgets.\u201d Daniel Kebede, the incoming NEU general secretary, also sought to reassure teachers: \u201cMembers have achieved so much. They have moved the government from 3.5% to 6.5%. They have won extra funding for schools. The deal is NOT perfect or ideal\u2026 Whichever way the vote goes, the fight for pay restoration is NOT over.\u201d But Debs Gwynn, one of the executive members opposed to the deal, told colleagues: \u201cThe offer is short of what we were asking. It is not inflation proof, it does not redress the real-term losses we have suffered over the past 13 years and it does not address the chronic funding and staffing crisis in our schools.\u201d All four unions are to ballot their members over the offer, with the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders, NASUWT and the NEU all recommending that their members accept it. The unions are continuing to hold strike ballots alongside the vote on the offer. The NASUWT announced last week that it received enough votes to pass the legal threshold for strike action, while the remaining ballots close at the end of this month."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87ba", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-shoots-down-nine-ukrainian-drones-over-crimea-moscow-official-says", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: drones shot down over Crimea, Moscow claims; Putin says Russia has stockpile of cluster bombs \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Russia says air defence forces intercepted attacks over port city of Sevastopol; Putin says Russia will take \u2018reciprocal\u2019 action if devices used on his troops", "author": "Nicola Slawson (now); Jane Clinton and Yang Tian (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:45:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627803", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/df1bf69a87e429a7c196ed5b3c7cacd7b4763c86/0_331_5000_3002/500.jpg", "body": "It\u2019s 19:45 in Kyiv, and here\u2019s a summary of the key developments from the day: Ukraine says fighting has intensified on the eastern front as further details emerged about the number of Wagner fighters who have relocated to Belarus. \u201cThe situation has somewhat intensified in the east,\u201d the Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Sunday.

That\u2019s it for today from me. Thank you for following along. For more updates, follow our live coverage tomorrow. Here\u2019s more from Reuters about the subsidiary of the French yoghurt maker Danone that is being taken under Russian state control: The Russian state has taken control of French yoghurt maker Danone\u2019s Russian subsidiary along with beer company Carlsberg\u2019s stake in a local brewer, according to a decree signed by Vladimir Putin on Sunday. The decree said that foreign-owned stakes in Danone Russia and Baltika breweries were being put under the \u2018temporary management\u2019 of government property agency Rosimushchestvo. The move comes after the Russian subsidiaries of Germany\u2019s Uniper and Finland\u2019s Fortum were taken under state control in April. The Kremlin warned at the time it could seize more western assets on what it said was a temporary basis in retaliation for foreign moves against Russian companies abroad. Danone said last October it was seeking a buyer for its dairy food business in Russia, in a deal that could lead to a write-off of up to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m). The decree published on Sunday said also that Danish brewer Carlsberg\u2019s stake in Russian-based Baltika breweries had been put under state management. Carlsberg said in June it had signed an agreement to sell its Russian business, subject to regulatory approvals. Danone and Carlsberg were not immediately available for comment. Ukraine says fighting has intensified on the eastern front as further details emerged about the number of Wagner troops who had relocated to Belarus. \u201cThe situation has somewhat intensified in the east,\u201d the Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Sunday. She added that Ukrainian forces were on the defensive near the eastern city of Kupiansk but making advances near Bakhmut. Maliar wrote on Telegram: For two days in a row, the enemy has been actively attacking in the Kupiansk sector in the Kharkiv region. We are on the defence. Only a \u201cfew hundred\u201d fighters from Russia\u2019s Wagner Group have so far relocated to Belarus, a Ukrainian official said on Sunday, leaving the eventual fate of the fighting force unclear. The Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was given free rein to build a mercenary army of tens of thousands of contractors and prisoners, agreed to relocate his forces to Belarus as part of a deal to end his mutiny against the Kremlin last month. Since then, however, there has been conflicting messaging about the fate of Wagner, which has carried out some of the most fierce fighting for the Russian side in Ukraine. Belarusian authorities say Wagner trainers have arrived in the country, and both Polish and Ukrainian authorities have confirmed this, but so far there does not appear to have been a mass relocation. The whereabouts of Prigozhin also remain a mystery. Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s border guards, told Ukrainian television on Sunday: There are some groups of mercenaries on the territory of Belarus, but we are not talking about any massive or large-scale deployment \u2026 we are talking about a few hundred. On Thursday, the Pentagon briefed that while the majority of Wagner forces were still in Russian-occupied Ukraine, they were \u201ceffectively are no longer contributing as a significant combat capability\u201d, according to a spokesperson. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has claimed Wagner has handed over thousands of tonnes of weaponry to the regular Russian army. Read the full story here: Andrew E Kramer in the The New York Times [paywall] has written about the deadly landmines that are slowing the progress of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. It was a grisly scene of bloody limbs and crumpled vehicles as a series of Russian mines exploded across a field in southern Ukraine. One Ukrainian soldier stepped on a mine and tumbled onto the grass in the buffer zone between the two armies. Nearby lay other Ukrainian troops, their legs in tourniquets, waiting for medical evacuation, according to videos posted online and the accounts of several soldiers involved \u2026 Five weeks into a counteroffensive that even Ukrainian officials say is off to a halting start, interviews with commanders and soldiers fighting along the front indicate the slow progress comes down to one major problem: landmines. The full report is here. The Russian state has taken control of shares in the Russian subsidiary of French food producer Danone, according to a decree signed by Vladimir Putin on Sunday. The decree also said that shares in Baltika Breweries, a Russian-based brewing company, would be transferred to state management, Reuters reported. Fighting in eastern Ukraine has \u201csomewhat intensified\u201d as Ukrainian and Russian forces clash in at least three areas on the eastern front, a senior Ukrainian defence official said on Sunday. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram that Russian forces had been attacking in the direction of Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region for two successive days. Maliar wrote: We are on the defensive. There are fierce battles, the positions of both sides change dynamically several times a day. She also said the two armies were pummelling one another around the ruined city of Bakhmut but that Ukrainian forces were \u201cgradually moving forward\u201d along its southern flank, Reuters reported. She added that Kyiv\u2019s troops were also fending off Russian attacks near Avdiivka and Maryinka. Accompanied by images from the war, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has tweeted: The world believes in Ukraine. The world is inspired by our courage, inspired by our heroes. And most importantly, Ukrainians believe in Ukraine, Ukrainians see what we are all capable of when we are together. We are the strongest when we are united. Here is a summary of events so far: President Vladimir Putin said Russia had a \u201csufficient stockpile\u201d of cluster bombs and that Moscow reserved the right to use them if such munitions were used against Russian forces in Ukraine. He added that Russia had not yet used the weapons despite a \u201ccertain shortage of munitions at some point\u201d.

Here are some images coming to us over the wires. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that a Ukrainian counteroffensive aimed at recapturing territory was \u201cnot succeeding\u201d and that attempts to break through Russian defences had failed. Putin made the remarks in an interview with state television, excerpts of which were released on Sunday, Reuters reported. Putin said: All attempts by the enemy to break through our defence ... have not been successful throughout the entire offensive. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken of the 55th separate artillery brigade \u201cZaporizhzhia Sich\u201d on Twitter. He posted a thank you to the brigade for a military chevron it gave him, calling them \u201cabsolutely heroic\u201d. Last month, I had the opportunity to personally communicate with them and support our warriors. They are absolutely heroic. They are tough, strong and confident in their actions. We will preserve Ukraine\u2019s independence. Because we have such warriors. Because we have a clear understanding of what we are fighting for. Thank you, guys, for this chevron! And especially thank you for your power and accuracy. According to The Kyiv Independent \u201cloud explosions\u201d were reported this morning on social media in occupied Luhansk, Berdiansk, Mariupol. There\u2019s been an update on Russia\u2019s announcement regarding Ukrainian drones downed around Sevastopol on the Crimea peninsula. The number has now risen from nine drones to at least 10, Russian officials have said. The Russian defence ministry said air defence shot down two unmanned aerial vehicles and electronically disabled five others, Agence France-Presse reported. The ministry also said its forces destroyed two naval drones and the thwarted attack resulted in \u201cno casualties or destruction.\u201d The Russian governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, later said on Telegram that a tenth drone had been electronically deactivated. A Chinese naval flotilla set off on Sunday to join Russian naval and air forces in the Sea of Japan in an exercise aimed at \u201csafeguarding the security of strategic waterways\u201d, according to China\u2019s defence ministry. Codenamed \u201cNorthern/Interaction-2023\u201d, the drill marks enhanced military cooperation between China and Russia since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported. The Chinese flotilla comprising five warships and four ship-borne helicopters left the eastern port of Qingdao and will rendezvous with Russian forces in a \u201cpredetermined area\u201d, the ministry said on its official WeChat account on Sunday. On Saturday, the ministry said Russian naval and air forces would participate in the drill taking place in the Sea of Japan. This would be the first time both Russian forces take part in the drill, state newspaper Global Times cited military observers as saying. The governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had shelled the Russian town of Shebekino near the Ukrainian border with Grad missiles, killing a woman riding her bike. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, which hardly ever publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia, Reuters reported. The Guardian was not able to verify what happened. Vyacheslav Gladkov, Belgorod\u2019s governor, said the Grad missiles had struck a market area, damaging a building and two cars. Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app: To much grief, one person was killed \u2013 a woman was riding a bicycle on the pavement at the time of the shelling. Injuries she received from shrapnel were incompatible with life. The Grad (Hail) weapons system is a truck-mounted multiple rocket launcher. Its use against civilian areas is regarded as a war crime by human rights activists. South Korea will provide more demining equipment to Ukraine, a South Korean official said on Sunday. The announcement came after President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s visit to Kyiv at the weekend where he pledged more military and humanitarian aid in the fight against Russia, Reuters reported. Yoon\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told a briefing: We are thinking to expand support on mine detectors and demining equipment as Ukraine\u2019s demand for them was assessed to be desperately huge. More from Tony Blair on Ukraine, who said it would be \u201ccompletely disastrous\u201d if the US rowed back support for Ukraine in the event of Donald Trump being re-elected as US president. I hope that a Trump presidency would not mean that \u2026because it would be completely disastrous if America withdrew its support from Ukraine. I think the way that President Biden has managed to marshal support for Ukraine and keep people pretty much on the same page has been a significant act of statesmanship. He added: Talking to Ukrainians \u2026 they want an end to this which is on terms that make it clear that no Russian president not this one, or any successive one, can ever come back and do this again. And I think that will be the overwhelming desire in eastern Europe as well. So for that to happen that American support has to firm. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has said Ukraine has done an \u201cextraordinary\u201d job in defending their country but when asked what endgame looked like he said the path will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d. He told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I think there are two issues \u2026 it\u2019s extremely difficult to see how you get a solution to this unless it\u2019s very clear that Ukraine has a clear path to European Union membership, and a clear path to Nato membership. I think probably people will wait and see what happens after this Ukrainian counter offensive. The Ukrainians have done an extraordinary job in defending their country and by the way, defending us by defending their country, but I think it will be how you deal with those two issues together. This is going to be extremely difficult, but I do think once we take stock after the counteroffensive, we\u2019ve got to see if there was a way to bring it to an end with a negotiated end to it. On territory, he added: Territory is going to be the most difficult thing because Ukrainians will never accept the territory that, from an international community point of view has being taken wrongly from them, should be left with with Russia. President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has a \u201csufficient stockpile\u201d of cluster bombs and that Moscow reserves the right to use them if such munitions are used against Russian forces in Ukraine. In a state TV interview, excerpts of which were published on Sunday, Putin said: Of course, if they are used against us, we reserve the right to take reciprocal action. He added Russia had not yet used the weapons despite a \u201ccertain shortage of munitions at some point.\u201d However, in April 2022, Russia was accused of using cluster munitions in the Kramatorsk railway station attack, which killed 63 civilians (including 9 children) and wounded 150 (including 34 children). Ukraine has received cluster bombs from the United States, munitions banned in more than 100 countries. Kyiv has pledged to only use them to dislodge concentrations of enemy soldiers, Reuters reported. One civilian was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region, while seven were injured in a village in Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said on Sunday. A 33-year-old man died and a man was wounded in Russian firing at residential buildings in the village of Kolodiazne in the region overnight, Oleh Sinehubov, Kharkiv\u2019s governor, said on the Telegram messaging app, Reuters reported. He said Russia had launched four S-400 surface-to-air missiles overnight at the city of Kharkiv, slightly damaging a residential building. The Zaporizhzhia governor, Yuriy Malashko, posted on Telegram that three women and four men were injured and a number of houses damaged in heavy Russian shelling from multiple rocket launchers on the village of Stepnohirske on Saturday afternoon. The Guardian could not independently verify these accounts. Here are the latest images coming out of Ukraine: US treasury secretary Janet Yellen says redoubling support for Ukraine is the \u201csingle best\u201d way to aid the global economy, AFP reports. Yellen, speaking on the sidelines of a G20 finance minister summit in India, said a \u201ckey priority\u201d was \u201cto redouble our support for Ukraine\u201d in its defence against Russia. After visiting Kyiv in February, Yellen said she had seen first-hand \u201cthe massive difference\u201d that foreign assistance was making, both to civilians and the Ukrainian military. \u201cEnding this war is first and foremost a moral imperative,\u201d Yellen told reporters in Gandhinagar. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the single best thing we can do for the global economy.\u201d Budgetary support is critical to Ukraine\u2019s resistance. By helping keep the economy and the government running, we are giving Ukraine the support it needs so it can fight for freedom and its sovereignty. She added that one of Washington\u2019s \u201ccore goals\u201d was to \u201ccombat Russia\u2019s efforts to evade our sanctions\u201d. Russia\u2019s security apparatus entered a period of confusion and negotiations after the Wagner group\u2019s mutiny and an interim arrangement for the future of the group has started to form in recent days, according to the UK Ministry of Defence\u2019s latest intelligence update. On 12 July 2023, the Russian MoD announced that Wagner had handed over 2000 pieces of military equipment, including tanks. As of 15 July 2023, at least a small contingent of Wagner fighters have arrived at a camp in Belarus. Concurrently, some Wagner-associated social media groups have resumed activity, with a focus on highlighting the group\u2019s activities in Africa. Based on recent announcements by Russian officials, the state is likely prepared to accept Wagner\u2019s aspirations to maintain its extensive presence on the continent. Wagner group fighters have arrived in Belarus from Russia, according to Ukrainian and Polish officials, a day after Minsk confirmed the mercenaries were training the country\u2019s soldiers south-east of the capital, Reuters reports. \u201cWagner is in Belarus,\u201d Andriy Demchenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian border agency, said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. Demchenko added that the movement of \u201cseparate groups\u201d from Russia has been observed in Belarus. The Belarusian defence ministry released a video on Friday, showing what it said were Wagner fighters instructing Belarusian soldiers at a military range near the town of Osipovichi. Poland\u2019s deputy minister coordinator of special services, Stanislaw Zaryn, said that Warsaw also has confirmation of Wagner fighters\u2019 presence in Belarus. \u201cThere may be several hundred of them at the moment,\u201d Zaryn said on Twitter. The Belarusian Hajun project, which monitors military activity in the country and is viewed as an extremist formation by Belarusian authorities, said a large column of at least 60 vehicles entered Belarus overnight Friday from Russia. It said the vehicles, including trucks, pickups, vans and buses, had licence plates of the self-styled Donetsk and Luhansk people\u2019s republics in what is internationally recognised as eastern Ukraine. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace has walked back his remarks that Ukraine should show \u201cgratitude\u201d for the military support it has received, saying they were \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. Wallace tweeted a clarification in Ukrainian pledging his support for the invaded country and said his comments were not about governments, but more about \u201ccitizens and members of parliaments\u201d. My comments about how best to support Ukraine caused a lot of interest and were somewhat misrepresented. For the record, as someone who has been at the forefront of mobilising support for Ukraine, I have discussed the challenges that may arise as we work towards the common goal of helping Ukraine get what it needs to defeat this illegal invasion. I said that Ukraine sometimes needs to realise that in many countries and in some parliaments there is not such strong support as in Great Britain. It was a comment not about governments, but more about citizens and members of parliaments. We are fortunate that the citizens of the United Kingdom and all parties in our parliament support our efforts to provide Ukraine with the necessary means. Our approval ratings for supporting Ukraine are among the highest in Europe \u2013 over 70%. My comments were meant to reflect that it is important to remember not to talk to yourself, but to make an effort to reach out to other citizens who still need to be convinced. Wallace also addressed his comments suggesting the UK was not online delivery service Amazon after being handed a wishlist for military supplies. The comments about Amazon were made last year to emphasise that Britain\u2019s relationship with Ukraine is not \u2018transactional\u2019 but more \u2018partnership\u2019. I will personally continue to support Ukraine on its path for as long as it takes, but national parliaments often have competing needs and Ukraine and the UK must continue to encourage this strong support, with facts and friendship. Russia\u2019s air defence forces and fleet in the Black Sea intercepted nine Ukrainian drones over the Crimean port of Sevastopol early on Sunday, a Moscow-installed official said. \u201cNo objects, either in the city or in the water area were damaged,\u201d said Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol. Two aerial drones were shot down over the sea, five were intercepted by Russia\u2019s electronic warfare forces and two water surface drones were destroyed on the outer shore, Razvozhayev added. The strikes were over the harbour of Sevastopol and the city\u2019s Balaklava and Khersones districts. Maritime transport, including passenger ferries, was suspended for several hours early on Sunday, authorities said. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on the attack on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine, I\u2019m Yang Tian bringing you the latest news. Russia has shot down nine Ukrainian drones over the Crimean port of Sevastopol early on Sunday, according to a Moscow-installed official. There was no reported damage to the city and surrounding water area. More details shortly, in other key developments: Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling civilians in a village in Zaporizhzhia after three people were wounded in attacks. The head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said Russian forces bombed the village of Stepnohirske using multiple rocket launchers, hitting an administrative building. Moscow-backed officials claimed it was Kyiv\u2019s forces that shelled a school in the village of Stulneve and air defence forces intercepted a drone over the city of Tokmak. Both sides have denied targeting civilians. Russia has issued criminal charges against seven people who planned to kill two prominent Russian journalists in an alleged Ukrainian-backed plot, according to the state-owned Tass news agency. Russia\u2019s FSB security service detained an unspecified number of people who conducted reconnaissance near the homes and workplaces of journalists Margarita Simonyan, head of state media outlet RT, and Ksenia Sobchak, who ran against President Vladimir Putin in 2018. The FSB said detainees had admitted preparing attacks on the two women on behalf of Ukraine and had been promised a reward of 1.5m roubles for each one. South Korea\u2019s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has pledged to increase his country\u2019s humanitarian and non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine after a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Yoon said Seoul would \u201cexpand the scale of supplies from last year, when we provided materials such as helmets and bullet-proof vests\u201d, adding that humanitarian aid would be increased to $150m in 2023, from $100m last year. Vladimir Putin has said the main objective of the deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports to resume was not achieved, in a call with his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa. The Black Sea grain deal that eased fears of a global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine is due to expire late Monday unless Russia agrees to renew it. \u201cThe main goal of the deal, namely the supply of grain to countries in need, including on the African continent, has not been implemented,\u201d Putin said according to a Kremlin release. Ukraine has criticised Bulgaria\u2019s president over his remarks that Kyiv is to blame for Russia\u2019s ongoing war and that supplying arms to Ukraine only prolongs the conflict. President Rumen Radev spoke about the recent Nato summit and said that he wanted \u201cto make it clear that Ukraine insists on fighting this war \u2026 But it should also be clear that the bill is paid by the whole of Europe.\u201d The embassy of Ukraine in Sofia rejected Radev\u2019s stance that supplying arms to Ukraine fuels and prolongs the war, saying Kyiv was making all possible efforts to restore peace. Ukrainians have reacted with bemusement, mild irritation and irony to UK defence secretary Ben Wallace\u2019s comments that the country should be more grateful for the help it is receiving from the UK and other allies as it fights off Russian aggression. Kyiv previously regarded Wallace as a staunch supporter and friend. His remarks \u2013 on the second day of the Nato summit in Lithuania last week \u2013 mystified officials. \u201cWhether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,\u201d Wallace said, asked about President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s frustration at not being given a formal invitation to join Nato. A large convoy carrying fighters from the Wagner private army was spotted entering Belarus from Russia early on Saturday, according to independent monitoring group Belaruski Hajun. At least 60 trucks, buses and other large vehicles crossed into the eastern European country accompanied by Belarusian police. Belarus\u2019s defence ministry said it planned for the mercenaries and Minsk\u2019s own armed forces to conduct joint military drills."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87bb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/vingegaard-retains-slight-lead-over-pogacar-after-wout-poels-wins-stage-15", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vingegaard retains Tour de France lead and \u2018happy for scepticism\u2019 on his speed", "lead": "Jonas Vingegaard kept his 10-second advantage over Tadej Pogacar, while Dutchman Wout Poels won stage 15 after a fan caused a crash in the peloton", "author": "Jeremy Whittle in Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:43:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627821", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e314cb74f0803bf42e6a3012c73b00f702203496/0_103_4321_2593/500.jpg", "body": "After another day of intense heat, multiple climbs and growing fatigue, Jonas Vingegaard retained his narrow lead on his Tour de France rival Tadej Pogacar and then addressed scepticism towards his dominant performances, saying he \u201cfully understood\u201d it. Following another stage through the Alps in which he and Pogacar were inseparable, the Dane was asked about the ever-increasing speeds on the Tour\u2019s major climbs. \u201cWe have to be sceptical because of what happened in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it would just happen again. \u201cI fully understand all the questions we get about it, the only thing I can say is I am not taking anything. To be honest, I am happy there is a bit of scepticism about it. We are going faster, quicker than back then, maybe. And also the food, material, training, everything is different.\u201d The game of poker between the pair continued in the shadow of the highest peak in the Alps, as they bluffed their way to the summit finish at Saint-Gervais Mont Blanc. The only meaningful attack on Vingegaard\u2019s slim overall lead came from the Slovenian in the final kilometre but was contained easily by the Dane. Their next duel comes in the 22.4km time trial on Tuesday, and they remain divided by a mere 10 seconds. Ahead of them, Wout Poels of the Netherlands won this 15th stage of the Tour, which started in Les Gets, after dropping his namesake Wout van Aert, of Vingegaard\u2019s Jumbo-Visma team, on the steep climb of the Cote des Amerands, 11km from the finish. The two Wouts were part of a three-man breakaway, including Pogacar\u2019s UAE Team Emirates colleague Marc Soler, that reached Domancy, at the foot of the final climb, with a lead on the main peloton of seven-and-a-half minutes. Poels, who made his reputation as a support rider to Chris Froome when with Team Sky, described his first Tour stage win as \u201camazing\u201d, adding: \u201cI really enjoyed my period with Sky. I was four times in the winning team. It was really incredible to do, but unfortunately I could never fight for a stage win. Finally, to do it today, it\u2019s great.\u201d As Poels took his Bahrain Victorious team\u2019s second stage win, the real drama was expected further down the mountain as Adam Yates paced the team leader Pogacar up the final climb, with Vingegaard glued to his rival\u2019s rear wheel, anticipating the inevitable explosion of power. But it never really came and the pair rode to the finish together. \u201cJonas was super good and I knew that I couldn\u2019t really drop him,\u201d Pogacar said after the stage, before describing the climb to Mont Blanc\u2019s steep lower slopes as \u201ctoo easy\u201d. But the Slovenian, Tour winner in 2020 and 2021, is still talking up his chances, saying he and his team go into the Tour\u2019s final week with \u201cbig, big confidence\u201d, adding: \u201cI know the time trial pretty good. I hope it suits me pretty well. Let\u2019s see after that and then it\u2019s two stages to go full gas for the team.\u201d The weekend\u2019s racing was dominated by talk of mad men and motorbikes, after overexcited spectators and in-race \u201cmotos\u201d caused a series of incidents. On Saturday, a potentially telling attack from Pogacar was blocked by two media motorbikes, hemmed in by raucous crowds, near the top of the Col de Joux Plane. On Sunday, a spectator caught one of the riders and caused another mass stack-up early in the stage. \u201cThere was a narrowing in a town,\u201d Vingegaard\u2019s teammate Sepp Kuss said, \u201cand a spectator was out in the road and just clipped my handlebar. It\u2019s been such a hard race. Everybody is a bit tired and you lose a bit of alertness. There are always things that are a bit out of your control as well. Aside from nervous moments, sometimes there are crashes because of fatigue.\u201d The Israel-Premier Tech rider Krists Neilands also crashed out of the lead group after trying to take a drink from an in-race motorbike on a fast descent. The incidents prompted outrage and hand-wringing, but the reality is that better crowd control, particularly at the Tour, is needed to limit such crashes. The rest day on Monday will allow both Vingegaard and Pogacar to take stock. Barring significant mishaps, the time trial on Tuesday, from Passy to Combloux, is neither long enough nor tough enough to make much difference to the gap between them, although there is sure to be a difference of a few seconds. If they remain locked together, the next summit finish is on Wednesday at Courchevel Altiport, after the monstrous climb of the 2,304-metre Col de la Loze. Pogacar considers that stage could be \u201creally decisive\u201d. Yet even then, it might not be enough to divide two riders who remain head and shoulders above their peers."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87bc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/16/national-audit-office-launches-review-of-financial-regulators-effectiveness", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "National Audit Office launches review of financial regulator\u2019s effectiveness", "lead": "Plans to assess FCA come in light of its growing list of responsibilities including cryptoassets, AI and competitiveness", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:43:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627839", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e473523bf2c999640877a9a91d8d7101a54097d8/0_0_5184_3112/500.jpg", "body": "The National Audit Office has launched a fresh review of the City watchdog\u2019s effectiveness and ability to manage a growing list of responsibilities, including oversight of cryptoassets and risks surrounding artificial intelligence. Plans to assess the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) come in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d in the way it is expected to regulate the financial services sector, the NAO explained. Those changes include government orders to promote the international competitiveness of City firms, while simultaneously having to crack down on any misconduct. That is on top of the regulator\u2019s incoming \u201cconsumer duty\u201d, under which the FCA will have to challenge firms on whether they are charging and treating customers fairly. The FCA is also juggling new responsibilities surrounding \u201ctechnological innovations such as cryptoassets and artificial intelligence\u201d that will \u201cprovide challenges and opportunities for regulation of financial services\u201d, the NAO said. The FCA is now responsible for making sure crypto firms comply with money laundering rules, and by October it will be tasked with monitoring crypto-related adverts. Those responsibilities could expand as the government makes final decisions on how to regulate the wider sector. Meanwhile, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, has been trying to get ahead of risks posed by AI. The former London Stock Exchange boss used a speech last week to warn banks, investors and insurers that while AI could improve productivity and the detection of fraud and money laundering, senior managers would ultimately be held responsible for any decisions taken by AI software. \u201cAs AI is further adopted, the investment in fraud prevention and operational and cyber-resilience will have to accelerate simultaneously,\u201d Rathi said. \u201cWe will take a robust line on this \u2013 full support for beneficial innovation alongside proportionate protections.\u201d The FCA\u2019s board flagged the NAO audit in its May meeting, noting that it would review the regulator\u2019s \u201coverall effectiveness\u201d and that this was \u201clikely to be resource intensive\u201d. The NAO last audited the FCA in 2014, a year after its formation. The regulator was created out of the ashes of the Financial Services Authority, which was disbanded after the 2008 banking crisis. An FCA spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the National Audit Office\u2019s review of the FCA and how we adapt to change, as it could help us to ensure we continue to meet our objectives. We have a clear strategy in place about we want the FCA to be, and we are well under way to achieving that.\u201d The NAO declined to comment beyond its online notice, which was quietly released in June."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87bd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/16/peter-jinman-obituary", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Peter Jinman obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives</strong>: Vet who advised the government and the BBC on animal-related matters and became president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons", "author": "Christianne Glossop", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:38:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627857", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c08031b38d1cf0686311e45a9206ce0a3206d0af/0_292_640_384/500.jpg", "body": "My friend Peter Jinman, who has died aged 72 of cancer, was a greatly loved rural vet in Herefordshire whose impact and influence reached Westminster and the BBC. Directed as a teenager to veterinary medicine by the zoologist JZ Young, who was a family acquaintance, Peter had a distinguished career that led him to become president both of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (2010-11) and the British Veterinary Association (2002-03). He was appointed OBE in 2004. Despite reaching the heights of his profession, Peter remained a vet with mud on his boots, as comfortable testing cattle for TB as advising government on animal welfare policy. During the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic he averted disaster when marksmen were deployed up both sides of the same hill simultaneously to cull infected sheep. From 2003 to 2006 he was a member of the BBC\u2019s rural affairs advisory committee, ensuring veterinary matters were presented accurately across the network and advising on various animal-related elements of Archers storylines. He was also the veterinary adviser to the second series of the BBC Three series Kill It, Cook It, Eat It. Outside veterinary business, Peter was elected as an independent councillor to Herefordshire county council in 2017. During the Covid-19 pandemic, and drawing on his understanding of population medicine and epidemiology, Peter gave guidance on the risks of discharging potentially infectious patients into care homes. At his suggestion, provision of additional training and PPE helped to reduce the county\u2019s death rate. In 2011, with his daughter Phillippa, he bought, renovated and breathed life into his village pub, the Temple Bar, in Ewyas Harold, Herefordshire, donning rubber gloves to wash up after Sunday lunch service. Peter was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, to Charles Jinman, a design engineer, and Floss (nee Windridge), one of the UK\u2019s first county court clerks. He attended Feldon school in Leamington Spa, then Warwick school, and graduated in veterinary medicine from the Royal Veterinary College, London, in 1974. Two years later he joined the Ewyas Harold practice, marrying the boss\u2019s daughter, Gill Carter, in 1977, and becoming a partner in 1979. His eclectic interests led to adventure holidays that included sailing in the Caribbean, hiking up volcanoes in Hawaii and canoeing on the Colorado river. His son, Henry, recalls a trip to Croatia, where they unknowingly negotiated a minefield before sitting down to lunch. He was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Farmers and a freeman of the City of London.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, paid tribute to Birkin, saying she \u201cembodied freedom and sang the most beautiful words in our language\u201d. \u201cJane Birkin was a French icon. A complete artist, her voice was as gentle as her commitments were ardent. She bequeaths us a legacy of songs and images that will never leave us,\u201d Macron tweeted. \u00c9lisabeth Borne, the prime minister, said: \u201cShe was an unforgettable icon, with a unique voice and a charm.\u201d In France, Birkin was the \u201clittle English girl\u201d who came to Paris in the 1960s, met the legendary French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg and with him became one of the era\u2019s most f\u00eated celebrity couples, gaining international notoriety with the erotic song Je t\u2019aime \u2026 moi non plus. Birkin sang, wrote, acted and composed and was regarded in her adopted homeland as an icon of French music in her own right. Le Monde wrote: \u201cBirkin\u2019s life, apart from Gainsbourg, was a seamless adventure \u2013 records, films, theatre, love at first sight and hard knocks.\u201d She had been forced to postpone concerts in Paris scheduled for May after breaking her shoulder in March 2022. This followed another string of cancelled shows after Birkin had a stroke in September 2021. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a big optimist, and I realise that it still takes me a little while to be able to be on stage again and with you. I love being with you so much,\u201d she said in a statement at the time. She was found dead at her home in Paris, French media reported. Birkin was born in London on 14 December 1946 to an actor mother and naval officer father. At 17 she married the James Bond composer John Barry, a marriage that lasted only three years. She catapulted to fame after appearing in the 1966 film Blow-Up before crossing the Channel in 1968, at the age of 22, to star in the satirical romantic comedy Slogan alongside Gainsbourg, who was 18 years her senior. It was the start of a 13-year on- and off-screen relationship that made them France\u2019s most famous couple, in the spotlight as much for their bohemian and hedonistic lifestyle as for their work. Despite being banned on radio in several countries and condemned by the Vatican because of its overtly sexual lyrics, their song Je t\u2019aime \u2026 moi non plus (\u201cI love you \u2026 me neither\u201d), released in February 1969, achieved worldwide success and reached No 1 in the UK singles chart. Their relationship was frequently described as \u201ctumultuous\u201d, and Birkin reportedly wrote in her 2020 diaries that there had been violence. During one of their rows, Birkin launched herself into the River Seine after throwing a custard pie in Gainsbourg\u2019s face. But she frequently defended the man with whom she became so closely associated, including against charges by one singer that he was a \u201charasser\u201d, in an interview in the Times in 2020. \u201cHe and I became the most famous of couples in that strange way because of Je t\u2019aime and \u2026 he went on being my friend until the day he died. Who could ask for more?\u201d Birkin told CNN in 2006. \u201cSo Paris became my home. I\u2019ve been adopted here. They like my accent.\u201d Birkin and Gainsbourg were together for 12 years and never married. In 1971 they had a daughter, Charlotte, who is an award-winning actor and singer. They split in 1980 and Birkin branched out from more ditsy film roles to arthouse productions, gaining three nominations at the C\u00e9sars \u2013 France\u2019s Oscars \u2013 starting with La Pirate in 1985. She appeared in 70 or so films under some of France\u2019s leading directors, including Bertrand Tavernier, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Jean-Luc Godard, Alain Resnais and James Ivory. Some of her most famous acting credits included the 1966 crime comedy Kaleidoscope, a 1978 adaptation of Agatha Christie\u2019s Death on the Nile and the 1982 mystery Evil Under the Sun. Gainsbourg continued to write songs for her, including Les dessous chic, about lingerie being used to try to cover up a relationship on the rocks. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful song about separation you could ever have,\u201d Birkin said in a 2018 interview. Her first child, Kate Barry, a fashion photographer who worked for Vogue, died in 2013 at the age of 46. Birkin had another daughter, the singer Lou Doillon, from her 13-year relationship with the director Jacques Doillon. Beyond cinema, her legacy includes being the name behind the Herm\u00e8s Birkin handbag, which was launched in 1984. It was reportedly born after a conversation between Birkin and the Herm\u00e8s chief executive, Jean-Louis Dumas, on a flight from Paris to London, on which they discussed how difficult it was to find a bag that could fulfil Birkin\u2019s needs as a mother of two. She was made an OBE in 2001 for her services to acting and British-French cultural relations. The Portishead singer Beth Gibbons said: I\u2019m so sad to hear that Jane Birkin has gone. She was such a beautiful, generous and kind soul. She was one of the nicest people I\u2019ve worked with and always made me feel so at ease.\u201d Alex Kapranos, the lead singer of Franz Ferdinand, said: \u201cShe was a true icon, but also charming sensitive and funny. To be able to perform and record with her was a total honour. I last saw her perform at the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris a year ago and she was still as magical as ever.\u201d The former French culture minister Roselyne Bachelot told the French TV station BFM on Sunday: \u201cThis departure is so sad.

He was admired for the dozens of classical supporting roles he took on stage, but he gained his greatest recognition on screen. His comic flair was best exploited as the cold, calculating Sir Arnold Robinson in the TV sitcom Yes Minister (1980-84), set in the corridors of Whitehall. Although his presence and resonant voice invested authority in the characters he played, Nettleton was shy and totally unstarry. He described himself as a \u201cworkman\u201d actor, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve got a pipe-smoking image. I\u2019m typed as a senior civil servant, a soldier, a judge, a Harley Street doctor.\u201d Yes Minister, the biting political satire created by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, cast him to type as the cabinet secretary, a scheming bureaucrat who manipulates Jim Hacker (played by Paul Eddington), the minister in the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs, through his permanent under-secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorne). By the time Hacker has risen to the top job in government in the sequel, Yes, Prime Minister (1986-88), Sir Arnold has retired and become president of the Campaign for Freedom of Information. Television fame came to Nettleton after three decades on stage that began with Shakespeare performances in Stratford-upon-Avon, followed by a string of West End roles and plays with the National Theatre company. He was also singled out for credit as, according to Peter Hepple of the Stage, a \u201cjovially pandering\u201d Polonius bringing humour to an acclaimed Prospect theatre production of Hamlet at the Old Vic (1977-78), featuring Derek Jacobi in the title role. Nettleton was born in Sydenham, south London, to Alfred Nettleton, a factory supervisor, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Pratt). On leaving St Dunstan\u2019s college, Catford, he trained at Rada, graduating in 1951 and making his professional debut with a walk-on role in the pantomime Snow White at St James\u2019s theatre, London. He then joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre company (1952-53), taking small roles in Stratford-upon-Avon and on a 1953 tour of Australia and New Zealand. He married the actor Deirdre Doone (born Anne Cooper) in 1954 after appearing with her on an Elizabethan Theatre tour. He then broke into the West End, with roles such as the police superintendent Mr McBryde in A Passage to India (Comedy theatre, 1960). Peter Hall, who directed Nettleton in several London productions, signed him as a contract player when he formed the Royal Shakespeare Company. Nettleton spent five years (1961-66), mostly at the Aldwych theatre, London, in supporting roles that included the surgeon Mr Mannoury in The Devils (1962) and Friar Barnardine in The Jew of Malta (1964). With the National Theatre company the following decade, he played Jaques on a North American tour of its all-male production of As You Like It that included a run on Broadway (Mark Hellinger theatre, 1974), with Hawthorne playing the clown Touchstone. Away from classical roles, he was at his comic best in the role of (Roy) Jenkins, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s butler, in John Wells\u2019s farce Anyone for Denis? at the Whitehall (now Trafalgar) theatre (1981-82). Nettleton and his wife teamed up to take Raymond Briggs\u2019s stage version of his anti-nuclear story When the Wind Blows on tour (1984-85). Both CND members themselves, they played the elderly couple Jim and Hilda Bloggs, based on the writer\u2019s own parents, who trust in \u201cthe authorities\u201d in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. Later, Nettleton played the magistrate in the 1990 National Theatre production of Alan Bennett\u2019s Wind in the Willows adaptation. He brought authority to the role of Arthur Kipps, the storyteller, in Stephen Mallatratt\u2019s thriller The Woman in Black for two runs at the Fortune theatre (1992-93 and 1999). Although he appeared on television throughout the 1950s, the first screen role that brought Nettleton to the attention of critics was Charles, a principled business executive whose wife walks out on him, in John Hale\u2019s play The Noise Stopped for ITV\u2019s Armchair Theatre series in 1966. One critic remarked on his similarity to Alec Guinness \u2013 \u201cthe deliberate speech, the apparent under-playing, the suggestion of fire beneath the ice\u201d. Nettleton continued popping up in character roles on TV. He had five different parts in Z Cars between 1962 and 1977, three of them as detectives, and was Francis Bacon in Churchill\u2019s People (1975) and the lord chamberlain in Henry VIII (1979). He also played military types \u2013 a major in The Flame Trees of Thika and the commanding officer of Charles Ryder (Jeremy Irons) in Brideshead Revisited (both 1981) \u2013 and was the father in the coming-of-age television play East of Ipswich (1987), written by Michael Palin, and an Oxford vicar turned into an ape in the 1989 Doctor Who adventure Ghost Light. The talent for comedy he demonstrated in Yes Minister led him to be cast in a string of sitcoms. He played Arthur Spender, one of the bosses of a fading ad agency who discovers the natural talents of his secretary (Leslie Ash) for spotting successful products and dreaming up slogans, in The Happy Apple (1983). He then played Lord Mountfast, who becomes the husband of Isobel (Gail Harrison), daughter of the self-made mill and mine owner Bradley Hardacre (Timothy West), in the second series of Brass (1984) and had a guest role as a vicar in Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV in 1985. Nettleton brought elements of his Yes Minister character to the second run of Fairly Secret Army (1986) as Smith, a shady government figure using to his own advantage the rightwing group formed by a retired major (Geoffrey Palmer) to defend the country against ideological threats, and The New Statesman (1987-89) as Sir Stephen Baxter, an anti-pornography Conservative MP leading the Campaign for Moral Regeneration.

A bad Test, two bad innings, especially just before a long break with plenty of time to talk about it. Those discussions mounting as supporters fret. Pressure on a weak point, compounded by bad Tests and bad innings past. As Australia\u2019s selectors mull over the fourth Ashes Test, they probably won\u2019t drop David Warner from opening the batting \u2013 but it is a chance more genuine than at any other time in his career. Even if selectors stay calm, much of the public is agitated. Combine Warner\u2019s declining returns in general, a bad record in England specifically and his horror Ashes tour in 2019, and there is a statistical argument that he should not even have started the series, much less be in with a chance to finish it. Then add a personality that draws a lot of disapproval \u2013 such shortcomings can be outweighed by on-field success, but once success gets slimmer the scales tilt fast. So, a lot of people went into the current Ashes ready for Warner to fail. Expecting it, even hoping for it. They feel vindicated by the third Test at Headingley: 10 balls in the match, caught twice at slip from rearing Stuart Broad deliveries, a 2019 facsimile. Simple, right? Like a lot of things, you can arrange the data to support your view. Averages are a usefully blunt instrument, like Warner\u2019s current 25.33 on English soil. With Warner on his fourth tour, Malcolm Knox in the Sydney Morning Herald characterised the sequence as \u201c10 years of hard evidence of Warner\u2019s inability to score runs in England\u201d. Except that just isn\u2019t true. On his first foray in 2013, having missed half the tour suspended, Warner made 41 in Manchester as soon as he returned to the top of the order, then 71 in Durham, taking Australia to 168 for two in a run chase that was subsequently blown up by the middle order. On the 2015 trip, Warner made 38 and 83 at Lord\u2019s, then 85 at the Oval, including two century opening partnerships, substantially setting up Australia\u2019s two wins. His 52 in Cardiff, 77 in Birmingham and 67 in Nottingham were second\u2011innings scores with Australia miles behind, but still showed mental strength and technical aptitude to make scores in such conditions. So really, it is the dramatic crash of Warner\u2019s third tour that has been projected across the rest. In terms of perception he is still paying for the failures of 2019. And, of course, the player at 36 is not the same as the player a decade earlier. It is no surprise that performances have diminished. He is no longer a dominant slayer of hundreds. The point of the current trip was whether Warner would still be better placed than others to do a job at the top of the order. Opening the batting in England is hard work. The average opening partnership over the past 10 years is 29. Primarily the task is to get through the difficult opening exchanges, shielding the middle order for long enough that conditions ease. Going on to a bigger score yourself is a bonus. So far, Warner has delivered. Starting his tour in the World Test Championship final, India sent in Australia on morning one under heavy cloud. Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj bowled excellent spells. Warner got through them both, and most of the first session, taking the score to 71. He made 43. Steve Smith came in next and made a hundred. At Lord\u2019s it was the same, sent in by England: 96 runs on the board, into the 30th over, his contribution worth 66. What do you know: next in, Smith, hundred. Setting up a target in the second innings, Warner batted into the 25th over in a partnership worth 63. In between those matches was Edgbaston where, after a low score first up, Warner went at the bowling second time around and importantly helped bite 61 out of the run chase. These are not the headline successes for people reading scorecards instead of watching matches, where anything short of a century is a failure. In matches where 250 is a challenging chase on the final day, those are not the increments we\u2019re dealing in. It\u2019s the same simplistic mentality that says Mitchell Marsh making a century at No 6 means that he should be thrown up to open the batting a week later. There are specific roles in cricket for a reason. So sure, Warner has never made a hundred in England, and has a worse record away than at home. Most players do. The greats who overcome that are great for a reason. Joe Root has never made a hundred in Australia, but he will be on the next trip if he wants to be. He can still offer something to his team. Perhaps Warner fails again in Manchester, reaches the end of the road then. He is still in a team that go into that contest 2-1 up, and he has still played his part in getting there."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87c3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/16/family-calls-for-better-jaundice-testing-of-non-white-babies", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018He could have died\u2019: family calls for better jaundice testing of black and Asian babies", "lead": "Jaxson\u2019s symptoms were initially dismissed by health staff in a case that could have had fatal consequences", "author": "Anna Bawden Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:44:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627971", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0ae93217b8050b6063498637c26731d83bb536/0_173_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Soon after her son Jaxson was born, Lauren Clarke spotted that his eyes were yellow and bloodshot. \u201cWe kept asking if he had jaundice, but each time we were told to keep feeding him and just put Jaxson in front of a window,\u201d she says. It was only when Clarke was readmitted six days later with an infection that Jaxson\u2019s jaundice was detected by a midwife. By this time, his levels were becoming dangerously high. \u201cWe spent a further five days in hospital for Jaxson to be treated with light therapy and antibiotics. If I hadn\u2019t had to go back to hospital, he could have died or had serious long-term health conditions,\u201d she says. This week, the NHS race and health observatory will announce new funding for research into the efficacy of jaundice screening in black, Asian and minority ethnic newborns on the back of a recent report showing that tests to assess newborn babies\u2019 health are not effective for non-white children. An interim report is planned for May 2024, with final recommendations due in November 2024. The research cannot come too soon. Jaxson\u2019s aunt, Gemma Poole, a midwife from Nottingham, created her company, the Essential Baby Company, to develop resources and training about the specific needs of women and babies with black and brown skins, after Jaxson\u2019s jaundice was initially missed by clinicians. Poole believes the trauma her nephew, brother and sister-in-law had to go through could have been avoided if health professionals had known better ways to spot jaundice in non-white babies. \u201cThe colour of gums, the soles of the feet and hands, the whites of eyes, how many wet and dirty nappies and if the baby is waking for feeds and alert could be more reliable indicators if a black or brown baby has jaundice,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for cyanosis, the inside the mouth, lips and tips of fingers could be more reliable than just telling parents to look for blue or pale skin colour if the baby is black or brown. But midwives haven\u2019t been taught what to look for in those places so it\u2019s difficult to have a standardised approach to assessing.\u201d New technologies are also in the pipeline that are potentially more reliable and racially inclusive. EarMetrics is a device like a digital thermometer that, when inserted in the ear, can detect oxygen levels, cardiac function, jaundice and temperature through its highly sensitive sensors. Nick Gompertz, a former GP and chief executive of EarSwitch, which created EarMetrics, said: \u201cThe ear canal is closer to the heart and brain and crucially has no pigment. This is likely to enable Apgar scores, cyanosis and jaundice to be more accurately diagnosed, irrespective of skin colour.\u201d It is still in the early stages of clinical investigation, but initial data from the University of the West of England and Queen Mary University of London suggest it provides highly accurate data. Gompertz hopes that the necessary regulatory hurdles will be reached by mid-2025, but believes it could be rolled out across the NHS earlier by partnering with existing medical device manufacturers. Meanwhile, hospitals are becoming more proactive. Many NHS trusts routinely measure blood oxygen saturation on all newborns, using pulse oximeters. \u201cWe test every baby\u2019s oxygen levels in our hospital, midwifery-led unit and home births, at around three hours of age,\u201d says Sam Oddie, a consultant neonatologist at Bradford teaching hospitals foundation trust. \u201cOccasionally this picks up serious conditions when other tests at birth have been normal. For example, newborn babies with congenital heart disease can present with cyanosis. That is very difficult for staff and parents to notice, and is probably harder in south Asian or black babies, which is why universal pulse oximetry is so useful. \u201cRecently, we saw a baby who had extremely low blood oxygen levels because of a heart problem. Other routine tests did not pick this up. The pulse oximeter test undoubtedly played a role in saving that baby\u2019s life.\u201d Oddie says that jaundice is much more difficult to detect, especially in south Asian babies, but points out that if parents or clinicians suspect jaundice, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance stipulates that a test should be given. He believes other areas of training need to be more diverse too. \u201cIt is rare for neonatal life support to be taught with anything other than a white European doll. We need to have a much more diverse set of teaching aids and images so all clinicians know how different illnesses present in patients with darker skin.\u201d Back in Nottingham, Clarke says better training would help others avoid going through what her family did. \u201cIf the health professionals we saw had listened to our concerns or been trained correctly to include every ethnicity, it is a trauma that could have been avoided for ourselves and many other families.\u201d Michelle Rhodes, the chief nurse at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: \u201cWe recognise and welcome the recommendations made in the NHS race and health observatory report, and we recognise the issues and concerns that Lauren experienced in the care Jaxson received. \u201cNottingham University Hospitals continue to implement the recommendations of the review into Jaxson\u2019s care including update of guidelines and policy, staff awareness and understanding and use of new technology including bilirubinometers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87c4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/16/harry-maguire-stripped-manchester-united-captaincy-erik-ten-hag", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Harry Maguire stripped of Manchester United captaincy by Erik ten Hag", "lead": "Harry Maguire has revealed that he has been stripped of the Manchester United captaincy by Erik ten Hag", "author": "Jamie Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:37:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.627989", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/10d27fbbdcc344e3e655d1c145652fc3f831dd04/885_182_1732_1039/500.jpg", "body": "Harry Maguire has revealed he has been stripped of the Manchester United captaincy by Erik ten Hag. The England defender retained the armband last season despite losing his first-choice status and the move comes with United willing to listen to offers for the 30-year-old. West Ham are interested in Maguire but their proposal of a loan, potentially with an option to buy, is unlikely to appeal to United at this stage and wages make the deal difficult. Maguire received a considerable salary increase, in line with the rest of the squad, as a result of United qualifying for the Champions League and that means it is more challenging to find a new club. It is understood Maguire has given mixed messages to West Ham regarding a readiness to join but he will need regular games to stand a chance of retaining his England place. He will leave only for what he considers the right club and is is ready to stay and fight for his place if he concludes that is the best option. \u201cAfter discussions with the manager today he has informed me he is changing captain,\u201d Maguire tweeted. \u201cHe outlined his reasons to me and whilst I\u2019m personally extremely disappointed, I will continue to give my all every time I wear the shirt. So I wanted to say a massive thank you to the Manchester United fans for all their brilliant support whilst I\u2019ve been wearing the armband. \u201cSince the day I took on the role, three and half years ago, it\u2019s been a huge privilege to lead Manchester United and one of the proudest moments of my career to date. It\u2019s one of the greatest honours in club football. I\u2019ve done everything I possibly could to help United be successful \u2013 on and off the field. I will always be grateful to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r for first giving me the responsibility and I wish whoever now takes it on every success and they will have my full support.\u201d In a statement on the United website the club said: \u201cEveryone at Manchester United thanks Harry for his contribution as captain over the past three-and-a-half years. The manager will announce the new captain in due course, after he has informed the players.\u201d Ten Hag hopes to sell Maguire and other fringe players to increase the money available for signings. Mason Mount has joined from Chelsea for an initial \u00a355m, which amounts to almost half his \u00a3120m budget. United are poised to complete an initial \u20ac50m (\u00a342.9m) move for the Internazionale goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana, who is due to travel to Manchester once a final check on payment terms has been completed. Ten Hag has spoken to Onana over the past couple of days to confirm the deal will go ahead. The manager also wants a striker and is interested in Atalanta\u2019s Rasmus H\u00f8jlund. If Maguire leaves Ten Hag may also try to sign another centre-half. Maguire, bought by United from Leicester for \u00a380m in August 2019, started only eight Premier League games last season, including on the final day after qualification for the Champions League had been secured. Bruno Fernandes was the regular captain and is expected to be confirmed as Maguire\u2019s successor."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87c5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/ukraine-says-only-a-few-hundred-wagner-troops-are-in-belarus", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ukraine says \u2018only a few hundred\u2019 Wagner troops are in Belarus", "lead": "Kyiv reports fighting has intensified on eastern front, with its forces on defensive near Kupiansk", "author": "Shaun Walker in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:24:58", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628009", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5308eddd6068aa2b94eed54c094a15ef2c1fa8ae/0_58_6870_4122/500.jpg", "body": "Ukraine said fighting had intensified on the eastern front as further details emerged about the number of Wagner troops who had relocated to Belarus. \u201cThe situation has somewhat intensified in the east,\u201d the Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. She added that Ukrainian forces were on the defensive near the eastern city of Kupiansk but making advances near Bakhmut. \u201cFor two days in a row, the enemy has been actively attacking in the Kupiansk sector in the Kharkiv region. We are on the defence,\u201d Maliar wrote on Telegram. Only a \u201cfew hundred\u201d fighters from Russia\u2019s Wagner group have so far relocated to Belarus, a Ukrainian official said on Sunday, leaving the eventual fate of the fighting force unclear. The Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was given free rein to build a mercenary army of tens of thousands of contractors and prisoners, agreed to relocate his forces to Belarus as part of a deal to end his mutiny against the Kremlin last month. Since then, however, there has been conflicting messaging about the fate of Wagner, which has carried out some of the most fierce fighting for the Russian side in Ukraine. Belarusian authorities say Wagner trainers have arrived in the country, and both Polish and Ukrainian authorities have confirmed this, but so far there does not appear to have been a mass relocation. The whereabouts of Prigozhin also remain a mystery. \u201cThere are some groups of mercenaries on the territory of Belarus, but we are not talking about any massive or large-scale deployment \u2026 we are talking about a few hundred,\u201d Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s border guards, told Ukrainian television on Sunday. On Thursday, the Pentagon briefed that while the majority of Wagner forces were still in Russian-occupied Ukraine, they \u201ceffectively are no longer contributing as a significant combat capability\u201d, according to a spokesperson. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has claimed Wagner has handed over thousands of tonnes of weaponry to the regular Russian army. In Kyiv, a source close to Ukrainian intelligence said that although the turmoil over Wagner had not led to major Ukrainian gains on the ground, the Ukrainian military had noticed confusion and disarray among parts of Russia\u2019s fighting force. \u201cThey are trying to spread out the Wagner guys among other units, but of course this is going to affect their fighting abilities,\u201d said the source. \u201cThese are professional, trained fighters who were used to fighting in particular units and combinations, and now they have to get used to something different.\u201d On Thursday, Putin told a trusted Russian journalist that \u201cWagner does not exist\u201d, but he also gave details of a meeting he held in the Kremlin with Prigozhin and 35 Wagner commanders after the failed mutiny. Putin said he told the commanders they could continue to serve in Ukraine under the leadership of their battlefield commander, Andrey Trochev. \u201cA lot of them nodded their heads when I said this. But Prigozhin, who was sitting in front of them and didn\u2019t see [their reaction], said: \u2018No, the guys won\u2019t agree with that decision,\u2019\u201d Putin said. On the ground in Ukraine, fighting continues. On Sunday, Maliar said Ukrainian forces were \u201cgradually moving forward\u201d near the symbolic target of Bakhmut, which was seized by Russia in May, but were fighting defensive battles near the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region. \u201cFierce battles are going on, and positions \u2026 change several times a day,\u201d she added. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, trailed for several months, has been making slow progress, with Kyiv calling on the west to supply more firepower. In an interview with the Guardian last week, a top Ukrainian security official said the international pressure over the counteroffensive was unhelpful. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sporting competition. There\u2019s a lot at stake, people\u2019s lives are at stake,\u201d said Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the security council. He added, however, that he expected progress to come in August or September. The US has controversially provided Ukraine with cluster munitions to help overcome the shortage of ammunition. In an interview with state television, excerpts of which were published on Sunday, Putin said Russia had a \u201csufficient stockpile\u201d of cluster munitions and said Moscow \u201creserves the right to take reciprocal action\u201d if Ukraine used the controversial weapons. The use of cluster munitions by the Russian side has already been widely documented by human rights organisations. Russia also said on Sunday it downed at least 10 drones close to Sevastopol, the Black Sea port in Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014 and home to the Russian Black Sea fleet. The governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine, also claimed that a woman had been killed during a Ukrainian rocket attack on the town of Shebekino. The Kremlin has not yet indicated whether Russia will renew a deal to allow Ukraine to ship its grain across the Black Sea. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the deal, which expires late on Monday, in July 2022. Russia has threatened to pull out of the deal, citing obstacles to its own exports. \u201cVladimir Putin stressed that the obligations \u2026 to remove obstacles to the export of Russian food and fertilisers still remain unfulfilled,\u201d according to a Kremlin statement on Saturday."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87c6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/16/chris-gloninger-tv-weather-man-climate-crisis", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Your heart races a bit\u2019: US weather man threatened with death for mentioning climate crisis", "lead": "Chris Gloninger wove the reality of global heating into his forecasts in the conservative heartland of Iowa.

Gloninger said he experienced \u201ca holy shit moment\u201d with climate change as he was drenched while covering 2017\u2019s Hurricane Harvey \u2013 in which the overheated air and ocean helped dump 9tn gallons of rainwater upon Texas in little over a day. He said he always required a thick skin, like many broadcasters, to deal with casual ridicule over his appearance or voice. But the experience at KCCI, a CBS affiliate in Des Moines, Iowa, was more extreme. Hired by the station two years ago to help weave the reality of global heating into his forecasts, Gloninger flagged the science where appropriate, reminding viewers during a flood event that a warming atmosphere holds more moisture, or of the upward march of global temperature during a heatwave. But this soon provoked angst from some viewers, who grumbled that he should \u201cstick to the weather\u201d. Then, last July, he started getting a string of emails that included threats against his life. \u201cIt was \u2018I am going to kill you\u2019 written in a very deliberate way in a long letter and followed by obsessive emails,\u201d said Gloninger. His critic demanded that he \u201cgo the hell back to where you came from DOUCHEBAG!!!\u201d and demanded \u201cwhat\u2019s your home address, we conservative Iowans would like to give you an Iowan welcome you will never forget.\u201d The emails attacked Gloninger for pushing a \u201cliberal conspiracy theory on the weather\u201d, calling climate change a \u201cBiden hoax\u201d. What followed was a painful, fraught year in which Gloninger and his wife, Cathy Danko, struggled to deal with what they felt was an overt threat to their safety. The meteorologist started to suffer from stress-induced acid reflux and a chronic cough. He felt his zest for work was diminishing. He ended up in therapy for a year. \u201cI would go to work until 11pm at night and my wife was alone, we\u2019d worry when a car drove past at night, your heart races a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a first responder for several years and so I\u2019ve seen things that left me upset but this is something I\u2019d never experienced before. We were frightened, we had no idea what a man in rural Iowa would take a stand over. We were awake at all hours.\u201d KCCI assigned a security detail to Gloninger but also, he said, \u201ctold me to dial down the climate stuff a bit\u201d. Ultimately the toll of the threats, combined with family health issues, pushed him to quit the station (the author of the emails was eventually tracked down and handed a small fine). \u201cThe death threat was concerning enough to be the catalyst to us leaving,\u201d said Gloninger. \u201cYou can only be kicked so many times before you throw in the towel.\u201d On 21 June, Gloninger, wearing a warming stripes tie, told viewers that he thought he had his \u201cforever home\u201d in Iowa but that the threat had left him \u201cshaken\u201d and that he wanted to move away from TV to work full time on helping tackle the climate crisis. On his final broadcast, on 7 July, Gloninger choked back tears as he recounted the \u201cmostly happy memories\u201d of Iowa, including the deluge of emails from viewers decrying the threats and praising his focus on climate. \u201cThe management of the station wanted me to avoid the term climate change, maybe talk about changing climate or a warming world, to give people less of a stick to beat them with, which I get but also I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d Gloninger, who started a new role as chief scientist at the Woods Hole Group in Massachusetts last week, told the Guardian. \u201cWhat gets lost in the mix, though, is that it was remarkable they had the balls to do this in the first place.\u201d The episode serves as a stark reminder that even though polling shows increasing numbers of Americans are alarmed by the sort of climate impacts on vivid display this summer \u2013 with its record, searing heat, ruinous floods and toxic wildfire smoke \u2013 and more meteorologists feel compelled to mention this worsening emergency in their forecasts, there is a significant chunk of the population that sees the crisis as just another part of an all-encompassing culture war. What happened to Gloninger is part of a broader context of \u201chateful and hurtful politics which like a cancer is taking over our political discourse \u2013 it\u2019s changed radically in just a few years\u201d, according to Eric Sorensen, who was a TV meteorologist for two decades before being elected to the US House of Representatives in 2022. Sorensen, a Democrat, said he himself was initially skeptical about humanity\u2019s influence over the climate and, once seized by the issue, initially found himself blocked by his bosses from covering it at the WQAD station in Illinois back in 2008 due to the perceived political sensitivity of the topic. \u201cBut when we did end up covering climate, the viewership went up,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cThere is an obligation to communicate this to viewers and that\u2019s best done via the personal connection people have to their local meteorologists \u2013 they are the ones protecting your family by telling you it\u2019s time to take the kids into the basement because of a tornado, or get off the roads because of the snow.\u201d Many meteorologists who do talk about global heating still have to deal with abusive emails, even if death threats are rare, Sorensen added. \u201cA lot of my former colleagues are afraid and I\u2019m worried what happened to Chris will make more of them afraid to talk about this,\u201d said Sorensen, who has invited Gloninger, whom he has known for several years, to speak to members of Congress about his ordeal. \u201cThere were always vocal people against this but now there are threats of violence. We need to be able to communicate climate change and not worry if ratings suffer, or about being victims of angry voicemails.\u201d TV meteorology used to be a surprising, if niche, bastion of climate skepticism, although that has changed in recent years as the impacts of the climate crisis have become more stark. TV networks in general still regularly neglect to mention the climate elephant in the room \u2013 only 5% of stations that covered the recent heatwaves in Texas and the US south-west connected them to rising global temperatures, a Media Matters analysis found \u2013 so those meteorologists that do highlight climate change in their broadcasts are often the only reliable source on the topic for millions of Americans. An initiative called Climate Matters now provides climate-related resources to more than 3,000 TV meteorologists and journalists across the US, an effort that research has found \u201cmay be increasing the climate literacy of the American people\u201d. Climate is gradually going mainstream on weather forecasts, despite the risk of backlash. Some meteorologists are still reticent to talk about climate change but that stance is receding, according to Shel Winkley, who regularly talks about climate in his role as chief meteorologist of KBTX News, in Texas. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to push something, we are just giving information and the emails and calls we get tend to back us up, because we are presenting the truth,\u201d he said. Winkley said the death threats against Gloninger were the talk of a recent conference of TV meteorologists, but that the situation won\u2019t deter him from responding to every email and Facebook comment from climate deniers critiquing his work. \u201cI don\u2019t try to shut people down, it\u2019s a conversation that sometimes ends poorly and sometimes you make a bit of headway on,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot more people are supportive of the science now. But what happened to Chris is scary, I won\u2019t say it\u2019s not. Sadly, it\u2019s not surprising.\u201d Gloninger also feels that he hasn\u2019t been cowed, despite the saga prompting him to move 1,300 miles from Iowa, to Cape Cod. In his last few weeks at KCCI he became candid in an unvarnished way, referencing, on air, the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and that the recent withering heat \u201cshould be ringing alarm bells\u201d. He showed off printouts of more than 300 emails from viewers thanking him for his work. \u201cI\u2019ve been encouraged that in a true conservative state many want climate action and many people want to see more coverage of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the people who harassed me won. I\u2019m just reinventing myself in my career. This can be the start of a new chapter in this state, where people have a little more basic understanding of what\u2019s happening. People will have a decision next year [in the presidential election] over whether to keep pushing for change.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87c7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/indigenous-voice-to-parliament-no-campaign-targets-sydney-migrant-communities-marriage-equality", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Indigenous voice no campaign targets religious voters who opposed marriage equality", "lead": "The no campaign plans to tap into the \u2018unheard majority\u2019 in Sydney, believing there is a bloc of socially conservative religious voters ripe for its messages", "author": "Sarah Collard", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628047", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d67c805d6c05149a15fb006e21694af8350508fb/2_0_4924_2956/500.jpg", "body": "The no campaign in the referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament is targeting migrant communities and parts of Sydney that voted strongly against marriage equality in the 2017 postal vote, Warren Mundine has said. The campaign believes there is a cohort of religious and socially conservative voters who are open to its messaging on implications of the voice. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re choosing the mosques, Hindu communities and temples and the like,\u201d Mundine said. \u201cEven though I was a yes voter for same-sex marriage, we saw the polling from the plebiscite. In western Sydney, it was 70% against because of their religious beliefs and conservatism, and so we\u2019re going to sit down and have a chat to [those communities].\u201d Twelve federal electorates in Sydney, all in the west and south of the city, voted against same-sex marriage. Only Watson (69.6%) and Blaxland (73.9%) reached close to the mark claimed by Mundine, though several others were comfortably above 60%. Mundine, who leads the Recognise a Better Way group that is part of the no campaign, said the strategy was to tap into the \u201cunheard majority\u201d who he claimed were often ignored, and in particular to engage with Australians who were born overseas, or whose parents were. \u201cWe\u2019re very respectful of them and we go and listen to them, and they want to hear what we\u2019ve got to say,\u201d he said.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He claimed that many in the community were worried about the voice to parliament. \u201cIt is really divisive. It\u2019s divisive not just in mainstream Australia, not even just in the political arena but in your neighbours, in your family, even in your own culture, and I know among the Aboriginal community as well \u2026 I\u2019ve been labelled a racist.\u201d Khouw organised a no campaign event on behalf of Fair Australia, who funded the event, in the Sydney suburb of Burwood this month, featuring Mundine, which drew a crowd of about 150 people. The event was pitched as a way to hear \u201cthe truth about the voice\u201d. \u201cThose that came, I called them back to see what did they think about it, and if they\u2019re going to talk about it with their families, their friends and neighbours. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about really \u2013 spreading the information and using word of mouth,\u201d Khouw said. Khouw said about a dozen events were planned in different parts of Sydney before October, and it was hoped more would follow in Newcastle and Wollongong. On Friday Mundine is due to speak again at the Berala Community Club in western Sydney, under the auspices of Multicultural Voices Against the Voice. Also on the bill are the former state Labor MP Tania Mihailuk, now with One Nation, and Michael O\u2019Neill of the Informed Medical Opinions party, which has called for a royal commission into the alleged harms caused by vaccinations. Shuhba Kumar is president of the Indian Club in the Hills district of Sydney. The club is hosting an event on the referendum this month, with both sides of the debate presenting their views in the hope of allowing voters to \u201cmake their own minds up\u201d, Kumar said. Kumar said she was concerned about misinformation, particularly among people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, \u201cnot just in the Indian community\u201d. \u201cSome people say that their property will not be safe, that they have to give some of these people money, they will lose rights on their property. I don\u2019t know where they are getting these opinions from. \u201cI think the main issue here is there is no clarity,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThat clarity is not there and that is creating a lot of confusion. I\u2019m hoping people can go and ask and get some clarity when both sides are at the forum. \u201cThey should do a better job at reaching multicultural communities. But again, they should really clarify the issues \u2026 and Indigenous people\u2019s needs, and how it will improve lives. There needs to be a bit more substance \u2026 from the yes side.\u201d Shireen Morris, a constitutional lawyer and director of the Radical Centre Reform Lab at Macquarie University, has been campaigning for the yes vote among multi-faith and multicultural communities. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to fight lies with good information and to fight fear with love,\u201d she said.

Sam Roggeveen, the director of the Lowy Institute\u2019s international security program and a former Australian intelligence analyst, issues the stark warning in an essay published on Monday. \u201cAustralia has taken the decision to bring US combat forces, and its military strategy to fight China, on to our shores,\u201d Roggeveen wrote in the latest edition of the Australian Foreign Affairs journal. \u201cWe have also chosen to build military capabilities of our own that are designed expressly to contribute to American operations to defeat China. These fateful decisions threaten to draw Australia into a war that is not central to our security interests, and which could end in nuclear catastrophe.\u201d Roggeveen examined the combined effect of decisions, including plans to host up to six US B-52 bombers in the Northern Territory and to rotate US nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling in Western Australia from 2027. He said US bombers operating from Australia could be assigned to strike China\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, including missile silos, command and control facilities, early warning radars and air defence facilities. Roggeveen said it was \u201chard to overstate the sensitivity involved in threatening another nation\u2019s nuclear forces\u201d and that meant American bombers flying out of the Tindal RAAF base \u201cwould be an important target for Chinese forces\u201d. He said the requirement for Australia\u2019s planned nuclear-powered submarines, acquired under the Aukus deal, to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles \u201ccan only be interpreted one way: Australia wants the capability to strike targets on Chinese soil\u201d. In the event of war, Roggeveen said, the Australian submarines would probably be assigned to sink Chinese naval ships and submarines, blockade ports or strike targets in China with cruise missiles. If Australia eventually acquired hypersonic weapons under the advanced defence technology pillar of the Aukus deal, Roggeveen said, that could further increase the country\u2019s profile in the eyes of Chinese military planners. He said Australia had previously taken risks \u201cbecause we have concluded that, on balance, we are likely to be safer within the alliance, with all the obligations it imposes, than outside it\u201d. \u201cBut if China\u2019s capabilities to strike Australia are set to increase, and if we are raising China\u2019s incentives to do so, then the judgments we have previously made about whether the risks of the alliance outweigh the security benefits need to be re-evaluated.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Roggeveen said whether the trade-offs were worth it depended on the value Australia placed on American military dominance in Asia, including its ability to defeat China in a war over the future of self-governed Taiwan. He said contrary to its rhetoric, the US had not increased the weight of military power it dedicated to Asia, even as it dispersed its forces to be outside China\u2019s missile ranges, raising questions about its long-term commitment. \u201cIn short, six bombers based in Tindal are a less potent military asset than the same number based in Guam, which means America\u2019s deterrent against China is diminishing while the military threat to Australia increases.\u201d Roggeveen is not the first to raise such concerns, although his intervention is notable because of his past experience as a senior strategic analyst at the Office of National Assessments. In the same edition of Australian Foreign Affairs, however, the former senior US official Michael Green argued his country remained \u201cthe indispensable power despite itself\u201d. Green, head of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, wrote that in a world without US leadership, Vladimir Putin \u201cwould today be ruling Ukraine through proxies in Kyiv\u201d and Taiwan \u201cmight have succumbed to Chinese coercion\u201d. \u201cThere is no indication that Labor or the Coalition are going to choose neutrality or distancing from America \u2013 not with Chinese coercive pressure a new reality and other close partners such as Japan and South Korea choosing to reinforce the American alliance system rather than defect,\u201d Green wrote. The Australian government has repeatedly argued its Aukus plans are intended to contribute to regional peace and stability, and it has also said US bombers have visited Australia since the 1980s."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87c9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/17/gonski-review-government-funding-private-public-schools", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Private school funding increased twice as much as public schools\u2019 in decade after Gonski, data shows", "lead": "Exclusive: government funding since landmark education review released \u2018has gone to those least in need\u2019, says national convenor of Save Our Schools", "author": "Jordyn Beazley and Caitlin Cassidy", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628083", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0bd08c439c82346a71337f1b1ad6d2ab4c4ebaf1/0_0_6981_4189/500.jpg", "body": "Real government funding to private schools has increased almost twice as much as funding to public schools in the decade since the landmark Gonski review recommended changes designed to fund Australian schools according to need. From 2012 to 2021, per student funding to independent and Catholic schools rose by 34% and 31% respectively, while funding to public schools increased by just 17%, according to parliamentary library data provided exclusively to Guardian Australia. In Queensland, the growth in government funding to independent schools per student has been nine times greater than to public schools. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (Acara) data shows that 98% of private schools are funded above the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) recommended by Gonski and more than 98% of public schools are funded below it. \u201cThat money has gone to the wrong place,\u201d said Trevor Cobbold, an economist and the national convenor of Save Our Schools. \u201cIt has gone to those least in need.\u201d The Gonski review was hailed as the roadmap to reducing the impact of social disadvantage on educational outcomes. But more than decade later, government policy has had the opposite effect. Cobbold said the figures showed a \u201csabotaging\u201d of the plan by successive governments, both state and federal, which has shortchanged students in the public system. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThe Gonski model wasn\u2019t perfect, there were some flaws,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it offered a change in terms of where funding would be directed in terms of the most in need, and that has not happened.\u201d The Greens education spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said the gap in funding between private and public schools had created one of the most unequal and segregated school systems in the OECD. A Unicef report in 2018 ranked Australia 30th out of 38 OECD countries in providing equitable access to secondary education. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the implementation of Gonski has been a failure. By no measure can anyone say, a decade later, that our school funding model is working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twisted and perverse system that is widening the gap between rich and poor kids and lowering average student performance.\u201d The decade since Gonski One of the core recommendations of the Gonski review when it was released in 2011 was implementing the SRS, a needs-based model to provide a baseline education to students, set at $13,060 for primary students and $16,413 for secondary students. The federal education minister at the time of the Gonski review, Peter Garrett, said the aim was to ensure any student, irrespective of their background, could reach their potential. \u201cThe legislation we put in place meant Australia finally had a genuine needs-based funding system for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis required a massive effort to produce significant buy-in from most of the education sector Australia wide.\u201d But a briefing by the education department prepared for witnesses appearing before Senate estimates and seen by Guardian Australia, estimates that schools in the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Western Australia will reach only 75% of their SRS this year, with the remaining states and territories also falling short of 100%. On its current trajectory, the Northern Territory will never reach it. Cobbold said the failure to fund schools according to need could be traced back to key decisions made by successive governments after the Gonski review. The first kick to its success, he said, was the Gillard government\u2019s edict that \u201cno school would lose a dollar\u201d. A deal was struck with the Catholic system and other private schools \u2013 which were found to be overfunded at the time \u2013 to maintain their revenue from government. Documents released in June this year through freedom of information laws revealed more than 1,000 private schools \u2013 or 40% of Australia\u2019s non-government schools \u2013 would be overfunded by $3.2bn over the next six years. Cobbold pointed to the Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget, which scrapped the biggest increases in school funding agreed to under the Gonski reforms, planned for 2017 and 2018, the bulk of which would have gone to public schools. Cobbold said the funding model for public schools was further undermined in 2017, when the Turnbull government introduced an \u201carbitrary\u201d commonwealth funding cap of 20% for public schools, with the remainder to be covered by state governments. For non-government schools, the caps are the reverse. The president of the Australian Education Union, Correna Haythorpe, said putting the onus on the states to implement 80% of funding failed to adhere to the Gonski review\u2019s recommendation that the commonwealth should put in more, given its greater capacity to raise revenue. \u201cWhat we know is that over the past decade, states have not been held accountable for delivering the full share,\u201d she said. Former New South Wales National party MP and former state education minister, Prof Adrian Piccoli, said the Turnbull government did cap the funding increase for schools that had reached 100% of the SRS \u2013 most of which were in the independent sector \u2013 after the Gillard government had promised to increase funding by 3% a year for all schools. \u201cWhat the Gillard government did was better than what was there before, what the Turnbull government did was a little better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was far from perfect.\u201d Cobbold said the final blow to funding schools according to need came from the Morrison government, which negotiated a $4.6bn increase in funding for Catholic schools over 10 years but no additional money for public schools. \u201cMorrison basically said it\u2019s up to the state governments [to fund public schools], but the state governments haven\u2019t been delivering either,\u201d Cobbold said. \u2018It can be a lot better and fairer\u2019 In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, state government funding in real terms has gone backwards since 2012, falling by 5.6% and 7.75% per student respectively, according to the Acara data. The overall funding disparities have not been spread equally across the country. Real government funding per student has increased by more than 16% in metro areas, more than 22% in inner regional areas, and more than 20% in outer regional areas. But in remote and very remote areas it has risen by barely 14% and 10% respectively. Garrett said the failure of federal governments to fund schools according to their need in the decade since Gonski was an outrage. \u201cThe Coalition trashed that reform and a generation of students in public schools lost the opportunity to shine,\u201d he said. The federal government is now undertaking a review to inform the next National School Reform Agreement, with the aim to work with state governments to get schools to 100% of their SRS. The education minister, Jason Clare, agreed there was a gap that needed to be filled. \u201cAustralia has a good education system, but it can be a lot better and a lot fairer,\u2019 he said. \u201cIf you are a child today from a poor background, from the bush or if you are an Indigenous Australian, you are three times more likely to fall behind at school.

For months, the state government has defended conditions inside Cleveland, in the face of accounts by guards, teachers, youth workers, court documents, judges and children documenting problematic practices. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A Guardian Australia investigation found chronic staffing shortages have caused widespread and extended cellblock lockdowns, with some children attending almost no school classes or rehabilitation programs. But as those concerns mount, the state has publicly maintained a more upbeat view of conditions inside the prison. In the words of one guard: \u201cThey just keep saying black is white.\u201d Now the prison\u2019s acting deputy director, Andrew Morris, has given an account of what is happening inside Cleveland which is at odds with the government\u2019s PR. Morris was giving evidence at the sentencing hearing of Michael*, a boy who likely spent more than 500 days in solitary confinement for more than 20 hours a day. Speaking under oath, Morris said the standard routine for children at Cleveland involved 16 hours in their cells \u2013 a comment that conflicts with prior government claims that the standard practice is 13 hours (including 12 hours overnight). Morris also gave further insights into schooling at Cleveland. When Guardian Australia last month reported that children who spent months in detention had attended almost no classes, the government held a press conference in Townsville. Senior executive director of the youth justice department, Michael Drane, assured journalists that when children were confined to their cells \u201cit\u2019s not the case that the school doesn\u2019t operate\u201d. \u201cIt may be the case that the teachers or the program providers or the psychologists go to the young people,\u201d he said. But in the boy\u2019s case, his barrister, Laura Reece, told the court that detailed records covering his 175 of his 744 days in Cleveland showed there were \u201conly two occasions \u2026 where education staff visited him in the unit\u201d. This record was confirmed by Morris in court. \u201cEach day the education department provides all young people with education packs while in their cells, if they choose to do them,\u201d he said. \u201cAlone?\u201d Reece asked. \u201cAlone,\u201d Morris replied. The court also heard that Michael had been referred to a forensic mental health service, but that his referral was cancelled, and he received no treatment, due to the service having no ability to treat young people with trauma-related mental health services. Previously, the department has responded to stories about Cleveland by insisting children have \u201caccess to specialised mental health service\u201d. Government response at odds with court transcript When asked about Morris\u2019s evidence, the department released a statement that did not accord with the evidence before the court. The government said that Morris\u2019s comments in court had been in response to a question about the maximum period a child could be detained for \u201croutine security\u201d reasons. However, Guardian Australia was in the courtroom and has a recording of the hearing, in which Morris was asked how long children behaving well on \u201can average day\u201d and \u201cany given day\u201d spend outside their cells. Morris told the court Cleveland detainees usually spend 16 hours a day in their cells for \u201croutine security\u201d purposes, even when the centre is fully staffed. Crown: \u201cHow long on an average day would a general detainee in CYDC, who is behaving well, let\u2019s say, be expected to spend outside of their cell on each day?\u201d Morris: \u201cEight hours.\u201d Crown: \u201cWhy not 12?\u201d Morris: \u201cAgain for those routine security purposes, if we\u2019re fully staffed it would mean that staff \u2026 are entitled to their breaks, half breaks, we don\u2019t have a second group of staff to go in. Hygiene, shower times, staff training, team meetings.\u201d Crown: \u201cThat\u2019s OK. For a variety of reasons, on any given day, an inmate would expect to be detained for the 12-hour daylight period and for about four hours?\u201d Morris: \u201cCorrect.\u201d When shown the transcript and challenged about its representation of the court exchange, the department said it stood by its initial statement. \u201cWe maintain that during separations young people continue to have access to health and specialist services, education, caseworkers, cultural liaison officers, and phone calls,\u201d a statement said. Guards at the centre subsequently told Guardian Australia that it would be \u201crare\u201d for children to spend more than eight hours outside their cells, but also that none had \u201canything resembling a consistent routine\u201d. The Australian Workers Union made similar claims recently, including that at any given time 80% of Cleveland is in lockdown. Legal sources say the state is \u201cclearly concerned\u201d about the liability implications from the management of its detention centres. They point to a Victorian case and this week\u2019s WA supreme court judgment, which found that frequent solitary confinement at the Banksia Hill detention centre was unlawful. No reliable data on use of solitary Morris was called to give evidence to explain discrepancies between \u201cseparation\u201d data and other records showing how long children were locked inside their cells. Several court judgments have revealed young people have spent extended periods in \u201cseparation\u201d \u2013 which the department says means being locked in a cell alone \u2013 mostly due to staffing shortages. In Michael\u2019s case, he was approved by youth justice staff for a 24-hour separation on 515 of 744 days at Cleveland. The department has said this is not a true reflection of the actual time Michael spent in or out of his cells; and that children subject to a formal \u201cseparation\u201d often leave their cells for various reasons. In Michael\u2019s case the state provided a second report, which covered 175 out of 744 days \u2013 one sample week for each month \u2013 and was designed to show more detail about his time at Cleveland. It showed Michael spent 125 of those 175 days in solitary confinement for more than 20 hours each day. If those 175 days fairly reflect his entire time in youth detention, he would have likely spent about 530 days in solitary confinement. Morris said that obtaining the more detailed snapshot of Michael\u2019s records had been a time-consuming task and that the system was not designed to provide detailed records to a court. \u201cWe are now moving, we\u2019ve contracted a computer, uh, whiz, to rebuild the [system] so we can provide the [more detailed information], not the data dump, at request,\u201d he said. While Morris\u2019s evidence related to the ability to provide data to a court, it also highlights that those running the detention system don\u2019t have an easily accessible way of accurately monitoring the cumulative impact of separations or solitary confinement on individual young people. The youth justice minister, Di Farmer, was asked whether she had any concerns about this, and whether she would ask for an audit into the cumulative impact of confinement on long-term detainees. She sent a response that did not address the question. \u201cDetention centres are challenging environments and our \u2026 staff do difficult work in complex circumstances,\u201d Farmer said. In relation to questions about why evidence in court, under oath, is at odds with repeated public claims by the department, Farmer said: \u201cI receive high-level advice from very senior departmental officials and am guided by their experience and their insights.\u201d Written Off seeks to detail the experiences of young people in Queensland\u2019s justice system, where record numbers of children are being arrested and imprisoned.

A nurse was assigned to feed her and the midwife team taped handwritten signs across my door: \u201cDo not disturb this patient\u201d and \u201cThis patient must sleep\u201d. I had a 95% chance of entering postpartum psychosis, and nobody wanted that. While managing manic depression, I have probably met with 20 or so psychiatrists in and out of hospital, and they share a unified obsession \u2013 sleep. So I did as I was told my first day as a mother, as I knew it was the single-most protective action I could take for myself and my baby. While sleep has always been an intimate part of manic depression, new lines of inquiry are exploring whether sleep and the disruption of it are the defining characteristic of the disease itself and not just a symptom or side-effect of it. Sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities are found across the spectrum of bipolar disorders, and present in every phase of it \u2013 depression, mania and euthymia (remission). That means that even when you\u2019re well, you don\u2019t get the quality sleep other people do. But in addition to the classic sleep problems of bipolar, which are well-known and documented, an increasing body of evidence is unearthing the importance of sleep in the prevention and management of a host of other psychiatric disorders. Sleep is also pivotal to the prevention of mental disorder in otherwise healthy individuals with no history of mental illness. \u201cThe dominant view is that sleep [problems are] either a symptom of several mental health problems or it is a secondary consequence,\u201d Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford told the Guardian. \u201cReally, sleep is one of the contributing causes.\u201d It\u2019s very chicken and egg. Did you get sick because you weren\u2019t sleeping, or did you not sleep because you were sick? People with serious mental illnesses are often regarded as the outliers of society; there to show the general population what a malfunctioning brain looks like (and how best to avoid one). But the psychiatric risks of too little sleep are population-wide. Brain imaging scans have found the impact of sleep disruption on otherwise healthy individuals induces hypomanic mood problems similar to those found in bipolar patients, as well as emotional dysregulation, poor impulse control and severe irritability. To experience what having a mental illness is like, try not sleeping for two to three nights. It\u2019s a bit like that. Poor quality sleep is also a significant and recognised risk factor in developing certain conditions, especially depression, anxiety, psychosis and even suicidal ideation. So while sleep disturbance is a key symptom of the above illnesses, what scientists are discovering is that sleep problems can also precipitate mental illness, long before the illness may be recognised and diagnosed, let alone treated. So is sleep the canary in the coalmine, a clue to the health of our minds? \u201cHaving insomnia doubles your chances of developing depression and we now know that if you treat the insomnia it reduces depression,\u201d said Freeman. In my own case, research out of Italy has found that even a single night of disrupted sleep can lead to an episode in bipolar type one. If I have a very short or disturbed night, the early symptoms of a manic or psychotic episode generally appear in the following one to two days. According to the sleep foundation, it can take between four to nine days to fully recover from a disrupted night and return to \u201cbaseline\u201d. That\u2019s a long time for your brain to be at risk. I have left weddings, family gatherings and sleepovers because of missing sleep, and checked myself into hotels alone with nothing on the agenda but to fall unconscious. For a long time, I didn\u2019t realise that my reaction to even minimal sleep deprivation is somewhat extreme \u2013 bugs crawling across my vision, chairs swaying under me \u2013 and a clear indication of greater psychiatric disturbance. But we are all subject to the ravages of sleep loss. It\u2019s a spectrum, but one all of us are bound too. With a global sleep loss epidemic worsening since the pandemic, treating insomnia and sleep disturbances as a preventative measure in the general population should be an urgent public health priority. But too often sleep problems are given the magazine-treatment, and shallow tips and tricks (\u201ctry a warm bath scented with lavender\u201d) abound. For a long time I fought the sleep interventions that were imposed on me, especially in my 20s. It made me feel old and pathetic to go to bed when everybody else was out partying till dawn or, in news circles, covering some crisis. I wanted to keep up, I didn\u2019t want a disease slowing me down. In our culture, it\u2019s very hard to slow down \u2013 frowned upon even. But eventually, I had to get some sleep. The mayhem caused by me not sleeping is simply not worth it, for myself or, more crucially, those around me. The offhand \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine\u201d as I wave my concerned husband away at a late-night party is simply not true. The next day, I\u2019m almost never fine. But it\u2019s really hard to admit that. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed because of my bipolar\u201d is a bit of a mood-killer. The powerful and free treatment of sleep should be better recognised for its extraordinary therapeutic properties, not just in the management of psych patients, but for everyone. Sleep is probably the single best thing you could do for your mental health right now, yet as a society we continue to neglect it, treating it as a luxury rather than a necessity. I find it staggering that a single night of good sleep can quieten psychotic symptoms, quell anxiety, extinguish hypomania and tamp down depression. Your relationship with sleep (and not getting it) will no doubt look different to mine, but the power of using this drug-free, specialist-free intervention is something we all have in common. Cancel plans. Shuffle your schedule around. Whatever it takes to get you to bed. \u2022 Eleanor de Jong is the former New Zealand correspondent for the Guardian.

Yet they\u2019re almost always acrimonious. Stuart Dew\u2019s sacking felt particularly grubby. It was a dog\u2019s breakfast, really. He was made to look like a mug. They backed him, then sacked him. The press release announcing his departure was farcical, even by footy departure standards. It made him sound like he\u2019d just passed away. Footy coaches aren\u2019t building orphanages or splitting atoms, but they\u2019re entitled to some basic dignity. On his weekly radio slot with Neil Mitchell, Gil McLachlan said it \u201cfeels like a club that has decided to grow up in my view.\u201d If that\u2019s the view from the top, and to the best of my knowledge he\u2019s still running this competition, then it\u2019s a rather sad state of affairs. The leaks, the bloodlust, the weasel words \u2013 they rarely reflect well on the industry. As a Guardian AFL columnist, the only leaks I\u2019m getting are coming from my five-month-old daughter. But everyone\u2019s blades are sharpened. A month ago, I was far too quick to write off Michael Voss. I was like a Footy Classified panellist or Gold Coast Chairman Bob East, who exited customs, flicked his cowlick, fielded the call from league headquarters, and sacked Dew. Michael Voss, I wrote, didn\u2019t have a signature victory in his time at Carlton. Six weeks of shanks, sideways dinks and psychotic talkback rants had swayed me \u2013 the coach had to go. In my defence, I was hardly on my Pat Malone. But there were several prominent media figures who backed him in. \u201cI understand that (sacking him) if you just want to look at the win-loss sheet, which in the end is the thing that hires and fires,\u201d David King said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s all you\u2019re looking at, then you\u2019re going to bounce around and change with the breeze every two weeks.\u201d Voss, he insisted, was actually coaching well. Their problems, he said, simply came down to execution. I remember listening to that thinking: \u201cDavid, we\u2019re watching two completely different sports.\u201d But a month later, it holds up. In the second quarter of the Gold Coast game, an enormous weight was lifted from Carlton. They\u2019d scratched and poked around in the opening term, and the visitors probably should have cashed in. But the next half hour was a giant exhale. The Blues kicked 9.3, eight of those from centre clearances. Voss said he\u2019d been expecting that sort of football for two or three weeks, \u201cThere\u2019s been a storm on the outside and calm on the inside,\u201d he said. The 29,000 or so Blues fans who turned up deserved to see football of that quality. Like a Test cricket crowd, they stood and applauded the players as they walked off at half-time. So what changed? How could a team playing execrable football six weeks earlier turn up on Saturday and wallop a Port Adelaide side coming off 13 wins in a row? Voss says it comes down to greater pressure and an even spread of contributors. Jack Martin, Lachie Fogarty and David Cunningham have certainly added a bit of class, speed and mongrel to their forward set up. Blake Acres and Jack Silvagni both probably played their best games for the club. The view persists, particularly outside of Carlton, that Silvagni has been gifted an AFL career by virtue of his surname. But he\u2019s hardly blessed with an abundance of natural talent. He\u2019s an old school grafter, a jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none. He was superb on Saturday. So too Patrick Cripps, whose tackling and smothering were phenomenal. Again, his turnaround tracks back to the first few seconds of the second quarter in that Gold Coast game. On Saturday night, Voss was asked how he would handle expectations from here on. \u201cI hope we give it as much attention as we gave it six weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is, whether people are saying bad things about you, or good things about you, you have to treat it the same.\u201d All the coaches speak like that. They all echo Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u2018If\u2019. It\u2019s all well and good until the Bob Easts of this world tap them on the shoulder and tell them their time is up. One minute they\u2019re preaching \u201cit\u2019s never as good as it seems, and it\u2019s never as bad\u201d and the next minute they\u2019re being farewelled in a press release that reads like an \u2018In Memoriam\u2019 notice. It\u2019s a pitiless caper. Gil McLachlan says sacking Dew was a \u201chard-edged football decision\u201d and the sign of maturity. A month ago, I would have said the same thing about Voss. Carlton ignored the noise \u2013 from pokies magnates, from ledge loiterers, from membership microwavers, and from Guardian columnists - and were rewarded with the best football of the Michael Voss era."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87cd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/17/three-things-with-john-safran-these-shelves-hold-several-guides-to-jewish-exorcism", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Three things with John Safran: \u2018These shelves hold several guides to Jewish exorcism\u2019", "lead": "In our weekly interview about objects, the author and satirist tells us about a spoon with a special history \u2013 and how he\u2019s ready to communicate with spirits, good and bad", "author": "As told to Katie Cunningham", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628159", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/77a38df1a3eef3c4d41e2980866e6083a0569445/391_170_5609_3365/500.jpg", "body": "In the name of journalism, John Safran has taken on white supremacists, big tobacco and far-right extremists.

What I\u2019d save from my house in a fire A Swedish welcoming spoon. This is how my grandparents procured it: they fled the Nazis in Poland for a gulag in Russia, then a refugee camp in Uzbekistan \u2013 where my mother was born \u2013 then back to Poland. The Nazis had been defeated but the Jews were still hated, so they went to a displaced person\u2019s camp in Germany before finally my grandparents, my mother and my aunt were welcomed into Sweden. The Swedish government handed them a bag of essentials, including cutlery \u2013 of which the spoon, marked SAK, survives in my kitchen drawer in Melbourne. I use it for cereal and soup and whatever. It signifies hope for me. My most useful object Books decorate my home. One cabinet, that reaches floor to ceiling, is dedicated to Bibles and scripture. I call it God\u2019s Bookshelf. There\u2019s New Testaments in Korean, Japanese, Bislama, Aboriginal creole, Spanish and Hebrew. Some procured from hotel drawers, others honestly obtained. You\u2019ll find Qur\u2019ans and Books of Mormon and Ramayana alongside guides to Nazi mysticism, UFO Christianity, a feminist translation of the Torah, the Satanic Bible, the Necronomicon and an instruction manual on how to build a Scientology E-meter. Most houses only have a book or two instructing how to perform an exorcism and it\u2019ll be the garden-variety Catholic version. These shelves hold several guides to Jewish exorcism and how to expel demons found along the Horn of Africa. So no matter what spirit passes my door, friend or foe, I can communicate with it. The item I most regret losing Many of us have a box, curated by our parents, storing kindergarten finger paintings and other childhood work. I had one of them, then a certain someone who shall remain nameless threw out the box. Without warning! I\u2019m most annoyed because childhood mementos are fertile seeds for stories. And storytelling is my occupation. I wrote a storybook in grade three, stored in that box, of a boy and girl in love, both with a secret they are withholding from each other which they believe prevents them from marrying. On the final page of the story, the secrets are revealed. The boy takes off their mask, revealing they are a girl. But then the girl takes off their mask revealing they are a boy. They realise they can get married after all. When it became clear that 2020s society was obsessing over gender issues, I thought back to that story. It would have come in handy for some present-day spiel. But it was not to be. Those sheets of paper are worm food in a landfill. Thanks a lot, Certain Someone Who Shall Remain Nameless!

They say the criteria to qualify \u2013 requiring a role to last for a minimum of 13 weeks \u2013 has effectively lead to the \u201cexclusion\u201d of the screen industry, as most shoots last much less than 13 weeks. There is currently \u201cno incentive nor any support for employers in the screen industry to hire a person with a disability\u201d, says Tracey Corbin-Matchett, chief executive officer of Bus Stop Films. While she thinks JobsAccess is an \u201cexcellent\u201d service, it is \u201cdisconnected\u201d from the realities of how film and TV industries work. \u201cI imagine when it was set up [in 2006] that people weren\u2019t even thinking about people with disabilities in jobs in the screen industry,\u201d she says. Riesel \u201cdefinitely thinks\u201d that scrapping or reducing the 13-week requirement would land him more work; none of his jobs have lasted anywhere near that long. In the meantime, he attends screen industry events to get his foot in more doors, which \u201ccan be a bit difficult because of anxiety\u201d, he admits. Ade Djajamihardja\u2019s story is a stark example of how disability can impact a screen career. The writer and producer began his career as a floor manager with ABC TV News, then worked his way up on programs such as Countdown Revolution, The Big Gig and The Late Show, before setting up his own production company, A2K Media, with his partner Kate Stephens. But in 2011, Djajamihardja suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke that required urgent brain surgery under a medically induced coma, which many did not expect him to survive. He spent seven months in hospital, learning to breathe independently again and sit upright. After three decades in the business, Djajamihardja, now in a wheelchair, found himself cast as a \u201cre-emerging\u201d producer, he says. \u201cWhen Ade tried to get back into the screen industry, literally the first five meetings he couldn\u2019t get in the door,\u201d Stephens adds. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t even physically access the buildings.\u201d (Djajamijardja\u2019s \u201cmeditation mantra\u201d to get through hard times, he jokes, is \u201cinner peace, inner peace, inner freakin\u2019 peace\u201d.) The pair have been fighting to improve accessibility in the Australian screen industry ever since, making productions led by disabled creatives such as the panel show The Wheelhouse and Tales from the Crips. Their production company A2K Media is poised to launch an online training module, Disability Justice Lens, which aims to encourage Australia\u2019s screen industry to increase hiring rates for workers with disabilities, but they need more funding to get the module to its final phase. Djajamihardja and Stephens were key collaborators with a first-of-its-kind national survey of 518 screen industry workers, which found \u201cdisabled workers face prejudice and discrimination on a regular basis\u201d. The final report, Disability and Screen Work in Australia \u2013 which featured Djajamihardja in his wheelchair on the cover \u2013 found that \u201cgovernment programs such as JobAccess \u2026 do not appear to be well known or widely used in the screen industry\u201d. More recent research shows Australian film and television has a long way to go. In April, a Screen Australia report found only 6.6% of characters on screen identified as having a disability, compared with 17.7% of the general population. And last year, the Screen Diversity Inclusion Network\u2019s Everyone Counts report showed that among 2,811 cast and crew on 70 Australian film and TV productions, only 8.9% of people on screen and 5.3% of people behind the camera had a disability. Bus Stop\u2019s Corbin-Matchett believes reforming the criteria around employment subsidies would combat discrimination. \u201cCrewing up with more people with disabilities is really going to flow on to the story that\u2019s told, and the way it\u2019s told,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there was a wage subsidy to employ more people with a disability, we would see more characters with a disability. \u201cI call it exposure theory: people get more comfortable around disability when they work more with people with disabilities. Change will come when we have more people with disabilities working together.\u201d JobAccess general manager Daniel Valientl-Riedl says he is keen to work with the screen industry, even though he calls it \u201cproblematic\u201d for being \u201cvery casualised, really staggered\u201d. \u201cWhen the industry unfortunately is so erratic in the way they provide employment to people, it is difficult to make the argument that it is sustainable long-term, because there is no certainty around the hours the person is going to be able to do,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s complex.\u201d There have been significant wins for creatives with disability in front of and behind the camera: notably the award-winning SBS series Latecomers, led by co-creators and writers Emma Myers and Angus Thompson, who both have cerebral palsy, alongside comedian Nina Oyama. Myers says screen funding initiatives aimed at people from under-represented backgrounds \u2013 such as Digital Originals, under which Latecomers was funded \u2013 are \u201ca great thing, and there should be more of them catered specifically for creatives with disabilities \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be in this industry if those initiatives didn\u2019t exist.\u201d The stars of the show are disability advocate and writer Hannah Diviney, who plays Sarah, and Thompson as Frank: two characters whose sexual journeys, rather than their disabilities, are front and centre of the story. Diviney, who has cerebral palsy, is \u201cas far as we know, the first person with a disability to do a sex scene on Australian television,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew how much this would mean to our community and the chance of other projects coming along where disabled people have sex on screen was pretty limited.\u201d Playing Sarah in Latecomers led to Diviney being cast in her first film: the upcoming family dramedy Audrey. The film\u2019s producer Michael Wrenn confirms they did access an employment subsidy for Diviney via JobAccess, which enabled them to make accessibility modifications on the home where the film was shot to accommodate her wheelchair. This then prompted the film\u2019s writer to rewrite Diviney\u2019s character, originally written as having more mobility than she has, as a wheelchair user. While Diviney was on set for only six weeks, her employment qualified for the minimum 13-week subsidy by including her pre-production work on the film \u2013 an extreme rarity for the industry. Diviney\u2019s employment on Audrey is now a test case for JobAccess and how it can be used to employ more people with disabilities in the screen industry. \u201cFor everyone it was a real learning experience, because a lot of them hadn\u2019t necessarily seen or spent time with disability before,\u201d says Diviney. \u201cThere was a lot of uncertainty from everybody I think around whether it would work, myself included. I\u2019m hopeful that when people get to see the film and talk about it, the industry at large will not see disability as such a scary thing.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87cf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/data-doesnt-support-this-violent-nsw-knife-crimes-at-a-20-year-low-as-new-penalties-take-effect", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Data doesn\u2019t support this\u2019: violent NSW knife crimes at a 20-year low as new penalties take effect", "lead": "High-profile stabbings have led the new Labor government to get tough on knives, but statistics tell a different story", "author": "Tamsin Rose", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 15:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628195", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/13bfa94fb0a77359aff7327395a9e43d48a185da/1193_1613_3075_1846/500.jpg", "body": "The New South Wales government was adamant that swift, decisive action was needed to combat a spate of knife crime across Sydney. A series of high-profile stabbings and media reports about \u201cknife attack hotspots\u201d had created a sense of urgency to do something about it. \u201cToo many people, almost exclusively young men, think that it is OK to carry a knife,\u201d the NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, told parliament on 20 June. \u201cIn the same way as we would pick up a pen and put it into our pocket when we go to work, there are young men who think that it is OK to put a knife into their pocket to carry out their daily business.\u201d Yet some experts were confused when the new state Labor government last month announced the doubling of the maximum penalties for people caught with knives in public or in schools. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There have been prominent cases of serious crimes involving knives, such as the stabbing death of paramedic Steven Tougher in April and an attack on a Service NSW worker the following month. There is also the death of Uati \u201cPele\u201d Faletolu, who was 17 when he died at last year\u2019s Royal Easter Show. But the statistics say they are the exceptions to the trends. In fact, they suggest assaults and robberies involving knives are actually at their lowest levels in 20 years. Jackie Fitzgerald, the executive director of the state\u2019s Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (Bocsar), said the data is \u201cclear\u201d and shows the use of knives in crime is at a historic low. \u201cThe most recent year shows very low rates of offences with knives,\u201d she said. But \u201cthe question about where [it is that] more people are carrying knives is more difficult to answer\u201d, according to Fitzgerald, who said policing priorities would have an effect on figures. \u201cWe\u2019re dependent on the police detecting these incidents and usually that\u2019s through some kind of productivity \u2026 so if police are focused on weapons offences, they will detect more weapons being carried,\u201d she said. She noted that knife custody in a public place was at a high, but that was \u201cnot dissimilar to where we were in 2020, 2021 and even similar to the year before that\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that there\u2019s been a sharp rise in people carrying knives,\u201d she said. She said the figures around wielding a knife in public also remained stable over recent years and just two people have been prosecuted for wielding a knife in a school over the past decade. There were between 13 and 24 offences each year between 2019 and 2023 of wielding of a knife in public over the 10 years. Three people have been prosecuted for visibly carrying a knife in a school over the same period. The prosecution numbers do not show how many youth offenders have been diverted from court. The figures for some offences were so low that they presented an opportunity for police to better understand why they occur, in order to try to prevent them from happening again, according to the NSW Greens\u2019 justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson. \u201cTaking this kind of sharper, bigger stick approach is not going to change these figures,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep criminalising and then imposing harsher measures on people who are already vulnerable and locked in the criminal justice system. This just perpetuates a dysfunctional cycle and it\u2019s not going to make anyone safer.\u201d She accused the government of taking a \u201cpopulist\u201d approach to policy, rather than working in the best interest of people, especially the state\u2019s youth. A spokesperson for the NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, said the government will \u201cmake no apologies for taking strong action against those caught carrying knives illegally in public\u201d. \u201cKnife attacks regularly cause horrific injuries and deaths and there is absolutely no place for this kind of dangerous behaviour in our community,\u201d they said. But the NSW advocate for children and young people, Zo\u00eb Robinson, said the law change was not supported by the data and the government needed to be thinking about the impact of jail time on young people. \u201cWe encourage a focus on early intervention and holistic support when talking about how to respond to these complex issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThe data doesn\u2019t support this legislative response. We should be working collectively together to support and work with young people, not impose punitive responses.\u201d A spokesperson for Daley, the attorney general, said the tougher penalties \u201care intended to send a strong message about the seriousness of knife-related crime\u201d and youth offenders will still be eligible to receive a caution or referral to youth justice conferencing where appropriate."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/thousands-forced-out-of-homes-la-palma-canary-islands-as-heatwave-grips-europe", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Southern Europe braces for second heat storm in a week", "lead": "New system pushing into region from north Africa could lead to temperatures above record 48.8C", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll in Brussels, Angela Giuffrida in Rome, and Helena Smith in Athens", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:49:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628213", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d96076d572837062eeffeee66dd27b2d2232ccdc/0_137_5659_3396/500.jpg", "body": "Southern Europe is bracing for a second heat storm in a week, with Italy, Greece and Spain, along with Morocco and other Mediterranean countries, being told temperature records could be broken on Tuesday. A new anticyclone that pushed into the region from north Africa on Sunday could lift temperatures above the record 48.8C (120F) seen in Sicily in August 2021, and follows last week\u2019s Cerberus heatwave. The European Space Agency (ESA) said the next week could bring the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe in a heatwave named Charon after the Greek mythological boatman who ferries souls to the underworld. The human-caused climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather around the world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters, from heatwaves to floods to wildfires. On Monday, the World Meteorological Organization said the planet experienced the hottest few days on record in the first few days of July, after a June that was the hottest on record according to the ESA. A study recently published in Nature Medicine said more than 60,000 people died because of last year\u2019s summer heatwaves across Europe, with the highest mortality rates seen in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal. Italy sweltered in exceptionally high temperatures and humidity levels on Sunday in what the weather website ILMeteo.it described as a \u201cheat storm\u201d, and the situation will intensify with the arrival on Monday of another anticyclone that will push the mercury to possible highs of 47C in southern areas of Sardinia, and 45C or 46C in parts of Puglia and Sicily. Temperatures in Rome, which is packed with tourists, are poised to climb to 42C or 43C on Tuesday. Sixteen Italian cities, including Rome, Florence, Bologna, Bari, Cagliari and Palermo, have been put on \u201cred alert\u201d by the health ministry, meaning the heat is so intense it poses a threat to the health of the entire population. Nighttime temperatures remain above 20C, making it a struggle for people to sleep. Italy is one of the European countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with extreme weather events within the past 13 months responsible for more than 50 deaths. Luca Mercalli, the president of the Italian Meteorological Society, said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the heatwaves were linked to global heating. \u201cIt is much easier to connect a heatwave to global warming than, say, flooding,\u201d he added. \u201cFloods have a component linked to climate change but we don\u2019t know to what extent, and so it is more delicate to say a flood is caused by [the climate crisis]. Instead, with the heat there is no doubt \u2013 it is the most direct phenomenon that we can perceive.\u201d The ESA said: \u201cItaly, Spain, France, Germany and Poland are all facing a major heatwave with air temperatures expected to climb to 48C on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia.\u201d Morocco is among the north African countries slated for above-average temperatures, with highs of 47C in some provinces recorded this weekend \u2013 more typical of August than July \u2013 sparking concerns over water shortages, the meteorological service said. On the Canary island of La Palma, more than 4,000 people were evacuated from properties after a forest fire swept through the north-west of the island. The regional government said on Sunday it had put neighbouring islands including Tenerife and Gran Canaria on alert for risk of forest fires, with 4,500 hectares of land and a dozen homes already destroyed in La Palma. \u201cThe fire advanced very quickly,\u201d said Fernando Clavijo, the president of the Canary Islands regional government. He blamed \u201cthe wind, the climate conditions as well as the heatwave that we are living through\u201d for the swift spread of the blaze. In Greece, scorching heat forced the Acropolis to close temporarily between 11.30am and 5.30pm to protect tourists from dangerous temperatures, risk of dehydration and sunstroke. Winds provided some respite and the temperatures dropped by as much as 4C in some parts of the country. But leading weatherman Sakis Arnaoutoglou warned the hiatus would be brief and predicted the mercury would rise \u201cabove 41C\u201d from Thursday for six consecutive days. The appearance of winds measuring seven on the Beaufort scale would undoubtedly keep temperatures down in the coming days, meteorologists said, but they have also raised fears of forest fires feeding on land parched by intense heat. \u201cAfter the heatwave and the dryness [caused by it], we have the meltemi [strong, dry] winds, which multiply the risk of fire,\u201d the Greek minister of climate crisis and civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias, said. \u201cAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough when the winds die down we\u2019ll have a heatwave again \u2026 we are in the worst, and most difficult, climatic conditions possible for fires to occur.\u201d Unrelenting temperatures are also being felt in the US, where sweltering conditions over the weekend put more than one-third of Americans under extreme heat alerts. The US National Weather Service (NWS) reported that a heatwave stretching from California to Texas was expected to peak during an \u201cextremely hot and dangerous weekend\u201d. Death Valley national park \u2013 often among the hottest places on Earth \u2013 was expected to equal or surpass its heat record of 54.4C. Las Vegas could experience three consecutive days with a high of 46C, which has happened just once before, the NWS reported. Phoenix, which has endured a two-week stretch of temperatures above 43C with little relief in the evening hours, was expecting its hottest weekend of the year. Southern California is fighting numerous wildfires, including one in Riverside County that has burned more than 3,000 hectares (7,500 acres) and prompted evacuation orders. Farther north, the Canadian government said wildfires had burned a record-breaking 10m hectares this year, with more damage expected. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, was asked on CNN about the global response to the climate crisis, and if it was time for the UN to stop allowing China to be categorised as a developing nation when it comes to emissions cuts. Sullivan said that the US climate envoy, John Kerry, would make the point during his trip to Beijing, which began on Sunday, that there was \u201cmore work for them to do on that front\u201d and that \u201cevery country including China has a responsibility to reduce emissions\u201d and China should be encouraged to \u201ctake far more dramatic action\u201d. Japan issued heatstroke alerts to tens of millions of people in 20 of its 47 prefectures as near-record high temperatures scorched large areas and torrential rain pummelled other regions. \u201cEvery time we\u2019re visiting somewhere there seems to be a heatwave or like a rare weather disaster,\u201d said Anthony Fernandez, a Texan tourist, in Tokyo. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of becoming like the new normal \u2026 climate change is a big concern.\u201d The national broadcaster NHK said the heat was life-threatening, with the capital and other places recording nearly 40C. Japan\u2019s highest temperature ever \u2013 41.1C recorded in Kumagaya city, Saitama, in 2018 \u2013 could be beaten, according to the meteorological agency. Some places experienced their highest temperatures in more than four decades on Saturday, including Hirono in Fukushima prefecture, with 37.3C. The Copernicus Climate Change Service said June 2023 was just over 0.5C above the 1991-2020 June average, with unprecedented sea temperatures and record low Antarctic sea ice.

Johnson gave the keynote speech this week at Netroots, the largest annual gathering of progressives in the country, taking place in Chicago, and amplified his campaign talk about a wider approach to safer streets. \u201cMany people will make you believe that the only way in which you can have safe communities is by simply engaging in politics of old, by believing that the only answer to public safety is policing. That\u2019s a failed strategy,\u201d he told the gathering. However the progressive Democrat did not repeat his campaign trail commitments to pull the plug on ShotSpotter when the city\u2019s current contract is up next year. For more than a decade, Chicago has used the company\u2019s nearly 30-year-old gunshot detection system, deployed in high-crime areas and designed to direct police to shootings, but that in recent years has faced intense criticism for its methodology and the impact of its technology on communities of color. \u201cHe\u2019s a rising star in progressive politics and we\u2019re going to hold him accountable,\u201d Granate Kim, campaign director at MPower Change, a Chicago-based Muslim digital advocacy organization, told a panel held at Netroots. Kim added that if Johnson did not break with ShotSpotter: \u201cWe would be very upset and take him to task nationally.\u201d Johnson emerged as the unlikely winner from the left in the mayoral race in April, defeating former Chicago public schools CEO Paul Vallas, who had received an endorsement from the right-leaning police union. The two men had faced off after mayor Lori Lightfoot lost her bid for re-election. Johnson had said on his campaign website: \u201cChicago spends $9m a year on ShotSpotter despite clear evidence it is unreliable and overly susceptible to human error. This expensive technology played a pivotal role in the police killing of 13-year-old Adam Toledo.\u201d Toledo, 13, was shot dead by police in 2021 after a chase and confrontation in which bodycam footage showed the boy with his hands in the air. The killing prompted protests in Chicago, and no charges were brought against the police. Amid criticism of the city\u2019s procurement process as opaque, last fall, Lightfoot quietly extended the company\u2019s contract to February 2024. Then in June, Johnson approved a $10m payment for ShotSpotter. A senior adviser in the mayor\u2019s office blamed the authorization on an automated signature \u2013 but also did not commit to ending the contract next year. If Johnson continues the contract, the backlash from fellow progressives is likely to be swift. \u201cWe need Mayor Brandon Johnson to stand on his campaign promise of getting the contract canceled. It does not have to be that hard,\u201d said Alyxandra Goodwin, a community organizer with Black Youth Project 100 in Chicago. Goodwin noted that the city\u2019s upcoming budget season provided another opportunity to push the mayor and his allies to end the contract. \u201cWe need the mayor to propose a budget that does not have money for gunshot detection. And now we need city council to approve the budget that doesn\u2019t have money for gunshot detection,\u201d Goodwin added. Shotspotter has been deployed in more than 120 cities including Boston, New York and Denver, according to the company, which recently rebranded as SoundThinking. Research from the University of Michigan and Chicago\u2019s own office of inspector general have raised questions over its accuracy and efficiency. A recent investigation by the Guardian, the Lucy Parsons Labs and the Oregon Justice Research Center, shed light on how ShotSpotter circumvented the public procurement process in Portland. While the city mulls the renewal, it\u2019s also facing a federal lawsuit from the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern University\u2019s law school over Chicago police\u2019s use of ShotSpotter. Lucy Parsons Labs, one of the plaintiffs in the class action suit, alleged that the deployment of ShotSpotter in predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods infringes on civil liberties and breaks the fourth amendment, said Alejandro Ruizesparza, co-director for Lucy Parsons Labs. \u201cWe are using that racial justice lens in our litigation to look at how cities that have contracts with private entities use this technology in a way that is particularly harmful to people of color and also poor people,\u201d Ruizesparza said. \u201cMaybe these companies should be paying reparations every time they hurt Black and brown people. That would really hurt their profit margin.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/16/ofgem-warns-energy-suppliers-it-will-clamp-down-on-excess-profits-dividends", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ofgem warns energy suppliers it will clamp down on excess profits", "lead": "Head of regulator for Great Britain says firms with weak finances should not pay dividends as energy crisis abates", "author": "Zoe Wood", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:39:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628251", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dc47da2954d934826f076d2d59b9338d1c85918a/0_183_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "The head of Ofgem has fired a warning shot at suppliers as the worst energy crisis since the 1970s abates, making clear that Great Britain\u2019s gas and electricity regulator will clamp down on excess profits and that firms with weak finances should not pay dividends. Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, said during the past two years the country had experienced an \u201cenergy crisis genuinely unprecedented since at least the 1970s\u201d and as more normal conditions returned it would be alive to profiteering. \u201cWe will be vigilant in the way the price cap changes so it continues only to reflect costs reasonably incurred in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe acted quickly to make changes to allowances in the price cap as prices rose and suppliers struggled to stem excessive losses, and we will act equally quickly to adjust the price cap if we see undue rewards across the sector as prices fall and profits return.\u201d The price cap sets a maximum price that suppliers in Great Britain can charge consumers for each kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy they use, limiting the amount of profit they can make. Brearley said: \u201cTo ensure fair cost recovery, earlier this year we allowed suppliers to recover costs incurred through the market turbulence of previous years. This, alongside the usual regulated profit margin, means suppliers are likely to make significant profits this year.\u201d \u201cCompanies do need to recover costs and to make reasonable profits for there to be a sustainable and competitive market for consumers,\u201d he added. Until recently, profits have not been the problem as energy suppliers have made combined losses of about \u00a34bn over the last four years, with 29 suppliers going bust during a tumultuous period. The run of failures led to criticism of Ofgem\u2019s effectiveness as they ended up costing consumers \u00a32.7bn, or an extra \u00a394 each, as the cost of managing millions of customer transfers was added to bills. Brearley said: \u201cWe will act against any suppliers who have not learned the lessons of the energy crisis and do not put their customers first. This means not only ensuring falling prices are passed on to consumers in their energy bills, but also stepping up to deliver excellent customer service this winter \u2013 in particular to the most vulnerable.\u201d In a nod to the high number of failed suppliers, Brearley said companies that were \u201cnot yet sufficiently financially resilient\u201d should not pay dividends until they had \u201cthe financial resources in place to deal with future price shocks\u201d. He added: \u201cAll companies need to work hard to avoid the costs that hit all energy customers in the event they go bust. Customers deserve a stable and financially resilient energy market, and we will take action against any company that pays out to their shareholders while taking unnecessary financial risks.\u201d Although energy prices have fallen, the annual bill for a typical household in Great Britain is still more than \u00a31,000 more than before the crisis. Ofgem cut the price cap on standard dual-fuel tariffs to \u00a32,074 at the start of this month, although most households will feel little relief. That is because the government has withdrawn its universal support for energy bills. In addition to the \u00a3400 credit given to bill-payers, its energy price guarantee, which temporarily replaced the price cap, limited average energy costs to \u00a32,500. Both those schemes have now ended. With bills still high, Brearley said there was a significant group of vulnerable customers that would struggle to pay this winter. \u201cThis may well mean we need further targeted support for those worst affected, and we will work with government on examining this need,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jul/16/scheme-to-protect-abuse-case-litigants-lacks-resources-lawyers-say-england-wales", "primaryCategory": "law", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Scheme to stop people being quizzed by abuser in court failing, lawyers say", "lead": "Exclusive: Courts in England and Wales unable to attract sufficient numbers of advocates", "author": "Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:20:55", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628270", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4ff53b696b9e717c22ea989fc7f6b6d6ca2c30fd/0_229_4928_2956/500.jpg", "body": "A scheme designed to ensure people representing themselves in court do not have to be questioned by their abuser is failing due to lack of resources, family law experts have said. Since last year, family and civil courts have been required in certain cases to appoint a qualified legal representative (QLR) so that litigants in person are not cross-examined by the perpetrator or alleged perpetrator of their abuse and vice versa, but there has been a shortage of lawyers signing up to the scheme. Last week, the president of the family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane, said the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had been \u201cunable to attract anything like sufficient numbers of advocates to act as a QLR in individual cases\u201d. A response to a freedom of information (FoI) request by the barristers\u2019 chambers 4PB, shared exclusively with the Guardian, shows that only 113 QLRs have been used in courts across England and Wales since the scheme launched last July. Mani Basi, a barrister at 4PB, said: \u201cWhilst the QLR scheme had an incredibly noble and important intention, it seems almost inevitable that anything based on barristers volunteering was going to struggle to get off the ground. Failure to appoint a QLR is undoubtedly likely to create more adjournments, delays and wasted costs and resources to an already struggling court system.\u201d The number of litigants in person has been increasing since cuts to legal aid funding were introduced in 2013, and such cases tend to take longer because they usually need additional time and support, exacerbating the backlog in the courts. The proportion of private law cases in which both parties had legal representation was only 18% in July to September last year. McFarlane said that \u201cfrequent and widespread difficulties are being encountered in finding advocates to act as a QLR\u201d. He said it was \u201cdispiriting and very concerning that the QLR scheme \u2026 seems unable to attract anything like sufficient numbers of advocates to act as a QLR in individual cases\u201d. The 4PB FoI request found that 428 lawyers had registered for the training since the scheme started. Of these, 258 had completed the training and 113 had been used, some in more than one case. The number of open private law family cases stood at 47,700 in March, official figures show, and cases are taking 45.7 weeks on average to complete. Lucy Hadley, the head of policy at Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cWe welcomed the ban on this abhorrent practice in the Domestic Abuse Act but we remain unconvinced the implementation of these measures effectively protects survivors of domestic abuse. The government must ensure that there is enough training and funding to enable lawyers to become qualified legal representatives and stop this state-sanctioned abuse. Without oversight of the implementation of these commitments and proper scrutiny, women are left unprotected, terrified and subject to further abuse.\u201d Before QLRs were introduced, the solution was usually for judges or magistrates to put questions to a witness directly. Basi said that if judges struggled to find a QLR, they may consider reverting to putting the questions themselves, something McFarlane also suggested could happen if there was no alternative. But Basi said this may leave a judge open to challenge by a litigant in person unhappy that they were denied access to a QLR when people in other cases were not. \u201cIt might be that in some areas there is a greater availability of QLRs than in others and therefore the success of the scheme may vary from region to region \u2013 a potential postcode lottery,\u201d Basi said. \u201cImportantly, there is a greater awareness in respect of domestic abuse, but these individuals need support to bring their case and these issues on the ground with the QLR scheme require more consideration to ensure it works and justice is served.\u201d An MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cThe latest figures show there have been 350 cases where a qualified legal representative has been appointed, demonstrating the scheme\u2019s success in helping to protect vulnerable people from being retraumatised at court.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/16/benjamin-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-heart-tests", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Benjamin Netanyahu discharged from hospital after heart tests", "lead": "Israeli prime minister fitted with monitoring device after being kept overnight with dehydration", "author": "Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:17:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628288", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/59eb47de562807c1d2dc091dc79e13c33913cc26/0_204_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been discharged from hospital after heart monitoring tests showed no irregularities during an overnight admission for dehydration. Netanyahu, 73, was taken to hospital near his private residence in the coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday afternoon after complaining of dizziness and kept overnight for observation, his office said. In a video statement issued from the hospital, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader appeared to be in good spirits. He said he and his wife had spent a day at the Sea of Galilee on Friday \u201cin the sun, without a hat, without water: not a good idea\u201d. Israel is in the middle of a summer heatwave. Sheba medical centre confirmed its original diagnosis of dehydration on Sunday and said that while Netanyahu\u2019s heart was in \u201cexcellent condition\u201d, a heart monitoring device had been implanted \u201cfor the sake of routine monitoring\u201d. The weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday was postponed until Monday as a result of the prime minister\u2019s hospital visit. Netanyahu is generally thought to be in good health, although he was admitted to hospital briefly during the election campaign in October last year after feeling unwell during prayers for Yom Kippur. In 2010, the prime minister\u2019s office released a protocol requiring annual public reports on the incumbent\u2019s health, but Netanyahu\u2019s staff have not released this since 2016. Netanyahu returned to office in December at the head of a coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties, which has faced intense opposition to its plans to overhaul the judicial system. Supporters of the changes argue that they are needed to rein in what they see as a leftwing bias in the decisions of the supreme court, which serves a prominent role in a country with no formal constitution and only one legislative chamber. Critics say they fear democratic backsliding and allege that the overhaul will aid Netanyahu\u2019s fight against graft charges, which he denies. The issue has given rise to an unprecedented protest movement, including pressure from the technology sector and military reservists, damaged Israel\u2019s economy, and drawn criticism of the government from international allies such as the US. Israel is gearing up for an intense two weeks before the Knesset breaks up for summer recess. Ministers are pushing to pass a key part of the government\u2019s controversial overhaul into law before the parliamentary term comes to a close at the end of the month, despite planned protests and strikes across the country. On leaving hospital, Netanyahu expelled a prominent member of his Likud party for comments relating to the Holocaust. Ethnic tensions between Ashkenazi Jews, of European descent, and Mizrahi Jews, of Middle Eastern descent, have been whipped up by the political and constitutional crisis. Footage circulated on social media showed Itzik Zarka cursing and spitting at people near the town of Beit Shean demonstrating on Saturday against the judicial overhaul. Zarka shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s not for nothing that 6 million were killed \u2026 I\u2019m proud that 6 million of you were burned.\u201d In a statement, Netanyahu said: \u201cWe will not tolerate such disgraceful behaviour in the Likud movement.\u201d Also on Sunday, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on a car in the occupied West Bank, wounding three Israelis, including two girls, Israeli authorities said. The suspect fled the scene of the shooting but was later captured by the Israel Defence Forces. In addition to Netanyahu\u2019s political headaches, Israel and the West Bank are experiencing the bloodiest year on record since the end of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in 2005. More than 150 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of 2023, and 26 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis, according to figures collated by rights groups."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/16/huge-market-untapped-lack-of-visitors-worries-wales-tourists-money", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018A huge market going untapped\u2019: lack of visitors worries Wales", "lead": "Country does not seem to get its fair share of tourists or money, despite so much spectacular mountain scenery and coastline", "author": "Kevin Rushby", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:03:50", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628306", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3bff68e72d763a5c9578515ddaa7fab196fc12e8/0_224_6720_4032/500.jpg", "body": "Any summer\u2019s day on top of Yr Wyddfa you may be forgiven for thinking all is well with Welsh tourism. People are queuing to touch the summit cairn, the cafe is rammed and the railway fully booked. But the Welsh affairs committee at Westminster this week voiced serious concerns. It pointed out that in 2019, international visitors spent about \u00a3515m in Wales, less than 2% of the \u00a328bn they spent in the UK overall. Closer scrutiny revealed other worrying signs: in 2022, there were almost 2.8bn day trips taken by British residents but only 6% happened in Wales, and on those visits people spent less than elsewhere in Britain. For a country with so much spectacular mountain scenery and coastline, the committee report on Wales makes painful reading, especially since world tourism surveys regularly show that \u201cnatural beauty\u201d is the key driver for visitors. Rowland Rees-Evans, the chair of Mid-Wales Tourism, said: \u201cYou have to look at the infrastructure, it is lagging behind. And then there\u2019s a lack of communication between the tourism industry, the various marketing bodies and government. If we could work together, the potential is massive.\u201d This view is echoed by others working in tourism. Richard Rees runs Celtic Deep, which takes visitors out to see marine wildlife around Pembrokeshire. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of awareness of what amazing world-class wildlife experiences we have here: from puffin colonies on Skomer Island to sightings of tuna, whales, sharks and dolphins. There\u2019s a huge market that is going untapped.\u201d So what are the tourists missing out on in Wales? Scenic railways Infrastructure is often cited as weak, but in fact Wales has several remarkable railways. Board the Cambrian line from Shrewsbury down to Aberystwyth and you pass through stunning mountain scenery and, in season, can spot ospreys nesting near Dyfi junction. The northern branch to Pwllheli then rattles past several remarkable coastal sights, including the Mawddach estuary and Harlech Castle. Further south, the Heart of Wales line, another underfunded and creaky public service, is also one of the world\u2019s finest rail routes. Suzy Davies, the chair of the Wales Tourism Alliance, said: \u201cWe have poor quality carriages and unreliable services. But the routes are magnificent.\u201d These lines also connect to some of the world\u2019s finest collection of heritage steam services: the Ffestiniog, Talyllyn and the Vale of Rheidol railways. Other lines are dotted all over, from the Brecon Mountain Railway in the south to the Welsh Highland up north. The Coastal Path Wales is one of only a handful of countries that can claim to have a fully operational footpath right around itself, and what a gem it is. Start with the 870-mile coastal route that takes in the glories of the Gower, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, but also the less well-known seascapes of Ceredigion and Gwynnedd. Follow that with the Offa\u2019s Dyke path, 177 miles through border mountains, often next to, and even on, the underrated ancient monument itself. The word \u201cdyke\u201d barely does justice to a vast eighth-century infrastructure project, way beyond the capacity of any administration nowadays, it rises to eight-metre high earth rampart for some stretches across lonely and isolated mountains. Elsewhere there are too many blocked and unsigned paths, but the coastal route and Offa\u2019s Dyke are triumphs. Mountains Yr Wyddfa takes the strain. Everyone climbs it. Meanwhile, a few miles away, other equally spectacular peaks can be peacefully unfrequented. Some are better known than others: Tryfan and Glyder Fach have great scrambles, further south there is Cnicht and Cadair Idris, the latter with wonderful views of the Irish Sea. These, however, are positively busy compared with the delights of Cadair Berwyn, Aran Fawddwy and Pumlumon Fawr, the highest mountain in mid-Wales and source of both the rivers Severn and Wye. Further east is Moel Famau, a hill topped by a tower. Down in Pembrokeshire, Foeldrygarn is home to an iron age hill fort and three bronze age cairns that were built when the hieroglyphic paint was still drying inside Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb. Access is not always easy: some mountains do not have recognised summit paths, but the potential for hillwalkers is vast. Slate An industry that once dominated the landscape of north Wales lingers on as the ghost in the tourist machine. Old quarries are home to the fastest zip wires in the world and underground adventures like Go Below. The mines\u2019 transport routes are now reborn as heritage railways. Real adventurers, however, treasure them as places to explore. You will need climbing skills and equipment to enjoy Eryri\u2019s Dinorwic (this vast wonderland has access issues), but Llanfair near Harlech is more easily enjoyed. Slate was not the only mineral exploited, of course, and other mines that can be visited include coal and gold. At Parys, near Amlwch on Anglesey, is the wondrous orange moonscape of a former copper mine, once the largest in the world and mined since the bronze age. Welsh language and culture Once seen as the exclusive domain of fluent native speakers, there\u2019s a recent shift towards inspiring interest and inclusivity (residential courses for beginners are available). Call it the Deadpool effect. In 2020, the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought Wrexham AFC. Reynolds\u2019s TV channel Maximum Effort then started hosting Welsh-language programmes for its US and Canadian audiences. \u201cIn a lighthearted and humble way, they\u2019ve embraced the language,\u201d said Davies, \u201cIt\u2019s made a difference.\u201d A new younger demographic are bringing a livelier and less judgmental approach as shown by the Welsh-language channel S4C\u2019s Gogglebocs Cymru, which embraced all kinds of accents and levels of ability. That, and football of course, has brought American tourists to Wrexham, proving that anything is possible."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/16/womens-world-cup-2023-stadium-guides-stadium-australia-accor-sydney-football-allianz-melbourne-rectangular-aami-brisbane-suncorp-perth-hbf-hindmarsh-adelaide-eden-park-auckland-dunedin-forsyth-barr-wellington-regional-sky-waikato-fmg", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup 2023: the complete guide to all the stadiums", "lead": "Ten venues across nine cities in Australia and New Zealand will host matches during the tournament", "author": "Jo Khan, Mike Hytner, Tess McClure and Paul Bellsham", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:03:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628325", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a62586dbf25bf3b9e6506c7913e1ba629a8e832a/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "Stadium Australia, Sydney/Gadigal Capacity: 69,314 Opened: June 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group B: Australia v Republic of Ireland, 20 July, 8pm (local time) Last 16: 1B v 2D, 7 August, 8.30pm Quarter-final: 12 August, 8.30pm Semi-final: 16 August, 8pm Final: 20 August, 8pm As the largest stadium in the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup lineup, Stadium Australia (Accor Stadium) was originally going to host three knockout games and the final. But the Matildas\u2019 opener against Ireland was moved to the venue when ticket demand suggested Sydney Football Stadium was going to quickly sell out. The stadium is in Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park and was built to host the 2000 Games\u2019 ceremonies, athletics and some football. The stadium had its largest crowd on day 11 of those Olympics when 112,524 people watched from the stands as Australia\u2019s Cathy Freeman won the gold medal in the 400 metres. After the Olympics the stadium was reconfigured to accommodate an oval field for AFL and cricket, and its capacity was reduced. Before the Women\u2019s World Cup the ground held the record for the highest attendance for a home Matildas match \u2013 36,109 saw them play the US in 2021. But when the Matildas take to the pitch on 20 July that record is expected to be broken. Sydney Football Stadium, Sydney/Gadigal Capacity: 38,841 Opened: August 2022 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group F: France v Jamaica, 23 July, 8pm (local time) Group H: Colombia v Korea, 25 July, 12pm Group D: England v Denmark, 28 July, 6.30pm Group H: Germany v Colombia, 30 July, 7.30pm Group F: Panama v France, 2 August, 8pm Round of 16: 1E v 2G, 6 August, 12pm Just outside Sydney\u2019s city centre is the manicured sporting precinct of Moore Park \u2013 home to the new Sydney Football Stadium. Also known as Allianz Stadium, the football and rugby venue is neighbour to the Sydney Cricket Ground as well as additional fields and facilities for netball, basketball and athletics. The $828m (\u00a3435m) stadium opened in August 2022 after the state government controversially decided to demolish and replace the original stadium of the same name which was built in 1988. The new Sydney Football Stadium features steep seating to get you closer to the action and a sweeping architectural roof covering all seats \u2013 which can be lit up in custom colours. While the original stadium was the site for the 2000 Sydney Olympics women\u2019s football gold medal match between Norway and the USA, in this tournament it will host five group matches and just one round of 16 game. And if you\u2019ve ever wondered what a cheeseburger spring roll tastes like, this venue delivers \u2013 upon redevelopment the catering contract was won by the Merivale group, which is charged with keeping fans fed and watered. Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, Melbourne/Naarm Capacity 24,870 Opened 2010 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group B: Nigeria v Canada, 21 July, 12.30pm (local time) Group H: Germany v Morocco, 24 July, 6.30pm Group B: Canada v Australia, 31 July, 8pm Group F: Jamaica v Brazil, 2 August, 8pm Round of 16: 1G v 2E, 6 August, 7pm Round of 16: 1H v 2F, 8 August, 6pm The Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, known as Aami Park, is the newest structure in the city\u2019s sporting hub next to the Yarra River. The MCG may be the jewel in the crown in Australia\u2019s \u201csporting capital\u201d but the rectangular stadium stands out thanks to its geometric cloud-shaped roof and exterior \u2013 which can be lit up in team colours. Across the road is the home of the Australian Open tennis tournament, Melbourne Park and Rod Laver Arena, all connected with walkways and footbridges. The addition of the rectangular stadium provided the city with a dedicated football and rugby ground where spectators could enjoy better views and a more intimate atmosphere compared with the oval grounds. It is home to Melbourne Victory, Melbourne City and Western United\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s A-League teams. As it is the only viable World Cup venue in the city, due to the MCG and Marvel Stadium being locked up by the AFL, Melbourne will only host six matches despite being one of the most football-loving states. Brisbane Stadium, Brisbane/Meaanjin Capacity 46,851 Opened 1914 (redeveloped in 2003) Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group D: England v Haiti, 22 July, 7.30pm (local time) Group B: Australia v Nigeria, 27 July, 8pm Group F: France v Brazil, 29 July, 8pm Group B: Republic of Ireland v Nigeria, 31 July, 8pm Group H: South Korea v Germany, 3 August, 8pm Round of 16: 1D v 2B, 7 August, 5.30pm Quarter-final, 12 August, 5pm Third-place playoff, 19 August, 6pm Brisbane Stadium, on a bend in the river just outside the city centre, has been Queensland\u2019s home of rugby league since the 1950s. The intimate rectangular stadium will no doubt echo the raucous energy of Brisbane Broncos and State of Origin games when it hosts its first Women\u2019s World Cup match between England\u2019s Lionesses and Haiti on 22 July. Among the older stadiums being used in the tournament, Brisbane Stadium\u2019s storied history has reflected the growth of the city since the early 20th century. The site was Brisbane\u2019s main cemetery until it was set aside for recreation in 1914 and became Lang Park \u2013 a name it still carries unofficially today, though commercially it is Suncorp Stadium. After being used as a parade ground during the first world war it started regularly hosting sport: football, athletics and cycling. Rugby league came in the mid-1950s and oversaw the transformation from a public park to the specialised rectangular facility used today. The stadium has been significantly affected by flooding in the past, first in 1974, then in Brisbane\u2019s devastating 2010-11 floods and again in 2022. Women\u2019s football royalty will grace the pitch this tournament over four other group games, one round of 16 game, a quarter-final and the third-place playoff. Perth Rectangular Stadium, Perth/Boorloo Capacity: 13,932 Opened: 1910 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group D: Denmark v China, 22 July, 8pm (local time) Group B: Canada v Republic of Ireland, 26 July, 8pm Group F: Panama v Jamaica, 29 July, 8.30pm Group D: Haiti v Denmark, 1 August, 7pm Group H: Morocco v Colombia, 3 August, 6pm With the old Waca Ground and the state-of-the-art Optus Stadium in the city, Perth is not short of a famous sporting venue or two. But it is the less well-known rectangular stadium, HBF Park, that will take the spotlight during the World Cup. Located Close to the central business district and just a stone\u2019s throw away from the AFL and cricket ovals, HBF has a long and rich history. When it was constructed at the beginning of last century it served as an Australian rules football oval until redevelopment in 2004, and the ground is now home to Perth Glory\u2019s A-League teams (as well as Super Rugby\u2019s Western Force). International football has been played here before, though just three times, and only once in the women\u2019s game \u2013 in 2018 when the Matildas thrashed Thailand 5-0. While the likes of Pernille Harder and Christine Sinclair will grace the turf in the coming weeks, it was actually Harry Styles who was the last star to play here, performing a concert in February. But before Denmark and China become the next international acts to feature, the venue will undergo a major $32m (\u00a316m) upgrade of facilities, and further temporary fit-outs will be made to make it match ready. Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide/Tarntanya Capacity: 13,327 Opened: 1960 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group F: Brazil v Panama, 24 July, 8.30pm (local time) Group D: China v Haiti, 28 July, 8.30pm Group H: South Korea v Morocco, 30 July, 2pm Group D: China v England, 1 August, 8.30pm Round of 16: 1F v 2H, 8 August, 8.30pm Hindmarsh, better known as Coopers Stadium due to a naming rights sponsorship deal with the South Australian brewer, is the smallest of all the venues. Still, what it lacks in terms of seat numbers Coopers makes up with punch. Though it is also a live music venue it doesn\u2019t need a touring band to create a buzzing atmosphere, and on a good night the boutique stadium can rock \u2013 as main tenants Adelaide United can attest. And, with the likes of Brazil, England and China slated to play here over the coming weeks, that is unlikely to change. Hindmarsh has been hosting football matches since it opened in 1960 and several Olympic matches were played there in 2000 but it has also welcomed the All Blacks and hosted top-level rugby league including, briefly, NRL team the Adelaide Rams. A $53m (\u00a327m) development started two years ago has been completed in time for the tournament and the stadium now boasts a new east stand roof, improved lighting, big screens and other improvements. Eden Park, Auckland/T\u0101maki Makaurau Capacity: 40,536 Opened: 1900 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group A: New Zealand v Norway, 20 July, 7pm (local time) Group E: USA v Vietnam, 22 July, 1pm Group G: Italy v Argentina, 24 July, 6pm Group C: Spain v Zambia, 26 July, 7.30pm Group A: Norway v Philippines, 30 July, 7pm Group E: Portugal v USA, 1 August, 7pm Round of 16: 1A v 2C, 5 August, 5pm Quarter-final: 11 August, 7.30pm Semi-final: 15 August, 8pm New Zealand\u2019s national stadium, Eden Park, is the grandfather figure of the country\u2019s sporting grounds. Built on what was once a swampland, fed by lava from the now dormant nearby volcanoes, it has been a cricket and rugby ground in Auckland\u2019s central suburbs for more than a century. The stadium didn\u2019t host a professional club football match until 2011. But it has had a taste of international women\u2019s sport: the Football Ferns took on the US in front of more than 12,500 people \u2013 a record for a women\u2019s football game in New Zealand. And last year the final of the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup sold out \u2013 a first for a women\u2019s sporting event in the country. Eden Park will host some of the best-attended games of the tournament, including the opening match between New Zealand and Norway, as well as the opening ceremony. Dunedin Stadium, Dunedin/\u014ctepoti Capacity: 24,243 Opened: 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group A: Philippines v Switzerland, 21 July, 5pm (local time) Group E: Netherlands v Portugal, 23 July, 7.30pm Group C: Japan v Costa Rica, 26 July, 5pm Group G: Argentina v South Africa, 28 July, 12pm Group A: Switzerland v New Zealand, 30 July, 7pm Group E: Vietnam v Netherlands, 1 August, 7pm Forsyth Barr in Dunedin is New Zealand\u2019s largest indoor stadium and, as well as rugby or football matches, it plays host to large-scale music shows, including Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Fleetwood Mac. Nicknamed \u201cthe Glasshouse\u201d, it\u2019s in Dunedin, a university city with a student-led nightlife. For the brave, the west stand area \u2013 officially the Mitre 10 Mega Stand or unofficially \u201cthe Zoo\u201d \u2013 is frequently occupied by Otago\u2019s extensive student population, particularly for home rugby games, and is known for near-compulsory costumes, high-octane partying and general chaos. New Zealand\u2019s South Island has a far colder winter climate than the north, so rug up \u2013 although the stadium\u2019s roof does provide some shelter from the icier weather. Wellington Regional Stadium, Wellington/Te Whanganui-a-tara Capacity: 31,089 Opened: 2000 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group C: Spain v Costa Rica, 21 July, 7.30pm (local time) Group G: Sweden v South Africa, 23 July, 5pm Group A: New Zealand v Philippines, 25 July, 5.30pm Group E: USA v Netherlands, 27 July, 1pm Group G: Sweden v Italy, 29 July, 7.30pm Group C: Japan v Spain, 31 July, 7pm Group G: South Africa v Italy, 2 August, 7pm Round of 16: 1C v 2A, 5 August, 8pm Quarter-final: 11 August, 1pm Wellington Regional Stadium is affectionately known as \u201cthe Cake Tin\u201d for its circular shape and metal facade, and is planted on reclaimed land overlooking Wellington\u2019s harbour. It\u2019s one of the most accessible of the four New Zealand stadiums: next to the city train station, and only a short walk from the beating heart of Wellington\u2019s central city district, lined with restaurants, bars, cafes and vintage shopping. There is only one main entrance in or out \u2013 a design that can slow foot traffic but also adds to the party (or commiseratory) atmosphere. The stadium should be in top shape to host its seven group matches, a last 16 match and quarter-final, having just completed a NZ$4m (\u00a31.9m) revamp for the tournament, including a full pitch replacement, upgraded lighting, gender-neutral changing facilities and new entry turnstiles. Waikato Stadium, Hamilton/Kirikiriroa Capacity: 16,271 Opened: 2002 Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 fixtures Group C: Zambia v Japan, 22 July, 7pm (local time) Group A: Switzerland v Norway, 25 July, 8pm Group E: Portugal v Vietnam, 27 July, 7.30pm Group C: Costa Rica v Zambia, 31 July, 7pm Group G: Argentina v Sweden, 2 August, 7pm Unlike many of New Zealand\u2019s sporting arenas, Waikato Stadium is not built as an oval to also host cricket games \u2013 which means a tighter rectangular arrangement that places fans closer to the action. That makes it the most intimate football-watching environment of New Zealand\u2019s stadium offerings, with stands placed right above the pitch. A year after the stadium opened, a carved wooden Whatanoa gateway at its entrance was unveiled to commemorate the ancient Ngati Wairere Pa and burial ground near the site. Waikato Stadium has already played host to some of the World Cup women\u2019s teams \u2013 it hosted the intercontinental playoffs between the six regional confederations in February in which Panama and Portugal sealed their spots in the tournament. The ground has also played host to past under-17s and under-20s Women\u2019s World Cups."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/16/on-my-radar-anohni-cultural-highlights", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "On my radar: Anohni\u2019s cultural highlights", "lead": "The singer and artist on Marvin Gaye\u2019s masterpiece, the shameful price of peace in Afghanistan \u2013 and why Arnold Schwarzenegger is such a hoot", "author": "Killian Fox", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628343", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad2b04e4478bf6935b46e24dddbd5e826cc7ecf/0_505_4592_2756/500.jpg", "body": "The musician and visual artist Anohni was born in Chichester in 1971. She moved to California with her family aged 10 and to Manhattan in 1990 to study experimental theatre at NYU, getting involved in the New York performance scene and later forming Antony and the Johnsons. The band\u2019s self-titled debut album came out in 2000 and their follow-up, I Am a Bird Now, won the Mercury prize in 2005. After a decade-long hiatus, during which she released solo work and was nominated for an Academy Award, the band have reformed as Anohni and the Johnsons. Their sixth album, My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross, is out now. 1. TV Arnold (Netflix) I really like this ingeniously conceived biopic of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He\u2019s such a hoot! There\u2019s a great scene where he\u2019s like: \u201cI used to look in the mirror and see a bit of a droop under my pec, and I thought, \u2018Maybe I could get a surgery for that.\u2019 But now I\u2019m in my 70s and I\u2019m just trying to survive. When I look in the mirror I think, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019\u201d He had me so deeply when he said that, because that\u2019s how I feel. 2. Music What\u2019s Going On by Marvin Gaye This album, which had its 50th anniversary recently, has been such a huge influence on me, the way it summed up over 10 songs all these aspects of global brokenness. Gaye brought forth from a tradition of black American music the gorgeous, world-changing [power] of resilience in the face of untenable circumstances, and introduced a new template for a modern political, environmentally confrontational record. He spoke simple truths in simple language about what was really happening. It\u2019s as if it were written yesterday. 3. Photography The Price of Peace in Afghanistan by Mads Nissen In The World Press Photo yearbook 2023, there\u2019s a series of images from Afghanistan [by Danish photographer Mads Nissen]. One shows a group of women covered from head to toe, sitting outside a bread shop in early morning, begging for bread. I\u2019m thinking about the American occupation of Afghanistan over the past two decades and the children \u2013 the girls and the gay people especially \u2013 who grew up under that occupation with access to the internet and to a dream of potential freedom. And then America pulled out. My question is, what\u2019s happening to all those kids now? How is it that my country just walked away? It\u2019s disgusting. 4. Place Washington Square Park, Manhattan For the past 20 years, the police have had a brutal and fascistic presence in Washington Square Park. But since Covid they\u2019ve basically bailed on downtown Manhattan and gone to torment communities in the boroughs. As a result, young people started to gather in really fresh ways. Now kids from all over the city go to Washington Square Park and they\u2019re cross-pollinating. It\u2019s fascinating to go there again. It\u2019s like the way it might have been in the 1960s. It\u2019s the most interesting it\u2019s been since I first came to Manhattan in the early 90s. 5. Art Evolution of Fearlessness by Lynette Wallworth at the Muziekgebouw, Amsterdam I saw this installation at the Holland festival and it\u2019s really magic. Wallworth first showed it in 2006. She interviewed refugees from around the world living in Sydney, all women, and collected their stories in a book, where they described the unspeakable traumas they had endured. But in the installation there is no speaking. You see a projection of a woman slowly approaching a glass screen. She places her hand on the screen and you\u2019re invited to do the same, and she just looks at you in silence. It\u2019s really, really beautiful. 6. Hobby Water observation I like observing water in different capacities. I\u2019m made of 70% water, and if I get in the bathtub, a thing of 100% of water and I\u2019m 70% water\u2026 I like to observe that sometimes. But more importantly, I mean the movement of water, and the oceans. A few days ago it was reported that the North Sea is up to 5C hotter than it should be. This could lead to a mass die-off of fish and shellfish. A lot of people thought waters around the UK and Ireland wouldn\u2019t succumb [to the climate crisis], but they are. If the oceans die, there\u2019s not going to be much in the way of a future for any of us."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87d8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/its-not-just-the-food-we-missed-three-writers-remember-beloved-restaurants-that-closed-down", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s not just the food we missed\u2019: three writers remember beloved restaurants that closed down", "lead": "From student haunts to a first \u2018proper\u2019 meal out, why we mourn the places where we ate that are no longer with us", "author": "Rachel Cooke, Shahnaz Ahsan and Eva Wiseman", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628364", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d7bf5426367f14369e2059feeb6d7c4e59732029/0_228_1535_921/500.jpg", "body": "Hanrahan\u2019s, Sheffield On the surface of it, the problem was straightforward. Somehow, we\u2019d all made it to the sixth form, an elevation we thought so magnificent \u2013 oh, the grandness of being allowed to drink Nescaf\u00e9 in free periods! \u2013 it was surely only right now to mark it with a minor increase in sophistication come Friday night. But the question was: how? Clubbing was one thing. We were avid for that, and went dancing in town twice a week in our cliff-top shoulder pads and scratchy white shoes. The bigger drama was the matter of what to do first. No longer would the pub do: that slow eking out of our Cinzano and lemonades, the better that we might not conk out too early later (alas, I usually did conk out too early). A restaurant? For the longest time, the thought never occurred to us. For one thing, we had no money. For another, it was the 1980s and we lived in Sheffield. On the vaguely affordable side, there was curry and Chinese food, both of which were a bit too familiar to us to be fully glam, or there was Pizza Hut, which had at last opened a branch not far from where we lived. Pizza Hut was OK in our eyes \u2013 the words \u201cdeep pan\u201d were new and fresh and slightly thrilling then \u2013 but this branch was next door to Tesco in a small shopping precinct, which really crushed the vibe on our Dorothy Perkins earrings and sky-blue eyeliner. Beyond this \u2013 and to us, it was like staring out across an ocean \u2013 there were basically only two other options, both more expensive: a wine bar called Mr Kite\u2019s, where quiche was served and Phil Oakey out of the Human League had once been seen, and an American-style restaurant called Hanrahan\u2019s, where men with Buck\u2019s Fizz hairstyles and (I may have imagined this) salmon-pink ties served ridiculous cocktails to footballers (whose wives had not yet been invented), solicitors and dealers of secondhand Jaguars (ten bob millionaires, as they were known then). Of this pair, it was Hanrahan\u2019s that seemed to us like a place worth saving up for, and henceforth it was our chosen venue for the celebration of birthdays and particularly significant events on the boy front; I used the money I earned in my Saturday job at Boots. Housed in a redbrick Georgian building that had once been a nurses\u2019 home, it was close to the university, which made it cool in our eyes (we were always eyeing the Union up hopefully), and though we inevitably laughed as we ordered A Slow Comfortable Screw Against The Wall \u2013 in case you don\u2019t know, this is a long, Galliano-based drink \u2013 we hadn\u2019t yet learned to be sniffy about such delights. And we loved the menu, too, which encompassed modish offerings like club sandwiches and barbecue ribs. The sweet, sticky softness of those ribs! Every visit meant war for me. To order this dish was extremely hazardous if I was wearing my best white, sleeveless polo neck. On the other hand, not to order it felt like a crime \u2013 or perhaps I mean a punishment. Hanrahan\u2019s finally closed in 2008. The building briefly housed a Loch Fyne restaurant; the last I heard, it is to be converted into flats. Looking back, of course, I realise that it was completely unoriginal even during what I will call its heyday; hundreds of places just like it must have sprung up around the country about then, inspired by movies such as Desperately Seeking Susan, St Elmo\u2019s Fire and Cocktail. I expect, too, that if I tasted its menu now, I\u2019d pick holes in everything on it (all that iceberg lettuce and bottled thousand island dressing). But I loved it then, and in memory, I love it now. I miss those evenings out, every one of which offered the prospect of something, even if only a hangover; when we were so close and so relatively innocent, able to enjoy things so purely and sweetly. And I see in those nights, too, shades of the future me, a woman who would rather be in a restaurant with friends or the man she loves than doing just about anything else on earth (I said just about). Hanrahan\u2019s, in its small way, played a part in making me what I am today: a person who eats with her fingers should this be required, even if doing so brings with it the danger she will ruin her freshly laundered clothes. Rachel Cooke Aziz Pandesia, Oxford Aziz Pandesia opened in 2006, the same year that I arrived in Oxford as an undergraduate. On my first day, after my parents had helped me unload bags and boxes into my tiny single bedroom with its brown carpet and college-issued bedlinen, my dad pressed a \u00a320 note into my hand. \u201cGet a deshi takeaway for dinner,\u201d he instructed as we all tried not to cry. Then he and my mum drove the 200 miles back to the Aire Valley in West Yorkshire, leaving me alone and already homesick. I didn\u2019t get a Bangladeshi takeaway that night, deciding instead to meet other freshers in the dining hall. But the south Asian restaurants of Oxford did become a source of comfort during my time as a student: Chutneys in the city centre, Mirch Masala on Cowley Road, but none more so than the Aziz Pandesia. The whitewashed, glass-fronted building stood elegantly on Folly Bridge in south Oxford, complete with decked pontoon where diners watched boats and swans sail by as they enjoyed the upmarket Bangladeshi and \u201cpan-Asian\u201d menu. Crucially, Aziz Pandesia was a few minutes\u2019 walk away from college accommodation in my second and third year. It was where I went when I craved a taste of something close to home. The Bangladeshi dishes were familiar enough, the waiters came to know me and I began to visit as much for the warmth and welcome as the food. Being on a budget, the restaurant was a treat, but on visits back home my dad would slip me another \u00a320 before I got the return train and I\u2019d oblige with dinner from Aziz Pandesia that evening. My obsession rubbed off on my housemates. We all remember our old orders: mine was a chicken pathia, deliciously hot and sweet; Leah went for the same but with prawns. Mary opted for the lamb bhuna and mishti naan and Rosie was keen on lamb rogan josh. To save money we would order the mains as takeaways, cooking our own rice in the college kitchen. We celebrated Anne\u2019s 21st birthday there, and the end of our final exams. It felt especially fancy, with white tablecloths, heavy cutlery and glass jugs that we constantly asked to be refilled with tap water. I was too shy to speak to staff in Bangla though now I wish I had tried and been able to communicate just how much the place had come to mean to me over the years. I moved away after graduating and never had a chance to visit again. Soon after I left, Aziz Pandesia became a Mediterranean restaurant called Riviera, after a back and forth with the council over opening hours for the pontoon led it to be sublet to a new restaurateur. A sister restaurant on Cowley Road, known simply as Aziz, later moved to Headington. Today, 1 Folly Bridge is home to The Folly, offering river cruises alongside a modern British menu of salt-baked cauliflower and lamb pav\u00e9. On a recent visit back to Oxford I thought about making a pilgrimage down Abingdon Road and over Folly Bridge to revisit my student halls, the place I met some of my closest friends, and the man I eventually ended up marrying. I imagined seeing myself in the common room watching Neighbours, cooking with friends on the two hotplates we called a kitchen, or perhaps even bumping into myself on the walk back from Aziz Pandesia with change from a \u00a320, clutching a white plastic bag with a takeaway container inside so hot that I feared the bag would melt on to it. I didn\u2019t go in the end; the memories are vivid enough to sustain me. Shahnaz Ahsan Water Margin, London Pork, duck, rice. Choi sum. Wonton soup. Chinese tea. At the end, the waiter would bring a plate of orange segments in their skin, as if we needed to hydrate after playing a game of football, and we would lurch out into Golders Green as if we\u2019d won the cup. I hadn\u2019t realised the significance the first time my boyfriend took me to Water Margin, a Chinese restaurant he\u2019d been visiting with his family since the mid-80s. It was like a proposal, I see now, like handing me a key. We ordered the food his dad had always ordered, we had the fabulous time they\u2019d always had. I must have been in my earliest 20s and still new to restaurants then. White tablecloths and waiters, they still hold that glorious allure for me, but back then the glamour was almost overwhelming. I went to restaurants on special occasions only, while his family went on regular Sunday nights, or when his mum didn\u2019t feel like cooking. To pop, casually, to a foreign high street for a \u201cbite to eat\u201d, I loved it, I still love it, it\u2019s one of the things in my life that I love the most. I say foreign \u2013 though Golders Green was close to where I grew up, and paved with Jewish bakeries, Jewish shops, a Starbucks teeming with the big girls from school, it remained unfamiliar and largely closed off to me, a secular Jew. A Cantonese restaurant, with its char siu pork, would open it up to me, in that way that good restaurants do. In the US there\u2019s a Jewish tradition of Chinese food \u2013 the Jewish way of celebrating Christmas, for example, is in the safety of a Chinese restaurant where not only are you with other outsiders but the food is more likely to be kosher \u2013 there\u2019s very little dairy, so no mixing of milk and meat. Plus the pork and prawns were usually cut up finely and hidden inside a dumpling, so you could argue plausible deniability. Here in Golders Green, a suburb famous for its Jewish communities, was the first place I noticed that particular mixing in the UK, and it was quietly thrilling. We went to Water Margin a lot after that. We went by ourselves, we went with his family, we went with my family, we went all together. We saw Vanessa Feltz there a few times, which was funny. We went with our friends, later we went with our tiny daughter, who would calmly rip the fat from the duck and suck the orange segments dry. And then one day, it closed. No warning. The sign stayed up. We tried visiting a couple of times, calling, closed. In 2016 Feltz wrote an obituary to the restaurant in the Daily Express, saying her family had been eating there since 1976. \u201cYou know how when your grandma or mother passes away and you gradually realise you\u2019ll never taste their apple strudel or yorkshire pudding again? After 40 years \u2026 I feel a very similar sense of loss and even existential despair. Without warning or explanation our beloved Water Margin has closed its doors. We will never taste its like again.\u201d How do you describe the grief for a closed down restaurant? What is the word for it? I\u2019ve mourned too many in my life now, I\u2019ve had too many last meals. Places like the cathedral to chips and Formica, the New Piccadilly cafe at the bottom of Soho, which closed in 2007, or my boyfriend\u2019s restaurant Monty\u2019s Deli, which died during Covid (I type now surrounded by his hand-painted refreshments signs), or countless coffee shops which hosted the significant conversations and desserts of my life, knocked down to make way for a nice new Pret. I\u2019ve seen from the inside how hard it is to keep a restaurant open, how rising rent and rates and food costs eat away at your profits, and how labour shortages eat away at staff \u2013 it\u2019s the worst time in recent history to run a restaurant, so it\u2019s no wonder so many shut. And I feel for the owners, in debt and in trouble, but I feel for the patrons too, when one of our places disappears. It\u2019s not just the food we miss, it\u2019s the sense of walking in and feeling held by something tight and good, the shitty music, the warmth after the rain outside. And the cutleried stages where those conversations played out, where traditions formed, the manager cooing over a baby, or quickly building a table for six. As the industry wobbles, won\u2019t someone please think of us diners, grieving our way down glassy high streets, mourning a bowl of soup?

They\u2019ve been around for at least 100 million years in one variety or another, with their main party trick \u2013 hanging around until they can latch a host to feed on \u2013 working on thousands of different animals across almost endless environments. But how concerned should you be about them in the UK? You won\u2019t miss the blood they take, but they can cause a variety of unpleasant conditions in their hosts \u2013 and there\u2019s some evidence that their population is growing. Just so we\u2019re all on the same page, there are at least 900 species of ticks currently operating across every continent \u2013 some targeting seabirds and lizards, others cattle or dogs. Ticks sense vibrations and body heat, and will find a good place to wait for a host, then latch on to it, finding a patch of skin where the animal\u2019s blood vessels run close to the surface and where it\u2019s hard to be scratched away. At this point, it digs in and inserts its barbed, tubular mouthpart \u2013 sometimes secreting attachment \u201ccement\u201d to make itself harder to remove. In between slurps, it squirts saliva into the wound, containing a protein that prevents the host\u2019s blood from clotting. It\u2019s this saliva that causes a lot of tick-related issues, not only by transmitting pathogens, but by countering the host\u2019s own bodily responses in ways that can be harmful. Shutting down pain receptors and the immune system is helpful for ticks, for example, but for hosts, it can lead to serious problems. \u201cLyme disease, probably the condition most strongly associated with ticks, is a bacterial infection, which might affect as many as 5,000 people each year in the UK,\u201d says Dr Tim Brooks, head of the rare and imported pathogens laborator (RIPL). \u201cThe most common symptom is a spreading, bulls-eye rash at the site of the tick bite, which typically develops up to a month after being bitten, but other symptoms include a non-specific flu-like illness, a facial droop, nerve pains and numbness or tingling in the hands or feet.\u201d More recently, ticks have also been found in the UK carrying tick-borne encephalitis, or TBE, which can cause a range of diseases, from a completely asymptomatic infection or mild flu-like illness, all the way to severe infection in the central nervous system such as meningitis or swelling of the brain. More information about symptoms can be found on the NHS website. TBE has been prevalent in many parts of the world, including several European countries, but was first detected in ticks in England in 2019. Cases in humans in the UK have been \u2013 so far \u2013 thankfully rare. In 2017, former England rugby captain Matt Dawson had to undergo heart surgery after a tick bite. So, is there more cause for concern now? It\u2019s tough to say. \u201cSince data collection began in 2005, there has been a general trend of increasing cases of laboratory-confirmed Lyme disease,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cThat rise may be due to a combination of increased awareness as well as improved surveillance, and better access to diagnostics \u2013 but it may also be related to increased potential for encounters with ticks due to changes in wildlife populations and habitat modification that may have resulted in changes in tick distribution across the country.\u201d At the same time, ticks don\u2019t move around much by themselves, and this works in your favour if you\u2019re trying to avoid them. \u201cThe most common UK tick species, the deer/sheep ticks, survive in many habitats, but prefer moist areas with dense ground level vegetation, which can be found in woodland, grassland, moorland, heathland and some urban parks and gardens,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cThey don\u2019t fly or jump. They wait on vegetation for a host to pass by, and then climb on \u2013 so while walking in green spaces, consider wearing clothing that covers your skin to make it more difficult for ticks to access a suitable place to bite, using insect repellent such as DEET and wearing light-coloured clothing so that you can easily spot ticks and brush them off.\u201d It\u2019s also not disastrous if one does manage to sink its fangs \u2013 well, mouthpart \u2013 into you. \u201cOn average, approximately 4% of ticks are infected with the bacteria that can cause Lyme disease in England and Wales,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cBut the presence of the bacteria in a tick doesn\u2019t automatically mean that the person will be infected, especially if the tick is removed promptly.\u201d After spending time outside, it\u2019s worth giving yourself and your pets \u2013 or children \u2013 a once-over for ticks: data from the UK Health Security Agency\u2019s (UKHSA) Tick Surveillance Scheme shows that adults are commonly bitten on the legs, while children are commonly bitten around the head or neck. If you do find an unwanted passenger, removing it with a tick removal tool or fine-tipped tweezers can mitigate the risk of infection. And, if you start to experience symptoms, remember that rashes only occur in roughly two-thirds of cases of Lyme disease: contact your GP for antibiotics to fend it off. Try not to use ticks as an excuse to stay on the beaten track, however. Research suggests there are enormous benefits to getting out in nature, with forests, in particular helping to mitigate everything from anxiety to depression. Ticks might have made an evolutionary success of sitting around snacking for most of the time, but you don\u2019t have to."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87db", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/16/lauren-spencer-smith-mirror-review-quiet-loud-gen-z-pop-angst", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lauren Spencer Smith: Mirror review \u2013 quiet-loud Gen Z pop angst", "lead": "The young Canadian\u2019s debut holds tight to the formula of her TikTok hit Fingers Crossed, with a few nice rough edges thrown in", "author": "Michael Cragg", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628419", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a8c0a655f432509f1c74ff3f33a9f3c52d2ef950/145_930_5423_3252/500.jpg", "body": "Early last year, Portsmouth-born, Canada-raised 19-year-old Lauren Spencer Smith scored a TikTok-assisted global hit with Fingers Crossed, a musically delicate, lyrically damning takedown of a useless ex with a serious case of daddy issues.

Crisscrossing both centuries and continents in a programme with the natural world as its theme, different compositional treatments of the four seasons offered a connecting thread. And, yes, that immediately spells Vivaldi, though not as you\u2019d assume. It\u2019s common practice for new commissions to be partner pieces to particular pieces in the repertoire, but Anna Meredith\u2019s 2016 piece for the Scottish Ensemble Anno took elements of Vivaldi\u2019s four ultra-familiar concertos and created a sequence of 16 movements, interpolating her own distinctive blend of acoustic and surround electronics. While the original composition featured coordinated visuals by Meredith\u2019s sister Eleanor, here Cheltenham\u2019s Town Hall stage had a back wall of greenery, decorously arranged on the raked seating behind the players, with lighting used to atmospheric effect. Meredith\u2019s approach is not simply a matter of taking Vivaldi clubbing: it\u2019s playful but not irreverent, occasionally sentimental and, at 55 minutes, somewhat over-indulgent. At its most elemental, the music\u2019s progress from the light of the spring solstice to that of dark winter seemed to connect to the primeval energies associated with those turnings of the year. Among the most striking interventions were the thunder of summer and the glacial wintry chill, where brittle harpsichord combined with electronically generated sounds to colour the aural landscape. Scottish Ensemble leader Jonathan Morton was the vibrant soloist, in sync with Meredith herself presiding over the electronics. The evening had opened with Astor Piazzolla\u2019s moody Primavera Porte\u00f1a from The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires, a neat foil for the following sequence of short pieces. Jessie Montgomery\u2019s lively Starburst was framed by extracts from Caroline Shaw\u2019s Evergreen album, with Joanna Marsh\u2019s In Winter\u2019s House offering a parallel to the final Vivaldi. October from Tchaikovsky\u2019s piano suite The Seasons, arranged for strings by David Matthews, was impeccably played, carrying a wistfulness that contrasted well with the ebb and flow of Fredrik Sj\u00f6lin\u2019s Shore and the foot-stamping exuberance of a traditional Swedish polska."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87dd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/england-set-to-recall-jimmy-anderson-for-fourth-ashes-test", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England set to recall Jimmy Anderson for fourth Ashes Test", "lead": "Jimmy Anderson is expected to win a recall this week as England head into their must-win fourth Ashes Test on his home ground of Old Trafford", "author": "Ali Martin", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 13:49:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628455", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/accb6a512f7e966ab461fc6d2a199ad75f6199b7/274_412_3223_1935/500.jpg", "body": "Jimmy Anderson is expected to win a recall this week as England head into their must-win fourth Ashes Test on his home ground of Old Trafford.

These concerns are not shared by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, however, with sources saying Anderson is \u201call but certain\u201d to play in the fourth Test that gets under way on Wednesday. England must level the series at 2-2 and set up what would be a blockbuster decider at the Oval. Ollie Robinson appears the likeliest to make way here, having been a passenger for much of the third Test after the back spasms he experienced on day one. The 29-year-old has declared himself \u201c100% fit\u201d since, however, and will be looking to prove this when England\u2019s players resume training on Monday after a seven-day break. Josh Tongue is the other spare seamer in the squad and impressed with five wickets in his solitary outing at Lord\u2019s. But unless England believe the Old Trafford pitch requires a second outright fast bowler alongside Mark Wood, there is likely to be only one change, with a decision over who bats at No 3 \u2013 Harry Brook, Moeen Ali or Joe Root \u2013 to follow. It may prove to be Anderson\u2019s final outing at Old Trafford, even if England\u2019s record Test wicket-taker has remained tight-lipped on any possible retirement plans. Stuart Broad has also offered a defence of his new-ball partner\u2019s early series form, insisting a badly timed groin injury in the buildup and the two pitches prepared were to blame. \u201cAt Lord\u2019s, we had six of the best bowlers in the world bowling cross-seam bouncers, which tells you all you need to know about what the pitch was offering from a good length,\u201d Broad wrote in the Mail on Sunday. \u201cBut Jimmy has been one of the world\u2019s best bowlers for a long time and he can put those issues behind him. He\u2019s bowled goodness knows how many overs at Old Trafford and I\u2019m expecting a big performance from him in a high-pressure game.\u201d All eyes will be on the weather forecast over the coming week.

The study, led by London South Bank University (LSBU), explored in what settings vapes could help those addicted to smoking give up the habit. After three months, a quarter had quit and a further 13% reduced their cigarette consumption by more than half. The research showed that those who received help to choose a vape flavour and got supportive messages were 55% more likely to give up in three months than those who did not get these services. Lynne Dawkins, a professor of nicotine and tobacco studies at LSBU, said: \u201cSmoking kills approximately 8 million people worldwide every year and even some of the often most effective treatments have little effect on reducing the number of smokers. From this treatment, 24.5% were smoke-free after three months and a further 13% had reduced their cigarette consumption by more than 50%. \u201cThe simplicity of tailored support through flavour advice and supportive messages could have a huge impact in helping people lead smoke-free lives.\u201d The research examined five approaches to try to increase the number of people who stop smoking after receiving an e-cigarette bought online. The interventions used were: tailored advice on which product, nicotine strength or flavour to buy; brief information on vaping harms relative to smoking; and text message support. Some people received all of these, others received none and some received some but not all. Advice on product, nicotine strength or providing information on vaping harms relative to smoking did not improve quitting rates. The study, delivered in collaboration with partners from University College London (UCL), University of East Anglia (UEA) and University of New South Wales (UNSW), recruited 1,214 participants through social media. Earlier in the year, the government announced that 1 million smokers would be offered vape starter kits as part of a \u201cswap to stop\u201d scheme to make the nation \u201csmoke-free\u201d. The kits will be offered to almost one in five of all smokers in England as part of a push that is the first of its kind in the world, the health minister Neil O\u2019Brien said. Officials said this was the first scheme of its kind to be rolled out nationwide, with those hoping to swap offered a choice of products, strengths and flavours. The scheme will cost about \u00a345m over two years, which will come from the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s budget. Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cVapes increase smokers\u2019 chances of successfully quitting, as do vouchers for pregnant smokers, so these are welcome steps in the right direction, but they are nowhere near sufficient.\u201d Concern has been raised that a big push is needed if the pledge to get the nation smoke-free by 2030 \u2013 equating to getting smoking rates to less than 5% \u2013 is to be met."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87df", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/16/rmt-mick-lynch-government-not-contacted-him-since-january", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "RMT leader says government has not contacted him since January", "lead": "RMT leader downplays prospects of a resolution to dispute over pay, jobs and conditions", "author": "Haroon Siddique", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 13:38:43", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628490", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b90f123a7010ebcec63e6af1817f616c58c16db3/0_116_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The RMT leader, Mick Lynch, has claimed he has not met a government minister since January as he downplayed prospects of a resolution to the long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. The next strike by members of the of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union takes place on Thursday, with strikes also scheduled for Saturday and 29 July. About 20,000 station staff, train managers and catering staff across 14 operation companies will be involved in the action, with passengers advised to check their travel arrangements. Asked about the RMT\u2019s relationship with the government amid recent signs of settlement of some public sector pay disputes, Lynch told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: \u201c[There has been] no contact. They seem to pick out the RMT as a special category where they can\u2019t negotiate on a reasonable basis. \u201cWe\u2019re available to talk to them, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met a government minister since January, and even the employers now have stopped negotiating.\u201d Teachers\u2019 unions and the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, have welcomed recent pay offers but other public sector workers, such as junior doctors and consultants, have said the below-inflation rises do not go far enough. Lynch said: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re waiting for all this other stuff to be cleared out the way. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be settlements yet \u2013 they\u2019re out for referendum and consultation with their members, we\u2019ll see. \u201cThey\u2019ve certainly offered the others more than we\u2019ve been offered. There\u2019s no strings attached to those deals; we\u2019ve got to accept a whole host of change and dilution to those terms and conditions, and job losses.\u201d Train operators this month began the process of closing railway station ticket offices, with hundreds planned to shut across England, enraging the RMT, for which it has been a sticking point in its dispute with the companies. While members of the union who are at Network Rail voted in March to accept a 9% pay offer over two years, the union\u2019s executive has rejected a similar pay offer from train operators, with temporary guarantees over job security regarded as insufficient as many existing roles are set to be scrapped. Lynch, who said strikes would continue until an agreement was reached, also said Labour should be putting \u201cclear water\u201d between its party, the Conservatives and the rightwing press when it came to workers suffering as a result of the cost of living crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Labour and others can\u2019t show that they\u2019re distinct from the kind of consensus that\u2019s got us into this trouble where working people are struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost of living crisis seems to be ignored by the political class to a certain extent.\u201d Talking to Ridge about the public sector pay offers, Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cI think the government\u2019s got to recognise \u2013 I think it has recognised \u2013 its early approach was completely wrong. And actually the lack of respect they\u2019ve shown for a lot of the public sector, I think, has been one of the aggravating factors in the industrial action we\u2019ve seen.\u201d Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, is also taking industrial action this week. Members at 16 companies will refuse to work overtime from Monday to Saturday inclusive. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThis government has played its part by facilitating fair and reasonable pay offers that would see generous increases for rail workers. Union leaders should stop blocking their members from having a vote on these offers and give them the chance to help resolve this dispute.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87e0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/16/desantis-reduces-campaign-staff", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "DeSantis reduces staff as campaign struggles to meet fundraising goals \u2013 report", "lead": "Fewer than 10 staffers were laid off, Politico reports, as more shake-ups within campaign are expected in coming weeks", "author": "Michael Sainato", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 13:37:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628510", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/39719aafa24aa2376cc8e4639b010c23e293f281/0_99_4986_2992/500.jpg", "body": "Florida governor and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has reduced campaign staff as his campaign has struggled to meet fundraising goals.

Two senior campaign advisers, Dave Abrams and Tucker Obenshain, left the campaign this past week to assist a pro-DeSantis nonprofit group. Sources within the campaign reported an internal assessment that the campaign hired too many staffers too early. \u201cThey never should have brought so many people on; the burn rate was way too high,\u201d said one Republican source familiar with the campaign\u2019s thought process to NBC News. \u201cPeople warned the campaign manager but she wanted to hear none of it.\u201d More shake-ups within the campaign are expected in the coming weeks after two months on the presidential campaign, with DeSantis still lagging substantially in second place behind former president Donald Trump.

His campaign has spent significantly on a payroll of 90 staffers and fundraising efforts, including over $900,000 on merchandise, $883,000 on digital consulting, $867,000 on media placements and $730,000 on direct mail. DeSantis faced scrutiny this week following an investigation by the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times reported several veterans resigned and reported abuse within Florida\u2019s state guard training, likening training to a militia for the civilian disaster relief force. The governor reactivated the state guard in 2022 after it had been dormant since the end of the second world war. In May, DeSantis signed a bill to expand the state guard and make it permanent, expanding the group from 400 to 1,500 members and expanding its budget from $10m to $107.6m."}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87e1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-obituary", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jane Birkin obituary", "lead": "Singer and actor who duetted with Serge Gainsbourg on Je T\u2019aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus in 1969 and went on to a prolific film career", "author": "Ryan Gilbey", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 13:35:33", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 15:39:49.628529", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e1cfe79ccd629998b30d5677524bbe438b1988ac/176_17_1694_1016/500.jpg", "body": "The sultry 1969 hit single Je T\u2019aime \u2026 Moi Non Plus was a four-and-a-half-minute distillation of languid Gallic cool, in which a Frenchman, his voice coarsened by Gitanes, is heard billing and cooing with an ecstatically sighing young Englishwoman over the swirling motif of a baroque organ. That man was Serge Gainsbourg; his companion was Jane Birkin, the actor and singer, who has died aged 76. Though Birkin worked with some of the world\u2019s finest film-makers, including Jacques Rivette and Agn\u00e8s Varda, she knew that Je T\u2019aime \u2026 would be remembered above everything else she did. \u201cWhen I die, that\u2019ll be the tune they play, as I go out feet first,\u201d she said. Birkin was 21 when she and Gainsbourg met while starring together in the film Slogan (1969). He was 40, and had previously recorded Je T\u2019aime \u2026 as a duet with Brigitte Bardot, only for the actor to withdraw permission for it to be released. Birkin had already starred in a 1965 musical, Passion Flower Hotel, scored by John Barry, whom she married that year at the age of 19 and from whom she was divorced in 1968; he was the father of Kate, the first of Birkin\u2019s three daughters. But it was on the duet with Gainsbourg, she said, that for the first time \u201csomebody thought I had a pretty voice\u201d. She sang her part an octave higher than Bardot. \u201cIt gave it a choirboy side that [Gainsbourg] liked a lot,\u201d she said. Rumours that the vocal track was recorded under the covers during a moment of intimacy were untrue (the couple were standing at separate microphones in a studio in central London) though they did nothing to harm the mythology surrounding a song that was later condemned by the Vatican. \u201cI just remember thinking it was all terribly funny,\u201d she said. Among the countries that refused to give the song airplay was Britain, where it became the first banned single to reach the top of the charts, as well as the first non-English-language No 1. It was also the lead track on the 1969 album Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg. Birkin\u2019s life remained inextricably linked to his. They were together for 11 years, and had a daughter, Charlotte, who became a successful singer and actor. Even after they separated in 1980, he continued to write for her, and she went on performing his songs for the rest of her life. Far from being an adjunct to Gainsbourg\u2019s legend, she possessed her own style, intelligence and attitude. Her wistful beauty was rendered unorthodox by an eager, gap-toothed smile. Her voice was as bewitching as her face: though she lived in France from 1969 onwards, and spoke French fluently, she never shed her breathy, crisply English accent. She was born in London to Judy Campbell, an actor who had been a muse to No\u00ebl Coward, and David Birkin, who was a lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy and a spy during the second world war. His duties included taking British spies across the Channel to France and bringing back stranded airmen and escaped prisoners of war. Jane was educated at Upper Chine school on the Isle of Wight. At 17 she starred with Ralph Richardson in Graham Greene\u2019s play Carving a Statue; Greene himself had a hand in casting her. Her screen acting career began with a walk-on part in The Knack \u2026 and How to Get It (1965) and a controversial nude scene in Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s Blow-Up, which she agreed to because Barry had told her she wouldn\u2019t dare. She had a small role in the Warren Beatty caper Kaleidoscope (also 1966), played a model called Penny Lane in the psychedelic curiosity Wonderwall (1968) and starred with Romy Schneider and Alain Delon in the psychological thriller La Piscine (1969). She got on famously with Bardot when they starred together in Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973). Gainsbourg directed her in a 1976 film named after their hit song; he cast her as a boyish woman who attracts the attentions of a gay man, played by the Warhol regular Joe Dallesandro. Birkin was tremendous fun in two star-studded Agatha Christie thrillers, Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982). In the cryptic Love on the Ground (1984), Rivette cast her and Geraldine Chaplin as actors drawn into a playwright\u2019s mysterious world. She appeared in two films, The Pirate (1984) and Comedy! (1987), made by her then partner, Jacques Doillon, with whom she had her third daughter, Lou, also a singer and actor. Jean-Luc Godard directed her in Keep Your Right Up (also 1987), while for Varda she played a woman besotted with a 14-year-old boy in Kung-Fu Master! (1988); the film co-starred Charlotte and featured Lou, and was inspired by an idea by Birkin herself. In the same year, Varda made her the subject of Jane B For Agn\u00e8s V, in which the actor performed a variety of specially scripted scenes (in one, she was a Stan Laurel type, in another a cockney mother) interspersed with musings on her life. She received the documentary treatment once again when her daughter directed Jane By Charlotte (2021). Her two most impressive performances came in Bertrand Tavernier\u2019s These Foolish Things, aka Daddy Nostalgie (1990), in which she was moving as a woman trying to repair her relationship with her dying father (Dirk Bogarde); and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), Rivette\u2019s spellbinding four-hour study of a painter (Michel Piccoli) and his new muse (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art), in which Birkin played the artist\u2019s wife and former model, who must deal with the indignity of having her younger self literally painted over. Later films included Alain Resnais\u2019s musical On Conna\u00eet la Chanson (1997) and the Merchant-Ivory coming-of-age story A Soldier\u2019s Daughter Never Cries (1998). In 2002 Birkin was diagnosed with leukaemia, but by 2006 she had made her directorial debut with the autobiographical family drama Boxes, which she also wrote and starred in, along with Chaplin, Piccoli, John Hurt and her daughter Lou. She appeared in Rivette\u2019s final film, Around a Small Mountain (2009), played herself in Hong Sang-soo\u2019s Nobody\u2019s Daughter Haewon, and was reunited with Tavernier for his comedy The French Minister (also 2013). Her look had been widely applauded in the 1960s, and seemed never to go out of date. In the 80s Herm\u00e8s introduced a large and exorbitantly priced leather bag, named \u201cthe Birkin\u201d in her honour. Fashion journalists in recent years could still be heard celebrating the \u201cJane Birkin top\u201d, referring to the white lace dress made famous by her in the late 60s. \u201cReal life was what I was best at,\u201d she told Vogue magazine in 2016. \u201cI didn\u2019t have confidence in movie cameras or on stage. But I did have confidence in what I wanted in real life. If I wanted to be barefoot and wear a mackintosh, I would do it. I didn\u2019t give a hoot.\u201d It was at 40 that she finally discarded her youthful ing\u00e9nue image and performed her first live concert: \u201cI cut my hair off like a boy, I wore men\u2019s clothes. I only wanted people to hear the music and words. It was fantastic. And it was so frightening. Serge was there and he kept lighting his cigarette lighter to make everybody put their lighters on.\u201d That show was preserved on her 1987 album, Jane Birkin au Bataclan. She continued singing and recording into her old age; among her later albums is Birkin/Gainsbourg: Le Symphonique, from 2017, in which the couple\u2019s songs received new orchestral arrangements. In 2020 she published Munkey Diaries 1957-1982, containing diary entries addressed to her favourite cuddly toy from childhood, which she can be seen clutching on the cover of Gainsbourg\u2019s 1971 album Histoire de Melody Nelson. She buried the toy with him after his death in 1991. She is survived by Charlotte and Lou, and six grandchildren, and by her brother, Andrew, and sister, Linda.

In a presentation to suppliers at the end of last week, Tesco described the grocery market as moving from \u201cinflation to deflation\u201d and made clear that it wanted to get out in front of rival supermarkets by cutting prices more aggressively. The overview included charts showing a 50% drop in wholesale electricity prices, a 22% drop in plastic PET packaging prices, and an 84% fall in the cost of freight over the past year, according to the Sunday Times. The feedback from some suppliers was that Tesco was being \u201cselective\u201d because other costs, such as wages, were still rising. However, with the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain reviewing its ranges, companies that do not comply risk having their products dropped from its shelves. The move comes ahead of a week of intense scrutiny for supermarket and food industry chiefs, who have been stung by recent accusations of profiteering, with the consumer group Which? highlighting that grocery prices have risen by more than 25% over the past two years. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics will publish inflation data for June, which is expected to show the headline rate eased to 8.2% from 8.7% in May \u2013 still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. On the same day, Asda\u2019s billionaire co-owner Mohsin Issa, and Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, will be grilled by MPs on the outlook for food and fuel prices. In recent months, the rising cost of food and drink has been one of the reasons why inflation remains stubbornly high. The Which? grocery inflation tracker, based on the prices of 25,000 products across eight supermarkets, recorded 15.4% for the 12 months to June, down from 16.5% in May. The average across all eight big chains on a two-year basis is 25.8%. In the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Issa wrote to MPs, stating that he expected food inflation to ease further during the UK\u2019s summer growing season. He warned, though, that fixed-term contracts meant it would take between three and nine months for falling prices to feed through to consumers. MPs are keen to grill Issa on the cost of fuel on Asda\u2019s forecourts, after a recent investigation by the UK\u2019s competition watchdog revealed that in 2022 drivers paid about 6p a litre more than they would have done otherwise as retailers increased profit margins. This ran contrary to evidence given by an Asda executive in a previous session, who said it was not doing anything differently. A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re working \u2026 with suppliers to mitigate the impact of inflation as much as we can, particularly as some commodity and input prices begin to fall. When we see opportunities to pass on savings to customers, we\u2019ll take them.\u201d Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said that after two years of sky-high inflation, during which energy, labour, commodity, farm, and transport costs all rose significantly, it was \u201clittle surprise\u201d that prices were higher than two years ago. \u201cIn recent weeks we have seen the prices of some key staples, such as butter and bread, begin to fall, as fierce competition between retailers continues to help customers get the best value in their weekly shop,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, retailers continue to invest heavily in lower prices, locking the price of many essentials, and providing discounts for vulnerable groups.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b544a551ac3327138d87e3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/labour-changes-little-power-social-forces-councillors-climate", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Keir Starmer is threatening to leave our crises unchanged.

As everything falls apart, Labour\u2019s leadership would like us to believe that the metaphorical cavalry is now on its way, bringing common sense, competence and the promise of change. There is only one problem: when it gets here, we are told, its weapons will be rusty, many of its horses are likely to be knackered \u2013 and whatever the urgent challenges it will be confronted with, its commanders may well begin by doing precious little of any consequence. For the last few weeks, senior Labour figures have been repeating the same message at an ever-louder volume: about the supposedly impossible state of the public finances, fiscal restraint and their determination to avoid any big tax and spending changes until the economy is thriving \u2013 which may take a very long time indeed. Their party\u2019s \u00a328bn-a-year climate investment pledge has already been scaled back and delayed. Now, while acknowledging the huge crises that grip health, education and no end of local services, they tell us that any expectations of urgent help must be damped down. \u201cThe only thing worse than no hope is false hope,\u201d says Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary. Instead, we must trust shadow ministers\u2019 good intentions, and their claim that the main answer has to be \u201creform\u201d, whatever that means. The definitive statement of this position arrived today, in the form of an Observer article by Keir Starmer. \u201cEverywhere you look \u2026 things are broken,\u201d wrote the Labour leader, but 13 years of austerity went pretty much unmentioned. \u201cThis is what happens when a government loses control of the economy,\u201d he insisted, a contention that led on to a familiar emphasis on \u201ciron-clad fiscal rules\u201d, followed by a telling-off: \u201cFrankly, the left has to start caring a lot more about growth, about creating wealth, attracting inward investment and kickstarting a spirit of enterprise.\u201d Starmer is relatively new to politics: his understanding of his own side\u2019s history and essential political theologies often seems flimsy and cliched. So, by way of a reminder: whoever is in charge of it, the basic reason his party is different from the Conservatives lies in its century-old understanding that when it comes to poverty, inequality and all our other enduring social ills, \u201cgrowth\u201d, the animal spirits of the financial markets and the \u201cspirit of enterprise\u201d tend to offer insufficient answers, to say the least. The public sector exists for precisely that reason, and when it is in crisis, the fundamental reason is always to do with political choices to starve it of money. Here, though, Starmer offers another ideological about-turn: an insistence that what is needed is \u201creform\u201d \u2013 not just because there is allegedly no new funding available, but because even if there was, to spend it would be to \u201csimply service failure\u201d. Those last three words are quite something: given what they seem to say about our public services and the people who work in them, he and his people may yet regret using them. But they are the apparent basis of a newfound belief: that those services have to be \u201cmodern, innovative and focused squarely on the people who use them\u201d. This somewhat strange point \u2013 are there really schools not \u201cfocused\u201d on their pupils, or hospitals not oriented around their patients? \u2013 is a thin echo of the kind of rhetoric Tony Blair began to use at the start of his second term, when he talked about \u201cre-designing the system round the user\u201d. But whereas Blair\u2019s visions led on to specific \u2013 and often disastrous \u2013 changes, apart from his mentions of better mental health provision for young people and using DNA-sequencing in medical treatment, Starmer and his team\u2019s plans are vague and platitudinous. Even if you accept that there might be something there, the fact that any reform takes years to introduce means they offer no solution to our current national collapse. One obvious example: in the wake of the government\u2019s refusal to fully fund the public sector pay rises announced last week, would Labour carry on meeting a huge chunk of the costs via budget cuts, or somehow find the money elsewhere? One last tension sits at the heart of Starmer\u2019s positioning. Is the problem that he won\u2019t be able to find extra funds, or that he doesn\u2019t really want to? Moves such as changing the rules on non-dom status and the end of the VAT exception for private schools pack a symbolic punch, but they will bring in comparatively small amounts of money. Seemingly closing down other potential sources of revenue, Starmer has signalled a U-turn on plans to put up income tax for high earners, while Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has indicated she will not heed calls to put up capital gains tax. To state the blindingly obvious, the economy\u2019s mixture of inflation and stagnation presents a confounding set of problems. But Labour seems to be responding to a moment full of urgency and political opportunity by energetically boxing itself in. All of which leads to a very interesting question: if Labour wins, what will it actually feel like? Whatever is in its manifesto, and irrespective of the narratives that Starmer does or doesn\u2019t campaign with, a victory will self-evidently be a huge moment, replete with at least a momentary sense of relief and euphoria. But on the current evidence, what Labour will actually do with power is less interesting than what the simple change in regime will trigger, whether Starmer and his allies like it or not. The last 13 years have been so full of underinvestment, cuts and serial cruelties that from the moment they take power, calls for change will be overwhelming. Along with the party\u2019s regional mayors, the Labour people who run councils, faced with a \u00a33bn funding gap over the next two years, will rightly demand greater financial autonomy, and a level of funding from Whitehall that at last begins to make up for the cuts that they are still being forced to inflict on their communities. Whatever Starmer\u2019s antipathy towards the green movement, its activists and organisations \u2013 such as Green New Deal Rising, whose supporters disrupted his recent speech on education \u2013 will sense the door being at least slightly more open, and push on it all the harder. As a weak economy continues to make the case for renewed ties with the EU, there may well be a revival of the movement that pushed for a second referendum on Brexit, this time focused on membership of the single market. More urgently, I can easily foresee the kind of community activists who have parried the worst aspects of the Conservatives\u2019 record on poverty and inequality \u2013 the people who run food banks, homeless shelters and all the rest \u2013 sooner or later making a great deal of noise about the intolerability of living with both a centre-left government and the continuation of such awful social problems. As things stand, I am not sure Starmer, Reeves and Streeting will have the policies, authority or political talent to tell all these forces to keep quiet, something that particularly applies to a re-energised trade union movement, whose grievances have hardly been silenced by recent moves on public sector pay. Back in May, I interviewed Pat Cullen, the indefatigable leader of the Royal College of Nursing, who is now loudly decrying the fact that NHS workers are to get \u201cthe lowest pay rise in the public sector\u201d. What, I wondered, did she want from a Labour government? \u201cI keep going back to the people I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see them earning a decent wage.\u201d The other thing she expected was a \u201clong-term investment plan to get the NHS back from the brink\u201d. And could she envisage more strikes when Labour is in power? Not for the first time, there was a glint of steely purpose. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being apolitical,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re not associated with any political party. It doesn\u2019t matter which government comes in. If they turn their back on nursing staff \u2013 as this government has done \u2013 absolutely we will.\u201d Right now, Labour is emphasising two contradictory ideas. With one voice, it tells us that we cannot go on like this; but it then changes register, and suggests that is exactly what we are going to have to do. The howling tension between the two brings to mind a celebrated quotation from the Welsh thinker and writer Raymond Williams: \u201cTo be truly radical is to make hope possible, rather than despair convincing.\u201d If Starmer and his team fail that test, they will only deserve all the noise and disruption that will thereby be let loose. So far, it has to be said, the signs are not good.

For decades, the film-maker and artist was much respected as the pioneering feminist voice in French cinema and as the \u201cgodmother of the Nouvelle Vague\u201d \u2013 New Wave \u2013 her work beating Jean-Luc Godard, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut et al to the big screen by several years. But she was also somewhat sidelined, eclipsed by her male peers, and it took until this century for her to be truly revered: last year, her 1962 classic Cl\u00e9o from 5 to 7 was ranked No 14 in the Sight &amp; Sound greatest films poll. But by the time she had begun to be deified, Varda was prone to sending herself up. She would appear on her film posters and DVD boxes in cartoon form as a quizzical, rotund Mrs Pepperpot figure; she even appeared at the Venice Biennale dressed as a potato. The latter guise, she once said, was because she loved the circus as a child. \u201cI thought I should do something to get attention.\u201d The clownish side of Varda, who died in 2019 at the age of 90, helped endear her to a new international public, as did her double self-reinvention this century: first as a digital documentarist with her groundbreaking The Gleaners and I (2000), then with her extraordinary late flourishing as an installation artist. Her installations included Patatutopia, a reverie on tubers at the 2003 Venice Biennale (hence the spud costume); and a remarkable tribute to her beloved island of Noirmoutier in western France (mixed media: photos, video, beach balls, a hut made entirely from celluloid strips of one of her films). Nude, Paris, 1954. What\u2019s often forgotten is that Varda, before turning to cinema, had already developed her own vision as a photographer. This year her black-and-white work from the early 1950s is celebrated by French photography festival Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles with the exhibition La Pointe Courte, From Photographs to Film. The show (and accompanying book) consists of images shot by Varda in La Pointe Courte, an area of the Mediterranean town of S\u00e8te, where she lived as a teenager. Varda returned to the area \u2013 then an impoverished fishing community \u2013 to take photos in preparation for her first feature, La Pointe Courte, which she shot in 1954, a daring formal experiment alternating documentary footage and fictional love story. La Pointe-Courte (patterns and details on the \u2018dark side\u2019 of the port), March-April 1953. Containing many photos never seen before, the show has been curated in collaboration with the film-maker\u2019s children, Rosalie Varda \u2013 who runs the family production company Cin\u00e9-Tamaris \u2013 and actor-director Mathieu Demy. Since their mother\u2019s death, Rosalie has begun making an inventory of Agn\u00e8s\u2019s vast archive of negatives. \u201cWe\u2019re organising, we\u2019re discovering, we keep finding new things,\u201d she says. The S\u00e8te photos are particularly telling, as they show Agn\u00e8s planning her transition from still to moving images. \u201cWhen she decided to make La Pointe Courte,\u201d Rosalie says, \u201cshe really worked on the photos \u2013 it was more than reportage, it was about preparing the film. When she came on set, she had no problem knowing where to put the camera.\u201d Reflections on the quay, S\u00e8te, vintage print, 1950. Having moved from S\u00e8te to Paris in the late 1940s to study photography and history of art, the Belgian-born Varda had soon established herself as a professional photographer, shooting portraits, working for magazines and documenting the Avignon festival and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire. \u201cThat\u2019s how she earned her living, right into the 60s,\u201d says Rosalie. Agn\u00e8s\u2019s early theatre photos, featuring stars such as Jeanne Moreau and G\u00e9rard Philippe, have long been reproduced in published drama texts: in France, says Rosalie: \u201cAll schoolchildren had textbooks with her photos \u2013 all the classics of Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Corneille. Everyone grew up seeing her pictures.\u201d Varda\u2019s La Pointe Courte photos, taken on her Rolleiflex, include a certain amount of folkloric spectacle \u2013 notably the gondolier-like figures competing in S\u00e8te\u2019s traditional water jousts, in which participants try to push their opponents off boats with long poles. But she also explores the mundane reality of postwar S\u00e8te: children huddled in cramped rooms, dogs and drying laundry on the waterfront, along with familiar objects (barrels, stacked logs, carved wood) transformed into bizarre near-abstractions in the surrealist tradition. Jousters on board during a tournament on the Canal Royal, S\u00e8te, summer 1952. Published alongside the La Pointe Courte book is a separate photobook, Expo54. It reproduces an exhibition of Varda\u2019s work that she organised in June 1954 at her home in Rue Daguerre in Paris\u2019s southern 14th arrondissement, inviting friends and neighbours, among them the photographer Brassa\u00ef and artists Alexander Calder and Hans Hartung. Expo54 features more children, including an eerie masked trio, as well as Varda\u2019s friends: Calder is seen larking around in a bowler hat and sitting solemnly alongside his wife and daughters. There is also a remarkable set of ruthlessly matter-of-fact self-portraits with Varda either smiling cautiously in sensible-looking jumper and skirt, or naked, sometimes shot from behind, head bowed so as to turn her torso into pure sculpture. Even then, she sported the pudding-bowl cut that would be a trademark right through to old age, when she wore it in aubergine and silver in a style she called \u201cmamie punk\u201d (punk granny). Varda moved to Rue Daguerre \u2013 appropriately named after 19th-century photographic pioneer Louis Daguerre \u2013 in 1951 and would live and work there over seven decades, for some of that time with her late husband, Jacques Demy, the director of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. The quartier had changed massively by the time I went to interview Varda there in 2009. The 1954 photos show the sooty, distressed walls of a dilapidated postwar city, but half a century on, Varda\u2019s home vividly evoked the bohemian oasis it must have become during Paris\u2019s cultural boom of the 1950s and 1960s. The courtyard felt like Varda\u2019s private beach, decked with plants and decorated in shades of crimson and purple \u2013 very different from the severe site she recalled moving into, with no heating and no bathroom. By the time she and Demy had become star auteurs, the place was better equipped for entertaining, but at that point Varda didn\u2019t photograph their guests: an enduring regret, she told me, was that she never took pictures of the Doors singer Jim Morrison, who would come to dinner. Heart potato, 1953. Rue Daguerre became Varda\u2019s base for an eclectic, globetrotting career, taking in era-defining feminist fictions (One Sings, the Other Doesn\u2019t, Vagabond); numerous documentaries, including studies of the Black Panthers and Los Angeles murals; hybrid works such as Jacquot de Nantes, an imaginative recreation of Demy\u2019s childhood; and photographic studies of China in 1957 and Cuba in 1962. An image of the artist Alexander Calder and his family taken by Agn\u00e8s Varda in Paris in 1954. Varda found renewed attention this century partly through films such as her playful, affecting autobiography The Beaches of Agn\u00e8s (2008), partly through her impish new delight in self-promotion. But photography always remained a key thread \u2013 right at the end of her life, she enthused about becoming an Instagrammer. And one way or another, still images continued to fuel her films. One example is an enigmatic photo from Expo54 showing a dead goat, a child and a naked man on the beach; it would inspire her 1982 film Ulysse, in which Varda pondered the image\u2019s meaning, and she mused on it again in The Beaches of Agn\u00e8s. \u201cIt was a way of showing how a narrative can be born out of a single still moment,\u201d says Rosalie Varda of Ulysse. \u201cThe shutter clicks \u2013 but before and after, there\u2019s a whole story to tell.\u201d La Pointe Courte, From Photographs to Film is at the Clo\u00eetre Saint-Trophime, Arles, until 24 September.
