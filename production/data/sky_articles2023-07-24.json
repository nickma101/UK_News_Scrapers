The Gender Recognition Act, brought in by Labour in 2004, enabled people to legally change their gender for the first time in the UK by acquiring a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).\n\n\n\nBut to get a GRC, the individual has to have reports written by two doctors confirming a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and evidence they had been living in the gender they want to transition to for two years, before getting their decision approved by a medical panel.Politics live: UK cities need more people in them, says GoveWriting in the Guardian, shadow equalities minister and chair of the Labour Party, Anneliese Dodds, said the system needed reform, but claimed the requirement for a medical diagnosis \"upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Stonewall said the medicalisation of the process was \"inhumane and undignified\" for trans people and other governments were moving towards self-identification, known as self-ID.The debate over self-ID has been raging in political circles since the plan by former Conservative PM Theresa May to scrap the medical element of getting a GRC was dropped by Boris Johnson's government in 2020. \n\nMore on Labour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Starmer may be even more cautious after emissions zone by-election defeat in Uxbridge and South Ruislip\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Sir Keir Starmer warns 'policy matters' after ULEZ blamed for by-election loss in Uxbridge\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  At a time when we need it most, political consensus on climate is under threat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nLabourTransgender\n\n\n\n\n\nIt came to a head earlier this year when Westminster blocked the Scottish government's plan to introduce it back in January.The government claimed Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill - which gained the backing of a majority of MSPs - would lead to gender tourism and impact wider equalities legislation, such as the ability to provide single-sex spaces. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\nTuesday's national newspaper front pages\n\n\nPutin could have 'way out of war' if Russian strategy succeeds; Moscow raises upper age limit for military reservists | War latest\n\n\nMother handcuffed by police over bus 'fare evasion' was carrying valid ticket\n\n\nFamily's evacuation from wildfires 'like a horror movie'; parts of Med could become 'off-limits' in summer\n\n\nBBC newsreader George Alagiah has died\n\n\n\n\nWatch Live\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the then-first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accused the Conservatives of \"using trans people as a political weapon\" to exert their power over Scotland.Labour has been under pressure to clarify its position ahead of the upcoming general election, which Tories are thought to be preparing to fight on so-called \"culture war\" issues. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:35\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland's gender bill explained\n\n\n\nIn her Guardian article, Ms Dodds attacked the Tories for using trans people to \"stoke division\", saying \"responsible politicians would understand that this isn't a debate to exploit, it's people's lives\", and there should be \"a degree of care\" involved.But while she said Labour was \"committed\" to trans people - adding \"everyone deserves to be accepted, without exception, and treated with respect and dignity in society\" - she stood by the need for a medical diagnosis, saying the safeguards proposed in Scotland's bill \"were simply not up to scratch\".\"The requirement to obtain a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria remains an important part of accessing a gender recognition certificate,\" she wrote.\"That's especially the case now that gender dysphoria is no longer classified - and stigmatised - as a psychiatric disorder.\"It can help refer trans people to the NHS for support services - nearly a quarter of trans people don't know how to access transition-related healthcare.\"Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system.\"Labour pledges to reform gender recognition lawShe did offer some changes from a Labour government, saying: \"Changing gender is not a decision anyone makes lightly. The process is intrusive, outdated and humiliating.\"So we will modernise, simplify and reform the gender recognition law to a new process. We will remove invasive bureaucracy and simplify the process.\"For example, instead of a panel of doctors having to sign off on the decision - something she called \"demeaning\" for trans people and \"meaningless in practice\" - they would replace it with the requirement of one doctor and a registrar. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:50\n\n\n\n\n\n'Lower temperature' on Trans rights debates\n\n\n\nBut responding to her article, Stonewall said it was \"wrong to suggest that safeguards cannot exist with a de-medicalised model\", pointing to Scotland's proposal to create a new statutory aggravation offence for fraudulently obtaining a GRC.In fact, they said Holyrood's proposed safeguards were \"much stronger and more specific than a GP being involved in the process\", and the bill was backed by numerous women's organisations in Scotland, including Women's Aid, Amnesty International, Engender and Rape Crisis Scotland.The statement said the UK had \"gone from leading to lagging\" when it came to gender recognition, with the current act \"now far behind international best practice\".Read more Politics news:Tory 'turmoil' stopped party tackling Islamophobia in its ranksCity minister summons bank bosses over 'de-banking' after Farage account closureThe LGBTQ+ charity said it welcomed the \"intention to promote the dignity, respect and the potential of trans people\", but it was \"vital\" Labour worked with the community and those with international experience before deciding on the detail of their policies. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Labour are serious about reforming the Gender Recognition Act and enhancing trans people's legal protections, we need a strategy informed by input from trans people on their needs and priorities, and a real understanding of how practice is working internationally.

her class was nearly kidnapped twice, and wrote in her diary in 1975 that she believed he was the likely culprit.Mr Zandstra told detectives he picked up Gretchen in his green station wagon on the morning of her disappearance and took her to a nearby wooded area, where he parked the car and asked her to remove her clothing.According to the district attorney's office, Mr Zandstra admitted he struck her after she refused and, believing she was dead from the blow, attempted to cover up her body.\n"}, {"_id": "64bef7c051ac3335cc0762b7", "url":

have given Mbappe permission to speak to the Saudi club.The 24-year-old forward had been put up for sale by the French champions, who have also left him out of the club's pre-season tour of Japan and South Korea.PSG said they would only include players they believe are committed to the club.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelations between Mbappe and PSG have been tense since the French forward said last month he would not renew his contract which expires at the end of next season, when he could leave Paris for free.PSG President Nasser al Khelaifi has said they will not let him go for free.The offer is not the only one PSG have received, according to Sky Sports News chief reporter, Kaveh Solhekol.The French club has also been approached with a mix of offers for Mbappe, including cash plus players. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther interested clubs are said to include Manchester United, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Barcelona.According to media reports, the Parisian club believe he has already agreed terms to join Real Madrid for free next summer.Alongside the Premier League and Spain, there is also said to be interest in the player's signature from leading clubs in Italy.Mbappe reportedly cost more than \u00a3150m when he signed from Monaco.Read more on Sky News:Former PSG star Messi scores on Inter Miami debutPremier League leads European financial dominanceCristiano

he agrees to extend his contract.Some reports state he earns as much as \u00a32m a week at PSG and would be in line for even more money if a deal with his current club is agreed.There is plenty of speculation about the sums of money Mbappe could earn as he enters what are normally seen as the prime years of a footballer's career.The players' union in France has accused PSG of morally harassing Mbappe.The Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionels (UNFP) has also threatened the club with legal action to protect the forward's rights.A statement from the UNFP said: \"These players - all of

by Mr Netanyahu - who's on trial on corruption charges - and fear it is setting Israel on the path to dictatorship.Mr Netanyahu and his far-right allies are determined to push ahead, and on Monday politicians approved a measure stopping the Supreme Court blocking some government decisions they deem to be \"unreasonable\".Opposition politicians chanted \"shame\" and stormed out the chamber in Jerusalem, leaving supporters to approve the change 64 votes to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice minister Yariv Levin called it the \"first step in an important historic process\" of reshaping the influence of unelected judges, but opposition leader Yair Lapid said it meant Israel is \"headed for disaster\".Ahead of the vote, water cannon were again used on demonstrators who blocked the road to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, while some petrol stations and shopping centres closed in protest. \n\nMore on Israel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fitted

Margherita Della Valle a substantially higher salary than her predecessor, Nick Read, who was effectively ousted several months ago.\n\n\n\nVodafone is no stranger to public rows over executive pay,

What Musk will have to prove is whether Twitter users are longingly looking at WeChat.He may have played a pivotal role in the founding of PayPal, but it's difficult to envisage anyone looking at how

that his rebranding has been branded \"sinister\" and \"evil-looking\" by some users.\"Twitter had some real-world evocation - the sound of birds, all vying to be heard,\" said comedian David Baddiel.\"X is just an abstract, signifying\u2026 um\u2026 that Elon likes the letter, and naming things with it.\"But having been all but forced to buy Twitter after trying to back out of his initial offer in April 2022, Musk has seemed to find the most enjoyment in simply becoming its main character.And given he's the founder of SpaceX and infamously named one of his children X, the name change ties the platform more closely than ever to Musk's personal brand.Never mind \"the bird is free\", as Musk tweeted shortly after his takeover, it's now dead - and Musk doesn't want anyone in any doubt as to who killed it.X is being given to us, whether we like it or not.\n"}, {"_id": "64bef7cc51ac3335cc0762d3", "url":

Those it doesn't approve of would need to be disabled immediately.Another would see expanded authority for the Home Office to force non-UK companies to comply with changes it wants them to make to security features.Apple says this would give the UK an \"authority that no other country has\" and stifle innovation.The Home Office insists the act includes \"strong independent oversight\" to regulate how the surveillance powers it gives public authorities are used.

These relate to four men and allegedly took place in the UK between 2001 and 2013.Kevin Spacey trial - live updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost four weeks since the trial at Southwark Crown Court in London began, Mr Justice Mark Wall sent jurors out to consider their verdicts on Monday just before 1pm. With no conclusion reached by the end of the court day, they were sent home shortly before 4.30pm.During the hearing, jurors have heard evidence from each of Spacey's four accusers, who variously described the Hollywood star as a \"vile sexual predator\", \"slippery\", and \"atrocious, despicable, disgusting\".The court has been told of alleged \"aggressive\" crotch grabs against three men, while a fourth complainant accused the defendant of performing a sex act on him while he was asleep at his flat.What are the allegations - and how has Kevin Spacey responded?Accuser one: The man, a driver, claims he was assaulted more than 10 times by Spacey over four years, and told the court the actor forced his hand onto his own penis several times, and grabbed his crotch on other occasions. Describing one alleged incident to police, the man said Spacey grabbed him \"so hard I almost came off the road\". Spacey told the court the pair shared a \"somewhat intimate\" friendship and there was \"romantic\" touching, but that they never slept together. Any sexual touching was consensual, the actor told the court.Accuser two: This man alleges Spacey grabbed his crotch and kissed his neck at a property where the star was staying, hours after meeting him at a countryside pub. Spacey conceded that he may have made a \"clumsy pass\" at the man, but that it would have been no more than this. \"I'm only happy that he testified that the moment he told me he was not interested, I stopped,\" the actor told jurors.Accuser three: The third alleged victim says Spacey subjected him to a \"machine gun\" of verbal abuse at a showbiz event before grabbing his genitals \"like a cobra - and grabbed with such force it was really painful\". Spacey told the court that none of this is true, describing the allegation as \"madness\".Accuser four: A former aspiring actor told the jury he believes he was drugged by Spacey before he allegedly woke to find him performing a sex act on him at the actor's London flat. In his defence, Spacey told the court the sex act was \"intimate\" and consensual. However, he said the man's behaviour then changed. \"The person that I had this intimate moment with was suddenly awkward and fumbling... and I don't want to say ran out... but hurriedly left,\" he said. \"And it felt very odd.\" \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder questioning from Spacey's lawyer, Patrick Gibbs KC, the men have all denied either seeking financial gain, attempting to further their career, or giving false accounts to the jury.Spacey, best known for films including The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, and political series House Of Cards, has denied crotch-grabs are his \"trademark\", and also fought back tears as he told the court how his \"world exploded\" when allegations against him were first made in the US in 2017.Jurors are set to continue their deliberations at 10.30am on Tuesday.\n"}, {"_id": "64bef7d251ac3335cc0762dd", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/barbenheimer-phenomenon-sparks-explosion-in-uk-cinema-ticket-sales-12926295", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "'Barbenheimer' phenomenon sparks explosion in UK cinema ticket sales", "lead": "Vue International has said it had the biggest weekend for UK cinema ticket sales in four years following the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:23:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:14:42.120011", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-barbie-oppenheimer_6228254.jpg?20230723201419", "body": "\nVue International has said it had the biggest weekend for UK cinema ticket sales in four years following the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer.The cinema chain said on Sunday that a fifth of its customers had purchased tickets to see both films in a social-media-inspired double bill known as \"Barbenheimer\".\n\n\n\nThe two films, released on Friday, have very different storylines, with Greta Gerwig's comedy about the eponymous doll, and Christopher Nolan's biographical thriller chronicling physicist J Robert Oppenheimer's role in developing the first atomic bomb.More than 2,000 of Vue's screenings for Barbie were sold out, according to the company.The cinema chain's biggest sites for Barbie included Cambridge, Glasgow St Enoch, Leeds Kirkstall, Cwmbran, Islington, Bolton and Portsmouth.\n\n\n\n\n\nVue said the film, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, will exceed ticket sales for Super Mario Bros and Oppenheimer to become the biggest film of the year. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:49\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbie (Robbie) and Ken (Gosling) talk about the new film\n\n\n\nTim Richards, chief executive and founder of Vue International, said: \"Vue saw its highest weekend admissions since Avengers: Endgame in 2019 with the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer, proving that when the movies are there, our customers will come to watch them on the big screen.\"Barbie is tracking to become the biggest film of 2023 and has a good chance of getting into the Top 10 highest-grossing films of all time.\"It is an incredibly exciting moment for the industry, and we expect this trend to continue for the coming weeks.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more:Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling talk Barbie as they hit the pink carpetChristopher Nolan didn't intend for Oppenheimer movie to be so timely \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nPic: AP\n        \n\n\n\nIn total, the cinema chain had more than 4,000 sell-out sessions across the country for both films.Odeon reported on Thursday that more than 200,000 advance tickets had been bought and over 10,000 guests were expected to see both films during the opening weekend.Universal Pictures said Oppenheimer, which stars Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh, had made \u00a38.05 million in the UK and Ireland since Friday.The film production and distribution company said the biopic is on track to have a better opening three days than Nolan's other blockbusters Dunkirk, Interstellar and Inception.Sales have also soared across the pond with Barbie having the biggest opening weekend of any film in North America, taking $155m (\u00a3120m) and Oppenheimer pulling in $80.5m (\u00a362.6m) \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:52\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Nolan discusses his Oppenheimer biopic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarhan Mehmood, who watched Barbie at 2.30pm, followed by the darker Oppenheimer at 5.15pm with a friend, told the PA news agency the films can \"save cinema\".The 21-year-old from Scunthorpe, who volunteers in digital marketing, said: \"Barbie had a deep message, it paid off (with what) it said in the trailer with the tagline, 'If you grew up with Barbie, this film is for you.
