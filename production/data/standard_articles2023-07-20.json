For Londoners, it\u2019s just a 15-minute train journey from London Bridge or Victoria, and it\u2019s worth it. This space illustrates the idea of everyday escapism within easy reach of the city. The hotel is surrounded by 200 acres of rolling, unkempt countryside, home to Birch\u2019s long-term rewilding project, which aims to return the land to its natural state. Free-roaming animals and unexpected plant species are invited to thrive, as is the on-site kitchen garden.StyleBirch Selsdon  / Adam LynkInteriors are splashed with the same artsy paintbrush as the Cheshunt property, and each communal space has its own bold colour palette, textural details, and unique aesthetic. Elements of the original architecture, such as the restored parquet and tiled flooring through the entrance, juxtapose a mix of modern artwork on the walls, all of which is British and chosen by the on-site curator. High ceilings and full-length grid windows allow natural light to flood the ground-floor bar and restaurant. Viewed alongside plush, curvaceous seating, the contrast is striking. In the bedrooms, a minimalist aesthetic instills calm and bespoke furniture, whittled from local wood, nods to nature. FacilitiesGuests and members can try their hands at pottery and screen-printing in the on-site studios, where art is used as a form of meditation and escapism. There\u2019s a dedicated reading room, an interactive kitchen, and a wellness space with a programme of daily classes. Tennis courts and a lido offer fun for all the family, and have the potential to trick your mind into thinking you\u2019re abroad on sunny summer days. The temptation to be outdoors remains year-round, though, as woodland walks are just as well explored in a pair of wellies as sandals.\u00a0  / Adam LynkDespite brimming with style and encouraging remote working, this is a family-friendly place. In the school holidays, children can join the Birchlings Kids\u2019 Club and partake in games, arts and crafts, pyjama parties, and even \u2018superhero training\u2019. There\u2019s a chance to learn about biodiversity, and dedicated family wing rooms are available when booking. Slightly separate from the main house, this section of the hotel is home to bigger bedrooms, a complimentary pantry, and a natural football pitch in its own cordoned-off garden area.Food & Drink The Vervain restaurant / Adam LynkEach of the three bars and two restaurants is different from the next, but all draw from the land to inspire ever-changing menus made with British produce. All-day brasserie-style dining can be found at Vervain, where dishes range from classic to conceptual and will change with the seasons. Booth-like seating, two-seater window spots, and larger, oval tables create a diverse and social space that never feels empty. Through double doors is Meadows bar, with its sunny orange walls and oversized plants, and attached to that is the Orangerie. Part social space part working hotspot, it\u2019s decked out with comfy, sunken chairs as well as high tables, and it leads to the terrace, which is open for al fresco drinking in warmer climes.

One third of all casualties that occur on Kensington High Street were said to be cyclists.The council said it began researching a long-term cycle scheme for Kensington High Street in March 2021 after reviewing evidence from the temporary cycle lanes that were pulled after seven weeks in 2020.\u201cThat decision instructed officers not to install temporary cycle lanes on Kensington High Street but instead to commission research into post-Covid transport patterns, in partnership with local residents and local institutions including academic and research partners,\u201d the council said."}, {"_id": "64b942d751ac3324fe4fad5c", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/iopc-david-carrick-met-police-complaints-investigations-b1095735.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "David Carrick: Watchdog launches \u2018rare\u2019 multiple probes into Met officers over handling of complaints about rapist police officer", "lead": "Watchdog launches series of probes into \u2018potential missed opportunities\u2019 to stop rapist police officer ", "author": "Josh Salisbury", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 14:14:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:11.018313", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T14:14:17+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/04/09/19/59eb6b0731528411a98952e0fe96724eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjgxMTUxNTkw-2.70592133.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "The police watchdog has launched multiple conduct probes into eight Met police officers over their handling of complaints against serial rapist police officer David Carrick.Ex-Met PC Carrick, formerly an elite firearms officer in the Met\u2019s Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, carried out a campaign of rape and abuse during his policing career.The 46-year-old, whom colleagues had nicknamed \u2018Bastard Dave\u2019, was jailed earlier this year for subjecting at least a dozen victims to physical and emotional abuse over the course of 18 years, using his status as a police officer to coerce victims into silence.On Thursday, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was launching four separate investigations into the conduct of eight MPS officers and one staff member into the handling of complaints about Carrick.It criticised the force for failing to identify any potential conduct matters against officers in the force after an internal review into reports which could have stopped Carrick sooner.Read MoreMother of murdered sisters calls for more black Met officers in communitiesInquiry calls over failures linked to sixth Stephen Lawrence murder suspectVictims of serial rapist police officer David Carrick to sue the Met PoliceMan accused of touching Amber Gibson\u2019s body was with family, father tells trialIOPC regional director Mel Palmer said: \u201cThese were potentially missed opportunities to pursue gross misconduct investigations against Carrick, which may have led to his dismissal years before he was eventually arrested.\u201cWe will now be investigating the conduct of the officers involved in these cases, and at the end of our investigations we will determine whether they should face disciplinary proceedings.\u201dThe officers being investigated range in rank from police constable to chief inspector, said the IOPC. The Met said five of the officers were still serving, while two had retired and one was working in another force.The IOPC\u2019s probes centre around four separate allegations made against Carrick before his arrest in October 2021 but for which he never faced disciplinary action.In one case, a former partner made an allegation of harassment against Carrick in 2002, during which time he was a probationary constable.Carrick - who was handed 36 life sentences for his crimes in February, confirming him as one of Britain\u2019s worst-ever serial rapists - was only spoken to by his line manager.In three other cases in 2016, 2019 and 2021, separate police forces investigated Carrick over allegations of stalking, harassment and rape, but decided to take no further action.The Met was made aware of the claims and started misconduct probes, said the IOPC, but did not progress them, meaning Carrick never faced disciplinary action over the allegations until his arrest.Ms Palmer said the IOPC was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d to also discover that in two of the cases, Carrick\u2019s name was removed from the Met\u2019s system after criminal investigations were dropped, meaning they did not show up when later allegations were made.This meant Scotland Yard was \u201cunable to build a complete picture of his pattern of offending,\u201d she said.A Met spokesperson said it had written to the IOPC in January to ask it to review its handling of the allegations, and that it welcomed the watchdog\u2019s independent investigations.\u201cWe are absolutely committed to identifying and rooting out those who corrupt our integrity and have no place in policing,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWe welcome the important role that independent scrutiny has to play in improving our practices in this area as we work determinedly to rebuild trust and confidence in the Met.\u201cIn addition to the IOPC investigation, we are also continuing to support the work of the independent inquiry chaired by Lady Elish Angiolini which, as part of its wider terms of reference, is examining the extent to which Carrick\u2019s conduct and crimes were known and investigated at the time.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b942d751ac3324fe4fad5d", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rwanda-channel-home-office-government-prime-minister-b1095741.html", "primaryCategory": "Politics",

said:\u00a0\u201cToday is an important step in the Government\u2019s plan to stop the boats and put an end to dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys to the UK.\u201cNow that this piece of legislation has become law, we will be focused on the necessary next steps to ensure it can become operational, including by appealing to the Supreme Court in October regarding the safety of Rwanda

million higher in both 2025 and 2026.Extra profits will be used to \u201cfund vital public services, for the benefit of the nation\u201d, it said.The Sovereign Grant is based on funds two years in arrears.The total Sovereign Grant for 2024/25 will remain flat at \u00a386.3 million because of a caveat which means it cannot fall below current levels.The Crown Estate profits in 2022-23 were \u00a3442.6 million, meaning had the 25% formula continued, the monarchy would have received \u00a3110.7 million in 2024/25.At the new 12% formula, the monarchy would have received \u00a353.1 million \u2013 but because it cannot be less than the previous year, it will remain at the current \u00a386.3 million.Predictions in the report set the expected Crown Estate profits in 2023-24 as \u00a31.04 billion and 2024-25 as \u00a31.05 billion, meaning the Sovereign Grant could be \u00a3124.8 million in 2025-26 and \u00a3126 million in 2026-27 \u2013 a jump of nearly \u00a338.5 million and then

\u00a3260 million a year.The Sovereign Grant will be recalculated when the Palace building works are finished, the Treasury said.Mr Hunt said the British monarchy was a \u201csource of immense national pride and constitutional strength, widely admired around the world\u201d.\u201cFor almost 300 years, Kings and Queens have surrendered the profits from The Crown Estate to the British people, and in return the Government has provided a fraction of that to properly support the King in undertaking his official duties,\u201d he said.\u201cThe new Sovereign Grant rate reflects the unexpected significant increase in The Crown Estate\u2019s net profits from offshore wind developments, while providing enough funding for official business as well as essential property maintenance, including completing the 10-year reservicing of Buckingham Palace\u201d.Buckingham Palace declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the Treasury."}, {"_id": "64b942d751ac3324fe4fad60", "url":

Westminster council had approved plans to let the retailer demolish the Art Deco building near Marble Arch and build a new shop, along with offices, cafe and a gym. But following significant opposition from heritage and environmental campaigners, the decision was last year called in by Communities Secretary Michael Gove who launched an inquiry.On Thursday the plans were rejected over concerns that the public benefits of the proposal did not outweigh the harm to nearby landmarks, including the famous Selfridges department store and several nearby conservation areas.The scheme\u2019s carbon footprint and its failure to reuse existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings, was also cited as a reason for refusal in the 110-page report.

It is utterly pathetic.\u201dBut a government source responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a tantrum, it\u2019s an M&S tantrum.\u201dThe reasons for the refusal, he added, were set out clearly in the decision letter. M&S had earlier argued there was \u201cno heritage reason\u201d why the three buildings on the site should not be knocked down, as they are not listed, and do not sit within Westminster\u2019s conservation areas. \u201cAny heritage harm will be significantly outweighed by the benefits,\u201d Russell Harris KC for M&S had told the inquiry. The company had warned it will close down the flagship shop altogether if it is not allowed to rebuild it. But Matthew Fraser, on behalf of the campaign group Save Britain\u2019s Heritage, said the construction of a new building would release nearly 40,000 tonnes of CO2 \u2014 \u201cthe equivalent of driving a typical car 99 \u2009million miles, further than the distance to the Sun\u201d. Mr Fraser added that the retailer\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d to leave the area was \u201cnot the constructive attitude of a retailer committed to the future of Oxford Street\u201d.Cllr Geoff Barraclough, Westminster City Council\u2019s Cabinet member for planning and economic development, said: \u201cThe Marks & Spencer application had significant implications for the environment so it was right the case should be tested robustly. The Council\u2019s position is to encourage landowners to refurbish buildings, not demolish them. \u201cClearly this is a disappointing day for M&S but we hope they return with a revised scheme which meets the new tests presented by the climate emergency. Footfall on Oxford Street is improving and with our exciting plan for an overhaul of Oxford Street just launched, M&S can remain a powerful presence.\u201dHenrietta Billings, director of SAVE Britain\u2019s Heritage, said: \u201cThis is a hugely important decision that rightly challenges the way we continually and needlessly knock down and rebuild important buildings across our towns and cities. Repurposing and converting buildings we cherish and saving thousands of tonnes of C02 in the process is a no brainer. This is a massive positive step and we salute the Secretary of State.\u201dIt comes as Westminster Council launched a consultation into giving rundown Oxford Street a facelift.

And Rylan took charge, he absolutely took charge.\u201cLater that day when the police had been called, and Rylan had just been this incredible leader \u2013 calm, rational leader, who just saved the day \u2013 they told me the hotel porter was in custody, and had Rylan not come to shut that door, there would not have been that traceable key card that gave all the evidence to arrest that man.\u201dIn response to Spraggan\u2019s podcast interview, Rylan tweeted in support of his friend, writting: \u201cDear @lspraggan I love you dearly, you are so brave and so loved.\u201cIt\u2019s took me a while to process and revisit all this since the weekend but everyone should know how brave you are and @elizabday done this perfect.

one of the most sustainable buildings in London, improving the public realm and creating a flagship store, is now effectively in the deep freeze.\u201cToday the Secretary of State has ignored his

opinion and approval of the appointed planning inspector and playing to the gallery by kiboshing the only retail-led regeneration proposal is a short-sighted act of self-sabotage by the Secretary of

The Queen was supposed to bank with Coutts, but it would never be so crass as to confirm this fact.If it had just kept quiet, no one would have known who Nigel Farage banks with, or cared less. Instead it chose a fight with a man who picks them for a living. For the rest of us, awkward issues are raised. Does my bank want to know how I vote? My views on abortion? If I shower regularly?Rishi Sunak probably regards Farage as one of his many pains in the neck.And NatWest is a vital cog in how he hopes to rebuild the economy ahead of an election he already looks like he has lost.Even he has come out in support of Farage and against NatWest. \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should be barred from using basic services for their political views.\u201dThis is the same as saying that you can\u2019t have free speech only for people you agree with. A basic point that Coutts apparently has to learn. 1689840981Fullers hails strong demand for pints in LondonPints are in full flow at London\u2019s top pubs as the boss of Fuller\u2019s hailed strong signs of recovery in the capital and unveiled a one million share buyback scheme.The 178-year-old family business, which operates the Churchill Arms in Notting Hill, the Admiralty in Trafalgar Square and The Banker on Cannon Street, reported a 15.1% rise in like-for-like sales over the past 15 weeks compared to the same time last year.City and central London pubs showed even stronger growth, up 17.9%, thanks to \u201cincreased tourism and events, along with workers returning to their offices.\u201dChief Executive Simon Emeny said: \u201cWe are very pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year.

If you find yourself in the West End in the next week, you\u2019ll certainly do well to miss it: the front page of this iconic newspaper, but as you\u2019ve never seen it before, animated for the first time on the immense screens in London\u2019s Outernet district, which includes 23,000 square feet of wrap-around, floor-to-ceiling 16k-enabled screens, right outside Tottenham Court Road Tube station.For those unfamiliar with the capital\u2019s buzzy new billion-pound entertainment district Outernet London, these aren\u2019t just billboard versions of the Evening Standard\u2019s unmissable daily cover. They are the most advanced immersive screens in the world, standing proud in the heart of central London and set to broadcast an exclusive animated version of this paper\u2019s cover as hundreds of thousands of copies are distributed around the capital each day.

The maximalist live broadcast space \u2014 free to visit and home to the world\u2019s largest LED canvas by pixel density \u2014 was a decade in the making when it opened in November following a \u00a31bn redevelopment and has already hosted brands including Burberry, Amazon, Netflix, Nike, Chanel and Porsche and exhibitions from the likes of the Royal College of Art.Joining forces: Editor-in- Chief Dylan Jones with Philip Bourchier O\u2019Ferrall, CEO of Outernet Global / Paul HarriesAccording to recent figures released by Outernet, average weekly visitor numbers to The Now Building currently stand at 123,000, giving the development a predicted yearly reach of 6.3 million. This puts it on track to be ahead of the current top three attractions in the country \u2014 Windsor Great Park, the Natural History Museum and the British Museum \u2014 when compared to their numbers by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions. Future Outernet districts are set to be built in the US, Asia and Europe over the coming years, with similar venues planned for Los Angeles and New York.Here in London, the site\u2019s unique setting is undoubtedly at the forefront of The Outernet\u2019s appeal. Tottenham Court Road recently overtook both Waterloo and Liverpool Street to enter the top five most-used stations on the TfL network thanks to opening of the Elizabeth Line, and the new Outernet development \u2014 just outside the Charing Cross Road entrance to TCR station \u2014 includes the iconic Denmark Street, home to the musicians\u2019 hang-out Tin Pan Alley where everyone from Elton John and David Bowie to The Rolling Stones and Sex Pistols started out in their careers.Outernet LondonPhilip Bourchier O\u2019Ferrall, chief executive of Outernet Global, says he hopes Londoners will feel \u201chappy, exhilarated, informed and part of something special\u201d when they see the new Evening Standard broadcast on Outernet\u2019s high-spec, 360-degree landing screens from next week. To him, the partnership signals a powerful moment in the history of our capital city: a landmark partnership between two iconic London institutions and a new chapter in how Londoners engage with the most vital, vibrant and interesting stories their city generates every day. \u201cThe Standard has always defined London news and culture and to partner with them is a powerful moment,\u201d he says. The Standard has always defined London news and culture; to partner with them is a powerful moment \u201cWe\u2019re both committed to art, culture, fashion, music and all the things that make London the best capital city in the world. Being able to work together to shout about all those things on such iconic platforms is an exhilarating thought. We have common goals and a shared love of this city and all that it and the people that live here are capable of. \u201cThe Evening Standard has its rich history and huge influence and we have the screen technology, immense spaces and now a footfall that means we are on track to be the number one visitor attraction in the UK. All this means we can do things together that have never been possible before.\u201dOuternet LondonAmong the most exciting things the partnership has already made possible is the launch of the UK\u2019s newest and boldest ad competition, a contest called the London Creative Advertising Competition with a prize value of \u00a31m in media space and time. Further details will be announced in the paper later this year.Dylan Jones, Editor-in-Chief of the Evening Standard, says he is excited about the partnership and sees it as a reflection of how his historic media brand is seeking to innovate over the coming years as Londoners pour back into the city centre. Phil Lewis\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the Evening Standard is now working with the Outernet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most exciting innovations in London, as we continue to innovate ourselves, I couldn\u2019t think of a more powerful relationship. I\u2019m also thrilled that the Outernet have seen the potential of our new superpowered paper.\u201dPart of this superpowered new paper is an uptick in its interactive elements: QR codes to podcast episodes; links to more detailed analysis online. QR codes will appear on the Outernet\u2019s big screens, too, taking visitors straight to the Evening Standard on their phones if they fancy scrolling through the online edition as well the free print version handed out at Tube stations.

Epson\u2019s EcoTank technology means that each tank can be individually replenished from a compact bottle, which not only saves on the amount of plastic used per refill but also significantly reduces the cost of ink. It also helps that the heat-free ink tank uses significantly less energy than your typical laser printer, meaning it will save on the energy bill as well.Four refillable bottles are included with the sale of each printer \u2013\u00a0One for each tank, which provides up to three years worth of printing, or 7,500 colour pages if you want to be more specific.

With its eternally divisive nature, it\u2019s often pigeonholed as uber-feminine. However, if you hit the history books, you\u2019ll discover that pink was originally a genderless tone sported by both men and women in the 18th century. Initially a symbol of status and luxury, the pigment was rebranded during the postwar era as a female colour. It became hyper-commercialised and Westernised in turn, yet remained one of the most coveted colours in fashion. Valentino\u2019s autumn/winter 2022 collection turbocharged our fascination with fuschia. The brainchild of Pierpaolo Piccioli catapulted hot pink (aka \u2018Valentino Pink\u2019) into the sartorial stratosphere with pink-clad models sent down pink-clad runway, cementing himself among a long list of designers who have successfully championed a magenta mood board.

The majority of accounts concur that the monkeys' caretaker was performing his routine cleaning tasks when they attacked. He started by putting a barrier over the moat that separated the island from the rhesus monkeys. The clever rhesus monkeys, meanwhile, just strolled across the board to freedom.

financial watchdog have waded in to the debate surrounding banks\u2019 ability to close people\u2019s accounts because they disagree with their beliefs or political views.It was sparked by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage who said his account was unfairly shut down by private bank Coutts, owned by NatWest Group.Here, the PA news agency looks at what rights banks and consumers have, and what is next for the sector.\u2013 Are banks allowed to close your account with no explanation?Banks have the right to close a customer\u2019s account in the same way that a person can choose to shut their own account.Read MoreFarage praises Government plans to revoke banks\u2019 licences over free speech curbsWhat the papers say \u2013 July 20Banks \u2018could lose licences for banning customers over their political views\u2019SPONSOREDHow to keep your energy costs down all year roundBanks do not have to explain to a customer why they have closed their account but it can be helpful to give a rationale, according to the Financial Ombudsman Service.They are also obliged to give 30 days\u2019 notice before doing so, unless there are exceptional circumstances such as if financial crime or fraud is detected.Financial services firms may decide to cut ties with a customer if they are worried it will harm their reputation, which is reportedly one of the key reasons why Coutts opted to shut Mr Farage\u2019s account.Gary Greenwood, an analyst for Shore Capital Markets, told PA: \u201cHaving any links to anyone that could ultimately be deemed as being linked to terrorist financing or criminal activities is a huge concern.\u201cBanks also have their reputations to think about and if they are aligned with high-profile customers that have questionable values then that could damage their brand.\u201d\u2013 So what protections are in place for people?The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), emphasises that while financial firms have a fundamental right as a business to decide who they do and do not deal with, they still need to follow its rules.This means that they must treat consumers fairly, deal with them properly, and cannot discriminate against them.Under the Equality Act 2010, it is against the law for firms to discriminate against someone on the basis of protected characteristics, including race, sexual orientation, gender, religion and beliefs.Nikhil Rathi, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, stressed during a committee session with MPs on Wednesday that firms cannot discriminate based on a person\u2019s political views either.Furthermore, under its Consumer Duty coming into force at the end of the month, financial firms will have to meet higher standards of consumer protection and put their customers\u2019 needs first.\u2013 What rights do customers have?People can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they think their bank account has been closed unfairly, including if they feel they have been discriminated against, or did not receive enough notice.Furthermore, consumers have certain information rights which means they can access any personal data held.Mr Farage used a so-called Subject Access Request (SAR) to access Coutts documents detailing the reasoning behind his account closure, which he says showed his views \u201cdo not align with our values\u201d.People in the UK also have the right to open a basic bank account if they do not qualify for a standard current account.\u2013 Could the rules change?The Government is considering making new laws to stop banks closing customers\u2019 accounts because they disagree with their political views, according to reports.It could result in fast-tracked changes to the notice time given to customers to close accounts, from one month to three months, The Times said.Banks could also have to give an explanation of why the accounts are being shut and customers will be able to appeal against the decision.The FCA is already conducting a review into whether guidance for financial institutions needs to be updated.Mr Greenwood said banks are having to \u201ctread an increasingly narrow tightrope\u201d, as they navigate reputational risks and consumer care.\u201cUltimately, I think it will lead to lenders having to be more explicit about their customer criteria and demonstrating thorough processes when such criteria are not met\u201d, he said.\u2013 Could NatWest lose its banking licence?Senior Conservative MPs have piled pressure on NatWest \u2013 which is still part-owned by the taxpayer \u2013 over its closure of Mr Farage\u2019s Coutts account.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the move \u201ccompletely undermines the trust we have in our banking and financial systems\u201d.Former Brexit secretary David Davis said the disclosure of the politician\u2019s private information after the situation came to light \u201cought to jeopardise its banking licence\u201d.Mr Rathi said the FCA is currently in talks with NatWest over the matter.But banking experts say it is unlikely that the Government would take such a drastic step as to strip NatWest of its banking licence.NatWest was approached for comment."},

That means putting more resources into preventing, investigating and prosecuting fraud \u2013 as well as supporting those who unfortunately become victims.\u201dFigures for overall crime published on Thursday from the ONS Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year ending March 2023 suggest people aged 16 and over experienced 8.7 million offences, down 15% from 10.2 million in a survey for the year ending March 2020.The report measures experiences of crime in the 12 months before interview, meaning the latest survey \u2013 which was conducted between April 2022 and March 2023 \u2013 reflects crimes that could have occurred as far back as April 2021.Estimates from the crime survey suggest there were 391,000 advance fee fraud offences in England and Wales, more than six times the number recorded in the survey for the year to March 2020 (60,000).Total fraud has returned to pre-pandemic levels with a 14% decrease in bank and credit account fraud largely offset by a six-fold increase in advance fee fraud... from 60,000 to 391,000 offencesExperiences of crimes, as measured by the ONS survey, have been on a broad downwards trend since the mid-1990s.Nick Stripe, from the ONS\u2019 Centre for Crime and Justice, said: \u201cSome crime types are returning to their pre-pandemic levels, while others may have been affected by changes in people\u2019s behaviour during the pandemic and the subsequent lifting of social restrictions.\u201cOverall crime continues to be well below levels seen before the pandemic. This is in large part due to sharp falls in theft and criminal damage.\u201cTotal fraud has returned to pre-pandemic levels with a 14% decrease in bank and credit account fraud largely offset by a six-fold increase in advance fee fraud \u2013 where victims are tricked into paying upfront for services or goods that never materialise \u2013 from 60,000 to 391,000 offences.\u201cFor crimes which are well reported and recorded by the police, we can gain additional insight from police data. Knife crime, robbery and firearms offences are all down on March 2020 levels, but have seen increases in the past year. Imitation guns are driving the rise in firearms offences.\u201dThe overall number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales in 2022/23 stood at 6.7 million, compared with 6.3 million in 2021/22 and 6.1 million in the pre-pandemic year of 2019/20, though this is \u201cunlikely to reflect a genuine increase in crime\u201d, the ONS said.This is because the rise was largely influenced by increases in the offence categories, which are \u201cmost subject to changes in reporting and recording practices\u201d.Some 195,315 sexual offences were recorded by police in England and Wales in 2022/23, up slightly on 193,559 in 2021/22 but a jump of 20% from 163,358 in the pre-pandemic year of 2019/20.The rise reflects improvements in police recording practices and increased reporting by victims, which means the figures \u201cdo not provide a reliable measure of trends in these types of crime\u201d, the ONS said.The data will also have been influenced by \u201cthe impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage and campaigns on people\u2019s willingness to report both recent and historical incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims\u201d.Similar factors are likely to have contributed to the rise in police-recorded rape offences, which stood at 68,949 in 2022/23, down slightly from 69,973 in 2021/22 but up 16% from 59,191 in 2019/20."}, {"_id": "64b942df51ac3324fe4fad80", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-criticises-eu-argentina-falklands-malvinas-b1095706.html", "primaryCategory": "Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak criticises EU\u2019s \u2018regrettable choice of words\u2019 over Falklands", "lead": "The EU referred to the Falklands as \u2018Islas Malvinas\u2019, the name used by Argentina, which has long claimed sovereignty over the islands", "author": "Sophie Wingate and Bill McLoughlin", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 13:00:43", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:19.917526", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T13:00:43+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/newFile-4.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Rishi Sunak has criticised the European Union\u2019s \u201cregrettable choice of words\u201d after it appeared to endorse the name Argentina uses for the Falkland Islands.A diplomatic row erupted after the EU referred to the islands as \u201cIslas Malvinas\u201d in a declaration jointly signed with Argentina and other Latin American countries.Downing Street said any suggestion that the EU would recognise Argentina\u2019s claims on the Falklands would have been \u201centirely unacceptable\u201d, as it welcomed a subsequent clarification that EU countries have not in fact changed their position on their status.The initial statement, published on Tuesday after a summit between EU nations and the Celac bloc of Latin American and Caribbean states, said: \u201cRegarding the question of sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas / Falkland Islands, the European Union took note of Celac\u2019s historical position based on the importance of dialogue and respect for international law in the peaceful solution of disputes.\u201dBritish diplomats reportedly complained about the wording, which Argentina\u2019s president Alberto Fernandez appeared to hail on Twitter as support for his country\u2019s long-standing \u201cclaim to sovereignty\u201d over the Falklands.Read MoreCalls to end MPs\u2019 direct employment of staff rejected by Parliament reform bodyTop civil servant Sir Tom Scholar\u2019s sacking cost Treasury \u00a3457,000UK sanctions \u2018despicable\u2019 Wagner leaders linked to African killings and tortureSPONSOREDRaise your glass to a premium gin with a differenceIn a statement, EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano said: \u201cThe EU Member States have not changed their views and positions concerning the Falklands/Islas Malvinas.\u201cThe EU is not in a situation to express any position on the Falklands/Islas Malvinas, as there is not any Council discussion on this matter.\u201dMr Sunak\u2019s official spokesman told reporters on Thursday: \u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s view is that it would have been entirely unacceptable for the EU to question the Falkland Islanders\u2019 right to decide their own future.\u201cTo be clear, the Falkland Islands are British, that was the choice of the islanders themselves.\u201cThe EU has rightly now clarified that their position on the Falklands has not changed after their regrettable choice of words.\u201cAnd just as a reminder, in the 2013 referendum, 99.8% of islanders voted to be part of the UK family.

If the critics can be sniffy, the band has inspired adulation among fans. Elton John, for one, loves the band so much he once invited them to perform at his Academy Award party. Five years on from that debut, they say the criticism reveals more about their detractors than it does about them and their music.\u201cPeople say we\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d lead singer Josh Kiszka says when I meet the band in their studio in Nashville.

In person, the Kiszkas are charming and excitable, firing off jokes with the same verve seen in their flamboyant performances. Josh is clearly the alpha, while Jake, the guitarist, is very keen to show he\u2019s well read, often starting sentences with \u201cThere\u2019s a quote that goes \u2026\u201d.

Elton John gave them similar advice early on. \u201cJust flaunt what you\u2019ve got,\u201d the band remembers him saying. More volume, more flair, more drama. The band upped the ante on their second album, 2021\u2019s The Battle At Garden\u2019s Gate, an imposing record that delved into religion and war. A reader\u2019s poll in Total Guitar magazine ranked the guitar solo from The Weight of Dreams, the record\u2019s final track, as the best of the century.Their new album, Starcatcher, is out on Friday. It\u2019s softer than their previous work, and the band is keen to point out how \u201cspontaneous\u201d it feels. Produced with Dave Cobb, a nine-time Grammy Award winner who\u2019s worked with Chris Stapleton and Lady Gaga, it feels refreshingly paired back.\u201cWe wanted to do something less grandiose than Garden Gate,\u201d Josh says. \u201cWe\u2019d already made the album we wanted to make when we were in our primal years, so after that, we thought, where do we go from there?\u201dThe answer is back in time. \u201cWe started exploring our roots,\u201d Sam says. The Kiszkas grew up in a blue-collar family in rural Michigan. Sam recalls a conversation with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, where the two bonded over being raised by fathers who listened to the blues. Referring to how the area has faced industrial decline, he adds: \u201cIt\u2019s the Rust Belt, man.\u201dThe band moved to Tennessee in 2020 to produce their second album. Nashville, the birthplace of country records, is now their home. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere I can ring up a buddy one afternoon and ask to make an album together, and that night we\u2019re in a studio. By morning we\u2019re done recording it,\u201d Jake says.It\u2019s also a liberal bolthole in a state also known for Christian conservatism. There are more megachurches per capita in Tennessee than anywhere else in the US. Josh came out as gay a month ago. \u201cI was really sceptical,\u201d he says, but the response has been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been more reassuring,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt reminds you that most people have common decency.\u201d Still, he admits, America remains a country mired in discord. \u201cThere\u2019s stigma everywhere,\u201d he says. The country is currently at a cultural impasse. The Biden administration is pushing for reform while the conservative-leaning Supreme Court rolls back years of social progress. The culture wars have entrenched division. Sam says he feels like \u201ceverything is polarised\u201d and that there is \u201cno in between. There\u2019s a real sense the two sides won\u2019t even talk to one another. People aren\u2019t willing to communicate. We\u2019ve reached a point where we\u2019ve got people saying: his freedom\u2019s an infraction on my freedom!\u201dThe political landscape is \u201csuper influential\u201d to the way they write music, Jake says. \u201cYou know during World War Two when the Nazis stole artefacts from those they wanted to obliterate? They were culturally robbing those communities and taking away their identities. Music is an identity that you can\u2019t rob because it lives in the soul.\u201d The recurring criticism levelled against Greta Van Fleet is that they are inauthentic, producing Led Zeppelin-style work designed for the algorithm and confusing power with sensory overload. The band has its reasons for ignoring such assessments \u2013\u00a0they believe the criticism is misjudged and comes from a place of snobbery \u2013 but their producer has consciously pushed them towards more authentic terrain. Wagner says Dave Cobb \u201ctricked us into authenticity.\u201d The cover of Greta Van Fleet\u2019s new album Starcatcher /  While recording their new songs, he would suggest a different mindset for each take so the band wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable. He then selected the first, roughest take for the final cut. The result is a folksier, bluesier record. It also revisits the parallel universe they began to elaborate in their earlier work. \u201cTolkien was building a new world when he wrote Lord of The Rings,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIt\u2019s not dissimilar to what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\u201cI like to think of it as Todorovsky interpretating Salvador Dali,\u201d Jake chimes in (he might need a day off). \u201cWe\u2019re very involved in the visual representation of our music,\u201d Josh says. Loosely translated: we love cosmic and biblical allusions and we put stars on our album covers to suggest a world beyond the American plains.Wagner and the Kiszkas were raised in artistic families, keen on music, film and literature. They tell me, however, that fashion has become their favourite mode of experimentation. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a real love for clothes,\u201d Josh says. \u201cAnd we wear insane s**t on stage.\u201d With low waistlines, beaded jumpsuits and feather necklaces, they certainly know how to turn heads.Their elaborate costumes are certainly not out of place in Tennessee, either, which gave rise, not just to some of the most iconic music in the American canon, but to some of the most iconic fashion too. \u201cLook at Elvis!\u201d Wagner says.It\u2019s funny, he continues, how one of the most conservative regions in America spawned some of the campest acts. As Jake puts it, \u201cThe overly masculine Jonny Cash type who wears sparkles and rhinestones.\u201dNashville, they tell me, is often \u201cmore of a business than it is a city\u201d, country music in particular, with a clear hierarchy and labels running a tight ship. That\u2019s not how Greta Van Fleet work, Josh tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to bring a bit of anarchy to the town.\u201d No doubt they will with their performance next Monday, kicking off their world tour at the Bridgestone Arena.We meet a day after Harry Styles was hit in the face by a projectile launched from a fan in the crowd at his London concert. I ask if this kind of post-Covid misbehaviour worries them. \u201cNot really,\u201d Sam answers. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d Josh says, \u201cwe\u2019re more worried about guns.\u201dMusic, the band reiterates, can offer a way forward there as well. The conservative zeal imparted to younger generations by the Church can easily be recast, Jake says. He reflects on the \u201cspiritual dimension\u201d of live music. \u201cThe kid who grew up going to church and loving it,\u201d he says, \u201cone day realises: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t love Church, I love live performance.\u2019\u201d Starcatcher (Lava Records) is out on July 21"}, {"_id": "64b942e051ac3324fe4fad82", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/electoral-commission-mps-jacob-reesmogg-conservative-nadine-dorries-b1095729.html", "primaryCategory": "Celebrity News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Call for new guidance amid concerns over MPs hosting television programmes", "lead": "Opposition MPs were offered talks with the Electoral Commission after raising the issue in the Commons.", "author": "Richard Wheeler", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:54:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:20.380696", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:54:34+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/5a1e0512329c15cf2b7fdc8f464ba152Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTQyNzI0-2.71169539.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "The elections watchdog has been urged to issue new guidance amid concerns over MPs hosting political television programmes.Labour MP Barry Sheerman said there would be \u201csomething wrong\u201d with Conservative ministers being interviewed by their backbench colleagues on television at the same time that they are running \u201cvery political campaigns\u201d.Both he and his party colleague Kevin Brennan asked for the Electoral Commission to look closely at the issue and prepare guidance on what is deemed acceptable.The SNP\u2019s Owen Thompson, responding on behalf of the Speaker\u2019s Committee on the Electoral Commission, noted Ofcom is responsible for regulating broadcasters and providing guidance on impartiality.He added the Electoral Commission would be happy to meet the two Labour MPs to discuss their concerns.Read MoreConcerns raised over MPs hosting political TV shows during general electionsJeremy Vine\u2019s stalker to pay damages over campaign of harassmentBBC may need to consider alternative funding options in future, minister saysSPONSOREDStepping up to the challenge of decarbonising the Square MileOfcom said its 2005 rules make clear that news and current affairs programmes \u201cmust be presented with due impartiality\u201d, adding candidates in UK elections must not act as news presenters, interviewers or presenters of any type of programme during the election period.Conservative deputy chairman Lee Anderson\u2019s Real World programme first aired last month, making him the latest in a string of Tory MPs to host a GB News programme.There is surely something wrong with members of this House asking questions at the same time that they're running very political campaigns on televisionHis party colleagues Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, Esther McVey and Philip Davies also host shows on the channel.Tory former culture secretary Nadine Dorries hosts a weekly chat show on Talk TV, although she is planning to stand down as MP for Mid Bedfordshire at some point.Speaking in the Commons, former minister Mr Brennan (Cardiff West) asked: \u201cIs the (Electoral Commission) preparing any guidance about this new trend we have for members of this House who may be candidates at the next election being given their own TV programmes on some of these new news channels, interviewing members of the Government from their own benches in the lead up to a general election?\u201cWhat is the Electoral Commission doing about that?\u201dMr Thompson (Midlothian) replied: \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent question.

How to enjoy the Northern LightsFor an enjoyable viewing of the aurora borealis, the ideal conditions include having a cloudless, clear night sky.The best way to get the most out of the spectacular sky will be to find a dark location that isn\u2019t heavily impacted by light pollution, and face the northern horizon.READ MORENasa\u2019s Hubble telescope captures image of supernova from over 11 billion years agoNASA volunteers set to live in a simulated Mars habitat for a whole yearBetelgeuse Supernova 2023: Could the star blow up?UK\u2019s mission to become \u2018global power in space\u2019 back on track, ministers sayWhat causes the Northern Lights? The Northern lights are caused by activity on the surface of the Sun. Solar storms cause the star to expel large clouds of electrically charged particles, some of which eventually collide with the Earth.

Catley gave Brosnan no chance with the penalty, striking the ball with her left foot firmly into the top corner of the Ireland net.The penalty appeared to ease the Australian nerves and Mary Fowler, who had replaced Kerr up front, almost immediately stormed forward and lashed a shot high over the bar. Australia striker Caitlin Foord headed the ball across the face of goal in the 68th minute but that presaged Ireland's best period of the game as they launched wave after wave of attacks. Megan Connolly came close with a free-kick in stoppage time which whipped just over the angle of the post and crossbar to give the Australians in the crowd a mighty fright. The Irish continued to pour forward in search of an equaliser and Katie McCabe forced Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold into a save before Louise Quinn headed the ball just past the post in the dying seconds.Australia, however, held on to make a winning start to a tournament in which they feel they can be genuine contenders after wins over England, Spain and France this year."}, {"_id": "64b942e251ac3324fe4fad8b", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/swedish-embassy-baghdad-protest-koran-muqtada-al-sadr-b1095583.html", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Iraq expels Swedish ambassador as man desecrates Koran in Stockholm", "lead": "Diplomatic blow-up comes hours after protesters angered by the planned burning of a copy of the Koran stormed the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad", "author": "Michael Howie", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:29:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:22.604227", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:29:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/2023-07-20T115539Z_661407540_RC2X62AZFS1B_RTRMADP_3_IRAQ-SWEDEN-PROTEST-KORAN.JPG?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Iraq has ordered the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador and the withdrawal of the Iraqi charge d\u2019affaires from Sweden as a man desecrated of a copy of the Koran in Stockholm.The diplomatic blow-up came hours after protesters angered by the planned burning of a copy of the Koran stormed the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad, breaking into the compound and lighting a small fire.The Swedish Embassy announced it had closed to visitors.

for eight weeks after upholding the allegations and finding he had damaged the reputation of the Commons.Thursday is the last day for Mr Pincher, who remains MP for Tamworth, to lodge an appeal against the committee\u2019s findings, but the summer recess means even if he does not appeal, MPs will not be able to approve his suspension until September.Former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both received \u00a318,660 after resigning, while former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng received \u00a316,876.Rishi Sunak received a payment of \u00a316,876 after resigning as chancellor in July

As well as being a site of archaeological importance, its claim to fame is that it was the birthplace of the global china clay industry in the 18th century, which went on to become one of Cornwall\u2019s great exports.The hill is home to Castle Pencaire, an Iron Age hill fort, and a 20th century war memorial / Lillicrap ChilcottIncluded in the sale are 70 acres of hilltop land, a war memorial, Bronze Age burial mounds, the Iron Age hillfort of Castle Pencaire, two Iron Age defended settlements, a well-preserved medieval field system and, in case that wasn\u2019t enough to tempt you, a quarry.\u201cI\u2019ve worked with interesting properties in estate agency in Cornwall for the last 20 years, and this is the only time we\u2019ve ever offered something quite as unique and special as this \u2014 a proper Cornish landmark and a hill that can be seen for tens of miles around in every direction,\u201d says agent Guy Morse. The neighbouring Godolphin Hill, belongs to the National Trust. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for something like this to ever be in private ownership.\u201dCastle Pencaire, the Iron Age hillfort, sits on the summit of the hill, and would once have been a place for trade and focal point for community gatherings. To its south is a Bronze Age barrow where a Roman coin hoard was once discovered.There are public footpaths on the hill with panoramic views for walkers / Lillicrap ChilcottOn the northern slopes of Tregonning Hill, meanwhile, are two smaller defended farmsteads, as well as a system of field strips which have been grazed in more recent times. The hill is protected as a Scheduled Monument, while part of it is also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Because of this, it is not possible to build on the hill.\u201cThe views are almost incomparable \u2014 they stretch for miles and miles in every direction,\u201d says Morse. To the south is the English Channel, with the sweeping, sandy beaches of Mount\u2019s Bay and the tiny island of St Michael\u2019s Mount, topped by a castle. Further afield are the white sand bays and clear blue waters of the Lizard Peninsula and the cliffs of Land\u2019s End. In the other direction, over the rolling countryside and beyond the sand dunes, is St Ives Bay, with the Atlantic Ocean stretching out before it. Tregonning Hill is intersected by public footpaths, which are popular with hikers. As Morse explains: \u201cPeople are prepared to walk to the top of the hill on a regular basis to see these views.\u201dThe hill is currently owned by a local person, who bought it from a neighbouring landowner and farmer who had used the land to graze cattle. The current owner, says Morse, has \u201cfelt like a custodian of [the hill] for the last few years\u201d, keeping the footpaths open and allowing others to enjoy the land too. \u201cShe liked the fact that she was the owner of it. It was this beautiful thing that sat behind her house and was something to be proud of.\u201d Now, however, the owner is selling due to ill health.

Some see the land as an investment, while larger conservation charities have been attracted by the SSSI and fact that it is also a Country Wildlife Site. Tregonning has interested neighbours, been considered as a site for an alternative healing retreat and, for one potential buyer, even been eyed up as an engagement gift.\u201cAlmost inevitably, these kinds of pieces of land have fallen into various larger authorities\u2019 hands. The National Trust owns the majority of these things around Cornwall, and the majority of the coastline. For it to be available for sale by a private individual is really quite special,\u201d says Morse. \u201cIt\u2019s unique, and we\u2019re proud to be offering it for sale.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b942e451ac3324fe4fad94", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/environment/police-clydebank-activists-police-scotland-scottish-b1095715.html", "primaryCategory": "Environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police arrest 20 climate activists during protest targeting oil refinery", "lead": "A small group of This Is Rigged protesters still remain at the Nustar Clydebank oil terminal.", "author": "Laura Paterson", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:15:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:24.719950", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:15:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/ec2ad59244f99c6a2694f0fa74d75c65Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTM5MTYw-2.73052216.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Twenty climate activists have been arrested during protests targeting two oil sites.Police Scotland said arrests at Grangemouth oil refinery were over alleged public order offences and a breach of the peace.Climate campaign group This Is Rigged blockaded the Ineos site at Grangemouth and the Nustar Clydebank oil terminal early on Wednesday.Activists blocked gates, climbed on pipes and sat on top of tankers, vowing to \u201cshut down the Scottish oil industry\u201d, with the disruption forcing the closure of a tanker terminal at the Ineos refinery for several hours.An Ineos spokesman previously confirmed that manufacturing at the site was not affected.Read MoreEleven arrested after climate activists target oil sites in ScotlandWembley knife attack victim named by police as murder probe continues Former RAF officer jailed for three years for child sex offencesSPONSOREDAdventurers, it\u2019s time you considered the Berghaus Extrem collectionPolice Scotland said on Thursday afternoon that a \u201csmall group\u201d of protesters remain at the Clydebank site, along with police officers.The campaign group said three activists are on top of the silo at the Clydebank terminal and claimed there has been \u201cno oil tanker activity since they arrived at around 4am yesterday morning\u201d.On Wednesday, officers used specialist equipment including ropes and cranes to remove activists sitting on top of an oil tanker at Grangemouth.Fuel tankers were spray painted with \u201cThis is Rigged\u201d and \u201cstop oil\u201d.Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond said: \u201cTwenty people have been arrested and charged for offences under section 68 of the Public Order Act and breach of the peace at the Ineos site in Grangemouth on Wednesday, 19 July.\u201cDecisions about how to police protests require us to balance complex and often competing rights and issues.

Schools break up for the summer holiday this week, but figures obtained from the Passport Office indicate that 254,316 holidaymakers do not conform to the post-Brexit rules for entering the EU, Co-op Insurance reports. As of May 26, 2023, the HM Passport Office confirmed that this is the total number of passport-holders with a valid expiration date of more than 10 years since the date of issue. The data was gathered as part of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Passport Office, by Co-op Insurance. Travellers trying to go to the Schengen zone will be turned away at the boarding gates if their UK passport has been issued more than 10 years ago.Since the UK left the EU, UK passports now cannot be more than 10 years old when used to travel to the EU.This means you must check the date the passport was issued, as well as when it expires. The majority of people assume that an adult passport lasts 10 years. However, extra months might have been added to its expiry date if the previous passport was renewed before it fully expired. According to Co-op Insurance, 77 per cent of travel policies purchased so far in 2023 have been for a European destination, with a 32 per cent increase in travel policies sold, compared to last year. Graham Ward-Lush, head of travel at Co-op Insurance, says: \u201cFor many years, travellers renewing their passport before the previous one expired were able to carry over any remaining time left. Before September 2018, a maximum of nine months could be added to the replacement\u2019s 10-year length \u2014 meaning passports could be valid for as long as 10 years and nine months.READ MOREFirst British passports issued in King\u2019s name unveiledTravellers heading for summer getaways face long queues at Port of Dover\u201cPassengers may look at their passport, see that it does not expire until well after their return, and believe all is well.

But will that include the UK? And, if so, how much will it cost?What is TikTok Music?TikTok Music shares much of the same functionality as the other big streamers such as Amazon Music Unlimited, Spotify, and Apple Music.It lets you stream albums and songs from artists represented by the likes of Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music. Users can make and share collaborative playlists and save songs for offline listening.But that wouldn\u2019t be too groundbreaking on its own and TikTok Music has some features to appeal to the original app\u2019s userbase.READ MORESpotify is stopping iPhone users paying through the App StoreThreads hits 100 million users, as changes revealed: Tech & Science Daily podcastFor starters, it will provide personalised music recommendations accessible by that familiar vertical scrolling interface. This may sound appealing given how good the TikTok algorithm is at surfacing videos to match a user\u2019s interests.Speaking of those videos, it will also let you play full versions of the songs that accompany TikTok\u2019s most viral moments. It will also let you search by lyrics (which can appear alongside songs in real-time.) It even has a Shazam-style feature for identifying tracks.Perhaps aware of the challenge of attracting users of other services, TikTok Music lets you import your music library, too.Will TikTok Music come to the UK?For now, TikTok Music is only usable in five markets. It\u2019s available to all in Brazil and Indonesia, where it directly replaced parent company ByteDance\u2019s Resso app, which shut down last September in both. And it\u2019s now available as a closed beta in Australia, Mexico, and Singapore.Indeed, a recent press release from TikTok said that it has \u201cplans for further growth in other markets\u201d, albeit without more specifics or a timeline. This seems to be the early stages of a global rollout, then, but it could take some time. Resso launched in Brazil and Indonesia back in 2020, so it\u2019s not been a speedy transition to the world of streaming music for ByteDance, even if things are picking up pace with the closed beta in new territories.How much will TikTok Music cost if it comes to the UK?If it does come to the UK, expect TikTok Music\u2019s pricing to be in the same ballpark as Apple Music and Spotify.While it costs just R$19.90 (~\u00a33.27) a month in Brazil, that\u2019s the same price as both Spotify and Apple Music in the country. And the prices in Australia (AUD11.99), Mexico (MXN$115), and Singapore (S$9.90) all match the local prices for Spotify (right down to the options for students and families).In other words, should TikTok Music launch in Britain, it\u2019s virtually certain to match Spotify Premium\u2019s \u00a39.99 per month fee.

Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper described the pay offs as a \u201cslap in the face for all those who have seen their mortgages soar because of Truss and Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous mini-budget\u201d. \u201cIt is frankly insulting that whilst people struggle with the cost-of-living crisis, those responsible for their financial hardship are being showered with tens of thousands of pounds of tax-payers cash,\u201d she added."}, {"_id": "64b942e651ac3324fe4fad9a", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/womens-football-world-cup-opening-ceremony-new-zealand-australia-auckland-b1095658.html", "primaryCategory": "World", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lionesses ready to roar as haka kicks off a dazzling opening", "lead": "An unrelated shooting in Auckland couldn\u2019t dampen the tournament\u2019s message of unity or a host victory in the opening match.", "author": "Anthony France", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:07:10", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:26.196518", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T12:07:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/13/Lionesses.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "The Women\u2019s World Cup kicked off on Thursday with a spectacular opening ceremony and message of unity.

European champions England, who begin their campaign against Haiti in Brisbane on Saturday, are among the teams tipped for the title.

It included a haka as well as a \u201cunity dance\u201d with performers clad in the colours of all 32 competing nations.The 10-minute show climaxed with pop stars Benee and Mallrat singing the official song Do It Again.Fifa president Gianni Infantino has urged fans to \u201cseize the moment\u201d, adding: \u201cBe proud of what will be the biggest event that has been organised here so far.

These are major sums at a time when the average salary in the women\u2019s game worldwide is \u00a311,000, according to a Fifa report. Prize money has increased from \u00a323 million in 2019 to \u00a384 million.

Captains will wear Fifa\u2019s new Unite armbands but the world football governing body has been criticised for a lack of a pro-LGBTQ+ stance. It is a solution to the OneLove armband controversy that sparked the threat of sanctions being issued to countries, including England and Wales, during the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar last winter. While the new one will highlight a number of social issues, including inclusion, gender equality, indigenous people and peace, it doesn\u2019t contain rainbow colours associated with the Pride movement. The tournament is on course to be the most-watched Women\u2019s World Cup, with more than 1.3 million tickets sold, mostly in Australia, for the matches at 10 venues across nine cities. The take-up of tickets in New Zealand, which will stage 29 matches in Auckland, Dunedin, Wellington and Hamilton, has been more sluggish, with organisers having to give away thousands of seats.

The 40-year-old bowled without reward on the opening day, but put the disappointment of going wicketless behind him as Australian captain Pat Cummins drove the morning\u2019s first delivery straight to Stokes at cover-point to give Anderson only his fourth wicket of the series.England had taken the new ball at first opportunity on Wednesday evening and Stokes\u2019s decision to trust its first use to Woakes paid dividends as the seamer claimed his fourth wicket of the day with the late scalp of wicketkeeper Carey, Australia\u2019s last recognised batter, who feathered behind attempting to leave.With Anderson having made the breakthrough running in from his own end, Woakes was again given the nod from the other and looked to have wrapped the innings up inside the second over of the morning, only to be denied a first career five-for against Australia by the tightest of no-ball calls after Hazlewood had been caught by Crawley.The Manchester crowd\u2019s celebrations were cut short by third umpire Kumar Dharmasena, with Starc, at the non-striker\u2019s end, having already sprinted most of the way off the field ready to strap on his bowling boots for the start of England\u2019s innings.At that stage, Australia would have been all-out for 300 but, recalled to the crease, Starc helped build the total and eventually finished unbeaten on 36 as Hazlewood again guided Woakes to the cordon, this time with his front foot fine and the catch held by Duckett.Woakes finished with fine figures of five-for-62, taking his tally to the series to 11 wickets despite only having come back into the side for the Third Test at Headingley, where the all-rounder was also outstanding with the bat.\u201cHe was awesome, bowled fantastically,\u201d teammate Stuart Broad said at the close of play last night. \u201cWe all know what a talent Chris Woakes has been and what a servant he\u2019s been to English cricket.

When Farage first raised the charge that his account had been closed on political grounds, the bank let it be known that the problem was with his financial situation \u2014 itself hard to square with client confidentiality. But after Farage released a dossier from the bank alleging that his views are seen as \u201cxenophobic and racist\u201d and \u201cat odds with our position as an inclusive organisation\u201d, it was clear that he had indeed been dropped because of his views. Leaving aside the irony that a bank which requires a client to have \u00a33 million in savings or \u00a31 million in loans sees itself as inclusive, what we have here is straightforward discrimination on the grounds of politics. Coutts, 40 per cent owned by the taxpayer from its ownership by NatWest, is refusing a service because of a client\u2019s opinions and profile. Of course, banks are entitled to close customer accounts in the case of criminal activity \u2014 if a client is, say, suspected of money-laundering or of handling funds for IS \u2014 but this is very different from politics. A bank customer is entitled to hold strong public views on Communism or Brexit; that is not a bank\u2019s business. Now the Government is considering making free speech a condition of a banking permit, to nip any future Coutts-style behaviour in the bud. It is right. It is outrageous that banks should curb free speech. They should concentrate on decent banking practice: plenty of scope for improvement there.Don\u2019t be greedy Read MoreNigel Farage claims family had accounts rejectedCoutts picks a fight with the wrong manFarage praises Government plans to revoke banks\u2019 licences over free speech curbsSPONSOREDHow to keep your energy costs down all year roundTHE NHS is again cancelling routine appointments because of a strike \u2014 this time by consultants.

Yet their union has rejected the Government offer of a six per cent pay increase with contempt. It will be hard for them to muster quite the overwhelming public sympathy that was felt for the nurses given that their salary so much exceeds that of most patients. They should accept the offer.

The crowds, gathered for the denouement of Pride Month in Trafalgar Square, swell around the actress, undeterred by the London drizzle that falls gently on them. Dressed in a sheer lace slip dress, with a new Mia Farrow-inspired crop, Finney bellows, \u2018What time is it?!\u2019 from the foot of Nelson\u2019s Column, to which the crowd shouts back, \u2018It\u2019s Trans Pride!\u2019If anything, it\u2019s Yasmin Finney\u2019s time \u2014 and she is rising to the occasion with characteristic elan. \u2018For me, every month is Pride Month,\u2019 she explains, when we meet in the quieter setting of The Design Museum in Kensington. \u2018When Marsha P Johnson threw the brick at Stonewall, it was a pivotal moment. She was a Black trans woman, but she did it for all queer people. I feel like I have a little bit of Marsha P Johnson in me. I feel a spiritual connect to all of my ancestors that came before me and the power that I hold, the power that they held and the power that keeps on giving.\u2019 Does that great power come with even greater responsibility? \u2018It\u2019s a huge weight that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever going to fathom. I think, \u201cWow, what can I do next? What can I do to really make a change politically, environmentally, and [also] my well-being? What can I do to make sure that I\u2019m healthy and that my mental health is always first, but also putting my community first and impressing everyone and trying to fight for my rights at the same time?\u201d\u2019It sounds\u2026 exhausting. \u2018Who wants to live a life where they have to fight for rights? Especially at such a young age. I wouldn\u2019t want any person or any child of any nature to have to fight for their existence and their dignity. It\u2019s stripped away from you and you\u2019re kind of humbled. I\u2019m humbled all the time. I have this amazing life and I should feel amazing, but my trans identity is also a big part of me.\u2019I\u2019d never seen a young British trans character that I could look up to and be like, \u201cWow, that is who I am.\u201dFinney speaks with such passion and authority, it\u2019s all too easy to forget she is only 19 years old. It\u2019s even easier to forget that three years ago she was relatively unknown before answering a casting call splashed across social media for Elle Argent in the TV adaptation of Heartstopper. Based on Alice Oseman\u2019s YA books of the same name, the centrifugal force of the show is a group of four school friends grappling with the usual teen tropes of first love, friendship politics and wrestling with the cocktail of hormones that peaks around puberty.It was groundbreaking, too, with its tender depiction of sexuality and LGBTQ+ representation. To date, there have been no other notable examples of a young British trans woman playing a central character in a British drama. \u2018I was at school not that long ago. I can remember everything, and I remember specifically there being only a handful of shows that had any sort of representation. If they did it would be American shows. I\u2019d never seen a young British trans character that I could look up to and be like, \u201cWow, that is who I am.\u201d\u2019Yasmin Finney photographed by Fiona Torre for ES Magazine / ES MagazineTo the delight of Heartstopper fans (Heartstans?), the show is back for a second season this summer (and has been greenlit for a third, too). Finney teases that we will be seeing a lot more of Elle: \u2018[It was] amazing but also new for me. I just took it and I ran. I\u2019d still be learning my lines the night before filming, praying everything went well\u2026 it did, and I killed it every time.\u2019Art, it soon becomes clear, is a big part of Elle\u2019s evolution this season: hence Finney\u2019s choice of venue for our meeting. Though looking at past interviews, you soon discover she rarely does a trad \u2018sit down\u2019 conversation, preferring to roller-skate, trampoline or do anything that involves some sort of movement. \u2018It\u2019s about getting your mind going. I think it\u2019s so easy to sit in a room, with a phone there, and have all these things prepped, like a robot. I\u2019m always just like, \u201cOkay, what have I not said? What is a different side to me that I want people to know about?\u201d\u2019In terms of Elle\u2019s character, art \u2018really unlocks something. It\u2019s kind of like when you find a passion for something when you\u2019re so young, you just want to fulfil that. What\u2019s inspiring to me isn\u2019t just the fact that she\u2019s trans or unconditionally herself \u2014 I think it\u2019s that she\u2019s so ambitious and knows what she wants to do. She knows that she wants to go into that world and she\u2019s got her eyes on the goal.\u2019I\u2019ve always had the mindset of an independent womanGrowing up, was Finney just as driven? \u2018I was still getting to grips with who I was in high school. Drama became my passion, but it was a double-edged sword \u2014 I\u2019d get put into roles that were male roles [and] be like, \u201cUgh.\u201d\u2019 Being raised in a strict Catholic home in one of the poorest parts of Manchester also took a toll on her trajectory: \u2018Mum was obviously struggling, a Black woman barely able to afford meals and not having a husband to help her out. She didn\u2019t expect me to be feminine or flamboyant \u2014 she just expected me to be her ideal son, which was understandable. Because nobody really does expect that, you know?\u2019 Some would argue that the absence of a father figure only catalysed problems at home, but as Finney explains it only helped mould her into the woman she was destined to become: \u2018I\u2019d never had my life with a male figure in it, so I\u2019ve always had the mindset of an independent woman.\u2019Coming out at school was much easier. \u2018I think I came out as trans in Year 9. I was such a naughty kid, but I loved it and I had the best friendship group\u2019 \u2014 and formative experiences were shaped by books and films that captured what it meant to be trans. \u2018Paris is Burning [was] very iconic for me and I remember watching it under the bedsheets, thinking, \u201cWhat. Is. This?\u201d I remember watching it on my mum\u2019s phone and feeling the need to hide and have this moment to myself.\u2019At the time, Finney was also privately navigating access to hormone therapy on the NHS, something she soon discovered was woefully inadequate. \u2018I think hormone replacement therapy is not talked about enough,\u2019 she says. \u2018The system that we are in now [with] the NHS is a minimum five-year waiting list to get even a consultation for your HRT. It\u2019s a long process. And, if you\u2019re not privileged enough to be able to get private care, it can really make you overthink and [ask], \u201cIs this the right path for me?\u201d It\u2019s definitely a tactic that the Government employs, to make you wait all this time just to think and overthink.\u2019Yasmin Finney photographed by Fiona Torre for ES Magazine / ES Magazine\u2018Sixteen-year-old Yasmin wanted to be a model. She wanted to be\u2026 not even on the cover of a magazine, just to be valued as a gorgeous woman.\u2019 There\u2019s a beautiful irony that Finney has managed to start her hormone therapy properly now, \u2018completely self-funded\u2019 through lucrative brand campaigns and beauty endorsements with the likes of Tiffany & Co and YSL, all by simply being herself. The start of the therapy has left Finney feeling a little more fragile than usual: \u2018I\u2019m very emotional. My levels are just evening out and I\u2019m getting into the female puberty and it\u2019s kind of interesting. With my HRT I\u2019m seeing my breasts grow and a change in my mentality towards my body. I\u2019m feeling more confident within myself.\u2019There\u2019s another reason for this new-found confidence. While talking about her adopted pomeranian, Coco, who makes a sweet cameo on set during Finney\u2019s ES Magazine cover shoot, there\u2019s a Freudian slip. \u2018I\u2019m going through a second puberty as well as going through a pivotal time in my career and I\u2019ve also got a dog, I\u2019ve got another living orgasm that I\u2019ve got to look after\u2026\u2019 Wait, orgasm? A flash of a smile. \u2018Well, yes. I recently found someone but you never know, it\u2019s always up and down. But I\u2019ve got a good feeling about this one. We actually drove to Alexandra Palace yesterday \u2014 I mean, we went there for sunset and we didn\u2019t get the sunset, we kind of just got a whole lot of cloud and a whole lot of romance. Thank God I brought my blanket.\u2019 When it comes to dating, Finney confesses she is \u2018very picky. I\u2019ll have fun for sure, but when it comes to serious, serious relationships, I have to know. I\u2019ve been in relationships in the past, only one boyfriend, but leading up to relationships [it becomes] very sexual, like you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.\u2019Yasmin Finney photographed by Fiona Torre for ES Magazine / ES MagazineMakes sense, then, that Finney\u2019s immediate plans are firmly rooted in London, a long, hot summer of romance interspersed with walks in Battersea Park with Coco, catching the tennis at Wimbledon or some lowkey drinks by the river at her favourite pub, The Ship, in Wandsworth. Good thing, as from September things are going to ramp up with work. The juiciest rumour? That Finney is set to follow in the footsteps of Billie Piper and Jenna Coleman as the new assistant to Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s Doctor Who.\u2018Where\u2019s the cameras?!\u2019 she jokes when I bring the rumours up, deflecting like a pro. Being cast as Rose for the Doctor Who anniversary specials was \u2018a surreal moment. I grew up watching it \u2014 it was prestige television, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, and it still is. To be part of that world, and around some of TV\u2019s gold stars, is a blessing.\u2019 Not least because of the dishy new Doctor and fellow teen screen idol, Ncuti? \u2018We\u2019re absolutely intertwined, and I think we complement each other so well.\u2019Which brings us somehow to time travel. \u2018If I could go back to any decade? I love the Eighties \u2014 the big Afros, the flares, the roller-skates, the bold make-up. Sure, there were riots and movements, but everything felt pure and real.\u2019 Closer to home, if she could go back and speak to her younger self, what advice would she impart? \u2018Hold on.

Ticket sales and television viewing figures are one thing, but it is the football that will be remembered.As many as eight or nine teams could win this tournament, although there is clearly one side of the draw that looks easier than the other.Unfortunately for England, led by skipper Millie Bright, they are in that tougher side and, while a group of China, Denmark and Haiti looks very winnable, far greater tests lie ahead.The Lionesses\u2019 half includes Australia, Copa America champions Brazil, last year\u2019s Euros finalists Germany, France and Olympic champions Canada.The other side looks more straightforward, with Spain and reigning champions USA the favourites to make the latter stages.England will be relieved they have less travel than others. The Lionesses\u2019 group games are in Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney. Denmark, by contrast, have two trips across the country to Perth either side of their match with England in Sydney.England do not arrive here, though, with the flying form with which they entered Euro 2022. They have not scored in any of their past three games, while they are without captain Leah Williamson, Fran Kirby and Beth Mead.A row with clubs over the release dates for players for the pre-tournament training camp has not helped.

Those mismatches should only end with more investment in the women\u2019s game and this World Cup could provide a huge leap forward.The tournament is full of great storylines. The USA are looking to win an unprecedented third straight title, Australia as co-hosts are trying to inspire a nation, Germany want redemption after losing the final of Euro 2022 and France\u2019s golden generation are vying for one final shot at glory.And then there is England, who are aiming to follow up European success by winning their first Women\u2019s World Cup.

This stability makes Tether a good option for transferring value between exchanges, since Tether holdings are more likely to retain a stable value than other, more volatile, coins.However, stablecoins are not always stable.

No it won\u2019t. But without CCS, we won\u2019t do the long term stuff.\u201cA lot of the short term measures we need to cut emissions in the UK between now and 2030 are going to rely on continued fast pace of decarbonising power and fast focus on how we start to address heat more generally within the economy.\u201cTo move beyond that, to really start to make big inroads into decarbonising industrial processes, CCS is very much part of that.\u201dAlthough CCS technology has existed for several decades, it is still yet to be expanded at the scale needed to be effective in balancing CO2 emissions.The Government has said it is investing \u00a320 billion into developing CCS \u2013 which the Climate Change Committee has welcomed \u2013 as part of its strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Chris Stark, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, said CCS is necessary to reduce the emissions of difficult-to-decarbonise heavy industries like cement manufacturing.Environmental groups have long mistrusted CCS, seeing it as an excuse by the fossil fuel industry to keep on emitting rather than slowing down.Philip Evans, Greenpeace UK\u2019s climate campaigner, called CCS a \u201csmokescreen\u201d for oil and gas companies.He added: \u201cThe fact that the technology has a long history of failure, cost overruns, false starts and environmental liabilities just adds fuel to the theory that this is nothing but a way to prop up the industry.\u201cWith much of the world gripped by deadly heatwaves, we are seeing the consequences of the climate crisis unfold before our eyes.\u201cRelying on technologies that have a history of failure is not going to help the climate.

My best friend when I was a kid was a dog; my favourite show on TV was Scooby-Doo.But dogs are not universally benign. Some of them menace and kill. Of course, this is not entirely their fault. Dogs are bred for certain characteristics and behaviour. The affectionate golden retriever. The sweet cocker spaniel. The trustworthy German shepherd. And the aggressive pit bull. So aggressive, in fact, that they are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, along with three other breeds: the Japanese tosa, the dogo argentino and the fila brasileiro. Something odd has been happening recently in the relationship between dogs and humans in the UK. The average number of people killed by a dog each year between 2001 and 2021 was 3.3. Last year, however, 10 people were killed by dogs. Four of them were children. This year, five people have already been killed by dogs. The average number of people killed by dogs for 20 years was three \u2014 last year 10 people diedWhat has caused this spike is not a mystery but straightforward: six out of the 10 people killed last year were killed by a particular breed called the American bully. And this breed has killed two this year and is suspected of involvement in the other three cases. The American bully is related to the pit bull. It is a mixture of the American Staffordshire terriers and American pitbull terriers. But there is no clear figure of how many American bully dogs are in Britain because the breed is not recognised yet by any of the UK\u2019s main dog organisations. Its vicious presence is nevertheless felt in the country. In 2019, no American bully dog was seized by the police. At least 44 of them have been taken this year; this is significantly more than other breeds.

We should instead blame negligent or sinister owners. This is true to an extent. But it is the dog that is biting and maiming, not anyone else. And this line of argument \u2014 taking responsibility away from the dog \u2014 is of little consolation to the family of the seven-year-old girl in the Wirral who was recently attacked by an American bully dog. Nor is it of much help to the family of Jonathan Hogg, the 37-year-old dog carer and father of five from Greater Manchester, who was killed in May after playing with an American bully dog. He had his throat ripped out.We have banned pit bulls for over 30 years. And for good reason. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey \u2014 the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \u2014 should do the right thing and add the American bully to the list of dogs that are banned under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act. This should be done before more people are attacked and killed. Dogs can bring about immeasurable delight. But some of them can also be a source of terror. It is incumbent on all of us who love dogs to know the difference.Zharnel Hughes  / PAOur fastest manWho is the greatest English (or British) footballer of all time? This question is open to subjective opinion. Bobby Moore? Bobby Charlton? Wayne Rooney? There are so many variables at play, and expressing a preference is often a matter of prejudice rather than dispassionate analysis. But when you ask who the fastest British man of all time is, the question is beyond dispute because you can measure it in a definitive way. All you have to do is record the time. In June, 28-year-old Zharnel Hughes broke Linford Christie\u2019s British record in the 100 metres by running a time of 9.83 seconds. Born in the British overseas territory of Anguilla in the Caribbean, Hughes, left, is not a household name. He is not as well known as a Premier League footballer who starts for a top side.

Fifa has partnered with the United Nations to create sanctioned armbands that can be swapped or worn throughout the month-long women\u2019s tournament. There are eight armbands to choose from, highlighting issues such as inclusion, gender equality, indigenous people and peace.Here\u2019s what you need to know. What do the World Cup armbands mean?The Guardian reported that the armband themes were decided on after consulting with the 32 participating teams, players and United Nations agencies. The messages on the armbands are: Unite for Inclusion, Unite for Indigenous Peoples, Unite for Gender Equality, Unite for Peace, Unite for Education for All, Unite for Zero, Unite for Ending Violence Against Women and Football is Joy, Peace, Love, Hope and Passion.The Unite for Inclusion armband features the same colours as those used in the OneLove armband, with red, black and green (the Pan-African flag) signalling race and heritage, whilst pink, yellow and blue (the pansexual flag) signifying all gender identities and sexual orientations. In a statement, Fifa president Giani Infantino said: \u201cFootball unites the world and our global events, such as the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, have a unique power to bring people together and provide joy, excitement and passion.\u201cBut football does even more than that \u2013 it can shine the spotlight on very important causes in our society.\u201cAfter some very open talks with stakeholders, including member associations and players, we have decided to highlight a series of social causes \u2013 from inclusion to gender equality, from peace to ending hunger, from education to tackling domestic violence \u2013 during all 64 matches at the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201dResponding to FIFA\u2019s announcement, the FA said in a statement: \u201cWe know FIFA engaged with federations and players from around the world on the armbands to be worn at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. The next step is for our players to decide which of the options they will choose to wear.\u201dWhen England boss Sarina Wiegman was asked about the Lionesses\u2019 plans for a resolution, she said: \u201cI think there\u2019ll be a solution, I know there have been conversations.

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar, and in some instances punishable by death, so the use of the rainbow armband was deemed insensitive. England alongside six other nations announced their plans to wear it, but were forced to then back down after being threatened by FIFA.FIFA has now banned players at the Women\u2019s World Cup from wearing the rainbow armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights or the OneLove armband. There is now no specific armband that advocates for the LGBTQ+ community or that has the rainbow colours normally associated with the colours of pride.

It also installs and maintains energy systems, sells solar electricity, and offers energy products for generation, storage and consumption.Tesla markets and sells vehicles to consumers through a network of company-owned stores and showrooms.

However, your capital is at risk, your investment can go down as well as up, and you may not get your money back. If you are unsure as to the right investment, you should seek financial advice. How to buy Tesla sharesBefore you decide to open an account, you should set your investment goals, including the amount you wish to invest, the length of time you plan to invest for, whether you are comfortable with the risks involved and whether you can afford to lose some, or all, of the money.If you are looking to buy Tesla shares, the following steps will guide you through the process:1. Open a trading accountWhether you\u2019re an experienced share trader, or a beginner, you\u2019ll need to open an account with a trading platform.It\u2019s worth taking the time to review the costs involved - most, but not all, platforms charge a share trading fee and some may also charge an annual platform fee for holding shares.There are a variety of trading platforms available, from online DIY platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell and interactive investor, to app-based platforms such as eToro and Trading212.1eToroInvest in global and local stocks with ZERO commissionExplore over 2,500 stocks. Buy in bulk, or invest in fractional shares1eToroeToroBuy TSLA   \nOn eToro\u2019s Website*Your capital is at risk. Other fees apply. For more information, visit etoro.com/trading/fees.2. Where is Tesla traded?The ticker symbol for Tesla Inc is TSLA. Tesla is traded on the technology-focused Nasdaq exchange in the US which is open for trading from 9.30am to 4pm (Eastern time) from Monday to Friday.Most trading platforms allow you to purchase US shares. You will be charged a foreign exchange fee (typically around 1%, but may range from 0.15% to 1.5% depending on your platform). Many platforms also charge a slightly higher trading fee for buying US shares.If you plan to trade US shares regularly, it\u2019s worth looking at the best trading platforms as their fees can vary significantly. A small number of trading platforms, such as IG, allow you to hold your account in US dollars which may reduce the foreign exchange you have to pay.You will be requested to complete a W-8BEN form which allows you to benefit from a reduction in withholding tax from 30% to 15% for qualifying US dividends and interest.You will also have a foreign exchange exposure if you hold US shares. If the pound weakens against the dollar, your shares will be worth more in pounds sterling (and vice versa).As with UK shares, any profit on US shares will be subject to Capital Gains Tax, subject to your annual allowance (currently \u00a312,300). You will not have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you hold the shares in an Individual Savings Account or Self-Invested Personal Pension.3. Do your researchTo find out more about Tesla, visit the company\u2019s investor relations page.It\u2019s also worth comparing Tesla\u2019s valuation to other comparable electric vehicle manufacturers. One way is to look at the relative price-earnings ratios - shares trading on a high price-earnings ratio have high expectations of significant growth in the future.Another useful research tool is brokers\u2019 12-month share price forecasts, which are available on financial websites. There are currently over 40 brokers following Tesla shares, and their price forecasts give an indication of the upside and downside risk of the Tesla share price over the next year.4. Should you invest on a monthly basis or as a lump sum?People tend to buy shares either as a lump sum purchase, or drip-feed their investment on a monthly basis over time.Monthly investing is often referred to as a means of \u2018pound cost averaging\u2019, whereby making regular contributions helps to smooth out the highs and lows of the stock market. This provides some protection if the share price falls after you have bought shares, as you will effectively invest at the average share price over the whole period.However, drip-feeding your investment may sacrifice capital growth if the share price is rising and you may also pay more in share trading fees.5. Place your orderOnce you\u2019re ready to buy shares in Tesla, log in to your trading account. Type in the ticker symbol TSLA and the number of shares you want to buy, or the amount of money you want to invest.Many platforms also allow you to add a \u2018stop loss\u2019 after you\u2019ve bought the shares, which allows you to limit your losses if the share price falls. For example, if you buy shares at \u00a3100, and set a stop loss of \u00a390, your shares would be sold if the share price falls below \u00a390, limiting your potential loss to 10%.6. Monitor Tesla\u2019s performanceWhether you hold shares in just a few, or many, companies, you should review how your shares are performing on a regular basis.Monitoring your portfolio allows you to make any necessary adjustments, whether buying additional shares, or selling part of your holding.How to sell your Tesla sharesWhen you want to sell your Tesla shares, log in to your trading platform, type in the ticker symbol (TSLA) and select the number of shares you want to sell.If you\u2019ve made a profit, you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the sale of your shares. However, as mentioned earlier, this is not the case for tax-exempt wrappers such as Individual Savings Accounts.How to invest in Tesla indirectlyYou may make a profit if you invest in Tesla shares, however, holding shares in an individual company is higher risk than investing in a wide range of shares. A diversified portfolio should also reduce volatility.One option is to invest indirectly in Tesla by investing in a fund, investment trust or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Tesla shares, amongst others. These products provide a ready-made portfolio of shares in a number of different companies.There is a wide range of options, including global and US funds and investment trusts, together with ETFs that track the S&P 500 index.

All that changed this week \u2014 though I can\u2019t honestly say that I ever thought I\u2019d find myself welling up at a football advert. Particularly a seemingly standard montage of good goal-scoring and fancy footwork by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Antoine Griezmann. I mean, England fans are usually only made to weep by French players in World Cup quarter finals, right?Yet the tear-jerking twist is this: halfway through the advert comes the big reveal that what you\u2019ve just watched was, in fact, a deep fake.Those male footballers were actually France\u2019s women players \u2014 including Sakina Karchaoui and Selma Bacha \u2014 with the men\u2019s faces superimposed. It\u2019s exactly what we needed to see.When viewers don\u2019t know the gender of the footballers they\u2019re watching, they rate the quality of male and female players the sameWhy? Let\u2019s put it this way \u2014 a study published last week by the University of Zurich found that when viewers know they are watching men play, they rate the quality of the football as being much higher than that of the women\u2019s game. When viewers don\u2019t know the gender of the footballers they\u2019re watching, they rate the quality of male and female players the same.Simply: the argument that women\u2019s football isn\u2019t as popular, well paid or prominent as men\u2019s because the quality is lower, just doesn\u2019t add up. It\u2019s our preconceptions that get in the way.

The business, headquartered in California, offers streamed broadcasts as one of its key selling points.Netflix has more than 230 million customers in over 190 countries paying for television series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages.What\u2019s the latest from Netflix?These are Netflix\u2019s performance figures from Q2 2023, published on 20 July 2023: 5.9 million subscribers added in Q2 2023 (three times Wall Street expectations)Global subscriber base at 238.4 million, 8% up on 12 months agoQ2 revenue $8.2 billion, up 2.7% year-on-yearEarnings per share $3.29, up from $2.88 in Q1 2023Forecast Q3 revenue of $8.52 billionCrackdown on password sharing added significant number of subscribersNote: investing in companies comes with no guarantees, and your capital is at risk. When buying company shares, it\u2019s possible to lose some or even all of your money. How to buy Netflix sharesLet\u2019s take a closer look at what you need to know about buying and selling Netflix shares.Investing in share-based investments can be a good way to produce higher returns than cash-based investments. However, your investment can go down as well as up, and you may not get your money back. If you are unsure as to the right investment, you should seek financial advice.Before you decide to open an account, you should set your investment goals, including the amount you wish to invest, the length of time you plan to invest for, whether you are comfortable with the risks involved and whether you can afford to lose the money.If you are looking to buy Netflix shares, the following steps will guide you through the process:.1) Open a trading accountWhether you\u2019re an experienced share trader, or a beginner, you\u2019ll need to open an account with a trading platform.It\u2019s worth taking the time to review the costs involved - most, but not all, platforms charge a share trading fee and some may also charge an annual platform fee for holding shares.There are a variety of trading platforms available, from online DIY platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell and interactive investor, to app-based platforms such as eToro and Trading212.1eToroInvest in global and local stocks with ZERO commissionExplore over 2,500 stocks. Buy in bulk, or invest in fractional shares1eToroeToroBuy NFLX   \nOn eToro\u2019s Website*Your capital is at risk. Other fees apply. For more information, visit etoro.com/trading/fees.2) Where is Netflix traded?The ticker symbol for Netflix is NFLX. Netflix is traded on the Nasdaq in the US which is open for trading from 9.30am to 4pm (Eastern time) from Monday to Friday.Most trading platforms allow you to purchase US shares. You will be charged a foreign exchange fee (typically around 1%, but may range from 0.15% to 1.5% depending on your platform). Many platforms also charge a slightly higher trading fee for buying US shares.If you plan to trade US shares regularly, it\u2019s worth looking at the different platforms as their fees can vary significantly. A small number of trading platforms, such as IG, allow you to hold your account in US dollars which may reduce the foreign exchange you have to pay.You will be requested to complete a W-8BEN form which allows you to benefit from a reduction in withholding tax from 30% to 15% for qualifying US dividends and interest.You will also have a foreign exchange exposure if you hold US shares. If the pound weakens against the dollar, your shares will be worth more in pounds sterling (and vice versa).As with UK shares, any profit on US shares will be subject to Capital Gains Tax, subject to your annual allowance (currently \u00a312,300). You will not have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you hold the shares in an Individual Savings Account or Self-Invested Personal Pension.3) Do your researchTo find out more about Netflix, visit the company\u2019s investor relations page.It\u2019s also worth comparing Netflix\u2019s valuation to other comparable global streaming companies. One way is to look at the relative price-earnings ratios - shares trading on a high price-earnings ratio have high expectations of significant growth in the future.Another useful research tool is brokers\u2019 12-month share price forecasts, which are available on financial websites. There are currently nearly 50 brokers following Netflix shares, and their price forecasts give an indication of the upside and downside risk of the Netflix share price over the next year.4) Should you invest on a monthly basis or as a lump sum?People tend to buy shares either as a lump sum purchase, or drip-feed their investment on a monthly basis over time.Monthly investing is often referred to as a means of \u2018pound cost averaging\u2019, whereby making regular contributions helps to smooth out the highs and lows of the stock market. This provides some protection if the share price falls after you have bought shares, as you will effectively invest at the average share price over the whole period.However, drip-feeding your investment may sacrifice capital growth if the share price is rising and you may also pay more in share trading fees.5) Place your orderOnce you\u2019re ready to buy shares in Netflix, log in to your trading account. Type in the ticker symbol NFLX and the number of shares you want to buy, or the amount of money you want to invest.Many platforms also allow you to add a \u2018stop loss\u2019 after you\u2019ve bought the shares, which allows you to limit your losses if the share price falls. For example, if you buy shares at \u00a3100, and set a stop loss of \u00a390, your shares would be sold if the share price falls below \u00a390, limiting your potential loss to 10%.6) Monitor Netflix\u2019s performanceWhether you hold shares in just a few, or many, companies, you should review how your shares are performing on a regular basis.Monitoring your portfolio allows you to make any necessary adjustments, whether buying additional shares, or selling part of your holding.How to sell your Netflix sharesWhen you want to sell your Netflix shares, log in to your trading platform, type in the ticker symbol (NFLX) and select the number of shares you want to sell.If you\u2019ve made a profit, you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the sale of your shares. However, as mentioned earlier, this is not the case for tax-exempt wrappers such as Individual Savings Accounts.How to invest in Netflix indirectlyYou may make a profit if you invest in Netflix shares, however, holding shares in an individual company is higher risk than investing in a wide range of shares. A diversified portfolio should also reduce volatility.One option is to invest indirectly in Netflix by investing in a fund, investment trust or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Netflix shares, amongst others. These products provide a ready-made portfolio of shares in a number of different companies.There is a wide range of options, including global, US and technology funds and investment trusts, together with ETFs that track the Nasdaq index. However, you will pay an annual management fee for holding these products.1eToroInvest in global and local stocks with ZERO commissionExplore over 2,500 stocks.

A sudden downpour didn\u2019t dampen the atmosphere. More and more people arrived into the spotless square of corporate glass-fronted buildings and chain coffee shops, turning heads as kinksters in fetish gear began to outnumber business people in suits. For several hours the protesters staked out peacefully, waving a giant LGBTQ AI+ flag, and holding bold red and black placards. The placards read \u201cDeleted for existing\u201d and \u201cStop deleting people\u201d.Protesters from across London\u2019s sex-positive, queer and kink scenes came out in force in response to the alleged deletion of hundreds of queer and sex-positive Instagram accounts by Meta. Those affected claim the deletions came without warning, that a large number of accounts were removed during Pride Month \u2014 and that in all it constitutes a targeted attack on already-marginalised communities.The kind of content being removed isn\u2019t pornographic. It includes pictures of fully dressed kink-club attendees, pole dancing demonstrations with zero nudity, even selfies of people who \u201clook queer\u201d. Sex educators and therapists have reported instant bans for using the word \u201corgasm\u201d. Sexual wellness brands selling entirely legal products such as vibrators and lubricants have also had their accounts deleted. Even lingerie companies have been swept up in the mass deletions. READ MOREYou can\u2019t delete your Threads profile without deleting Instagram, so what are your options?Twitter threatens legal action over Meta\u2019s rival app ThreadsBlue ticks, crochet puns and no drafts or DMs: can Threads really convert a diehard Twitter addict like me?Meta has previously claimed that posts and accounts have been removed due to flagging by users as being sexually explicit \u2014 effectively shifting the blame to society, rather than their own policies or algorithms. But protesters say this excuse doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. Firstly, an Instagram user would need to be following one of these accounts to see the posts. Secondly, social media platforms have previously adjusted their policies and put in-app functions in place successfully to moderate content \u2014 in particular, the false information banners that sprung up across Facebook and Instagram during Covid. But with sex-positive content, there seems to be a more sweeping approach, compounded by long-winded and, protesters say, ineffective systems to dispute wrongful deletion.Although some Instagram accounts have since been restored, protesters say the reason given by Meta for the mass deletions was insufficient. They also say many accounts have yet to be restored, and censorship of sex-positive content is ongoing. Their demands include restoring the remaining deleted accounts, greater clarity on community guidelines, and a transparent investigation into why so many accounts were deleted without warning. The concept of sex-positivity has seen a relative boom in recent years, with TV shows such as Netflix\u2019s Sex Education and documentaries like Planet Sex, presented by Cara Delevingne, opening up conversations about sex, sexuality and sex ed in schools. Online, though, there is an debate about how sex is allowed to be presented, with platforms such as Instagram and TikTok accused of censoring the word \u201csex\u201d itself, along with anatomical words including \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201cvulva\u201d.\u201cFrom a freedom-of-speech perspective, it\u2019s absurd that companies like Meta are treating alternative sexual communities this way,\u201d says Myles Jackman, a lawyer specialising in obscenity. Referencing moves last year by Mastercard and Visa to distance themselves from adult content, Jackman points out that sex is coming under attack from big businesses in many different ways \u2014 despite the old adage that sex sells.Lucy Young\u201cAs a community with 700,000 followers, deletion almost broke us,\u201d says Karl, an organiser of the protest and founder of Klub Verboten, a members-only kink nightclub that started in 2016. \u201cSo many of us only ever connect through this platform and channel, so losing it means, effectively, that we do not exist.\u201dLondon\u2019s sex-positive scene has grown in recent years, in no small part due to the pandemic. During lockdown, sex toy brands reported 200 per cent increases in sales in the UK. Kink communities banded together to survive lockdown, with communities rallying behind crowdfunders to keep spaces alive. Kink clubs and queer spaces are nothing if not varied. At one party you\u2019ll find couples (and groups) of people in fetish gear having sex out in the open while techno music blares. At another you\u2019ll watch a beautiful burlesque show. At another you could attend an interactive workshop on tantric massage or learn shibari, the Japanese art of rope tying.At introductory meetings, often called \u201cmunches\u201d, like-minded folks can chat in a relaxed atmosphere. These spaces are a refuge for people who may feel different and a platform for sex education, especially as it relates to inclusivity and consent. For the most part, these spaces survived the pandemic, but internet censorship is posing a new threat.So many of this community only ever connect through this platform, so losing it means we do not existHanny Amin runs Klub Verboten\u2019s Instagram account. She says she was being particularly careful about the type of content she was posting, but the account was deleted without warning on June 22. This had a massive impact on the club financially. \u201cAt a recent event we only had about 70 people, it would usually be double that \u2014 people weren\u2019t seeing our promotion on Instagram.\u201d Helena Kate Whittingham, director of Lover Management, a creative agency specialising in intimacy, has been instrumental in organising the protest and the online campaign #stopdeletingus. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that we need to make this much noise for accounts to come back,\u201d says Helena, \u201c[Meta\u2019s] appeal system does not work. Their tech is failing and we\u2019re picking up the pieces. Sometimes people think it\u2019s not that important, an Instagram account being deleted, but for this community that is your digital self. It\u2019s you that\u2019s being deleted.\u201d Reed Amber, a sex educator, sex worker activist, and host of the \u201cF**ks Given\u201d ComeCurious podcast, says her account has been deleted nine times. At the protest she holds up a sign which says \u201cSuspended just for existing.\u201d Reed feels that Meta isn\u2019t doing enough to protect people like her online. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you the number of unsolicited dick pics I receive,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy are those able to get through, but when I post educational content about sex, it gets flagged and deleted?\u201dReed says this kind of censorship has a huge impact. Like a number of people we speak to at the protest, she describes the community as \u201cvulnerable\u201d \u2014 facing prejudice in daily life. \u201cWhen people in this community are deleted, the feelings of shame that we work so hard to overcome, and to help others to overcome, those feelings start to well up again.\u201dProtester Hanny Amin outside Meta HQ  / Lucy YoungAccording to the Office of National Statistics, sex work contributes \u00a35.7\u2009billion annually to the UK economy. And yet, sex workers and sex educators are protesting just for the right to exist on one of the world\u2019s largest social media platforms. \u201cIt is 2023,\u201d says Myles. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still being beholden to these backwardly moralistic, totally arcane, ideas about sex.\u201dAcademics including Myles also reference an American law-change that is having knock-on effects here in the UK. The FOSTA/SESTA Act, which was passed by the Donald Trump administration in 2018, changed the liability that social media platforms have for content posted by users, forcing them into more heavy-handed policing of content.Dr Carolina Are is a social media censorship researcher at Northumbria University\u2019s Centre for Digital Citizens and has been advising Meta on policies. \u201cI think this issue could easily be solved by a system which allows users to opt in or opt out of certain content,\u201d Dr Are says.It is 2023 and yet we\u2019re still beholden to backwardly moralistic, totally arcane attitudes around sexMJ Fox, co-founder of queer space Joyride, agrees. \u201cI think a lot of us in this community would love to be able to put a content filter on our posts. We\u2019re not out there trying to push sexual content in everyone\u2019s faces. But currently there are no capabilities to do that.\u201d\u201cIt comes down to this vague idea of perceived risk of harm,\u201d explains Reed. \u201cBut who is being harmed? People who are being persecuted in society and then find themselves censored online experience real, measurable harm.\u201dAt the protest, a security guard approaches one of the organisers, who is wearing a hi-vis jacket over a latex bodysuit. The concern seems to be that the protesters have plans to damage the building, or to throw paint. \u201cWhy would we do that?\u201d Karl says, laughing. A woman in thigh-high platform boots chips in: \u201cWe\u2019re nice people, you know.\u201dLucy YoungThe community is looking forward. And although some express concerns that censorship could get worse before it gets better, today\u2019s protest is one of the first times so many different spaces and groups have rallied together. And they\u2019re encouraging others to join in.\u201cWe\u2019ve made a resource off the back of this,\u201d says Helena. \u201cMaking noise works. There\u2019s a list that you can add your name to if you\u2019ve been deleted.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s freedom of expression, ultimately,\u201d says MJ. \u201cAnd perhaps that\u2019s a way people can support.

The show tells the story of \u201chow the meeting of an inspirational teacher, Peter Farquhar (Timothy Spall) and a charismatic student, Ben Field (\u00c9anna Hardwicke), set the stage for one of the most complex and confounding criminal cases in recent memory.\u201cThe Sixth Commandment explores the way in which both Peter and Ann were manipulated by Field, capturing the extreme gaslighting, the gripping police investigation, and the high-profile trial, while poignantly highlighting the devastating effect of isolation and loneliness, as Field closed in on them. \u201cIt also celebrates both Peter and Ann\u2019s lives as cherished mentors, much-loved relatives, and adored friends.\u201dThe Sixth Commandment is airing across four episodes \u2014 each lasts an hour and is being broadcast on BBC One at 9pm. Episodes one and two were on Monday and Tuesday, with episodes three and four on next Monday and Tuesday, but you can catch up on iPlayer if you missed the first two.What is the true story behind the Maids Moreton murders?The real crimes that the series is based on began less than a decade ago, and concerns the deaths of English lecturer and novelist Peter Farquhar and his neighbour, Ann Moore-Martin, a retired primary school headteacher.Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin lived three doors down from each other in Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire, and died two years apart in mysterious circumstances.They were both religious \u2014 Mr Farquhar was an evangelical Christian and had considered becoming a minister before starting in education, and Miss Moore-Martin was a devout Catholic.Both Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin found themselves the target of PhD student and churchwarden Ben Field, who set out to scam them both out of their hard-earned money.Field murdered his lover, Mr Farquhar, through alcohol poisoning and was sentenced to 36 years in prison in October 2019. The murderer admitted to drugging Mr Farquhar in order to inherit his house and money.Mr Farquhar lectured at Buckingham University, where Field studied and, as the pair grew closer, the lecturer wrote Field into his will in 2013 before they moved in together two months later.During their relationship, Field had a string of girlfriends and later started a sexual relationship with Mr Farquhar\u2019s neighbour, Miss Moore-Martin, who was 57 years his senior.READ MOREStephen Lawrence murder: 50-year-old Matthew White named as sixth suspect for first timeThe Sixth Commandment: BBC releases first look images of chilling true-crime dramaThe best summer TV to binge in 2023: from Black Mirror to Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s ChampionOver two years, Field topped up Mr Farquhar\u2019s drinks with bioethanol, gin, and poteen (Poit\u00edn), a high-strength Irish alcohol, and his food was laced with drugs.Jurors were told Field \u201csuffocated him\u201d when he was too weak to resist. Field left a half-empty bottle of whisky in Mr Farquhar\u2019s room to create a narrative that he had drunk himself to death and killed himself.Field also deleted numbers from Mr Farquhar\u2019s phone, which led him to believe he had done so himself but had forgotten. The lecturer even sought the help of specialist brain doctors but no-one could find out what was wrong with him.The convicted killer showed no remorse, and told the jury \u201che did it for no other reason other than it was cruel, to upset and torment Peter \u2014 purely out of meanness\u201d.Mr Farquhar died in October 2015 and then Field decided to move out of Mr Farquhar\u2019s home and went to live with Miss Moore-Martin, who lived three doors away.Miss Moore-Martin had expressed a desire to live with her family, who lived elsewhere in the country. However, as Field\u2019s manipulation grew stronger, she began to have less contact with her relatives.Field pressured Miss Moore-Martin to change her will, gaslighting her and writing \u201cmessages from God\u201d on her mirrors.Subsequently, Field claimed he needed money for a dialysis machine for his brother, among others things, ruses that led to Miss Moore-Martin handing over more than \u00a330,000. Then her health began to deteriorate and she was hospitalised after a seizure.Police were contacted by a family member with concerns about Field, whose links to Miss Moore-Martin and Mr Farquhar were subsequently uncovered. Miss Moore-Martin then died of natural causes and Field was accused of plotting to kill her, but was found not guilty.However, he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years for murdering Mr Farquhar and of defrauding Miss Moore-Martin, who had fortunately cut him out of her will before she died. The killer also unsuccessfully attempted to overturn his conviction."}, {"_id": "64b942ed51ac3324fe4fadb9", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/many-consultants-leaving-uk-for-better-pay-and-conditions-abroad-b1095689.html", "primaryCategory": "Business News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Many consultants \u2018leaving UK for better pay and conditions abroad\u2019", "lead": "Thousands of consultants are on strike across England in a dispute over pay.", "author": "Pa Reporters", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:09:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:33.814450", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T11:09:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/12/f64f3e1bed18a2a5f59a0e68e5d4f017Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5OTMxMDM5-2.73057400.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Hospitals are losing experienced surgeons and medics to places like Australia and Abu Dhabi because they can earn far more, NHS consultants have said as they took to picket lines.Consultant gynaecologist Tracy Jackson, who works at St James\u2019s Hospital in Leeds, was on the picket line at Leeds General Infirmary.She told the PA news agency: \u201cI never expected to be standing on a picket line.

But it\u2019s more about you, your family and about me as I want the NHS to be there when I need it.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe need the most senior doctors to be there to train the juniors. If the senior doctors are leaving for Australia or the Middle East, or taking retirement early, or leaving the NHS completely, who will be there to train the next generation of doctors?\u201dMr Aftab said medicine is central to his family but this is now changing: \u201cI belong to a family of doctors. All my siblings are doctors. We all married doctors.\u201cBut my son chose not to become a doctor. My elder brother\u2019s two sons chose not to become a doctor.\u201cThis is the first time in the whole family, basically.\u201cThey are all going into finance and banking because they feel that we work too hard for too little reward.\u201dAround 100 consultants and their supporters gathered at the main entrance to Leeds General Infirmary.Many of the stream of cars entering and leaving the site honked their horns in support.Meanwhile, Ben Hockenhull, a consultant at St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, said it was a difficult decision to join the strike.\u201cNone of us want to leave our patients without care but we are doing this because without enough doctors and enough other clinical staff to do the job, the NHS will not be here to serve our patients,\u201d he said.He outlined why pay was such a focus: \u201cSince I started medical school back in 2004, our pay has decreased by over 35%\u2026\u201cI\u2019m getting job offers from around the world\u2026 more than double my current remuneration package with added benefits and things like my professional expenses are paid for. Currently I have to pay for those myself.\u201cWatching my colleagues disappear from the UK, taking up those benefits packages abroad, moving to Australia and moving to New Zealand, moving to the Middle East, means that those of us that are left behind are the ones who are having to try and keep the service afloat.\u201cThat\u2019s making us more more stressed and more burnt out.\u201dElsewhere, psychiatrist Polly Christodoulou, 41, who has been a consultant for three years and joined the BMA picket at King\u2019s College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, said: \u201cI think a lot of consultants are being tempted to move in to the private sector or abroad because the pay is better.\u201cWe feel we are not paid properly for the level of skills and expertise that we have.\u201cA lot of us have trained for 15-years-plus to get to where we are and that is not being valued.\u201dShe added: \u201cI want to stay in the NHS. The NHS is where I trained. The NHS is what got me to where I am now and it is where I got my skills and knowledge.\u201cI want to be able to stay and support the NHS but it is becoming more and more difficult.\u201dConsultant surgeon Lindsey Barker, 59, of Deptford, south-east London, who was also on the picket at London\u2019s King\u2019s College Hospital, said the strike was \u201cnot so much about our pay but the impact of austerity on the health service\u201d.Doctors\u2019 salaries have \u201cdisproportionately been affected by pay cuts because we are a soft target\u201d, she said.\u201cWe are largely perceived conservative with a small C and universally perceived as being very well paid.\u201cThings are being cut back so we can\u2019t deliver what you want to be able to deliver, and if you don\u2019t value the people who are doing that, then how are you going to value the service?\u201dMs Barker has been a doctor for 33 years including 20 as a consultant.She said staff \u201care having to manage a service that is increasingly cut\u201d.She added: \u201cWhen we went into the pandemic we had been cut back in the NHS to such an extent that the only thing left to cut were salaries.\u201cIt all puts a lot of pressure on staff.

The city is falling behind its rivals with lagging productivity. This isn\u2019t just the Brexit-hit to its service economy. London is lagging because growth is being strangled.The entire system is broken, maintaining stagnation with thousands of vetoes. Instead of a real Mayor with the power and instruments to power up the economy, we\u2019ve got a hamstrung one who ends up being largely symbolic. And that\u2019s by design. The way London works is that councils hold lots of economic power \u2014 from planning and permitting to licensing \u2014 but aren\u2019t responsible for the economy they operate in, or benefit from any rewards by growing it. This means they have the worst incentive structure possible for growth. Which is to throttle it and keep things the same for activist (read Nimby) local residents.The councils are suffocating London. It is happening across the city. In east London, you\u2019ll find Newham council, which blocked plans to expand City Airport\u2019s jobs-fuelling expansion plans on grounds it would disturb local residents who had brought flats overlooking its runways. Who benefits? Not London. The entire system is broken, maintaining stagnation with thousands of vetoesIn central London, you\u2019ll find Westminster council, which vetoed the Mayor\u2019s \u2014 again growth powering plan \u2014 to pedestrianise Oxford Street, again, on grounds of residents off Britain\u2019s busiest shopping street might not like it. These geniuses, instead of cutting the ribbon on a world-class attraction, have now been forced to literally pay retail stores to open up there to stop the proliferation of candy stores. Again, who benefits? Are a few millionaire flat-owners happier? Though I doubt it as Oxford Street decays. The answer: not London. This same council \u2014 which frankly, given how concerned it is about the good night\u2019s sleep of inner London millionaires, is Labour in name only such is its enmity for jobs \u2014 has been trying its best to asphyxiate Soho. Remember the brief period of outdoor dining? That was growth. The council nixed it. Should a few streets in London\u2019s nightlife core be turned into a real late city with more 3am licences? Absolutely. Businesses are ready to do it. But they say Soho residents have rendered this all but impossible. A clutch of boomer millionaires are vetoing the 24-hour city. But above all the Green Belt is asphyxiating the city. Growth means letting people move to where the jobs are. It means accommodating the immigrants that arrive. It means freeing their incomes from servicing spiralling rents and mortgages. But the way the Green Belt is currently administered means it is blocking house building: even within a 10-minute walk of commuter rail stations feeding our economic hub. It is absurd that a stroll away from Taplow, now a Crossrail station, there are agricultural fields \u2014 inaccessible to the public and of no natural merit whatsoever \u2014 wedged between there and the M4. Release them.

The next government, and that looks like Sir Keir Starmer, needs a plan to let the city\u2019s economy grow. This should involve a new government for London Act empowering the Mayor to champion the city\u2019s economy and neutering the councils who do much to harm it. Good policies are at hand. Ant Breach, an expert at the Centre for Cities, in a forthcoming report proposes that an empowered mayor be given the power to zone areas with automatic planning approval for certain types of housing, ending the discretionary system, overrule obstructionist councils and the tools to fund projects like social housing or infrastructure with devolved business rates. This is the kind of thinking London needs. Simply zoning 3.7 per cent of the Green Belt within 10 minutes walk of a commuter rail station could allow for a million new homes. This must happen \u2014 but with a deal where for every square mile released an equal amount will be converted into parks and trails. This is a vision of the growing, greener and above all fairer London we need. And the rest of Britain needs to power it to a better future.Ben Judah is the author of This Is Europe: The Way We Live Now out now with Picador "}, {"_id": "64b942ee51ac3324fe4fadbb", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/business/money/upward-march-in-two-and-fiveyear-fixed-mortgage-rates-goes-into-reverse-b1095660.html", "primaryCategory": "Money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Upward march in two and five-year fixed mortgage rates goes into reverse", "lead": "Average two and five-year fixed-rate homeowner mortgages edged down on Thursday, according to figures from Moneyfactscompare.co.uk.", "author": "Vicky Shaw", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 11:04:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:21:34.364636", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-20T11:04:17+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "EveningStandard", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/20/11/20111850-f814c6d7-1b7f-46ac-b161-6d7f63aeec92.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "The upward march in fixed mortgages rates has gone into reverse, according to figures from a financial information website.The average two-year homeowner mortgage rate on the market edged down to 6.79% on Thursday from 6.81% the day before, Moneyfactscompare.co.uk said.Five-year fixes fell back to 6.31% on Thursday, down from 6.33% on Wednesday.The last weekday that both two and five-year fixed-rate mortgages fell compared with the previous day was in May, Moneyfacts said.On Wednesday, it emerged that inflation had slowed quicker than expected, giving a glimmer of hope for under-pressure mortgage borrowers.Read MoreMordaunt: no blank cheque for nuclear deterrentTech-savvy UK businesses to invest in AI to replace staff and cut costs \u2013 HSBCSunak says \u2018our plan is working\u2019 ahead of by-election testSPONSOREDRaise your glass to a premium gin with a differenceThe Office for National Statistics said the Consumer Prices Index fell to 7.9% last month, down from 8.7% in May.The Bank of England uses base rate rises as a tool to subdue inflation.The Bank is still expected to raise interest rates \u2013 currently at 5% \u2013 at its next meeting on August 3 as it battles to bring inflation back to its 2% goal.But experts have said the bigger-than-expected fall in inflation could see the Bank\u2019s policymakers opt for a smaller increase of 0.25 percentage points rather than another 0.5 percentage point rise.There are huge hopes interest rates on mortgages will fall, but it could take a few weeks for that kind of sentiment to surface in the market - especially with another base rate decision on the horizonSome mortgage experts have said swap rates, which lenders use to price fixed-rate mortgages, have been calmer in the past few days, resulting in fewer product pulls from lenders.The Co-operative Bank was among some lenders launching new fixed-rate mortgage deals on Thursday.Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: \u201cThe mortgage market has seen some competitive deals surface this week, but it will be down to the borrower to decide whether now is the time to grab a deal or wait and see what may surface in the coming weeks.\u201cThere are huge hopes interest rates on mortgages will fall, but it could take a few weeks for that kind of sentiment to surface in the market \u2013 especially with another base rate decision on the horizon.\u201dMark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: \u201cWhile swaps fell on the inflation news and are fairly steady today, there is unlikely to be any immediate change in mortgage pricing from the vast majority of lenders.\u201cLenders are likely to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach until we have a calmer or less volatile period in the swap market before reducing rates.\u201dThe signs are positive but inflation is still very high, so the Bank of England will undoubtedly increase the base rate a bit furtherMyron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, said: \u201cFor those seeking to buy or remortgage, it is worth consulting a mortgage adviser to explore your options.\u201dWriting on website Newspage, Kirsty Wells, a director at Blueprint Mortgages & Protection, said: \u201cLenders have still been emailing this week to advise of rate increases, so I think it is too early to breathe a sigh of relief just yet.\u201dJustin Moy, managing director at EHF Mortgages, said on the website: \u201cThe signs are positive but inflation is still very high, so the Bank of England will undoubtedly increase the base rate a bit further.\u201dElliot Cotterell, director at Windsor Hill Mortgages, told the website: \u201cLenders tend to factor in changes to their rates in anticipation of increases to the Bank of England base rate and rather than reducing them straight away, I think we are more likely to see them hold and take a breath rather than jump into reducing rates.\u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019ll see a pause on the aggressive rate pulls but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be lucky enough to see a flurry of lenders reducing rates just yet.\u201d"}]
