Keir Starmer\u2019s party said it wanted banks would be forced to help mortgage holders struggling with payments.The opposition is urging the government to compel lenders to allow borrowers to temporarily switch to interest-only payments, or to lengthen their mortgage period.Banks would also have to wait at least six months before starting repossession proceedings under a five-point plan set out by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves on Thursday.\u201cInstead of squabbling over peerages and parties and ruling out any action on\u00a0mortgages, the Tories should be taking responsibility and acting now,\u201d said Ms Reeves.Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt under pressure to help mortgage holders  (AFP via Getty Images)Annual mortgage repayments are set to rise by \u00a32,900 for the average household re-mortgaging next year, according to economists at the Resolution Foundation.The (IFS) said 1.4m homeowners \u2013 half of whom are under 40 \u2013 will see a fifth of their\u00a0disposable income wiped out by soaring\u00a0mortgage rates.Mr Hunt is set to meet the banks to urge them to offer more support, but the government has rejected calls from Tory backbenchers to bring in mortgage interest rate tax relief, and dismissed a Liberal Democrat plan for \u00a3300 a month grants for struggling mortgage holders.Dismissing such moves as \u201cinflationary\u201d, Mr Hunt said the government would \u201cstick to its guns no matter what the pressure from left, right or centre\u201d.Former Bank of England rate-setter Andrew Sentance told\u00a0The Independent\u00a0there is \u201cgreat danger\u201d in thinking the government will \u201cstep in to solve all known problems\u201d.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says banks must be forced to offer more help  (PA Wire)Former chancellor Philip Hammond said it was still possible to avoid a recession \u2013 if the Sunak government considered relaxing post-Brexit immigration rules to help boost the economy.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Bank [of England] has got much choice [but to tip the country into recession] unless the government does something pretty significant intervening in the labour market in a different way,\u201d Mr Hammond told LBC.The ex-chancellor added: \u2018I think the government has regarded any relaxation of migration rules as being politically toxic. But rising mortgage rates on the scale we\u2019re seeing is also politically toxic.\u201dAdding to criticism of the Bank of England, Anna Valero, another member of the Hunt advisory group, said the MPC had previously failed to act decisively enough to hike rates.But she warned against overcorrecting now, and the current doom-mongering about an \u201cinevitable\u201d recession. \u201cIf we push too hard we could push the economy into a recession and then not get the business investment we need. If that happens then ultimately we\u2019re not going to see productivity pick up.\u201dCharles Goodhart, a former member of the MPC, said Mr Bailey and the Bank chiefs faced a \u201cnasty dilemma\u201d when it meets this morning to decide on the rate rise.RecommendedTories face \u2018blue wall\u2019 wipeout from mortgage time bombMr Goodhart said the MPC could \u201ceither raise Bank rate by half a per cent and get attacked for mortgages and driving UK into recession, or raise by a quarter of a per cent and lose credibility as an inflation resister, and appear to allow a wage price spiral to strengthen\u201d.Professor Abhinay Muthoo, an economist and fellow at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, warned against further interest rate rises.\u201cInflation is a problem, but it is under control \u2026 We really don\u2019t need to raise rates yet further. There is a risk from doing so of putting the economy into recession, which will hurt deeper.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940cec51ac334f3a315ecf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tippa-irie-interview-windrush-75-victims-b2361271.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dancehall legend Tippa Irie on Windrush: \u2018Black Britons are still not accepted\u2019", "lead": "<p><strong>Exclusive</strong>: Speaking to The Independent for Windrush 75, the musician born Anthony Henry speaks with Nadine White about staying successful over a four-decade career, racism in Britain and his new biography Stick To My Roots</p>", "author": "Nadine White", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 07:38:27", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:16.559412", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T07:38:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/01/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Whereas Anthony Henry is a bit more reserved and shy; not so confident. When I\u2019m not performing, that\u2019s who I am.\u201dBorn Anthony Henry, Tippa is the man who helped to popularise the \u201cfast chat\u201d style of emceeing in the UK dancehall scene. His was an original sound: cheeky, conversational lyrics about everything from love to social justice, delivered with astute, contemplative flair over pulsing rhythms.Armed with charisma and imagination, not to mention a formidable stage presence that puts him in a league of his own, Tippa has been hailed by music legends including Yellowman and Peter Metro. In reggae scenes around the world, he is revered as a pioneer.Throughout his illustrious career, Tippa has collaborated with a number of global artists. You might have heard him on \u201cHey Mama\u201d by US group the Black Eyed Peas in 2004, for which he earned a Grammy nomination. Maybe you\u2019ve heard his collaborations with Jurassic 5, soul icon Alexander O\u2019Neal, the Far East Band and Congo Natty, aka Rebel MC.It\u2019s not surprising, then, that the 58-year-old is inundated by fans as he sits down for an interview in Brixton, the south-London district that welcomed his Jamaican parents after they migrated to England in the Sixties. \u201cTippa, I just have to shake your hand. Legend,\u201d one nervous fan tells him. \u201cTippa, big up yourself!\u201d says another. \u201cLong time, Tippa,\u201d one old pal says, greeting him. \u201cHow are you?\u201dRecommendedBritain marks the Windrush anniversary with the story of its Caribbean community still being writtenWhat is Windrush Day and how will the 75th anniversary be marked?King hails \u2018profound and permanent\u2019 contribution of Windrush generationBrixton is where Tippa created his first track, aged 17, before joining Saxon Studio International, an iconic south London sound system responsible for launching the careers of Maxi Priest and Smiley Culture, to name a few. At its peak, this collective was The Beatles of UK dancehall. Tippa enjoyed an explosion in success during the Eighties, as he and his Saxon peers were courted by labels including Island Records, Greensleeves, and Virgin Records.After signing a recording contract with Greensleeves in 1984, Tippa released a string of hits including \u201cGood To Have That Feeling\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re The Best\u201d, \u201cComplain Neighbour\u201d and \u201cHello Darling\u201d, which hit No 1 on the UK reggae chart and crossed over to Number 22 on the UK Top 40 Chart.He has gone on to tour across all seven continents around the world and in between, captivating crowds and releasing numerous tracks over the years including more recent offerings\u201cI\u2019m An African\u201d, \u201cFlat Foot Hustle\u201d and \u201cHot Like Fire\u201d.Yet, for all his success, Tippa comes across as unassuming and laid back, as we chat over chicken wings, fried plantain and orange juice in a Jamaican restaurant on \u201cthe ends\u201d.

Tippa started his musical career as a teenager on his father\u2019s sound system, Musical Messiah in the 1970s.The senior Mr Henry ran a greengrocers shop on Brixton\u2019s Coldharbour Lane by day and hosted shubeen parties by night. Meanwhile, Tippa\u2019s older sister Jacqui would perform at gigs at legendary jazz venue Ronnie Scotts, as a member of the band Metropolis, while his late younger sister Avril, who went by the name \u201cMiss Irie\u201d, was also an MC who regularly performed with her older brother. She died in 1999.Tippa\u2019s own music career was sparked by rave reviews from his schoolmates after he performed chatting lyrics in a school assembly when he was 15. Word of the sleepy-eyed teen\u2019s talent spread, and he began to enter competitions around Brixton. Many of the local sound systems in the area also recognised his talent and invited him to perform on their platform. The rest, as they say, is history. (Tippa Irie (3))Not everyone immediately envisioned the heights to which Tippa\u2019s talent would propel him. After his father retired to Jamaica in 1981, when his son was 16, he was amazed to see Tippa performing onstage in the six years later atReggae Sunsplash, a leading festival or \u2018stage show\u2019 in the country at the time.\u201cMy mum was always supportive of my career,\u201d Tippa says. \u201cShe\u2019d ask, \u2018Why are you always sitting down writing lyrics?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Mum, you will see.\u2019 When \u2018Hello Darling\u2019 came out, then mum saw me on Top of The Pops. She said, \u2018I get it now.\u2019\u201dFollowing the success of \u201cHello Darling\u201d, Tippa bought his mother a house. \u201cI was always confident that I\u2019d make it in the business,\u201d he says. \u201cI believed in myself.\u201dLongevityThe pioneering Windrush migrants brought with them an effervescent energy and the unique sounds of the Caribbean. This didn\u2019t just influence the UK music scene... it transformed it altogether. New arrivals like Tippa\u2019s parents carried with them Jamaica\u2019s sound system culture and a fusion of musical influences that eventually birthed quintessential Black British genres, from UK lovers rock to homegrown iterations of Jamaican dancehall. Newer genres such as grime music would follow decades later.Faced with chronic discrimination, alienation from wider British society and a lack of access to broadcast platforms, the Windrush migrants and their children had the fortitude to develop a sense of community and preserve their culture through music.And, for those who were present to witness Black Britain in the Seventies and Eighties, it seemed that a reggae industry was beginning to thrive through the production of music, formation of labels, launching of record shops, importing of records from Jamaica and staging of events for Black Britons by Black Britons.In 2023, such an industry does not exist. Few venues consistently host Black events, and even fewer are Black-owned; reggae and dancehall music is marginalised in mainstream spaces. Many of the great artists of yesteryear, who came up with Tippa, have long been forced to either give up music or perform on evenings and weekends, alongside their 9-5 jobs. Where many of them should be millionaires and household names, few outside of Black communities know who they are. So what happened?\u201cRacism,\u201d Tippa says, without hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason. As Black British artists of my generation, it\u2019s difficult for us because we\u2019re here and our tunes are not being played on the radio stations that pay money. Even \u201cSilly Games\u201d by Janet Kay or \u201cHopelessly in Love\u201d by Carroll Thompson don\u2019t get played on Smooth or Magic, but you may hear a Bob Marley.\u201d (AFP via Getty Images)He continues: \u201cThe people at the helm of these stations don\u2019t respect our music. You can\u2019t tell me that if they play \u2018Sexual Healing\u2019 by Marvin Gaye, they can\u2019t play a smooth Don Campbell, Lloyd Brown, Peter Hunnigale or Bitty McLean track.\u201cIf we got played on these stations, we\u2019d have more money and power. Evidently, this isn\u2019t what gatekeepers want. Even when there was a reggae industry, the mainstream didn\u2019t support us. Our music is just as good as any other genre\u2026so why isn\u2019t it getting played on the radio?\u201dHe quotes an old saying: \u201cIf you get airplay, you get a lot of say.\u201d\u201cThe reason why a lot of artists are broke is because of this lack of support,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to have a fair playing field, so that listeners can judge for themselves, the kind of music they want to hear.\u201cA lot of time, if you don\u2019t get played on these stations, it\u2019s harder to tour. It\u2019s sad, and depressing that institutional racism \u2013 that\u2019s what it is \u2013 has brought about this situation. The people in England don\u2019t really support their own; this is not our country, really, as Black people. \u201cThen when we go to Jamaica or the US, they\u2019re not paying us no mind there either. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones and I\u2019m grateful because I\u2019m still managed to survive.\u201dFour decades down the line and over a dozen studio albums later, Tippa is still able to live off of music on a full-time basis, collecting publishing cheques, operating a recording studio, voicing dubplates, touring and releasing new music. He also runs his own production company, Lockdown.HomeAs the UK celebrates the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush shop on Britain shores in 1948, many people of Black Caribbean heritage describe the occasion as \u201cbittersweet\u201d, while victims of the Windrush scandal are still waiting for compensation.Tippa agrees.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because there\u2019s so much money being wasted in this country \u2013 the PPE scandal, billions on Brexit \u2013 but the government can\u2019t give some of those billions of pounds to the people that came here to help build it,\u201d he says.\u201cThat\u2019s just another reason why I\u2019d never accept an MBE. I can\u2019t relate to this country when it comes to our people, Black people, because we\u2019re always getting the rough end of the stick because it\u2019s not our country. We\u2019re the minority here and maybe if we had a bit more unity amongst ourselves too, we might be a bit further along.\u201cStill, when it comes to Windrush Day, we have to big up our mums, dads, grandparents; they put up with a lot when they came here, so that we can be here doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\u2018Empire Windrush\u2019 arriving at Tilbury Docks (Getty)The Windrush scandal brought into sharp focus a dilemma that many Black Britons feel: where to truly regard as \u2018home\u2019. Is it the land in which you were born, and can evidently be expelled from under certain circumstances, or the land of your parents\u2019 birth?\u201cUs Black Brits, because we\u2019re not accepted in England and then when we go to our parents\u2019 birth countries, we are still regarded as foreigners,\u201d Tippa summarises.\u201cI really love Jamaica. I love the food, the tropics, the weather...but as much as it is like home, it\u2019s still not because I am not from there. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d (Tippa Irie)Tippa describes his new biography, Stick To My Roots, out in August, as a \u201chistory lesson\u201d that breaks down his life and times to date in intricate detail, from soaring to the top of the industry to dodging bullets as villains stuck up his performances in gritty, New York-based dances.It\u2019s certainly been quite the journey.\u201cFocusing on my craft, investing in myself and putting my energies into what I do has enabled me to survive in the music industry for 40 years,\u201d the artist says.RecommendedThe 22 greatest Glastonbury performances everThe earthy magic and lawless energy of being a child at GlastonburyN-Dubz interview: \u2018We\u2019re still young\u2026 we look good, we sexy, we here baby!\u2019\u201cI\u2019ve managed to be disciplined when it comes to writing songs, who I work with, how I treat people - you treat people how you want to be treated yourself.

and finally, beginning to accord a rightful place to those men and women of the Windrush generation.\u201cThe 10 portraits in this series, together with the tributes to other members of that indomitable generation, are a small way to honour their remarkable legacy.Charles speaks with a guest during a reception at Buckingham Palace to celebrate the Windrush generation (PA Wire)\u201cIt is, I believe, crucially important that we should truly see and hear these pioneers who stepped off the Empire Windrush at Tilbury in June 1948 \u2013 only a few months before I was born \u2013 and those who followed over the decades, to recognise and celebrate the immeasurable difference that they, their children and their grandchildren have made to this country.\u201dHe added: \u201cThose pioneers, who arrived in a land they had learned about from afar, left behind all that was familiar to them.\u201cMany served with distinction in the British Armed Forces during the Second World War, just as their fathers and grandfathers had in the First World War.\u201cOnce in Britain, they worked hard, offering their skills to rebuild a country during peacetime and seeking opportunities to forge a better future for themselves and their families.\u201cWhen they arrived on our shores with little more than what they were able to carry with them, few could hardly have imagined then how they, and those that followed them, would make such a profound and permanent contribution to British life.\u201dCharles said it is his \u201csincere hope\u201d that the portrait project acts as a reminder that \u201cour society is woven from diverse threads, each comprising stories of remarkable courage and sacrifice, determination and strength\u201d.He added: \u201cThough drawn from different parts of the world, they collectively enrich the fabric of our national life and the remarkable tapestry of the Commonwealth.\u201cThis year, as we honour the legacy and achievements of the Windrush generation, I dearly hope that we can continue to embrace differences, listen to each other\u2019s stories, and learn from one another\u2019s experiences.\u201cIt is these stories that help light the path of progress and remind us of a fundamental truth: that though we might all be different, every individual, no matter their background, has something unique to contribute to our society in a way that strengthens us all.\u201dLast week, Charles hosted a Buckingham Palace reception where he met the 10 individuals whose faces have been immortalised in paint, and was given a special preview of the

Is my baby going to die?\u201dMrs Javed said: \u201cThe words go round around my head every single day.\u201cAlongside the grief and pain, I can\u2019t get them words out of my mind.\u201dThe BBC reported that in one of the voice recordings Anwar can be heard telling his wife not to challenge him, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t challenge me, do not be that British woman.\u201dHer daughter, who was about 17 weeks pregnant when she was pushed from Arthur\u2019s Seat, used her dying words to reveal it was her abusive husband who caused her to fall about 50ft before her body came to a rest.Daniyah Rafique, 24, managed to reach the dying employment lawyer on the side of the hill, where she was told: \u201cDon\u2019t let my husband near me, he pushed me.\u201dGiving evidence during the trial Mrs Javed said Anwar was \u201cabusive, controlling, manipulative, aggressive and violent\u201d towards her daughter.She told the BBC that he did not like the fact his wife was independent.Mrs Javed said: \u201c\u201dHe didn\u2019t like the fact that Fawzi had her own voice, her own opinions.\u201cHe didn\u2019t like that.\u201dShe said her daughter had contacted divorce lawyers to \u201cget the ball rolling\u201d but Anwar always said he would never divorce her.The mother told the BBC: \u201cHe used to say to Fawziyah, we don\u2019t have divorces in our family, we don\u2019t divorce, we stay in marriages, no matter what.\u201dSentencing Anwar in April, Lord Beckett said he had committed a \u201cwicked crime\u201d and had showed no remorse.He told him: \u201cShe was willing to trust that you would keep her safe when she agreed to accompany you on your project to climb Arthur\u2019s Seat despite a fear of heights and being pregnant.\u201cShe was entitled to expect your protection and support.\u201dLord Beckett added: \u201cAs a result of your actions, Fawziyah Javed died far from home on a Scottish hillside and her loving family are left devastated and will never be the same again.\u201cHad she lived she would have given birth to your child some months later, but that life was also extinguished by you.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940ced51ac334f3a315ed2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/people-bristol-lee-jamaica-windrush-b2362127.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Documentary on Bristol\u2019s Afrikan-Caribbean legends of martial arts released on Windrush Day", "lead": "Filmmaker Clive Smith is launching his documentary at Bristol Museum.", "author": "Aisling Grace", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 07:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:17.727301", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T07:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/22/08/21230532-be820cd5-104a-47c3-8ad5-bb64904a771d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

As a result, markets are now betting more heavily that the central bank will push its base rate to 5 per cent this week instead of a less severe move to 4.75, with chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying that government \u201cwill not hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank as it seeks to squeeze inflation\u201d.With these worsened expectations yet to be priced into existing mortgage deals, Moneyfacts figures showed the average rate of a two-year fixed deal had already risen to 6.19 per cent on Wednesday \u2013 up from the 6.01 figure which prompted warnings of a \u201cmortgage disaster\u201d on Monday.RecommendedInflation remains frozen on 8.7 per cent ahead of Bank decision on interest ratesRental costs now account for over 28% of earnings in decade high \u2013 reportMichael Gove says 25-year fixed rates could ease mortgage crisisKey PointsInflation remains frozen on 8.7 per cent ahead of Bank of England interest rates decisionSpeculation mounts over \u2018shock-and-awe\u2019 0.5% base rate increase tomorrowGilt yields: Cost of government borrowing hits new 15-year high, above Truss spike\u2018Hesitant\u2019 Bank of England \u2018needs to create a recession\u2019, says government adviserInflation at highest levels in 31 years, ONS chief economist warnsChancellor insists government won\u2019t be \u2018pushed off course\u2019 in goal to curb inflationShow latest update \n \n\n1687355192Thanks for following our live update, we are pausing our coverage for the afternoon. Katy Clifton21 June 2023 14:461687354515SNP claims Sunak took \u2018honesty lessons\u2019 from Boris JohnsonThe prime minister has taken his \u201chonesty lessons from Boris Johnson\u201d, the SNP has suggested.The party\u2019s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn questioned Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201ceconomic optimism\u201d over recent months.Consumer Prices Index inflation stayed at 8.7% in May, the same as in April, despite experts forecasting a fall to 8.4%.The Office for National Statistics meanwhile said the increase in food prices slowed from 19.1% in April to 18.4% in May.In the Commons, Mr Flynn said: \u201cIn February the Prime Minister told this here House that borrowing costs are back to where they should be, in March he boasted we are on track to halve inflation by the end of the year, and in May he then said economic optimism is increasing.\u201cGiven the dire economic reality of today, is it not now clear that he has taken his honesty lessons from Boris Johnson?\u201dRishi Sunak replied: \u201cHe also failed to mention that not just the Bank of England, not just the OBR, not just the OECD, but also the IMF, all of them have upgraded their growth outlook for the United Kingdom economy this year.\u201cWhilst he and others were predicting this country would enter a recession, the actions of this Government have meant that we have so far averted that, and we continue to be on track to keep reducing inflation because that is the right economic priority.\u201dCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned Mr Flynn to be a \u201clittle bit more cautious\u201d and not imply Mr Sunak had intentionally misled MPs.Jane Dalton21 June 2023 14:351687352831Sunak still on course to fulfil inflation pledge, No 10 insistsDowning Street has insisted Rishi Sunak is still on course to fulfil his pledge of halving inflation by the end of the year despite it remaining stubbornly high.The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThat remains the target.\u201dAsked if they are on track to fulfil the promise, they added: \u201cYes. Despite some of the coverage at the time [of the announcement of the pledge] this was never something that was straightforward. It was rightly an ambitious target that we remain committed to and it can only be achieved with fiscal discipline.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 14:071687351803Why is inflation so high?Today\u2019s gloomy figures show that inflation struck 8.7 per cent in May, still considerably down from the 11.1 per cent peak it hit late last year but now stagnant since April.Prices rocketed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February caused the price of energy to shoot higher, adding to pressure from supply disruption.It contributed to higher costs for firms making products or offering services, while labour costs also started to rise.Since then, higher food and drink prices are a key reason why inflation has failed to fall as fast as hoped. Olive oil, eggs and cheese are among items to see the sharpest increases over the past year.However, according to the ONS, core inflation \u2013 which excludes items such as food and energy \u2013 is also at its highest level for 31 years.

The UK had the highest growth of any G7 country in both 2021 and 2022. The eurozone is currently in recession, we are not. Is it not time we heard more good news, talking Britain up?\u201dRishi Sunak replied: \u201cHe is quite right to highlight the improvement in our economic outlook and he is right to highlight the good, positive news showing the strength in the underlying economy. I know that he joins with me in saying that our economic priority right now must be to continue to bear down on inflation.\u201cBut while we do that, we are putting the conditions in place to grow this economy. As he said, unlike the party opposite we won\u2019t talk Britain down, we will grow the country\u2019s jobs.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 13:161687348803Sunak accuses Starmer of \u2018dangerous, inflationary\u2019 policies as he is challenged on mortgage risesSpeaking at PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Rishi Sunak on mortgage rises, asking: \u201cHow is an extra \u00a32,900 a year on repayment delivering for homeowners?\u201dHe said: \u201cThe question he refuses to answer, he actually knows the answer to this question, is \u00a32,900 extra. That\u2019s the cost to the average family of the Tory mortgage penalty.\u201cNow he was warned by experts about this as long ago as autumn last year, but he either didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t believe it or didn\u2019t care because he certainly didn\u2019t do anything, and when I raised this a couple of months ago, he had the gall to stand at that despatch box and say he was delivering for homeowners. How is an extra \u00a32,900 a year on repayment delivering for homeowners?\u201dThe PM replied: \u201cPerhaps [he] could explain why interest rates are at similar levels in the US, in Canada, in Australia and New Zealand, why they\u2019re at the highest level in Europe that they\u2019ve been for two decades.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we have a plan to reduce inflation, but in contrast what do we hear from (him). He wants to borrow an extra \u00a328bn a year, that would make the situation worse .... He doesn\u2019t have many policies, but the few that he does have all have the same thing in common, they\u2019re dangerous, inflationary and working people would pay the price.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 13:001687348577Analysis | This has been Rishi Sunak\u2019s worst month as prime ministerOur columnist Andrew Grice writes:Today's worse than expected inflation figures are grim for the government and will increase the pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates tomorrow, therefore compounding the mortgage crisis. With the cost of a two-year fixed rate mortgage now above six per cent, Conservative MPs are increasingly jittery about the political impact of higher payments home buyers. The penny has dropped that the pain is going to last until the general election \u2013 whenever Rishi Sunak calls it.Sunak is not only haunted by Boris Johnson. The mortgage crisis shows he is also struggling to move on from the disastrous Liz Truss regime. Memories of that make it easier for Labour to hang the mortgage crisis round the Tories\u2019 necks rather than allow them to blame external events beyond their control like war in Ukraine.The inflation figures are another black spot in what is becoming Sunak\u2019s cruellest month as PM. They will supplant headlines about Johnson and Partygate \u2013 but only with grim economic news.This has been Rishi Sunak\u2019s worst month as prime minister | Andrew GriceDespite seeing off Boris Johnson, wave after crashing wave of economic turmoil \u2013 from mortage hikes to runaway inflation \u2013 is overwhelming any buoyancy Sunak might be feeling.

He is certainly keeping to that with his answer.\u201cHe knows very well the cause of the mortgage catastrophe - 13 years of economic failure and a Tory kamikaze budget which crashed the economy and put mortgages through the roof.\u201cSo, will the prime minister tell us how much the Tory mortgage penalty is going to cost the average homeowner?\u201dMr Sunak replied: \u201cThe honourable gentleman isn\u2019t aware of the global macroeconomic situation.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have deliberately and proactively increased the generosity of our support for the mortgage interest scheme, we have also established a new FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) ... duty which will protect people with mortgages, for example moving them onto interest-only mortgages or lengthening mortgage terms.\u201cWe have spent tens of billions of pounds supporting people with the cost of living, particularly the most vulnerable.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 12:311687346523Watch: Hunt vows to follow Tory plan to battle inflation \u2018no matter the pressure\u2019Jeremy Hunt vows to follow Tory plan to battle inflation \u2018no matter the pressure\u2019Andy Gregory21 June 2023 12:22\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a03Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64940cef51ac334f3a315ed9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/canada-us-coast-guard-newfoundland-titan-oceangate-expeditions-b2361908.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "OceanGate runs extremely safe operation, mothership spokesman says", "lead": "Questions were raised about the safety of OceanGate, which runs the deep-sea dives to the Titanic, during a press conference in Canada on Wednesday.", "author": "Joseph Draper", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 04:14:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:19.733543", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T04:14:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/21/6755502a233d5787debd73fa870da6ddY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDY0NDI3-2.72683368.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our Evening Headlines email for your daily guide to the latest newsSign up to our free US Evening Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

\u2018serious shock\u2019 for mortgage holders as Bank of England poised to raise interest rates45% of mortgage holders finding it difficult to pay bills, charity warnsThe senior Conservative politician, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, said exercises to prepare for a future pandemic were full of \u201cgroupthink\u201d, which he wished he had \u201cchallenged at the time\u201d.He said studies by the likes of Johns Hopkins University in the US had viewed the UK as being \u201cvery good at dealing with pandemics\u201d but said that assumption proved to be \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.\u201cWe hadn\u2019t given nearly enough thought to other types of pandemic that might emerge and that was, with the benefit of hindsight, a wholly mistaken assumption,\u201d Mr Hunt told the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel Hugo Keith KC on Wednesday.He suggested the government had \u201ctoo narrow a focus\u201d during Exercise Cygnus, a cross-government exercise in 2016 to test the UK\u2019s response to a serious influenza pandemic.The findings of Exercise Alice, modelling which also took place that same year to assess the impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), were not shared with him, he also revealed.\n\nThere was clearly a narrowness of thinking, of which I was part, which didn\u2019t think hard enough about that kind of potential pandemicChancellor Jeremy HuntMr Hunt said the Alice report was the \u201conly place\u201d where the \u201cimportance of quarantining\u201d was clearly laid out.He added: \u201cThe fundamental issue was that we were \u2014 and by the way not just us, across western Europe and North America \u2014 there was a shared assumption that herd immunity was inevitably going to be the only way you could contain a virus because it spread like wildfire.\u201dUK \u201cgroupthink\u201d had also led ministers and officials to think \u201cwe knew this stuff best\u201d, he said, adding that there was a \u201cnarrowness of thinking\u201d when it came to learning from Taiwan and South Korea, which had dealt with Mers.\u201cThey learned those lessons and there was clearly a narrowness of thinking, of which I was part, which didn\u2019t think hard enough about that kind of potential pandemic,\u201d Mr Hunt added.The Cabinet minister said that had officials understood the role of quarantining infected people, as discovered in East Asian countries during Mers, then the first coronavirus lockdown might have been \u201cavoided\u201d.Mr Hunt\u2019s evidence comes after Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden told the inquiry he was reassured during his time in the Cabinet Office, from July 2019 to February 2020, that the UK was in a \u201cpretty strong state of preparedness\u201d for any future pandemic.Mr Dowden also told the investigation that preparations for a no-deal Brexit put the country in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond to other challenges.The deputy premier\u2019s evidence session had followed on from Professor Sir Mark Walport, who told the inquiry the UK had not been \u201coperationally prepared\u201d for a pandemic.The former chief scientific adviser to the UK government said the focus in developed countries had \u201cmoved away from infectious diseases after the Second World War\u201d, with more attention on conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.It came after Lord Bethell, a Conservative former health minister, said \u201cmaking money is not a crime\u201d as he defended the VIP lane for coronavirus-related contracts, which saw some politically-connected firms make huge profits.The peer also blamed \u201clongstanding\u201d inequalities for the NHS not being sufficiently prepared for the pandemic.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveEnding the day\u2019s evidence, Mr Hunt

\u2018serious shock\u2019 for mortgage holders as Bank of England poised to raise interest rates45% of mortgage holders finding it difficult to pay bills, charity warnsThe senior Conservative politician, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, said exercises to prepare for a future pandemic were full of \u201cgroupthink\u201d, which he wished he had \u201cchallenged at the

\u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.\u201cWe hadn\u2019t given nearly enough thought to other types of pandemic that might emerge and that was, with the benefit of hindsight, a wholly mistaken assumption,\u201d Mr Hunt told the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel Hugo Keith KC on Wednesday.He suggested the government had \u201ctoo narrow a focus\u201d during Exercise Cygnus, a cross-government exercise in 2016 to test the UK\u2019s response to a serious influenza pandemic.The findings of Exercise Alice, modelling which also took place that same year to assess the impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), were not shared with him, he also revealed.\n\nThere was clearly a narrowness of thinking, of which I was part, which didn\u2019t think hard enough about that kind of potential pandemicChancellor Jeremy HuntMr Hunt said the Alice report was the \u201conly place\u201d where the \u201cimportance of quarantining\u201d was clearly laid out.He added: \u201cThe fundamental issue was that we were \u2014 and by the way not just us, across western Europe and North America \u2014 there was a shared assumption that herd immunity was inevitably going to be the only way you could contain a virus because it spread like wildfire.\u201dUK \u201cgroupthink\u201d had also led ministers and officials to think \u201cwe knew this stuff best\u201d, he said, adding that there was a \u201cnarrowness of thinking\u201d when it came to learning from Taiwan and South Korea, which had dealt with Mers.\u201cThey learned those lessons and there was clearly a narrowness of thinking, of which I was part, which didn\u2019t think hard enough about that kind of potential pandemic,\u201d Mr Hunt added.The Cabinet minister said that had officials understood the role of quarantining infected people, as discovered in East Asian countries during Mers, then the first coronavirus lockdown might have been \u201cavoided\u201d.Mr Hunt\u2019s evidence comes after Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden told the inquiry he was reassured during his time in the Cabinet Office, from July 2019 to February 2020, that the UK was in a \u201cpretty strong state of preparedness\u201d for any future pandemic.Mr Dowden also told the investigation that preparations for a no-deal Brexit put the country in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond to other challenges.The deputy premier\u2019s evidence session had followed on from Professor Sir Mark Walport, who told the inquiry the UK had not been \u201coperationally prepared\u201d for a pandemic.The

by a rise in the average number of hours spent in employment, according to the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) think tank and Advance HE report.More than three in four (76%) university students feel that the cost-of-living crisis has affected their studies, research has found.The proportion of university students who say they are in paid employment while studying has increased from 45% to 55% over the past year \u2013 and it has reached the highest level recorded by the think tank.The study, based on a survey of 10,163 full-time undergraduates studying in the UK, found the average time spent working is 13.5 hours per week among the students who reported being in paid employment.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal

full-time courseNick Hillman, director of Hepi\u201cThis suggests more students may be undertaking so much paid work it could adversely affect their studies,\u201d according to the report.It adds that the rise appears to reflect \u201cthe financial pressures that many students are under\u201d.The 2023 Student Academic Experience Survey, which was carried out between January and March, suggests that students in paid employment are\u00a0 more likely to consider leaving their course compared to their peers.\u201cA reasonable assumption here is that the demands of balancing work and study are creating pressures that are leading to the prospect of non-continuation for some,\u201d the study said.Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, told a press briefing in London: \u201cSomewhere between 12 and 17 hours paid employment is the danger zone because you\u2019re doing a really intense paid job on top of a full-time course.\u201cEverybody in the survey are full-time students so they should all be doing something similar to a full-time job and the average working hours is 33/34 hours.\u201cSo if you\u2019re doing 17 hours paid work on top of that, or 20 hours paid work on top of that, that\u2019s when it really affects your studies and it makes you more likely to drop out,\u00a0less likely to do well in your degree.\u201d\n\nUniversities are doing their bit by increasing hardship funding, offering subsidised or free food on campus and increasing other forms of pastoral support, but there is a limit to what they can do without action from governmentUniversities UK spokespersonThe report found that 26% of students said their studies were affected \u201ca lot\u201d by the cost-of-living crisis, while 50% of students said that their studies were impacted \u201ca little\u201d.Mr Hillman added that the survey shows that most students are being affected in \u201cadverse ways\u201d by the cost-of-living crisis.\u201cThe increase in the proportion of students who feel compelled to do so many hours of paid employment that their studies may suffer seems a particularly acute challenge,\u201d he said.The report calls on the Government to urgently look at the level of maintenance support on offer to undergraduates in light of the findings.Rose Stephenson, director of policy and advocacy at Hepi, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a risk here that students who, for a multitude of reasons are less able to rely on financial support from their families and therefore need to rely on maintenance loans or paid employment, are being disadvantaged and we can see that their studies are more likely to be affected.\u201cThis risks entrenching inequality through higher education rather than combating it.\u201dThe survey also found that more than one in four students (26%) said they feel lonely all or most of the time, compared with 23% last year.Students living at home with family, in non-university halls or in a house on their own are more likely to experience loneliness than those in university halls, or in a flat or house with others, the report said.A Universities UK spokesperson said: \u201cThis data definitively shows that students\u2019 university experience is being negatively impacted by the cost-of-living crisis.\u201cThe vast majority feel that their ability to study has been affected, with many having to take on increased hours working to

SVRs are set by individual lenders although they often follow base rate movements.Some 773,000 residential SVR mortgages are outstanding.The bulk of homeowners are on fixed-rate products, although around 2.4 million deals are due to end between now and the end of next year.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to meet banks on Friday to ask what help they can give to borrowers struggling with their\u00a0mortgage.Lenders have said they stand ready to help. Banks may offer various options to struggling borrowers, depending on individual circumstances, such as extending the length of the mortgage, offering a temporary payment holiday or temporarily switching to interest-only.Vikki Brownridge, CEO at StepChange, said: \u201cIn a short space of time StepChange\u2019s mortgage advice team has seen a sharp rise in the cost of borrowing among clients, who are facing on average an approximate \u00a3300 jump in monthly payments for a typical-sized mortgage now compared to before September 2022.\u201cWhile our figures show that increased pressure is not yet bringing more homeowners to debt advice, the risk is there as people cut back on spending or turn to credit to keep up with essentials and the wider cost of living.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) has renewed its guidance to lenders to treat borrowers fairly, and we would urge all firms to proactively engage with and support customers showing signs of financial difficulty early, as well as providing effective signposting to free debt advice.\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about meeting your mortgage payments, it\u2019s never too soon to get support \u2013 speak to your lender about your options or seek free and impartial debt advice from a charity like StepChange.\u201cWe have a dedicated free mortgage advice service, which is open to anyone, whether they are currently in problem debt or not.\u201dMore than 2,100 people were surveyed by YouGov for StepChange across the UK in May 2023.RecommendedKing hails \u2018profound and permanent\u2019 contribution of Windrush generationScottish ministers urged to \u2018resist\u2019 Illegal Migration Bill and mitigate impactScottish Government to publish further independence papers this summerAlfie Stirling, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \u201cThere is a strong case for the Bank to take a pause for breath, and better gauge the effects already in the system before they become irreversible.\u201dHe pressed for \u201crebuilding the UK\u2019s income safety net so that it reflects the actual cost of essentials, and investing in ways to reduce the UK\u2019s future exposure to price increases across the economic system, including through stronger public services, housing market reform and greater energy efficiency and security\u201d."}, {"_id": "64940cf451ac334f3a315eeb", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-government-scottish-westminster-building-nhs-b2361966.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Scottish Government to publish further independence papers this summer", "lead": "Independence Minister Jamie Hepburn has said voters can expect more publications in the Scottish Government\u2019s Building a New Scotland series.", "author": "Lauren Gilmour", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:24.885791", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/22/00/28cb66111cc2f30d440bf80f4f123382Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDU5ODcy-2.72673521.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHundreds of healthcare workers had suicidal thoughts during the Covid-19 pandemic, new research has found.Around one in 10 had such thoughts, and a minority said they had actually attempted suicide.Last week, a lawyer for the British Medical Association, Brian Stanton, told the Covid-19 inquiry many workers felt pressured to work without adequate protection, \u201cwith consequences for their mental and physical health\u201d.The new study, led by the University of Bristol and published in the PLOS One journal, looked at results from two surveys distributed to all healthcare workers, students and volunteers in 18 English NHS trusts during the pandemic.In the first survey, completed by 12,514 workers from April 2020 to January 2021, 10.8 per cent reported having suicidal thoughts in the previous two months, while 2.1 per cent had tried to end their own life.In the second survey, of 7,160 workers between October 2020 and August 2021, 11.3 per cent of workers who did not report suicidal thoughts in the first survey reported them six months later.Some 3.9 per cent said they had attempted suicide for the first time.RecommendedSuicidal NHS staff lose mental health support in \u2018irresponsible\u2019 cutsAll the evidence heard in the Covid inquiry so farA lack of confidence in raising safety concerns, feeling unsupported by managers and having to provide a lower standard of care contributed to staff distress, employees said, as well as exposure to things that went against their moral values.In March, health leaders warned that suicidal\u00a0NHS\u00a0staff\u00a0would be left in \u201cdangerous\u201d situations when national\u00a0funding\u00a0for the country\u2019s 40 mental health hubs was about to end.The British Psychological Society and the Association of Clinical Psychologists said failure to continue the funding was an irresponsible way to treat vulnerable workers.Last year, NHS staff sick days increased to 12 million, from 7.21 million in 2019. And the cost of mental health sick days almost doubled, from \u00a3279m to \u00a3468m, as staff anxiety and stress skyrocketed.NHS nurses went on strike in May  (EPA)Some health and care staff have spoken of feeling despair as services became overwhelmed during the pandemic and vital non-Covid care was postponed.One of the study\u2019s lead authors, Paul Moran, professor of psychiatry at the University of Bristol\u2019s Centre for Academic Mental Health, said: \u201cA supportive work environment is very important for staff wellbeing.\u201cIf managers offer insufficient support, this can have a very bad effect on staff mental health.\u201cNHS staff need to feel confident that when they flag concerns, especially about patient safety, these concerns are listened to by managers and are being addressed.\u201dPrianka Padmanathan, another study lead author, said: \u201cOur analyses show that among healthcare workers who had not experienced suicidal thoughts when first completing the survey, one in 10 reported experiencing them six months later.RecommendedConcerns raised as thousands of mental health patients forced to travel miles for treatment: \u2018Dehumanising\u2019\u201cAdditionally, almost one in 25 staff reported having attempted suicide for the first time.\u201dAn NHS spokesperson said staff mental health hubs were set up using non-recurrent funding until the end of this year, and that a final decision was yet to be made on 2023-24 funding.If you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch.\nIf you are based in the USA, and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline on 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

The state is around 5,000 square miles.He added: \u201cThe good news is we are searching in the area where the noises were detected.\u201dOn Titan\u2019s dwindling oxygen levels, he said: \u201cOxygen is just one piece of data. There are lots of pieces of data that we need to study. But (oxygen) is not the only thing that\u2019s important.\u201dThe vessel reportedly had a 96-hour oxygen supply in case of emergencies.Asked if they were still treating the passengers as alive, he added: \u201cThis is a search and rescue mission, no doubt about it\u201d.The US Coast Guard announced earlier on Wednesday that Canadian P-3 aircraft had detected underwater noises.The sounds were detected on Tuesday and then again on Wednesday but searchers \u201cdon\u2019t know what they are,\u201d Capt Frederick said.He said: \u201cYesterday a Canadian P3 detected underwater noises in the search area.\u201cAs a result ROV (remotely operated vehicle) operations were relocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises. Although the ROV searches have wielded negative results, they continue.\u201cThe surface search is now approximately two times the size of Connecticut, and the sub-surface search is up to 2.5 miles deep, exponentially expanding the size of the search area.\u201cWith the respect to the noises specifically, we don\u2019t know what they are, to be frank with you, they\u2019re P3 detected noises, that\u2019s why they\u2019re up there, that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing, that\u2019s why they put sonar buoys in the water.\u201dHe said \u201cwe\u2019re searching in the area where the noises were detected, and we\u2019ll continue to do so\u201d, adding that additional \u201cROVs will be there in the morning\u201d to help.Carl Hartsfield, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told reporters that the the noises are being analysed by \u201cthe best people in the world\u201d.He added: \u201cThe ocean is a very complex place, obviously human sounds, nature sounds, and it\u2019s very difficult to discern what the sources of those noises are at times, but I can tell you that this team has multiple sensors that are in the area, they\u2019re sending data back expeditiously to the best people in the world to analyse that data and they\u2019re feeding the results of the analysis back to the unified team and they\u2019re making decisions.\u201cThere have been multiple reports of noises and every one of those noises is being analysed, tracked, looked for patterns and reported upon.\u201dMr Hartsfield added that the noises have been described as \u201cbanging noises\u201d.Other potential man-made sources of the noises have to be eliminated, reporters were told.Asked if it was possible a ship in the ocean or some mammals could mimic the sound, Mr Hartsfield said: \u201cI can tell you from my experience with acoustics, that there are sounds, biologics that sound man-made to the untrained ear, but I can assure you that the people listening to these tapes are trained.\u201cThere are a lot of vessels in the area and they each make noise, so all of that has to be eliminated and it\u2019s analysis over time, plus the team is searching in the right area, so if you continue to do the analysis, look for different patterns and search in he right area, you\u2019re doing the best you can possibly do with the best people on the case.\u201dAn object spotted in the ocean by an aircraft during the search for Titan is not believed to be debris, Capt Frederick said.In a statement on their website, deep water specialists Magellan said they were contacted by OceanGate on Monday and \u201cimmediately\u201d offered knowledge of the site and expertise in operating at depth.The company added that it has been working with UK and US agencies to move its specialist equipment and support crew to St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, following instructions to mobilise from OceanGate.RecommendedOne in 10 health workers felt suicidal during pandemic, study finds57,000-year-old Neanderthal wall art uncovered in FranceKing and Queen\u2019s hopes of winning their first Royal Ascot race dashedThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) also said the UK-based Nato Submarine Rescue System (NSRS) team is available to offer expertise and guidance to the search operation.But reports indicate the the depths involved in the search \u201cgreatly exceed\u201d that which the NSRS can safely operate."}, {"_id": "64940cf851ac334f3a315ef7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-join-nato-fast-track-britain-vilnius-summit-b2361817.html", "primaryCategory": "Europe", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Britain backs fast-track Nato membership for Ukraine", "lead": "<p>\u2018We have seen Ukraine evolve quickly\u2019 says James Cleverly </p>", "author": "Kim Sengupta", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:44:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:28.074395", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T18:44:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/18/SEI161140752.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The reform of their armed forces are happening whilst engaged in conflict and I think the UK\u2019s position is that it would be very supportive if we moved on from the Membership Action Plan.\u201cWe recognise that the offer to both Sweden and Finland did not require MAP. The Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to military reform required for Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield, and I think all Nato allies recognise that.\u201dAlso speaking at the conference, the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, commented: \u201cPerhaps we don\u2019t require the MAP mechanism, something which was planned in 2008. We are now a long way from 2008; time has passed, the situation is quite different.\u201dThe United States has been cautious about Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership, with Joe Biden saying recently that his administration would not \u201cmake it easy\u201d for Kyiv to join. \u201cThey have got to meet the same standards [as other entrants], that is our position,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will happen, can happen, but it won\u2019t be automatic.\u201dHowever, senior White House officials indicated the president is \u201copen to\u201d waiving the MAP requirement for Ukraine, and Washington is facing mounting pressure from European allies to give firmer backing to Mr Zelensky on the issue.Krisjanis Karins, the Latvian prime minister, said: \u201cThe only chance for peace in Europe is when Ukraine will be in Nato.\u201d Failure to do so, she said, means \u201cRussia will come back.\u201dNato membership for Ukraine is seen as a deterrent to Moscow from continuous attacks and attempts in the future to carry out regime change in Kyiv. A member can invoke Article 5,\u00a0 under which an attack on one member by an outside power is regarded as an attack on all Nato states.However, it is precisely this prospect of Nato getting directly into war with Moscow that is cited in support of making Ukraine wait until the current conflict has ended.Ukraine will be the key topic at next month\u2019s Nato summit in Vilnius, one of the most important in its recent history.It remains unlikely that Ukraine will be offered immediate membership. The options being considered include guarantees that Western military support will continue, and that the Nato-Ukraine Commission, launched in 1997, will be upgraded to Nato-Ukraine Council, with a higher level of engagement.RecommendedThe Body in the Woods | An Independent TV Original DocumentaryThe harrowing discovery at centre of The Independent\u2019s new documentaryIt will be a symbolic as well as practical move; in 2002, a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia became a partner in the Nato-Russia Council but that ended with the annexation of Crimea by Moscow in 2014.Meanwhile, Britain has set out a package of support for Ukraine including $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in guarantees for World Bank loans and $305m (\u00a3238bn) in bilateral assistance.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRishi Sunak has been warned homeowners face a \u201cserious shock\u201d as the Bank of England prepares to hike interest rates for the 13th time in a row, piling more pressure on struggling mortgage holders.The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) said 1.4m homeowners \u2013 half of whom are under 40 \u2013 will see a fifth of their disposable income wiped out by soaring mortgage rates, while trade body UK Finance said it expects 98,500 borrowers to fall behind on payments this year.On Thursday the central bank is expected to increase the so-called base rate from 4.5 per cent to at least 4.75 per cent, and possibly as high as 5 per cent.It comes after a shock inflation reading on Wednesday showed the rate at which prices are rising flatlined in May at 8.7 per cent, instead of an expected fall.The predicted interest rate change \u2013 aimed at bringing spiralling inflation under control \u2013 will add further pressure to the bank accounts of millions of homeowners through higher monthly mortgage payments.The average rate on a two-year deal has already shot up to 6.15 per cent, Moneyfacts figures on Wednesday showed \u2013 almost triple the level seen last March.Influential think tank the IFS warns that the average mortgage holder will be \u00a33,360 worse off a year, or \u00a3280 a month, because of the increases, wiping out around a 10th of their disposable income.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA private company has been awarded a \u00a31.1m contract to provide health services at one of the government\u2019s controversial new large asylum accommodation sites.The NHS trust covering the disused RAF Wethersfield site in Essex said it made the agreement without any competition \u201cfor reasons of extreme urgency\u201d, after being told 1,700 asylum seekers would be moved there.Immigration minister Robert Jenrick announced the plan in March, but it has been delayed by legal challenges launched by the local council and residents, as well as refurbishment work and safety checks.The transformation of Wethersfield is part of a wider government scheme to reduce the \u00a36m-a-day cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels by using military bases, a former prison and vessels.But costs are rapidly mounting, with The Independent previously revealing a \u00a31.6bn contract had been handed to barge operator Corporate Travel Management, while separate funding is paid to police forces, ports, private contractors, councils and health bodies.RecommendedGovernment quietly awards travel firm \u00a31.6bn contract for asylum barges and accommodationGovernment could be forced to pay millions to police asylum barges and military basesSuella Braverman \u2018advised to scrap asylum seekers plan for air base\u2019A new contract published on Wednesday said Commisceo Primary Care Solutions would be providing health assessments for people arriving at Wethersfield and a dedicated medical centre on-site.It said the NHS Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board was extending and expanding an existing contract with the firm, and that the total estimated value was \u00a31.1m over 18 months.A document seen by The Independent said the contract was negotiated without a prior call for competition because of \u201cextreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority\u201d.\u201cThe authority was informed by NHS England in Q4 2022-23 of the likely siting of asylum accommodation and support centre at Wethersfield,\u201d it added.\u201cThe authority was required to identify a provider of this service at pace as the initial go live was planned for April.\u201dThe NHS trust said normal competitive procedures \u201ccould not be complied with\u201d in the time period before it was told Wethersfield would open start housing people, adding: \u201cAs such, the authority have undertaken an analysis of the market and deemed Commisceo to be in the best position to ensure delivery of primary medical services.\u201dRishi Sunak says \u2018disused holiday parks and student halls\u2019 will house asylum seekersCommisceo Primary Care Solutions has been operating since 2014 and already provides services for several NHS trusts, including a GP surgery at Basildon University Hospital and an urgent treatment centre in Chelmsford. The contract said the \u201cearliest potential start date\u201d for Wethersfield had subsequently moved to 1 July, but the High Court will not hear a legal challenge against the government\u2019s plans until 12 July.Councils covering RAF Wethersfield and a Lincolnshire military base being turned into asylum accommodation launched the case after Suella Braverman declared an \u201cemergency\u201d to bypass normal planning permission.They are arguing that the situation does not meet the threshold for an emergency under planning law, and that the sites are not suitable for vulnerable people in light of the pressure on local services and community impact in rural locations.Ministers have argued the new sites are necessary to reduce spending on hotel places for asylum seekers, which are currently costing \u00a36m a day, and avoid the risk of homelessness if supply runs out.A National Audit Office report released last week said that by the end of April, the Home Office was accommodating 109,000 destitute asylum seekers, including 48,000 in hotels, because of a lack of proper accommodation and soaring decision backlogs.While being grilled by parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Committee, the home secretary said the new sites would \u201cbe delivered very soon, and we will be seeing asylum seekers relocated to those sites in the next few months\u201d, and that she aimed to procure more locations for large-scale accommodation.RecommendedDrop in Channel crossings hailed as proof policies were \u2018working\u2019 halves in fortnightGovernment could be forced to pay millions to police asylum barges and military basesSunak\u2019s pledge to clear asylum backlog on course to fail as system cost hits \u00a33.6bnThe Home Office said the first asylum seekers would be moving into military sites this summer, with a spokesperson adding: \u201cDelivering accommodation on surplus military sites will provide cheaper and more orderly, suitable accommodation for those arriving in small boats whilst helping to reduce the use of hotels. \u201cWe are continuing to work extremely closely with local councils, the local NHS and police services, to manage any impact and address the local communities\u2019 concerns, including through substantial financial support.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940cf951ac334f3a315efd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/royal-navy-shahzada-dawood-bbc-news-newfoundland-gmt-b2361810.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Titan submersible: Everything we know about the search mission so far", "lead": "The submersible went missing on Sunday with five people on board.", "author": "Pa Reporters", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:30:47", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:29.596296", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T17:30:47+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/18/8c2280d5b669239a2331a2e298aaa82cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDUwODg5-2.72696413.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It is unknown how deep the vessel is, with the seabed being around 3,800m from the surface.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveWho is involved in the search operation and what equipment are they using?The US Coast Guard confirmed three boats have arrived at the area where \u201cbanging\u201d has been heard by a Canadian P-3 aircraft early on Wednesday.The John Cabot, Atlantic Merlin and Skandi Vinland were the first to arrive with the following vessels also in the area:\u2013 Canadian CGS Ann Harvey\u2013 Canadian CGS Terry Fox\u2013 Motor Vessel Horizon Arctic\u2013 French Research Vessel L\u2019Atalante (ROV)\u2013 His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Ship Glace Bay (a mobile decompression chamber and medical personnel)The Explorers\u2019 Club said it was ready to provide the UK-based Magellan\u2019s remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that is certified to travel as deep as 6,000m.Rear Admiral John Mauger of the US Coast Guard told BBC News there is a number of plans should they find Titan, with a range of equipment ready.He said: \u201cWhile our unified command is fully focused on the search we have experts that are working those different scenarios and we have mobilised gear on site, we have lift capabilities on the vessels that are on site now we have additional lift capability coming in.\u201cThe (US) Navy has mobilised a submerged object recovery system that they have and the Canadian armed forces have mobilised a recompression chamber with medical support.\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for contingencies while remaining laser-focused on the search for the submersible and those people.\u201d\u2013 What is the scale of the search?The search area has been compared to the size of Wales, with Dik Barton, the first British man to visit the Titanic wreckage, telling the PA news agency the scale is \u201chuge\u201d.\u201cWe can work out roughly the trajectory of the submersible from the point of release.\u201cWe know what the tides are doing, what the water\u2019s like, the water column and how it behaves, we relatively know well how the local tides and currents work.\u201cBut when this is released and out of communication one hour and 45 minutes later that\u2019s going to put it about the 2,000 metre to 25,000 metre mark, and after that who knows?\u201cWhat happens is the vessel goes into a controlled descent.\u201cIf they\u2019ve lost communications that means they\u2019ve probably lost power of some sort and as a consequence of that you\u2019ve lost control. It\u2019s conjecture and you have to be positive and optimistic about these things.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou\u2019re working in the dark and an environment which is so restricted because of the size and direction, you literally have no idea where you want to go.\u201d\u2013 Who is onboard Titan?Titan is carrying five people, including British billionaire adventurer Hamish Harding.The others are UK-based businessman Shahzada Dawood, his son Suleman Dawood, OceanGate\u2019s chief executive and founder Stockton Rush and, reportedly, French submersible pilot Paul-Henri Nargeolet.\u2013 How long is left to find Titan?Rear Admiral Mauger estimated earlier on Wednesday there could be only 20 hours of oxygen left inside Titan.He said: \u201cBased on information that the operator provided, they indicated that they have an emergency life-support system onboard to provide oxygen for approximately 96 hours.\u201cI understand that is a difficult calculation to predict because it depends on the number of occupants and their consumption but we are looking at a period of time of about 20 hours from now into tomorrow morning that we may be at the end of the 96-hour window.\u201dHe said the prediction was breathable air could last to around 10am GMT.\u2013 What other factors could harm the crew?Former Royal Navy submarine captain Ryan Ramsey said one problem may also be the levels of carbon dioxide onboard.He said: \u201cFor this particular mission, if they\u2019re on the seabed at the moment they\u2019re 4,000m down.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe US Coastguard has rejected an offer of help from a UK firm which experts say may provide the \"best hope\" of finding the missing Titanic submarine, as the window of opportunity to rescue the five onboard rapidly closes.British company Magellan Limited has had a deep-sea submersible craft \u201cready to support\u201d the rescue mission since early on Monday, with the ability to reach depths of 6,000 metres and prior experience of visiting the Titanic wreckage site.But the US First Coast Guard District told The Independent it has not requested assistance from the firm as the vessel, currently sat on a plane awaiting US clearance to be deployed, is too far away.The frantic search for the vessel lost in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean is now in its third day and oxygen is expected to run out at around 10am on Thursday UK time.The US First Coast Guard District said after \u201ccareful consideration\u201d of the most effective resources available, the unified command - the US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expeditions - is \u201cnot planning on requesting Magellan\u201d because of \u201chow far out that vessel would be from the area needed\u201d.

Although the longer the wait, the less likely this becomes, hence a reversal of the US Coast Guard\u2019s decision is time critical.Magellan said it had been contacted by OceanGate, the company that organised the Titanic tourist expedition, early on Monday and \u201cimmediately\u201d offered its services, saying: \u201cWe are ready to support, and we are fully mobilised to help.\u201dThe US Coast Guard decided against deploying Magellan\u2019s vessel at the point at which the company offered its services, over two days ago, again citing its distance from the search site as the reason for this decision.Two of the stranded five - British billionaire explorer Hamish Harding and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet - are members of The Explorers Club, a community of experienced explorers. The group has issued a desperate plea to the US government to deploy \u201cthe ROV with the most experience at the Titanic site and possibly the best hope for a rescue\u201d.The wreckage sits at a depth of around 3,810 metres, but the group has said the vessels currently being deployed at the site only reach depths of 3,000 metres. The submarine the US Coast Guard confirmed had been deployed at the site, Deep Energy, is only rated to a depth of 3,000 metres.The Explorers Club said it has been in contact with top government officials, \u201dturning every stone\u201d, urging them to \u201cgive the green light and get Magellan to the site as soon as possible\u201d. It said it had also been in close contact with Magellan, who \u201care ready to deploy and every second now counts\u201d.Magellan Limited has had a deep-sea submersible craft \u201cready to support\u201d the mission since early on Monday (Magellan)Their pleas are all the more urgent following the glimmer of hope that came with reports from the US Coast Guard that a Canadian aircraft searching for the submarine detected intermittent \u201cbanging\u201d noises from the vicinity of its last known location. The crew heard banging sounds every 30 minutes on Tuesday and again on Wednesday after additional sonar devices were deployed. However, the US Coast Guard clarified that they \u201cdon\u2019t know the source of the noise\u201d.The President of The Explorers Club Richard Garriott shared a letter with his community, citing reports \u201ctapping sounds\u201d had been detected by sonar, \u201cimplying that crew may be alive and signalling\u201d.The letter shared with The Independent by Professor Mark Hannaford, a member of the group and founder of World Extreme Medicine, read: \u201cIt is essential to the survival of the crew that these assets [Magellan\u2019s vessel] are brought in, NOW!\u201dThe Magellan\u2019s vessel has the ability to reach depths of 6,000 metres and prior experience of visiting the Titanic wreckage site (Magellan)It added the submarines currently at the site \u201care not rated for the depth of the submersible and subsequently MAY NOT WORK\u201d.Mr Hannaford, who is close friends with Mr Harding, said: \u201cPutting yourself in their shoes is incomprehensible, especially for the families.

I have got no explanation for thatJamie BarrowBarrow, who has Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), had been suffering from a \u201cvery, very low mood\u201d in the days and hours before his actions, deciding to light the fire after \u201can elastic band snapped\u201d in his head.He said: \u201cI got a bottle, took the lid off it, put some gloves on, went downstairs, filled the bottle with petrol and then went round to the address and started the fire.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started filling it [the bottle] that I realised what I was going to set fire to.\u201cI knew I was going to set fire to something, I just didn\u2019t know what.\u201cI can\u2019t explain why I picked the victim\u2019s flat. I have got no explanation for that.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a thought as much as it was an impulse.\u201dMrs Hydara and her two children were away from the property for three days, returning to the property on the afternoon of November 19, before Barrow started the fire in the early hours of November 20.After lighting the fire, Barrow said he \u201cpanicked\u201d as he \u201cwas not expecting it to go up like that\u201d, but he denied hearing any noises or screams, something prosecutors say could be heard from inside the flat seconds after the fire started.He said that he would have \u201craised the alarm\u201d if he had heard noises and \u201cwould not have done it\u201d if he knew someone was inside the property in the preceding days.But upon being told by a neighbour that three people had been brought out of the flat, Barrow said: \u201cMy heart sank. I realised that I had done something terrible.\u201dBarrow, a father-of-one, was diagnosed with EUPD in 2013 but had taken the decision to stop taking anti-psychotic medication in July last year \u2013 a decision that he admitted in court was \u201cwrong\u201d.His stress had increased in the days leading up to the fire due to having to care for his son for a fortnight.On the night of the fire, Barrow said he drank \u201cseven or eight\u201d cans of San Miguel lager and was \u201cwallowing in self-pity\u201d, while also listening to \u201cdepressing\u201d music and suffering from flashbacks of abuse suffered in childhood, which led him to have suicidal thoughts.In texts to a friend, sent around three hours before he lit the fire, he said he felt like \u201cI\u2019m less than pond scum\u201d and said: \u201cI feel like there is no escape from the constant feeling of uselessness and inadequacy.\u201dSpeaking in court, Barrow said he had \u201cturned reclusive\u201d and \u201chad, for all intents and purposes, given up\u201d.\n\nI realised the enormity of what I had done and I felt an immense amount of guilt for obviously causing the deaths of those three peopleJamie BarrowBarrow was arrested on the afternoon of November 20 while police were conducting routine enquiries with residents of neighbouring properties, telling an officer \u201cI need to tell you something about the fire next door\u201d.Mr Henley said: \u201cYou later bowed your head and then held your hands out in front of you. Why did you do that?\u201d\u201cI was handing myself in, essentially,\u201d Barrow replied.Mr Henley asked: \u201cWhy did you want to admit starting the fire?\u201dBarrow responded: \u201cBecause I realised the enormity of what I had done and I felt an immense amount of guilt for obviously causing the deaths of those three people.\u201cI just wanted to be in custody because I knew what I had done was wrong.\u201dMr Henley asked: \u201cWhen you started the fire, was it your intention to cause serious harm or the deaths of anybody?\u201dBarrow replied: \u201cNo, it was not.\u201dDuring cross-examination by prosecutor, Simon Ash KC, Barrow denied seeing a light that would have indicated people were in the flat or a black and silver pushchair outside the door.He had earlier told the court that he had started fires from the age of 14, including setting a fire in a commercial bin on his 18th birthday, because it \u201crelaxes\u201d him and relieves stress, something he discovered at the age of around 11.He said: \u201cIt chills me out and takes me, to a certain extent, out of the headspace that I\u2019m in at the current time by calming it.\u201d\n\nI understand that I am responsible for the deaths of three individuals who sadly died, but I had no intent to actually kill themJamie BarrowMr Henley asked: \u201cHow much thought do you give to the consequences of starting a fire?\u201d\u201cZero,\u201d Barrow replied.\u201cAs part of my personality is disordered, and I have impulse management issues, I struggle to manage my impulses and I don\u2019t always think about the consequences of my actions.\u201dThe defendant has already admitted to three counts of manslaughter but denies three counts of murder and a charge of arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered.\u201cI understand that I am responsible for the deaths of three individuals who sadly died, but I had no intent to actually kill them,\u201d Barrow said.The trial continues."}, {"_id": "64940cfb51ac334f3a315f03", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/london-sky-news-b2361779.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Pickaxe-wielding attacker wounds two\u2019 in hospital rampage", "lead": "One person was left with life-threatening injuries after the attack at Central Middlesex Hospital on Wednesday.", "author": "Joseph Draper", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 16:31:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:31.220700", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T16:31:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/17/ac74b8e10a1c069863e4392bd73e380fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDQ5NDM1-2.72701703.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

pledging to seek a veterinary agreement to ease food trade, and to ask the EU for mutual recognition of qualifications.\n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK news in pictures20 June 2023The sunrises at 04.25am at St Mary\u2019s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, on the North East coast of England, the day before Summer Solstice \u2013 the longest day of the yearPAUK news in pictures19 June 2023The King and Queen depart the annual Order of the Garter ServicePAUK news in pictures17 June 2023Typhoon fighter jets fly over The Mall after the Royal family attended the Trooping the Colour ceremony at Horse Guards Parade, central London, as King Charles III celebrates his first official birthday since becoming sovereign.PAUK news in pictures16 June 2023A peregrine falcon nesting at Malham Cove, in the Yorkshire Dales National ParkPAUK news in pictures15 June 2023Newborn alpaca Sir Steveo, who has been named after one of his keepers, ventures outside in the Pets Farm area of Blair Drummond Safari Park near StirlingPAUK news in pictures14 June 2023Grace Kumar\u2019s father and Barnaby Webber\u2019s brother, Charlie, embrace ahead of a vigil at the University of Nottingham after they and Ian Coates were killed and another three hurt in connected attacks on 13 JunePAUK news in pictures13 June 2023Police forensics officers on Ilkeston RoadPAUK news in pictures12 June 2023People relax in a suspended swimming pool as hot weather continues, in LondonReutersUK news in pictures11 June 2023Usain Bolt and teammates celebrate with the trophy after winning Soccer Aid 2023Action Images via ReutersUK news in pictures10 June 2023A cyclist trains in the early morning, as hot weather continues, in Richmond Park, LondonReutersUK news in pictures9 June 2023A performer walks on a tightrope at Covent Garden during a sunny day in LondonAPUK news in pictures8 June 2023A women rides her horse through the river during the Appleby Horse FairPAUK news in pictures7 June 2023The Princess of Wales during a game of walking rugby during her visit to meet local and national male rugby players at Maidenhead Rugby ClubPAUK news in pictures6 June 2023An aerial view shows the dry bed of Woodhead Reservoir, revealed by a falling water level after a prolonged period of dry weather, near Glossop, northern EnglandAFP/GettyUK news in pictures5 June 2023Prime Minister Rishi Sunak onboard Border Agency cutter HMC Seeker during a visit to DoverPAUK news in pictures4 June 2023A hot air balloon rises into the sky above Ragley Hall, Alcester, south of Birmingham in central EnglandAFP via Getty ImagesUK news in pictures2 June 2023Skaters use the mini ramp at the Wavelength Spring Classic festival in Woolacombe Bay in DevonPAUK news in pictures1 June 2023The And Beyond installation, during a photo call for the London Design Biennale at Somerset House in LondonPAUK news in pictures31 May 2023Emergency services attending to a blaze at a derelict listed building in Samuel Street, BelfastPAUK news in pictures30 May 2023A robot named Stella interacts with visitors during the International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA in LondonAPUK news in pictures29 May 2023Dave Hackett and his daughter Daisy, five, explore the laburnum arch in the grounds of Preston Tower, East Lothian, in the warm Spring Bank Holiday weatherPAUK news in pictures28 May 2023Great Britain\u2019s Nick Bandurak scores their side\u2019s third goal of the game during the FIH Hockey Pro League men\u2019s match at Lee Valley, LondonPAUK news in pictures27 May 2023People enjoy the sunny weather at a park in LondonAPUK news in pictures26 May 2023People drink coffee inside Daleks during MCM Comic Con at the ExCel London in east LondonPAUK news in pictures25 May 2023King Charles III and Queen Camilla during a visit to Enniskillen Castle, Co Fermanagh as part of a two day visit to Northern IrelandPAUK news in pictures24 May 2023Horses enjoy the sunny weather on Middleham Gallops in North YorkshirePAUK news in pictures23 May 2023An aerial view of a yellow rapeseed field in Hemel Hempstead, BritainReutersUK news in pictures22 May 2023Manoj Malde and Clive Gillmor kiss after getting married, the first wedding ever at the Chelsea Flower ShowAPUK news in pictures21 May 2023People enjoy the warm weather as they take punt tours along the River Cam in Cambridge PAUK news in pictures20 May 2023Protesters emerge from the sea as Surfers Against Sewage hold a UK-wide paddle-out protest at Brighton West Pier in East SussexPAUK news in pictures19 May 2023Good Karma ridden by Daniel Muscutt (right) wins the Earl & The Pharaoh Novice Stakes at Newbury Racecourse, BerkshirePAUK news in pictures18 May 2023Choristers from the Choir of St John\u2019s College at the University of Cambridge look out from the top of the Chapel Tower before performing the Ascension Day carol -

It turns on the interpretation of what are ordinary words in their particular legislative contextHarriet Townsend, representing Surrey County Council Ms Finch has already lost fights in lower courts \u2013 a High Court judge ruled against her, and three Court of Appeal judges dismissed an appeal by a two-to-one majority.Ms Finch, who now lives in Exeter, Devon, says council bosses had failed to assess \u201cthe indirect greenhouse gas impacts\u201d and did not take into account environmental protection objectives.Council bosses, who gave Horse Hill Developments permission to extend drilling at Horse Hill, dispute Ms Finch\u2019s claim.Lawyers representing the council say Ms Finch\u2019s approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements is \u201cmisguided\u201d.Justices were told that an \u201cenvironmental impact assessment\u201d had considered the \u201cimpacts\u201d of \u201cdirect\u201d releases of greenhouse gases but did not assess the impacts of \u201cdownstream\u201d emissions.\n\nThis is a critically important legal challenge that could have significant repercussions for new fossil fuel projects, including the proposed new coal mine in CumbriaFriends of the Earth lawyer Katie de Kauwe They were told that the issue was whether \u201cdownstream greenhouse gas emissions\u201d were \u201cindirect effects\u201d.Barristers representing Ms Finch told justices that her case was \u201csimple\u201d.Marc Willers KC\u00a0and Estelle Dehon\u00a0KC said the appeal concerned the \u201cclimate impact of fossil fuel development\u201d and turned on the \u201ccorrect interpretation\u201d of the 2017 Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017.They said planning permission could only lawfully be granted in respect of developments which encompassed \u201ccertain extractive industry\u201d developments,\u00a0if\u00a0an environment impact assessment had been carried out.\u201cThe appellant\u2019s case is simple,\u201d they said.\u201cOn the plain language of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, the likely significant effects on climate of the \u2018combustion of material obtained from a development whose sole purpose is to obtain that material for combustion\u2019 are, as a matter of law, \u2018indirect effects\u2019.\u201dA barrister representing Surrey council said the case was \u201cessentially an issue of law\u201d.\u201cThis is not a climate change case,\u201d Harriet Townsend said.\u201cIt turns on the interpretation of what are ordinary words in their particular legislative context.\u201dShe said justices should dismiss the appeal.Ms Finch has also taken legal action against Horse Hill Developments and the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Michael Gove.Barrister Richard Moules, representing Mr Gove, told justices they were not being asked to make \u201cfindings about the science of climate change\u201d.\n\nSarah Finch's legal challenge could ensure that the full climate impacts of new fossil fuel developments have to be taken into account in the environmental impact assessment when planning applications are consideredFriends of the Earth lawyer Katie de KauweHe said the issue was whether the downstream greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from the eventual combustion of the refined end products produced from the oil originating from the development, were \u201cindirect effects of the development\u201d which had to be assessed.Friends of the Earth said the case might have implications for a planned coal mine on the outskirts of Whitehaven, Cumbria.\u201cThis is a critically important legal challenge that could have significant repercussions for new fossil fuel projects, including the proposed new coal mine in Cumbria,\u201d Friends of the Earth lawyer Katie de Kauwe said.\u201cSarah Finch\u2019s legal challenge could ensure that the full climate impacts of new fossil fuel developments have

You need to set out now the mechanism by which and how you will take the case to Strasbourg,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need to do it. This society needs you to do it. All victims of all persuasions are opposed to this. You will be taking in the interests of every single victim across these islands, and throughout this entire jurisdiction you will be taking that.\u201cYou have a moral and legal duty to do that under the Good Friday Agreement as well.\u201cThis Bill not only flouts international law, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act, it also flouts the Good Friday Agreement itself because the Human Rights Act is an essential component of that agreement.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re speaking up and with one voice. We\u2019re asking the Irish government: do the right thing. Go and take the case on behalf of every single victim. You have a duty to do it.\u201dPrevious interstate cases have been taken in relation to the Troubles. For example Ireland took an interstate case against the UK in relation to interrogation techniques used in Northern Ireland from 1971 to 1975.The legacy Bill has been opposed by victims groups and all Stormont parties, as well as the Irish government.\u00a0The Bill is currently in the report stage in the House of Lords.Mr Thompson said the legacy legislation denied bereaved families the right to an investigation.\u00a0\u201cSo just to make it clear, this Bill is anti-rule of law, anti-victim, anti-Good Friday Agreement, anti-international human rights law,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt denies the right to a basic investigation and truth and accountability.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s all that families have been wanting for decades since their loved ones were killed, and their tenacity and never-giving-up spirit to go on is amplified again and again and again.\u201dRecommendedStrike disruption warning for cycling world championshipsMan arrested after two people stabbed at hospitalRoyal Ascot welcomes King and Queen for second day of racingSinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly attended the protest on Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cThe families here will never give up, they will keep fighting on in the courts, but also it\u2019s up to the Irish government, to take on their behalf \u2013 they\u2019re Irish citizens \u2013 to take on their behalf an interstate case to the British government to try and destroy this,\u201d he said.\u00a0"}, {"_id": "64940cfd51ac334f3a315f0c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/glasgow-unions-unison-unite-glasgow-city-council-b2361701.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Strike disruption warning for cycling world championships", "lead": "The event takes place in Glasgow in August.", "author": "Lucinda Cameron", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:54:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:33.599414", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T14:54:16+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/16/c7074fcaf08cb97551aa69b7bafe4fd5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDQyNzky-2.66548056.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

They need to get on their bike and ask Scottish ministers for support to deliver a pay offer that values frontline council workers.\u201cDespite 94% of our members resoundingly rejecting the pay offer, Cosla have made little attempt to continue negotiations and council leaders are refusing to ask for Scottish Government intervention.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has said he was reassured during his time in the Cabinet Office that the UK was in a \u201cpretty strong state of preparedness\u201d for any future pandemic.And he told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry that preparations for a no-deal Brexit put the country in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond to other challenges.Mr Dowden, who was minister for the Cabinet Office from July 2019 to February 2020 and had previously worked in the department, said he had taken an interest in planning, including for a possible flu pandemic.He said: \u201cI asked for further specific briefing on that \u2013 received that briefing \u2013 and indeed, throughout my time as a minister, received further briefings, all of which were consistent with advice that we were broadly in a pretty strong state of preparedness.\u201dHugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Dowden about a 2019 memo about the National Security Council THRC (threats, hazards and resilience contingencies programmes) which suggested that work on pandemic influenza was expected to be affected by the \u201cstep-up in planning for a no-deal exit from the European Union\u201d.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMr Dowden said: \u201cWe had to ensure that we allocated resources according to where the greatest risk lay.\u201cNow, it was the case at that time that \u2018no deal\u2019 was the default position of the Government, so \u2013 and this is worth remembering the kind of frankly, apocryphal warnings that were being delivered about the consequences of no-deal Brexit, for example in relation to medicine supplies and elsewhere \u2013 it was appropriate that \u2026 we shifted the resilience function to deal with this.\u201cSecondly, it was not a permanent shift; we knew that this thing would come to an end since we had an endpoint for if we didn\u2019t reach a deal, no deal would happen.\u201dHe added that there was a \u201cflip side\u201d to the preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 known as Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 which made the UK \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for the pandemic.\n\nThere was a flip side to this, which was that the preparation, particularly through the Yellowhammer structures, made us match-fit for when ... we did have to deal with the the actual materialisation of the Covid pandemicOliver Dowden\u201cThere was a flip side to this, which was that the preparation, particularly through the Yellowhammer structures, made us match fit for when \u2026 we did have to deal with the the actual materialisation of the Covid pandemic \u2013 that is to say it forced Government departments to work together closely, so there\u2019s a lot more cross-government co-ordination.\u201dHe said around 15,000 extra staff had been employed for work on Brexit \u201cwho then were able to be redeployed once the threat of no deal had passed in order to further step up our preparedness, to contribute to our Covid response\u201d.Asked if the preparations had an impact on the majority of work programmes to deal with a flu pandemic, Mr Dowden said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually, I didn\u2019t fully accept that.\u201cThe core responsibilities that certainly I had respect for in Cabinet Office, in terms of our areas under the pandemic flu preparedness continued \u2013 namely the excess deaths work and the work in respect of pandemic flu Bill drafting, both of which then, subsequently, the learnings from that we used when the Covid crisis hit us.\u201cIt was also the case that there was this constant flexing that that happened, and, when one takes it in the round, in terms of how it essentially tested our ability to work together.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s countless other examples of that. So, for example, the battle rhythm of having these daily \u2018exos\u2019, the fact that we had realtime data coming in and going out again, all of those things actually put us in a strong position.\u201cThe advice that I received was the the core stuff that we had to do was continuing, but in line with a normal reprioritisation that happens; for example, when Salisbury hit there was a reprioritisation \u2013 there is always a flex, if we didn\u2019t have that flex we would not be in such a strong position to respond to challenges as they hit the Government.\u201d\n\nI think operation preparedness is another matter.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEurostar could soon face competition running international rail services through the channel tunnel, under plans being worked up by the government. Rail minister Huw Merriman said on Wednesday that the government would set out steps to encourage other companies to run services to the continent in a bid to drive down ticket prices.Ministers are hoping to emulate the effects of competition on the east coast mainline, where challenger operators like Lumo have driven down fares while increasing ridership.Mr Merriman said High Speed One, the rail link to the channel tunnel, had plenty of spare capacity and that the Department for Transport was having \u201cconversations\u201d about how to use it more effectively.This could include changes to the contract to run the line, he hinted.RecommendedHow Eurostar trains were built to link Manchester to Paris \u2013 and why they never ranRishi Sunak finally gives his verdict on Boris Johnson\u2019s Partygate liesEpstein was \u2018particularly close\u2019 to Peter Mandelson, says reportBut previous attempts by non-Eurostar operators to run services through the tunnel have failed to get off the ground, stymied by the UK's strict border rules and the complexity of using the undersea tunnel.The minister told the transport select committee competition would be \u201ckey\u201d for getting fares down on international services.\u201cThe only way we're actually going to bring prices down, get more people on, it's getting more operators on there. And I think that's my ambition for it,\u201d he said.\u201cThat will actually come into conversations about how we see the actual High Speed 1 infrastructure used as well, because there's a lot more space there that we'd actually like to see used.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe difficulty is it's not just down to this country because obviously it's a route that goes abroad, but we are looking to set out some steps as to what we actually see is possible with that line, because there was a lot more space on it. Huw Merriman, the rail minister, appearing at the transport select committee (UK Parliament)\u201cThat will come into conversations about the existing contract of that line as well. So it's something that we're working on.\u201dAn increase in competition running services through the tunnel would come at a difficult time for Eurostar, whose finances have also already taken a double beating from the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.The cross-channel operator did not benefit from the same Covid-19 bailout as other UK train companies and did not receive the same help as airlines \u2013 forcing it to take out loans at commercial rates, which it is now paying back.It has also been forced to run services with some seats empty because new Brexit border bureaucracy has restricted its ability to process passengers through passport control fast enough to fill trains. As a result the train company has mothballed suburban stations in Ashford and Ebbsfleet and cancelled a longstanding direct service from London to Disneyland Paris. The company has increased ticket prices and says it is focusing on its core routes while it pays down the debt.One likely barrier to running competing services is the physical capacity constraint at St Pancras station, which limits Eurostar\u2019s ability to run more services in the first place. It is not clear how competition could circumvent this limitation.Speaking at the same hearing Mr Merriman rejected emulating France's ban on domestic flights for routes possible by train in under two-and-a-half hours. \u201cIf you bring a policy in like that, then it means that the costs of trains can end up going up even more, because you haven't got the competition from flights,\u201d Mr Merriman said.\n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK news in pictures20 June 2023The sunrises at 04.25am at St Mary\u2019s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, on the North East coast

It lost contact with its surface support ship near the end of what should have been a two-hour dive to the Titanic.Those aboard the submersible which costs $250,000 per person, included British billionaire and adventurer Hamish Harding, Pakistani-born businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his 19-year-old son Suleman, who are both British citizens.French oceanographer and leading Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, and Stockton Rush, founder and chief executive of OceanGate, were also reported to be on board.A Canadian aircraft searching for the sub in the Atlantic Ocean detected intermittent \u201cbanging\u201d noises from the vicinity of its last known location, the US Coast Guard said.Crew searching for the missing sub heard banging sounds every 30 minutes on Tuesday and again four hours later on Wednesday after additional sonar devices were deployed.

Based on recent updates with the US Coast Guard and as confirmed with The Independent, it is believed that the oxygen supply within the vessel is due to run out at around 1pm UK time. The submersible was launched at 8am Eastern Time on Sunday, which equates to 1pm in the UK. There was an estimated 96 hours of oxygen on the sub for 5 people. Therefore, the US Coast Guard estimates oxygen will run out exactly four days after it submerged at 8am EDT, which is 1pm UK time today.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn environmental campaigner is staging a Supreme Court fight after objecting to the extension of oil drilling near Gatwick and raising concerns about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.Sarah Finch, 59, has challenged Surrey County Council\u2019s decision to allow a well about six miles from where she used to live in Redhill, Surrey, to be retained and expanded by Horse Hill Developments.She has already lost fights in lower courts \u2013 a High Court judge ruled against her, and three Court of Appeal judges dismissed an appeal by a two-to-one majority.Friends of the Earth has backed Ms Finch, who brought the challenge on behalf of the Weald Action Group and says the case could have widespread implications.Five Supreme Court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began considering arguments at a Supreme Court hearing in London on Wednesday.The hearing is due to end on Thursday.Ms Finch, who now lives in Exeter, Devon, says council bosses failed to assess \u201cthe indirect greenhouse gas impacts\u201d and did not take into account environmental protection objectives.Council bosses, who gave Horse Hill Developments permission to extend drilling at Horse Hill, dispute Ms Finch\u2019s claim.Lawyers representing the council say Ms Finch\u2019s approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements is \u201cmisguided\u201d.\n\nThe amount of oil to be produced over the lifetime of the development is not known, but it was agreed by the parties that: the development could in theory produce up to about 3.3 million tonnes of crude oil over the 20-year production period ...Marc Willers KC and Estelle Dehon KC Justices were told that an \u201cenvironmental impact assessment\u201d had considered the \u201cimpacts\u201d of \u201cdirect\u201d releases of greenhouse gases but did not assess the impacts of \u201cdownstream\u201d emissions.Barristers representing Ms Finch told justices that her case was \u201csimple\u201d.Marc Willers KC\u00a0and Estelle Dehon\u00a0KC said the appeal concerned the \u201cclimate impact of fossil fuel development\u201d and turned on the \u201ccorrect interpretation\u201d of the 2017 Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017.They said planning permission could lawfully be granted in respect of developments which encompassed \u201ccertain extractive industry\u201d developments, \u201cunless an environment impact assessment\u201d had been carried out in respect of that development.\u201cIn this case, Horse Hill Developments Ltd sought planning permission from the council for the large-scale production of fossil fuel (predominantly oil for sale and use as fuel in transportation), on land at Horse Hill, Surrey, for a period of 20 years and certainly beyond the year 2040,\u201d they said, in a written case outline.\u201cThe amount of oil to be produced over the lifetime of the development is not known, but it was agreed by the parties that: the development could in theory produce up to about 3.3 million tonnes of crude oil over the 20-year production period \u2026 \u201dThey added: \u201cThe appellant\u2019s case is simple: on the plain language of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, the likely significant effects on climate of the \u2018combustion of material obtained from a development whose sole purpose is to obtain that material for combustion\u2019 are, as a matter of law, \u2018indirect effects\u2019 \u2026\u201cAccordingly, where, as in this case, planning permission is sought for the extraction of oil for commercial production, such that greenhouse gas emissions will unavoidably result from the inevitable use of the refined oil via combustion, a plain language interpretation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations means it is unlawful for a relevant planning authority to grant planning permission without the benefit of an assessment of the nature and magnitude of the greenhouse gas emissions which would be caused by the combustion of the oil.\u201d\n\nIt is common ground that the question is one of statutory construction. The court is not required to make any findings about the science of climate changeRichard Moules, representing Secretary of State Michael GoveThey said the Court of Appeal was \u201cwrong to find otherwise\u201d.Ms Finch has also taken legal action against Horse Hill Developments and Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.Barrister Richard Moules, representing Mr Gove, told justices they were not being asked to make \u201cfindings about the science of climate change\u201d.He said the issue was whether the downstream greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from the eventual combustion of the refined end products produced from the oil originating from the development, were \u201cindirect effects of the development\u201d which had to be assessed.\u201cIt is common ground that the question is one of statutory construction,\u201d he said in a written case outline.\u201cThe court is not required to make any findings about the science of climate change.\u201dHe said the \u201curgent imperative to address climate change\u201d was the \u201cbasis for legislation\u201d.Ms Finch had said outside court: \u201cThe biggest climate impact from this project will occur when the oil is eventually burned.\u201cIf councils can ignore these \u2018downstream\u2019 impacts when making planning decisions, then we have no hope of staying within safe climate limits.\u201cThe present lack of clarity over environmental impact assessments is dangerous.\u201cI hope that the Supreme Court will confirm that no fossil fuel development \u2013 coal, oil or gas \u2013 should be allowed without consideration of its full climate impact.\u201dSolicitor Rowan Smith had said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of this case.\u201cThe Supreme Court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted.\u201cThere is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.\u201dFriends of the Earth said the case might have implications for a planned coal mine on the outskirts of Whitehaven, Cumbria.\u201cThis is a critically important legal challenge that could have significant repercussions for new fossil fuel projects, including the proposed new coal mine in Cumbria,\u201d said Friends of the Earth lawyer Katie de Kauwe.\u201cSarah Finch\u2019s legal challenge could ensure that the full climate impacts of new fossil fuel developments have to be taken into account in the environmental impact assessment when planning applications are considered.\u201cWe\u2019re in a climate crisis and it\u2019s absurd that this is not happening already.\u201dLocal campaign groups echoed Friends of the Earth\u2019s sentiments.A spokeswoman for the Horse Hill Protection Group said: \u201cHorse Hill matters, not just for the local community but for people and ecosystems everywhere affected by extraction and by climate breakdown.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940d0251ac334f3a315f1e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/australia-dover-dna-test-kent-bali-b2361638.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Long-lost sisters united after 60 years \u2018slotted together like jigsaw puzzle\u2019", "lead": "Two sisters unknown to each other for more than 60 years finally connect after surprise DNA test.", "author": "Anahita Hossein-Pour", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:17:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:38.708490", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:17:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/14/21111804-c3b7f7a6-99b7-4dea-afdf-79fae566998d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

All in a matter of months. At one point, a third of the country was underwater. Pakistani officials and scientists worldwide blame climate crisis for the unusually early and heavy monsoon rains.A year on, the country hasn\u2019t fully recovered. The aftermath runs the length of the country; survivors living in makeshift huts where their homes used to be, millions of children out of school, damaged infrastructure waiting to be repaired.This journey through Pakistan looks at how the unprecedented flooding of 2022 affected everyday life - and future generations.RecommendedWhat caused Pakistan\u2019s deadly floods? From melting glaciers to \u2018monster\u2019 monsoonHimalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever before, scientists warnScientists confirm climate change played a role in Pakistan floods by increasing rainfallRestoring WaterThe high altitudes and sharp peaks of the Hindu Kush Mountains mean that heavy rains barrel down through the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. That\u2019s good because the waters quickly drain to lower lying areas. But it\u2019s bad because of the damage they wreak along the way.Last summer\u2019s raging floods were so powerful that some rivers changed course. They wrecked more than 800 drinking water supply systems across nearly half of the province\u2019s 34 districts, damaging pipelines, supply mains, storage tanks and wells. Homes are surrounded by floodwaters in Jaffarabad, a district of Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province (AP)Residents living by stagnant water were forced to rely on contaminated water for drinking. Health care teams started receiving thousands of patients with diseases like dengue, malaria, acute diarrhea, cholera and skin infections.Authorities are taking some steps to prepare for the next disaster. They have installed an early warning system on seven of the major rivers and a monsoon contingency plan. Embankments were strengthened last year ahead of the flooding and riverbanks breached by floods have been repaired and reinforced.Lucky break for agricultureIt wasn\u2019t the flooding that nearly killed 80-year-old Razia Bibi and her family, it was the hunger.The floods washed away the wheat they\u2019d stored for the whole year in their home in Rojhan, Rajanpur district. Then they had to wait for weeks, scrounging for food, before supplies arrived from the government and aid groups.Across Punjab, stores of grain were wiped out along with at least a half-million acres of crops and orchards. Then relief came, mostly by luck rather than preparation.Authorities installed pumps that got rid of some of the water, but most of it drained on its own, some flowing down into Sindh province, some spreading into deserted, open areas.Waters receded in time for Punjab farmers to do the October sowing season and the result was a bumper crop. But the risk remains for future disasters.Left without schoolsSituated downstream from Pakistan\u2019s other provinces, Sindh suffered a heavy blow from last year\u2019s flooding and has been slow to recover. Around half of Sindh\u2019s 40,356 schools were either fully or partially damaged, affecting 2.3 million of its 4.5 million students, according to local education official Abdul Qadeer Ansari. So far, only around 2,000 schools are being rebuilt. Ansari estimates reconstruction will take at least two years, with the new schools intended to be climate resistant.Flood affected children attend school organized by Islamic group Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, in Sukkur, Pakistan  (AP)In the village of Maskran Brohi, 115 students take classes in a temporary learning center in a tent. The 72-square-meter tent has no electricity, so it has neither lights nor fans. There are also no toilets and no clean water.The only teacher, Zarina Bibi, doesn\u2019t see most of the 87 kids she taught before the flooding \u2014 families scattered when the floods came \u2014 and rain flattened the roof and walls of the single-room primary school she used to teach in.

The largely rural population is scattered over the mountainous landscape, crippled by an entrenched feudal system, under-development and neglect by the local and central government. Much of Baluchistan\u2019s population relies on solar panels.They faced losing what little they had in last year\u2019s flooding.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cNo water, no life. No blue, no green,\u201d said revered marine biologist Sylvia Earle in summing up the importance of the global ocean. The primary food source for half the planet, the ocean supplies the oxygen for every second breath we take. And yet it is humanity\u2019s dumping ground \u2013 choked by trillions of pieces of plastic, harmful chemicals and waste run-off. Ninety per cent of the atmospheric heat caused by fossil-fuel emissions is absorbed by the ocean, triggering a cascade of dire consequences.Global sea surface temperatures in April and May 2023 were the highest on record for those months, the UK Met Office reported last week, while Antarctic sea ice is \u201cthe lowest on record for this date by a wide margin\u201d. Warmer waters pack more energy into tropical storms, whipping them into increasingly destructive tempests.RecommendedMontana officials downplay first-of-its-kind climate trialUN members adopt first-ever treaty to protect marine life in the high seasScientists create clean fuel from thin airExcessive ocean warming has also depleted most of the world\u2019s wild fishing stocks, an unfolding food crisis for a growing global population. But the ocean is one of humanity\u2019s more important natural allies in the face of the climate crisis. Marine industries could deliver one-fifth of emissions cuts needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C by 2050, according to the UN High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy\ufeff, holding off more catastrophic climate impacts. It could also provide more sustainable food sources from fisheries, seaweed and aquaculture, feeding more people and cutting back on carbon-intensive, land-based food systems.\u201cIt\u2019s time to shift from thinking of the ocean as a victim to seeing it as an essential part of solving global challenges,\u201d the panel said.Tidal\u2019s underwater camera system and machine perception tools at work capturing fish behaviors Much of the ocean remains a mystery to us, while its depth and breadth make it incredibly difficult to harness potential on a grand scale. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning show signs of overcoming those challenges. Five years ago Tidal, a project inside Alphabet\u2019s invention lab known at the \u201cMoonshot Factory\u201d, began exploring how to boost aquaculture operations \u2013 the rearing of marine species for consumption \u2013 while protecting ocean health. Cameras have long been used by fish farmers but failed to give a detailed picture of what was happening at operations with millions of fish.The first trials of the system \u2013 comprised of 360 degree-rotating cameras, sensors and machine perception tools \u2013 were conducted in a kiddie pool at Googleplex, the headquarters of Google and parent company Alphabet in Mountain View, California.The next stop was Norway to test prototypes in harsh ocean environments from fjords inside the Arctic Circle to open waters of the North Sea.The system captured environmental data like water temperature and salinity along with eight billion underwater observations of Atlantic salmon. The data was then used to train AI into a de facto \u201cfish whisperer\u201d which can predict their needs.\u201cOur system separates signal from noise,\u201d Tidal Founder and CEO Neil Dav\u00e9 told The Independent.\u201cOur model looks at those scenes, and pulls insights from what\u2019s happening in the water, whether it\u2019s fish behavior, feeding, health, or general growth trends.\u201dAquaculture pens in Norway (Tidal)The Tidal system \u201creads\u201d a range of features including mouth opening and closing, whether fish consume food pellets, vertical swimming, and rapid changes in direction. The data is processed in miliseconds by AI and the insights help with day-to-day decisions at fish farms such as how much feed to put in the water, or whether pests like sea lice need to be treated.In the long-run it not only keeps fish healthier but reduces food waste \u2013 not only an environmental benefit but a huge financial boon for an industry where around 60 per cent of costs go on feed. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for the environment as well as the business,\u201d Mr Dav\u00e9 said. Tidal recently partnered with Cognizant, a global services and IT consultancy company with expertise in ocean industries, to scale the technology and get it into the market. Today, tidal has around 600 devices floating off the Norwegian coast.Stig Martin Fisk\u00e5, the Oslo-based head of Cognizant Ocean, believes Norway is an ideal testing ground due to its large fishing industry, and willingness to confront challenges head on.Norway\u2019s aquaculture sector hasn\u2019t been able to grow more fish for 10 years, he said, so he was impressed by Tidal\u2019s strategy of looking at the complex ecosystem as a whole and attacking the problem from \u201cthe egg to filet\u201d. \u201cWith this technology, we\u2019re seeing signals that we\u2019re able to produce more fish because it\u2019s granular, live, intelligent,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cYou\u2019re able to make smart decisions earlier.\u201dMr Fisk\u00e5 said it was too early to speculate on how much the industry\u2019s carbon footprint could be cut by the new technology but that he had high hopes.1- Camera and computer vision continuously collecting and interpreting images of fish; 2 - Environmental sensors collecting a mix of environmental data like temperature and salinity (Tidal)\u201dWe hopefully not only get [emissions] down to zero, or even positive ... but hopefully we\u2019re also helping the world to produce more sustainable food,\u201d he said.Mr Fisk\u00e5 said that while initially there had been a bit of scepticism and reluctance to share non-sensitive data needed for an AI system to work, the overall aquaculture industry\u2019s response was optimistic.\u201cI think most people are looking at this as \u2013 is it finally happening? I\u2019ve been talking to industry players in shipping, aquaculture,and energy who thought this was something we would get 10 years ago. Now it\u2019s mature, it\u2019s proven.\u201dIt isn\u2019t just about feeding fish. The Norwegian aquaculture project is viewed as the jumping off point for a number of industries in the \u201cBlue Economy\u201d \u2013 shipping, offshore renewable energy, and carbon sequestration.In shipping, for example, AI could be used to analyze micro-weather systems, and optimize vessel speeds, reroute around port traffic and adjust arrival times to cut fuel use, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions.

Back-to-back tornadoes killed one person in the state and injured dozens, leaving homes and businesses shattered, and residents dealing with power outages. Mr Reeves attended the Republican Governors Association (RGA) fundraiser alongside Alabama GOP Governor Kay Ivey at the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Birmingham on Monday, an invitation showed according to the Associated Press. Attendees paid between $5,000 for one person and $50,000 for four people. Mr Reeves is serving as the RGA policy chair and is hoping to get re-elected as governor this year.

Covering 70% of Earth\u2019s surface, the average depth of the ocean is 3,682 metres. The lower you go the higher the hydrostatic pressure (the force per unit area exerted by a liquid on an object).The deepest point of the ocean \u2013 the Mariana Trench \u2013 is 11,034 metres deep. It\u2019s located in the western part of the Pacific Ocean and is a 1,580-mile-long stretch (2,542 kilometres) of oceanic abyss.According to a study published in the journal Earth-Science Reviews, there are at least four other deep parts of the ocean across the world, including the Molloy Hole in the Arctic Ocean, located at 5,669 metres below the surface. There\u2019s also the Sunda Trench, also known as Java Trench, situated 7,290 metres underwater.The deepest part of the Southern Ocean, which encircles Antarctica, can be found within the South Sandwich Trench, at a depth of 7,385 metres.Lastly, a Puerto Rico trench site called Milwaukee Deep, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean, has a depth of 8,408 metres.To put that into context, the deepest a scuba diver has ever gone is 332.35 metres (a record held by Ahmed Gabr for a dive in the Red Sea).What is the ocean floor like?Though the ocean floor can be dark, it doesn\u2019t look the same across the entire ocean. So why is this the case?\u201cNatural geology,\u201d said Sophie Benbow, director of marine at Fauna & Flora International, a conservation charity dedicated to protecting the planet\u2019s threatened wildlife and habitats. \u201cIn the same way, we have mountains and river valleys on the land, they basically exist like that at the bottom of the sea. Affected by movements of tectonic plates (creates undersea volcanoes and hydrothermal vents) and oceanography processes, [for example] currents.\u201dThis makes the seafloor potentially unstable and it can rapidly bury marine life or shipwrecks where you can also find strong currents.What\u2019s it like around 3,900 metres \u2013 where the Titanic wreck lies?Many people imagine there to be a seabed with a vast amount of sand but like most of the deep sea, it\u2019s a jagged and dynamic landscape made of sediments with as much variation as any place onshore.Benbow described it as being \u201clow [in] oxygen, near freezing temperature, a completely dark environment which provides unique habitats to species that have evolved over millennia to be able to thrive there\u2026 with unique features to survive in the very high-pressure environment\u201d.Dependent on the oceanic zone (the region of the open sea beyond the continental shelf is divided into four zones: the sunlight zone, twilight zone, midnight zone, and abyssal zone) a wide range of species can be found.The depths of the ocean from 1,000-4,000 metres are called the bathypelagic or midnight zone.Dr Huw Griffiths, a marine biologist at the British Antarctic Survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s called the midnight zone because [the] light in the ocean decreases with depth and below 1,000 metres there is no light from the surface, but some animals do produce light (bioluminescence) to attract prey and mates or to escape predators.\u201dWhat sealife can be found at this level?The World Register of Deep-Sea Species (WoRDSS) has kept a comprehensive taxonomic database of known deep-sea and marine organisms since it launched in December 2012. So there is no doubt that the bottom of the ocean is teeming with a unique and special life.\u201cWe would refer to the wonders of the deep rather than anything more sinister,\u201d said Benbow. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there are species to be afraid of except perhaps in appearance as some of them are rather weird and wonderful.\u201dFor instance, you would find one of the world\u2019s deepest living fish, the Mariana snailfish, which over time has evolved to develop holes in its skull to keep its head from exploding due to the high pressures of the deep ocean.There\u2019s also the Dumbo octopus, named after the Disney elephant \u2013 the deepest living of all known octopuses. Due to its rarity, this creature has specially adapted so that it can more easily reproduce anytime it finds a mate.There\u2019s the Headless chicken fish, a type of deep-sea cucumber, also known as the Spanish dancer thanks to its unusual pink appearance.Grittiths added: \u201cOn the seafloor, there are worms, brittle stars, starfish and other invertebrates. All of the animals at this depth are dependent on food sinking down from the surface layers of the ocean.\u201dRecommendedKeeping primates as pets to be banned under Government proposalsConservation work yields bumper broods for barn owl community in Co AntrimMarine heatwaves \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for ocean life, say scientistsAt least 24 different species including fish, crabs and corals have been recorded from the wreck of the Titanic, he said.\u201cThe ocean as a whole helps to regulate our global climate and is doing a great job of mitigating the ever-increasing impacts of fossil fuel emissions by absorbing and storing over 91% of the excess heat from global warming,\u201d Benbow added. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes marine sediments one of the most expansive and critical carbon reservoirs on the planet.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940d0751ac334f3a315f2f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/france-protest-police-violence-group-b2361587.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "France shuts down climate activism group \u2013 claiming it provoked violence", "lead": "<p>Les Soulevements de la Terre say they will fight the decree in court </p>", "author": "Juliette Jabkhiro", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:04:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:43.683405", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T12:04:56+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/12/Gerald-Darmanin.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It doesn\u2019t belong to any segment of the population \u2013 it belongs to everyone.\u201cBroadening out that appeal will be good for the cricketing authorities because it will create more fans, more supporters and maybe more players.\u201cMaybe one day we will have a Jewish English Test player. If Daniel and I can inspire anything like that, what an amazing thing that would be.\u201dThe wheels in motion for this exhibition can be charted back to when Cooper and Lightman co-wrote \u2018Cricket Grounds from the Air\u2019 and interviewed more than 100 cricketers for the book published in 2009.Upon discovering the \u201cuntapped stories\u201d of various Jewish international cricketers, the duo decided to drive forward with an exhibition, but plans to roll it out during the action-packed summer of 2019 had to be shelved.Talks with the MCC took place after the Ashes of that year and, with its backing, the ball started to get rolling in 2020.Lightman told PA: \u201cWe got to know some cricketers from writing a book where we found out personal recollections that were deserving of being recorded.\u201cWe had a particular interest in the often untold or little-known stories of Jewish cricketers.\u201cThey may not have been greatest legends of the game but their stories were often interesting, quirky and shared a lot on the antisemitism they faced.\u201dThe end result is the \u2018Cricket and the Jewish Community\u2019 exhibition, which is the first in the new Community Gallery, formerly the Brian Johnston Film Theatre, that will aim to rotate displays about the bonds different communities have with cricket over the coming years.\n\nIt will create more fans, more supporters and maybe more players. Maybe one day we will have a Jewish English Test player. If Daniel and I can inspire anything like that, what an amazing thing that would be.MCC member Zaki CooperA number of the items have been donated by Lightman, including the blazer and cap of South African Sid O\u2019Linn, whose Irish-sounding name concealed the fact that he had been born Sydney Olinsky, the son of a kosher butcher.Grassroots cricket, the Maccabiah Games and antisemitism are covered in the exhibition with video contributions from MCC president Stephen Fry, Irish internationals Jason and Lara Molins and South African opening batter Mandy Yachad, who wore religious garment \u2018Tzitzit\u2019 in his first one-day international.Lightman continued: \u201cIn 2014 I interviewed Norman Gordon, then 99 years old, and he was the last survivor of the Timeless Test.\u201cHe played in that match (against England) and was the first openly Jewish cricketer to play for South Africa.\u201cHe told me on the first ball he bowled in Test cricket someone shouted out, \u2018Here comes the Rabbi\u2019, which was meant to be a negative comment but he shut him up by taking five wickets.\u201cSo, I think this is important in terms of showing the MCC is actively promoting inclusivity and diversity through the exhibition and through other activities like the launch events connected to it.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been many role models of Jewish cricketers playing at the highest level which can inspire the next generation. That is why the exhibition is important to show there has been people in the past.\u201dThe official launch for the exhibition took place at the MCC Museum on Wednesday evening, with MCC president Fry and DCMS secretary Lucy Fraser guest speakers, with a further event set to be held there on Thursday.Monday will see an event open to the public where Julien Wiener, the only Jewish man to play Test cricket for Australia, joins South Africa\u2019s Yachad for a conversation at the Jewish Community Centre in Finchley Road.Supporters of England and Australia will get the chance to visit the exhibition for free with their match ticket during next week\u2019s second Test at Lord\u2019s.\u201cIt will run for two years. There is the opportunity for school visits, youth group visits. We really do hope the community embrace it and it is early on but there has been a lot of enthusiasm for it,\u201d Cooper concluded.RecommendedSir Geoffrey Boycott says England \u2018have got carried away with Bazball\u2019Combined home worlds is a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 opportunity, says Elinor BarkerFootball rumours: Manchester United make last-gasp attempt to sign Harry Kane\u201cFor both of us, it has been a big learning curve.\u201cThere have been some amazing stories that have come out and maybe, as a result of this, more will come out.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940d0a51ac334f3a315f39", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/geoffrey-boycott-brendon-mccullum-edgbaston-australia-ashes-b2362140.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sir Geoffrey Boycott says England \u2018have got carried away with Bazball\u2019", "lead": "The hosts are 1-0 down with four matches to play after being beaten by two wickets by Australia in a dramatic finale at Edgbaston on Tuesday.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 07:14:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:46.741380", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T07:14:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/22/08/28d066ccef7635d99957d85c2477114fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NTAzNzYw-2.44720105.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The club have long known their list of potential targets but any moves are dependent on who leaves. As many as six players could go, and two of them - Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva - have had offers from Saudi Arabia.Even City, who have become the most assertive force in the game through their Abu Dhabi ownership, have had all their plans affected by this summer window\u2019s most disruptive force. The key figures in Saudi Arabia might say this is the natural order, since they are the main power in the region.It has had an immense influence on this summer\u2019s market, maybe the biggest since Paris Saint-Germain bought Neymar for what remains a record fee. Many involved insist it surpasses the effect of the Chinese Super League in the winter of 2016-17.While the headline element in all this has been the staggering money offered for so many prime players, the main effect has been how it has abruptly changed the plans of every major club. It is difficult to remember anything like it.It\u2019s all the more pronounced since this was expected to be a frenetic summer anyway. All of Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United planned significant comings and goings while Arsenal and Liverpool have been aiming for at least two major signings each. The competition for strikers was meanwhile set to be the driving force, from Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Randal Kolo Muani through Harry Kane to Atalanta\u2019s Rasmus Hojlund.RecommendedSaudi Arabia can help Chelsea solve headache \u2014 but talks raise more questions than answersFirst golf, now football? Saudi Arabia\u2019s grand plan and the 72 hours that changed everythingSportswashing is about to change football beyond anything you can imagineEven that has been overtaken. Many of those plans have been almost totally put off, because the market has been completely transformed.A number of Premier League clubs have had new meetings this week, as they attempt to untangle so many connected issues. There is first of all the fact that the nature of every negotiation has changed. Saudi Arabian interest weighs over everything, even with players that wouldn\u2019t yet dream of going there.It points to the biggest issue of all. Saudi Pro League money has completely inflated the market. Many within the industry are complaining that it has introduced an instability. Fees have gone up and wages have gone up.As an example, United had been looking at Hojlund for a potential price of \u00a345m but in the last week Atalanta have almost doubled the price. Players that would have been \u00a340m two years ago are now available at \u00a370m.This is one other reason plans have been put off. Some clubs are waiting to see if all this settles down.Man City\u2019s plans have been impacted  (PA Wire)Right now, though, various sources are describing a situation of \u201cchaos\u201d. It makes it worse that so many intermediaries are trying to get involved. It\u2019s almost a new gold rush. Some officials have complained they have had figures come to them making promises about certain players or signings only for that to go nowhere.It may ironically mean few players go anywhere for a while. This is seen as a huge week for the Saudi Pro League itself as it attempts to convince a number of big names to join. Losing Lionel Messi was a blow and checked momentum. Ruben Neves is a fine player but he doesn\u2019t quite match up to the megastars they want. Ilkay Gundogan, who also received an offer from Saudi Arabia, is set to rebuff them for Barcelona.As one figure who has been involved in negotiations with the Saudi league says, the next few days will determine how big this wave of signings is.RecommendedHuman rights must be key consideration in selecting World Cup 2030 host \u2013 surveyLeading figures summoned to Senate hearing over shock PGA Tour-LIV Golf mergerSaudi Arabia can help Chelsea solve headache \u2014 but talks raise issuesIt has still caused huge ripples in the wider game, though.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIlia Topuria has a question for you. Actually, he has a few.\u201cDo you know how good I am?\u201d is the first. Initially, I\u2019m not quite sure whether I should answer on your behalf. He asks again. \u201cDo you know how good I am?\u201d To my relief, he quickly follows up. \u201cI can submit him, I can knock him out. I can do with him whatever I want.\u201d The German-born Georgian, fighting out of Spain, is not actually talking about Josh Emmett \u2013 whom he faces in a UFC Fight Night main event on Saturday. Rather, he is reflecting on his win against Bryce Mitchell. In December, Topuria submitted the submission specialist to the surprise of many, and that is why he asks: \u201cDo you know how good I am?\u201dIt is also why he asks: \u201cDo you know how dangerous my takedowns are, how dangerous my ground game is?\u201d I had entered our interview presuming I would be asking the questions, but by this point, the unbeaten featherweight might have overtaken me. \u201cI don\u2019t care what people say about me,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople were talking like: \u2018He\u2019s good on the ground\u2019. I\u2019ve been a black belt since I was 20 years old. For me, there\u2019s no surprise if I submit Bryce Mitchell or anyone in my division. I know that I can finish anyone.

Do you know how dangerous my left hand is?\u201dThe answers to all of Topuria\u2019s questions are found fairly easily, so any frustration he has towards those fans who have missed them is understandable. Twelve of the Georgian\u2019s 13 professional wins have coming via stoppage \u2013 eight by submission and four by knockout. Nine months before Topuria entered the featherweight top 10 with his arm-triangle choke against Mitchell, he knocked out Jai Herbert on the Briton\u2019s home soil in London. After surviving a knockdown from a picture-perfect head kick, Topuria melted Herbert with a singing left hook to the liver and a molten right hand to the chin.Topuria celebrates his stunning knockout of Jai Herbert last year (Kieran Cleeves/PA) (PA Wire)While that bout took place at lightweight, it registered as a message to all UFC featherweight contenders when Topuria later dropped into the division. And, now done asking questions, Topuria has a message for you: \u201cShut up. Just watch the fight and enjoy.\u201dTopuria will certainly enjoy his clash with Emmett in Jacksonville this weekend, as he looks to hand the American, 38, a second straight defeat, four months after Emmett lost to Yair Rodriguez with the interim featherweight belt on the line.\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the ring, I\u2019m really happy and really thankful to God,\u201d Topuria tells The Independent, \u201cbecause I asked him to put me in this position. It was my goal to become a UFC champion, and this is the way I have to pass. When I go inside the cage, I feel very happy to have that opportunity, because I have the chance to fight for my dreams, and right now there are a lot of people in hospitals, [fighting] for their lives.\u201cI\u2019m working for my happiness every day. When I wake up, I\u2019m not happy just for something I did in the past; I can\u2019t live off that for my whole life. I\u2019m just focused on myself and achieving my goals. I don\u2019t care about anyone else \u2013 just me, my family, and my friends. That\u2019s it.\u201dTopuria en route to a submission win over Bryce Mitchell in December (Getty Images)Among the small group dearest to Topuria is his three-year-old son \u2013 already a \u201cman\u201d, in his father\u2019s words. \u201cHe knows [what I do], he knows,\u201d Topuria says. \u201cHe calls me every day, supporting me. He speaks perfectly. He\u2019s a man. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gonna do MMA.

The all-rounder made her England debut in July 2013, at Louth, a club ground in Lincolnshire, a far cry from those coming through now who could first step over the rope in an England cap at Trent Bridge.Captain Heather Knight has said of her own debut in 2010 in Mumbai that it was played in front of \u201cone man and his dog\u201d, but 2023 has been billed as \u201cone summer, two Ashes\u201d and over 70,000 tickets have been sold for the women\u2019s series.\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d Sciver-Brunt told The Independent. \u201cThis summer, before it\u2019s even started has got so much more hype around it, it\u2019s got so much more excitement.\u201cWith the marketing the way that it has been done, it\u2019s just allowed us to be more visible and more seen.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWimbledon has announced that it will become the latest sporting event to utilise artificial intelligence (AI), with the All England Club to use the technology to help produce commentary for video highlights packages.Starting at this year\u2019s Championships, app or website users will be able to watch back highlights from the tournament with audio commentary and captions that have been solely produced by AI.Working with IBM watsonx, the AI commentary will not replace human commentary as of yet, but will instead be used on the app for highlights without commentary and for matches that aren\u2019t available on the show courts.This is not the first time that Wimbledon has used the technology, with their stats packages and power rankings already produced using AI. Still, it will mark a significant step forward in the use of such technology at the tournament, which has evolved and grown greatly over the past year with the release of language learning modules such as Chat GPT-4 prompting calls for a slowdown in AI\u2019s enhancement for fears that it may be misused in the future.Alongside the commentary, Wimbledon and IBM watsonx will also introduce a new feature, dubbed IBM AI draw analysis, which will use machine technology to determine how favourable a player\u2019s route to the final might be based on their ranking and draw for the tournament.This will not be the first time that IBM has rolled out such features, with the company partnering with the Masters \u2013 one of golf\u2019s major championships \u2013 in April to produce AI commentary for the shot-by-shot highlights packages that were housed on the tournament\u2019s app.RecommendedQueen\u2019s order of play and Wednesday scheduleAndy Murray insists he can compete at Wimbledon despite early Queen\u2019s exitQueen\u2019s 2023 LIVE: Andy Murray suffers Wimbledon blow as Alex de Minaur ends winning runIn that case, the AI commentary was not replacing human commentary which was not present on the app and Wimbledon is keen to make clear that AI will not, at present, be used to replace the human voice.IBM Sports Partnerships Leader, Kevin Farrar said: \u201cI see AI as very much complementing the human element, rather than replacing it.\u201dHowever, Farrar did suggest that the software may eventually be used for full commentary on matches. \u201cYou can see in the future, you could train it in different styles and it opens up other possibilities in the future, around different languages, different voices.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHuman rights must be a key consideration in selecting the hosts of the 2030 World Cup, according to a new survey.Fifty-three per cent of the 17,477 people from 15 countries who took part in a YouGov poll commissioned by Amnesty International said human rights considerations were vital in choosing the host of the World Cup and other major sporting events, rising to 60 per cent among UK respondents.Saudi Arabia has been linked with a joint bid alongside Greece and Egypt to host the 2030 or 2034 World Cup, while the Middle East state has already been selected to host the Club World Cup in December.Representatives of more than 200 national associations will vote on who should host the 2030 finals at a FIFA Congress next year.FIFA made human rights criteria part of the bidding process for the 2026 finals, which were awarded to the United States, Canada and Mexico, following the decision by the governing body\u2019s now-defunct executive committee to award the 2018 and 2022 finals to Russia and Qatar respectively back in 2010.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHowever, organisations such as Amnesty and Kick It Out remain concerned that not enough importance is being attached to human rights in future decision-making processes.The poll showed that, after safety and security (57 per cent), human rights was the most commonly-chosen consideration for determining tournament hosts.This was the top consideration in seven of the countries surveyed and highest in Switzerland (68 per cent), where FIFA is based.More than four times as many people chose human rights as a key factor over \u201ccommercial revenues for sports bodies\u201d \u2013 just 13 per cent.Amnesty\u2019s head of economic and social justice Steve Cockburn said: \u201cIt is clear that the public wants human rights to be a high priority so that the World Cup is a celebration of the game they love and never provides a platform for exploitation, repression or discrimination.\u201cFIFA must rigorously apply the highest human rights standards in evaluating all bids to host its flagship tournament, demand clear human rights action plans and reject any bid that fails to credibly show how serious human rights risks would be prevented, independently monitored and remedied if abuses occur.\u201d\n\nIt is critical that FIFA puts human rights front and centre when choosing the host for the 2030 men's World CupDirector of the Sports and Rights Alliance Andrea FlorenceAndrea Florence, the director of the Sports and Rights Alliance, added: \u201cSince 2017,\u00a0FIFA has made important\u00a0progress\u00a0in recognising its human rights responsibilities.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFrankie Dettori was once again the toast of Royal Ascot as the magical Italian secured the first winner of his final week at the showpiece meeting courtesy of Gregory in the Queen\u2019s Vase.The 52-year-old announced in December that 2023 would be his last year in the saddle and on so many occasions he has stolen the show at the summer spectacular.But the opening day was a frustrating one for the veteran rider as not only did he have to make do with the runner-up spot in three races, he also picked up a nine-day suspension for careless riding.But the betting suggested John and Thady Gosden\u2019s dual winner Gregory would get him off the mark on day two, with punters ensuring he went off an even-money favourite, and Dettori delivered a brilliantly-judged ride from the front to send the packed grandstands wild.Just for a moment it looked like Gregory could be picked off by Saint George when challenged in the closing stages, but the son of Golden Horn found more for pressure and was ultimately well on top as he passed the post with a length and a half in hand, giving his rider a 78th Royal Ascot success.RecommendedFrankie Dettori: Racing\u2019s great showman takes one last shot at Royal Ascot glory\u201cI thought this winner was never going to come this year. I had three seconds yesterday, but I knew this would be my best chance,\u201d Dettori told ITV Racing.\u201cI was in front a long time and when Oisin (Murphy, on the runner-up) came to me I thought \u2018oh no, not second again\u2019. This horse really stuck his neck out though, he was great. To ride a winner at my last Royal Ascot is fantastic.\u201cIt was amazing the reception I got because it is my last season, I couldn\u2019t be happier. I\u2019m both sad and happy, I\u2019ve still got three more days, but at least I\u2019ve got one on the board.\u201dGosden senior said of his completely unexposed winner, who is now favourite for the St Leger: \u201cThat was a dominant display, he broke well, Frankie got a good position and then he was able to control the pace. When the second came to him he\u2019s gone away again.\u201cHe\u2019s a class horse, we\u2019re aiming for the St Leger and I told the owners before. All being well, touch wood, he might be a Cup horse next season.\u201cHe\u2019ll need to run somewhere before the Leger, so he\u2019ll go in one of the trials. I trained the father (Golden Horn) and the mother (Gretchen), so I know the family very well.\u201dRecommendedRoyal Ascot expert tips and best bets for Day 2Frankie Dettori: Racing\u2019s great showman takes one last shot at Royal Ascot gloryRoyal Ascot race card, times and how to watch Day 1He added: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely great, Frankie won it in the first furlong because he got him out and got the position.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland will attempt to end a miserable past few years in the Women\u2019s Ashes and topple Australia for the first time since 2014 when the multi-format series starts on Thursday.Here, the PA news agency assesses some of the burning issues ahead of the curtain-raising one-off Test at Trent Bridge.The greatest showHeather Knight recently harked back to making her England debut in Mumbai in 2010 \u201cin front of one man and his dog\u201d and, as a student, having to explain to her tutor why she would be absent for a month. Thankfully those days are over. The England captain was given equal billing alongside men\u2019s counterpart Ben Stokes on a Tower Bridge projection earlier this month and ticket sales for the \u2018WAshes\u2019 sit at a combined 80,000 for the seven matches. Even if there is still just a solitary Test, it will span five days in a break from the traditional four-day affair \u2013 giving both teams a chance to claim a first Ashes win in whites since 2015. Barriers continue to be breached for Knight\u2019s side as they will also play T20s at Edgbaston, the Kia Oval and Lord\u2019s for the first time.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveLanning absence evens the odds?Australia are the double world champions and have held the urn for the last eight years, beating England on their own patch twice in that time. But Rachael Haynes retired last year and totemic captain Meg Lanning withdrew from the tour due to medical issues. Are Australia more vulnerable now? Unquestionably. Lanning is an exceptional captain and batter who was in red-hot form. But her temporary successor Alyssa Healy is also a quality player, as are Ellyse Perry, Tahlia McGrath, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner and Jess Jonassen. Australia are therefore red-hot favourites to continue their stranglehold over England.Spotlight on England\u2019s bowlersWhile Australia brought over a couple of unproven talents, England also have a few inexperienced players in their line-up. Katherine Sciver-Brunt may have had a peripheral role given her scaling back of commitments but the seamer\u2019s retirement robs England of some wisdom. Kate Cross is likely to lead the attack after insisting this week she is fit and ready following a battle with a parasitic illness that has cut into her playing time domestically. The uncapped Lauren Filer might be the ace in the hole, though, after being named in the Test XI with Knight telling the PA news agency: \u201cShe\u2019s raw but she bowls wicket-taking deliveries, which is why we\u2019ve picked her because we want to take 20 wickets.\u201d\u2018Jonball\u2019 faces its acid testSince succeeding Lisa Keightley as England head coach late last year, Jon Lewis has attempted to instil a more attacking mindset into his charges. Lewis has taken his cues from working briefly as a bowling coach for the England men\u2019s side in the early stages of the Brendon McCullum-Ben Stokes axis last summer, sensing this is the best way to break Australia\u2019s grip on women\u2019s cricket. \u2018Jonball\u2019 \u2013 the term coined by star all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt \u2013 has had modest returns so far with a semi-final exit at the 2023 T20 World Cup but England will keep ploughing the same furrow.RecommendedEngland approach \u2018validated\u2019 despite defeat in opening Ashes TestHarriet Dart beats Anhelina Kalinina again to book quarter-final spotRobertson appreciative as Newcastle remember Tiote \u2013 Wednesday\u2019s sporting socialPressure on Heather?The decision to jettison Charlotte Edwards and promote Knight as England captain a little over seven years ago was controversial at the time. But barely 12 months into the role, Knight justified her ascension by leading England to a seminal World Cup triumph. She remains the natural leader of this England team and her authoritative presence was missed at the sharp end of last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, a tournament she sat out because of injury. But she has been unable to land a telling blow in the Ashes, with one drawn series and two heavy points defeats. A third this summer might draw scrutiny on her position even if Australia are one of the greatest sides of all time in women\u2019s sport."}, {"_id": "64940d1051ac334f3a315f50", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/kai-havertz-arsenal-germany-premier-league-declan-rice-b2361623.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arsenal and Chelsea agree Kai Havertz fee", "lead": "<p>The 24-year-old has emerged as a top target for the Gunners in recent weeks</p>", "author": "Mark Mann-Bryans", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:17:42", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:52.923386", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T17:17:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/13/1d081c7660e4af89c9b8fd73df3ecdedY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDM3Mjgz-2.71605450.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHead coach Brendon McCullum insisted England felt \u201cvalidated\u201d despite an agonising defeat in the first Ashes Test, and doubled down on the selection gamble of Moeen Ali.England drove the game forward for the majority of five gripping days at Edgbaston but still find themselves 1-0 down with four to play after Australia\u2019s more conservative approach carried them to a two-wicket victory in the dying moments of the final evening.It needed a brilliant match-winning intervention of 44 not out from captain Pat Cummins to seal the deal, as England failed to defend a target of 281 thanks to his ninth-wicket stand with tailender Nathan Lyon.England skipper Ben Stokes refused to entertain regrets after the match, commending his team for setting up a dramatic finish to a game that could have fallen flat due to a slow pitch and rain delays.McCullum is cut from exactly the same cloth and he saw enough from his side to feel sure that their commitment to risky, aggressive cricket was the right way to go.RecommendedBen Stokes and England must have \u2018no fear\u2019 and stay loyal to Bazball despite Ashes defeat\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the boys to be honest. I thought it was a cracking Test match,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone that watched all around the world and everyone who was here at Edgbaston absolutely loved it and that includes us. I had an absolutely amazing time.\u201cObviously you\u2019d rather have won the game \u2013 that\u2019s just the nature of sport sometimes \u2013 but I thought the way that we played validated our style of play.\u201cWe firmly believe, the skipper and I, that this gives us our greatest chance.\u201cOf everyone that has watched this game over the last five days, I would be very surprised if there were too many people who disagree with how we go about playing, because everyone was left entertained.\u201cYou\u2019re not always going to win and we understand that, but we want to keep getting up and throwing punches as a team.\u201dMcCullum was equally undeterred when it came to questions over Moeen\u2019s painful return to the Test arena.The 36-year-old was tempted out of red-ball retirement after Jack Leach went down with a stress fracture but, despite producing a couple of superb wicket-taking deliveries, he was reduced to a peripheral role in the critical fourth innings after a blister opened up on his right index finger.That left England relying heavily on Joe Root\u2019s part-time off-breaks and invited speculation over Moeen\u2019s place in the second Test at Lord\u2019s next Wednesday.McCullum suggested some thought would be given to possible call-ups \u2013 with Surrey\u2019s Will Jacks the most obvious candidate \u2013 but was confident that the injury could be resolved in the coming days. If that is the case, he guaranteed Moeen another shot.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some ideas and some theories up your sleeve and some options as well, but I\u2019m pretty confident that we can get on top of Mo\u2019s finger,\u201d he said.\u201cThat will give us an opportunity to select him in the next game and if he\u2019s available, he will be selected.\u201cI thought Mo did a great job \u2013 he bowled a couple of absolute \u2018jaffas\u2019 in the game and that\u2019s what his role was, to try and make breakthroughs when he had the opportunity.\u201cHe\u2019s got a big smile on his face, he\u2019s loving being back playing Test cricket, which is testament to the game and also Stokesy and all the boys for making the environment one that you want to be a part of.\u201dJonny Bairstow was another player who had some words of encouragement from McCullum after a tricky time behind the stumps.He dropped a couple of catches and missed a stumping in the match, leaving some pining for the absent Ben Foakes and his imperious glovework.Bairstow\u2019s return from a broken leg and the emergence of Harry Brook at number five means Foakes will continue to be the odd man out and McCullum, a former international wicketkeeper, declared himself content with the status quo.\u201cI thought they were pretty tough mistakes to be honest. I\u2019ve kept over here before, it\u2019s not the easiest place. When the ball is spitting and bouncing out of the rough, it can be quite difficult,\u201d he said.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI actually thought Jonny kept really well right throughout.

Fingers crossed they can go far.\u201cFor the players that weren\u2019t there last year, they can look around that changing room and see so many different faces that were involved and played big parts in moments within the squad. Anybody that has been there and done it, and obviously the manager has done it twice, I think you can believe and have trust, you can settle people\u2019s nerves by looking around and sharing experiences.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is just one leader in that England team. Collectively, that is their strong point. I think it will come down to how well they gel off the pitch and I\u2019m sure they are going to do a fantastic job because they can look back on their previous experiences.\u201dRachel Yankey during the England Women v Japan Women in 2013 (Getty Images)One noticeable aspect of the England squad named by Wiegman was the inclusion of just two Black players, Jess Carter and Lauren James.That is a continuation of a theme that was evident at the Euros, when Carter and Nikita Parris were the only Black players to get onto the pitch for England.The FA are aware of the issue, with Wiegman stressing that work is being done to change the make-up of the squad, while admitting it will not happen overnight.For Yankey, at one point England\u2019s most capped footballer of either gender, and a trailblazer for Black women\u2019s footballers, part of that trend may be due to the increased organisation of football.Lucy Bronze and Lauren James of England interact during a training session at St Georges Park (Getty Images)\u201cThere\u2019s many different barriers that are leading to why young girls from all different backgrounds are not taking up the sport or not staying in the sport, or not getting the same opportunities to play the sport,\u201d added Yankey, who delivered a moving Team Talk at the Gatorade\u2019s 5v5 all-female tournament in Eindhoven, an annual five-a-side competition for 14- to 16-year-olds that featured nine female teams from across the Netherlands who all fought hard to qualify for the final and represent their local communities on a global stage.\u201cOne of the things that relates straightaway, when I think back to when I played football as a kid, I used to go out of my front door and with two boys across the road, we would go to the bottom of the street and play football. You don\u2019t see people do that anymore. We used to go to the park and play football, you don\u2019t really see people do that anymore.\u201cWe used to play unorganised football where we would create our games and make up our own skills.

We had a plan, it was definitely an aggressive plan and we gave it a go.\u201dLast year Tarling won the world time trial title at junior level.Here, he skipped the under-23 category and only looked out of place in terms of how dominant he was. Tarling is 360 days younger than Josh Charlton, who took the men\u2019s under-23 title earlier in the day.Wright, who came into the race still dealing with some raw emotions following the death of his team-mate Gino Mader at the Tour de Suisse last week, could only admire Tarling\u2019s ride.\u201cAs a ride, I was really pleased with it, Wright told the PA news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame there was a massive kid who\u2019s put a minute into me, so what can you do?\u201cHe\u2019s a super talent and I think he\u2019s going to be the next big thing in time trialling.\u201dIt is the third year in a row an Ineos rider has taken the title. Ethan Hayter \u2013 winner of the last two national championships \u2013 was unable to defend his title due to a broken collarbone, while Geraint Thomas also withdrew and is now expected to also sit out Sunday\u2019s road race.But even with some elite riders missing, Tarling\u2019s margin of victory left little doubt as to his superiority.Holden won the women\u2019s event by 14 seconds from Anna Morris and 16 from Elinor Barker, completing the 27.4km course \u2013 two laps of the route \u2013 in a time of 37 minutes and two seconds.The 25-year-old Manx rider was third in last year\u2019s time trial as Joss Lowden took the title, and second as an under-23 rider in 2019, but this was her first time on the top step of the podium.\u201cIt\u2019s very special,\u201d Holden said. \u201cIt means a lot. I had high expectations because I\u2019ve been close many times before, and with Joss not being here, I thought it could actually be possible.\u201cBut you never know until it happens.

Delaying the new ball in the fourth innings also made sense on that surface.\u201cThe only query I had was whether a bit of rustiness from a lack of game time in preparation night have been the difference.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFirst the romance, then the new reality. N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s eight years in England were bookended by two phenomena, two dramatic shifts in the footballing world. In his debut season, came Leicester\u2019s improbable Premier League win, powered by Kante, destined to be a one-off. As he goes, it is to Saudi Arabia, to Al Ittihad, to a project that has greater funds and may have more longevity. Kante, the footballer who famously drove a Mini, will get a supersized salary, reportedly \u00a386m. Selfless running has proved to be a profitable business.That it came in the same summer Leicester were relegated is a coincidence. Yet an era has ended: the three catalysts for English football\u2019s greatest fairytale may not play in the Premier League again, with Jamie Vardy going down with the Foxes and Riyad Mahrez perhaps destined to join Kante in Saudi Arabia. A new force in the global game now is in the Middle East, not the East Midlands.Kante goes as Leicester and Chelsea\u2019s likeable legend, the unassuming and perhaps inimitable \u2013 though maybe Moises Caicedo will be charged with emulating him at Stamford Bridge \u2013 architect of unexpected triumphs. If xG has been a factor in football in recent years, so has \u2018NG\u2019; the latter was a way of confounding predictions.It says something that winning the World Cup may not rank in Kante\u2019s top three achievements; not given the context, anyway, because France were at least among the favourites in 2018. Their prowess, however, relied upon a recurring theme in Kante\u2019s career: his ability to do the work of two men, which in turn released Paul Pogba to adopt a more attacking brief.Kante became a hugely popular figure at Chelsea (PA )RecommendedJose Mourinho gets four-game ban for Anthony Taylor abuse at Europa League finalJose Mourinho hit by Uefa punishment for abusing referee Anthony Taylor Man Utd see \u00a350m bid rejected for Mason Mount as Chelsea set asking priceBut the Kante hat-trick consisted of his back-to-back Premier Leagues, with Leicester and Chelsea, who had finished 14th and 10th respectively the previous seasons, and then the 2021 Champions League. Arguably, he was the outstanding player in each competition. In 2015-16, the individual honours went to Vardy and Mahrez, before Kante was named both PFA Player of the Year and Footballer of the Year the following season. Aided by Italy\u2019s triumph at Euro 2020, Jorginho won Uefa\u2019s Player of the Year for 2020-21; it is no slight on the regista to say he was not even the best player in Chelsea\u2019s midfield. Kante, man of the match in the final and both legs of the semi-final, was the small man who doubled up as a big-game player, and not merely because a disproportionate share of his few goals came against Chelsea\u2019s peers.Chelsea won the Champions League by conceding two goals in seven knockout games. Thomas Tuchel branded Kante \u201cour Salah, our Van Dijk, our De Bruyne\u201d. He was right: Chelsea\u2019s X-factor footballer was a runner who was playing in France\u2019s third tier when he turned 22. Kante\u2019s defining attributes seemed prosaic: running \u2013 he could cover 13km in a game \u2013 tackling and intercepting, which he did more than virtually anyone else. But he felt flawless: the king of tackles was never sent off for either Chelsea or Leicester. And his brilliance was illustrated by his uniqueness: as others sought their own Kante, players who had similar statistics for regaining possession, such as Idrissa Gueye and Wilfred Ndidi, were acquired, but no one else had the full package.Instructive as Tuchel\u2019s tribute was, it was not the most pertinent praise of Kante. That came from the man who brought him to England, Steve Walsh, who took to whispering \u201cKante\u201d to a sceptical Claudio Ranieri when their paths crossed in corridors and in ultimately successful attempts to persuade the manager to sign him. A year later, with Leicester champions, Walsh reflected that City played three in the heart of midfield in their seemingly anachronistic 4-4-2 formation: \u201c[Danny] Drinkwater in the middle with Kante either side\u201d.Kante was Leicester's most crucial player in their title-winning campaign  (Getty)And Kante, with his extraordinary energy, held back trends in tactics. There was a sense that teams with him had 12 men. A central-midfield trio tends to be a prerequisite at elite level these days: unless, that is, one of a duo is Kante, covering the ground of two men, compensating for the times he was actually outnumbered. The last two teams to win the Premier League with a central-midfield duo are Leicester and Chelsea; the first as a low-possession team, the second sometimes with the immobile Cesc Fabregas alongside the all-action Kante. In the last decade, only one team has won the Champions League with just two out-and-out central midfielders: Chelsea in 2021. Factor in France in 2018 and Kante made tactics and teams work.Al-Ittihad will have to confront the question if such feats are consigned to the past, if a man whose physicality \u2013 along with his reading of the game \u2013 made him so good is now in decline. He only made nine appearances for Chelsea last season. Graham Potter is entitled to feel himself luckless in at least one respect: Kante was only able to play 33 minutes in his ill-fated tenure.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFirst the romance, then the new reality. N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s eight years in England were bookended by two phenomena, two dramatic shifts in the footballing world. In his debut season, came Leicester\u2019s improbable Premier League win, powered by Kante, destined to be a one-off. As he goes, it is to Saudi Arabia, to Al Ittihad, to a project that has greater funds and may have more longevity. Kante, the footballer who famously drove a Mini, will get a supersized salary, reportedly \u00a386m. Selfless running has proved to be a profitable business.That it came in the same summer Leicester were relegated is a coincidence. Yet an era has ended: the three catalysts for English football\u2019s greatest fairytale may not play in the Premier League again, with Jamie Vardy going down with the Foxes and Riyad Mahrez perhaps destined to join Kante in Saudi Arabia. A new force in the global game now is in the Middle East, not the East Midlands.Kante goes as Leicester and Chelsea\u2019s likeable legend, the unassuming and perhaps inimitable \u2013 though maybe Moises Caicedo will be charged with emulating him at Stamford Bridge \u2013 architect of unexpected triumphs. If xG has been a factor in football in recent years, so has \u2018NG\u2019; the latter was a way of confounding predictions.It says something that winning the World Cup may not rank in Kante\u2019s top three achievements; not given the context, anyway, because France were at least among the favourites in 2018. Their prowess, however, relied upon a recurring theme in Kante\u2019s career: his ability to do the work of two men, which in turn released Paul Pogba to adopt a more attacking brief.Kante became a hugely popular figure at Chelsea (PA )RecommendedJose Mourinho gets four-game ban for Anthony Taylor abuse at Europa League finalJose Mourinho hit by Uefa punishment for abusing referee Anthony Taylor Man Utd see \u00a350m bid rejected for Mason Mount as Chelsea set asking priceBut the Kante hat-trick consisted of his back-to-back Premier Leagues, with Leicester and Chelsea, who had finished 14th and 10th respectively the previous seasons, and then the 2021 Champions League. Arguably, he was the outstanding player in each competition. In 2015-16, the individual honours went to Vardy and Mahrez, before Kante was named both PFA Player of the Year and Footballer of the Year the following season. Aided by Italy\u2019s triumph at Euro 2020, Jorginho won Uefa\u2019s Player of the Year for 2020-21; it is no slight on the regista to say he was not even the best player in Chelsea\u2019s midfield. Kante, man of the match in the final and both legs of the semi-final, was the small man who doubled up as a big-game player, and not merely because a disproportionate share of his few goals came against Chelsea\u2019s peers.Chelsea won the Champions League by conceding two goals in seven knockout games. Thomas Tuchel branded Kante \u201cour Salah, our Van Dijk, our De Bruyne\u201d. He was right: Chelsea\u2019s X-factor footballer was a runner who was playing in France\u2019s third tier when he turned 22. Kante\u2019s defining attributes seemed prosaic: running \u2013 he could cover 13km in a game \u2013 tackling and intercepting, which he did more than virtually anyone else. But he felt flawless: the king of tackles was never sent off for either Chelsea or Leicester. And his brilliance was illustrated by his uniqueness: as others sought their own Kante, players who had similar statistics for regaining possession, such as Idrissa Gueye and Wilfred Ndidi, were acquired, but no one else had the full package.Instructive as Tuchel\u2019s tribute was, it was not the most pertinent praise of Kante. That came from the man who brought him to England, Steve Walsh, who took to whispering \u201cKante\u201d to a sceptical Claudio Ranieri when their paths crossed in corridors and in ultimately successful attempts to persuade the manager to sign him. A year later, with Leicester champions, Walsh reflected that City played three in the heart of midfield in their seemingly anachronistic 4-4-2 formation: \u201c[Danny] Drinkwater in the middle with Kante either side\u201d.Kante was Leicester's most crucial player in their title-winning campaign  (Getty)And Kante, with his extraordinary energy, held back trends in tactics. There was a sense that teams with him had 12 men. A central-midfield trio tends to be a prerequisite at elite level these days: unless, that is, one of a duo is Kante, covering the ground of two men, compensating for the times he was actually outnumbered. The last two teams to win the Premier League with a central-midfield duo are Leicester and Chelsea; the first as a low-possession team, the second sometimes with the immobile Cesc Fabregas alongside the all-action Kante. In the last decade, only one team has won the Champions League with just two out-and-out central midfielders: Chelsea in 2021. Factor in France in 2018 and Kante made tactics and teams work.Al-Ittihad will have to confront the question if such feats are consigned to the past, if a man whose physicality \u2013 along with his reading of the game \u2013 made him so good is now in decline. He only made nine appearances for Chelsea last season. Graham Potter is entitled to feel himself luckless in at least one respect: Kante was only able to play 33 minutes in his ill-fated tenure. Frank Lampard rather strangely used him as a No 10 against Real Madrid and Brentford. It was a glamour position but Kante was the man who long excelled at the unglamorous. He became a miracle worker by being the greatest worker of his generation."}, {"_id": "64940d1651ac334f3a315f5f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/jose-mourinho-anthony-taylor-portuguese-europa-league-west-ham-b2361718.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jose Mourinho gets four-game ban for Anthony Taylor abuse at Europa League final", "lead": "The Portuguese faced widespread criticism after he directed abuse at English referee Taylor.", "author": "Jamie Gardner", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:36:29", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:57:58.549778", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T15:36:29+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/16/a39012c15091eef646022641aed4566aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDQ2OTgx-2.72443122.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Intellogent ran really well in it last year \u2013 well treated and hopefully he\u2019s on the right side in stall 31. If you want to be on the other side, the far side, Wanees will run well at a big price \u2013 hopefully one of those hit the board.

I liked Relief Rally\u2019s wins at Windsor and Salisbury \u2013 and she can outrun her odds. I was also really impressed with Princess Chizara when she won at Bath last time out. Visually, she looks brilliant and she\u2019s overpriced after bolting up in a really good time.15:05 \u2013 CRYSTAL CAPRICECrystal Caprice, Tamarama and Indian Wish are all drawn really high and I can feel a tricast coming on! Farhh To Shy could also be thrown in too. I can\u2019t decide so take your pick!15:40 \u2013 JUMBLY (NAP)I was at the Curragh on the weekend that Jumbly ran and she tried to come way off the pace. Jumbly did well to even deliver a challenge and she will have improved. I\u2019m with her to go one better.16:20 \u2013 LUXEMBOURGI watched Luxembourg make his seasonal reappearance and I thought he was finished, however, he bounced back and was unrecognisable when winning the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh last month. He looked a different horse and while he got a good ride, he was brilliant. He can improve from that win and land the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes.17:00 \u2013 INTELLOGENTI\u2019ve got five that I fancy: Perotto,Intellogent, Atrium, Bless Him and Sonny Liston. In terms of picking the winner, I\u2019m keen on Intellogent with James Doyle on board for Jane Chapple-Hyam. He ran a blinder last year and he was eye-catching on his last start at Newbury.17:35 \u2013 PEKING OPERAI\u2019m with Peking Opera for Ryan Moore and Aidan O\u2019Brien. It looks like he\u2019s done just enough to win on his last two starts but he won with plenty in hand at Navan last time out. I don\u2019t like Gregory as the favourite so I\u2019m on Peking Opera instead.18:10 \u2013 BARNWELL BOYI like the favourite Barnwell Boy. I was really impressed with him at Goodwood and I\u2019m not worried about the drop to 5f.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe boxing landscape is arguably as intriguing as it has ever been.The past few years have seen heavyweight epics for the ages between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, they have seen Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez establish himself as the face of the sport in the eyes of many fans, and they have seen frequent displays of technical brilliance from champions in lighter weight classes.There have been upsets, title unifications, and there has been no shortage of drama \u2013 Anthony Joshua\u2019s defeats by Andy Ruiz Jr and Oleksandr Usyk standing out as prime examples.All of these fights and results have factored into The Independent\u2019s own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s boxers, to be updated monthly. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.RecommendedBehind the scenes, laughter is turning to anger in the Fury vs Usyk sagaTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesTyson Fury promises \u2018imminent\u2019 announcement of \u2018big fight\u2019The Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings10. Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight.

While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.Before diving into the top 10, here are a couple of honourable mentions:RecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearBest seat in the house: UFC\u2019s commentary team on what it\u2019s like to be cageside for the biggest fights in the world\u2018The only rules?

While the American, 35, has lost both of his shots at undisputed gold, he pushed then-champion Kamaru Usman to the brink in both fights. Covington, a wrestling specialist, responded to his second defeat by Usman with a dominant points win over friend-turned-rival Jorge Masvidal in March 2022. He has not fought since.Stipe Miocic (20-4, heavyweight)The consensus heavyweight GOAT, the part-time firefighter holds the record for most successful title defences in the division \u2013 the hardest weight class at which to put together a sustained run. The American surrendered the belt to Francis Ngannou and the French-Cameroonian\u2019s freakish knockout power in March 2021, but prior to that achieved back-to-back wins against one of the greatest ever in Daniel Cormier. The veteran, 40, also holds a decision victory over Ngannou, plus wins against more UFC champions in Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Werdum and Andrei Arlovski. However, he has dropped out of our top 10 due to two years of inactivity. Miocic is expected to return in July, to challenge current heavyweight champion Jon Jones.Brandon Moreno (20-6-2, flyweight champion)Mexico\u2019s first ever UFC champion has just one loss in the last five years, though he has also competed in two competitive draws in that period \u2013 the most recent kickstarting the most entertaining run of his career. There was no winner when Moreno challenged Deiveson Figueiredo in 2020, but the \u201cAssassin Baby\u201d submitted the Brazilian in their 2021 rematch to win the gold. Figueiredo wrestled the belt back in a close trilogy bout last year, but Moreno claimed the interim title by stopping Kai Kara-France and went on to stop Figueiredo again this January. In doing so, he became a two-time undisputed champion.Top 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally.9. Robert Whittaker (24-6, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just twice in the last eight years. Both of those losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but each has come against a former world champion, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around). An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (25-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski is riding a 22-fight winning streak  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro loss came against a welterweight champion, until this February. Seven of the Australian\u2019s last eight fights have pitted him against \u2018elite\u2019 fighters, and in 2022 Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that title \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as Chad Mendes and Brian Ortega.RecommendedHow Ciryl Gane\u2019s Jon Jones dream turned into a nightmareJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "64940d1d51ac334f3a315f6f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/qatar-leah-williamson-harry-kane-gianni-infantino-england-b2361648.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Range of armband options for Women\u2019s World Cup as FIFA aims to avoid repeat row", "lead": "The row over \u2018OneLove\u2019 armbands dominated the early stages of the Qatar World Cup.", "author": "Jamie Gardner", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:26:51", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:05.657982", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:26:51+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/14/6c668e654cd4ebac91d201640620dd74Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDM3ODU4-2.71645066.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAustralia\u2019s two-wicket victory over England in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston ranks alongside some of the greatest matches played between cricket\u2019s oldest rivals.Here, the PA news agency highlights some key stats from an incredible game.Culture clashA big part of the allure surrounding this match and the rest of the series relates to the styles of cricket that both teams play, which could hardly be more different.Australia play tough, attritional cricket designed to grind down their opposition, while England have adopted an ultra-aggressive style under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, aimed at generating results \u2013 whether that be a win or a loss.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThis clash of ideologies was on full display in Birmingham.Australia and England scored a near-identical number of runs (668 compared with 666) and lost the same number of wickets (18), but Pat Cummins\u2019 side faced 1,252 deliveries compared with England\u2019s 866.Australia were happy to bide their time, scoring at a rate of 53.35 runs per 100 balls on average, while Stokes\u2019 men looked to force a result by striking at 76.91.The difference in approach was embodied by the teams\u2019 key batters \u2013 England\u2019s reverse-ramping Joe Root faced just 207 balls for his 164 runs across both innings, while Australia\u2019s stoic Usman Khawaja scored his 206 runs from 518 deliveries and became the 13th player in history to bat on all five days of a Test match.Ebb and flowAustralia\u2019s win was especially thrilling because of the way the match seemed to swing back and forth throughout.Just seven runs separated the sides after the first innings, in which England surprisingly declared on 393 for eight and Australia lost their last four wickets for 14 runs to be bowled out for 386.The drama went up a notch in the second innings, however, as both teams repeatedly threatened to get ahead before losing a wicket.Eighteen of the 19 second-innings\u2019 partnerships reached double figures but only four passed 50, with the highest being Australia\u2019s opening stand of 61 between Khawaja and David Warner.Similarly, 19 of the 21 batters scored 10 or more runs, with only Zak Crawley (seven) and Steve Smith (six) falling in single digits.RedemptionAustralia captain Cummins and spin bowler Nathan Lyon were key figures in the thrilling Edgbaston victory, having also played a central role in a heartbreaking defeat at Headingley in 2019.Cummins conceded the winning runs four years ago as Stokes led England to an unlikely win, while Lyon missed a crucial run-out chance in the penultimate over.This time, the pair inspired their side to victory with an unbroken partnership of 55 from a perilous position of 227 for eight when Alex Carey \u2013 the last recognised batter \u2013 was dismissed.RecommendedArsenal pull new home shirt while \u2018design error\u2019 is rectified by AdidasHarry Maguire retrial at Greek court to be held in FebruaryArsenal edge closer to Kai Havertz deal and gear up for third Declan Rice bidCummins and Lyon had already performed heroics with the ball to limit Australia\u2019s target to 281.They took a combined eight wickets for 143 runs from 42.2 overs in England\u2019s second innings, compared with two for 121 from 24 overs by Australia\u2019s remaining bowlers \u2013 Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Cameron Green."}, {"_id": "64940d1e51ac334f3a315f72", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-adidas-premier-league-b2361612.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arsenal pull new home shirt while \u2018design error\u2019 is rectified by Adidas", "lead": "The shirt honours Arsenal\u2019s \u2018Invincible\u2019 season, with a thin white stripe down the side detailing the results of the club\u2019s 38 games that term.", "author": "Mark Mann-Bryans", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:26:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:06.835488", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T12:26:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/13/ae34e9f374c69c0fffd38648a9dd45d4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDM1NzEz-2.47910310.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe heavyweight division is a bad pantomime now with Tyson Fury, Oleksandr Usyk, a chorus of fighters, a few promoters and some hefty backers all trying to work out what part of the dancing horse they are. Moving away from the ugly sisters, there is every chance that the gap between the last championship fight and the next will be the longest in over 50 years. This break is not common, ignore people telling you that. Fury defended his WBC title last December against his old, old friend, Derek Chisora, and Usyk beat Anthony Joshua for the second time last August in Saudi Arabia to retain his IBF, WBA and WBO titles. Fury has no date, just social media plans, and Usyk is due to defend in Poland in late August against Daniel Dubois. It is hard to find a solitary reason for the break and even more difficult to put the blame on just one single person. There are a lot of people on the stage, and they all have a role to play. And to be honest, during the last six months they have all said too much. Sure, greed, rivalries, stupidity, lies and ego are at the very core of the problem, but boxing at the highest level has always had the same flaws, the same fluid obstacles. The standard excuses are there to overcome - that is how boxing works. RecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesWhy has Saudi Arabia become big player in world sport and what does future hold?Fury and Usyk for all the tarnished marbles was meant to have been signed and sealed last September. It was scheduled for April and is now a plan for December. Both boxers have insulted the other, and the theme of their mutual abuse is simple: greed. Obviously, both deny they are the greedy, money-grabbing party in the sad affair. Actually, the righteous outrage from both sides is comedy gold at times. Fury\u2019s father, the unstoppable \u201cGypsy John\u201d Fury, has demanded that Usyk apologise for his criticism. He has warned that if there is no apology, there might be a straightener in a field somewhere, man-to-man. There is honour at stake. It is endless mirth, it really is. Fury (right) beat Derek Chisora in December to stay unbeaten and retain the WBC heavyweight title (Zac Goodwin/PA) (PA Wire)c. Some of boxing\u2019s wisest, richest and smartest brains have been involved in this ongoing lunacy. The men and women in the Fury camp blame Usyk, and the men and women in the Usyk camp blame Fury. The two main players in the Fury business, Bob Arum and Frank Warren, have a combined total of 98 years of promotion; they are both battling this madness. There is, according to some insiders, a one-off offer on the table from the government of Saudi Arabia for Fury and Usyk to fight there at the end of the year. Usyk has signed his deal. This offer is non-negotiable, and we know this because the media flown out to Saudi by the Saudi government have reported it as fact. As a guide to the way boxing works, there are seldom any facts involved when deals are being made, broken and made again. The real insiders are furious that Usyk and Fury, the biggest fight in boxing, is not yet across the line. The sanctioning bodies, who get paid a fee for fights, have promised to get tough with their heavyweight champions, but have not said a word or done a thing; everyone is holding out for a slice of the Saudi cash pie. \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a business,\u2019 they will say, but that little claim is wearing very thin. Usyk (right) last fought in August, outpointing Anthony Joshua for the second fight in a row  (Getty Images)Fury, meanwhile, has mentioned 10 possible opponents in his social media rants in the last few weeks, including a plan to fight two UFC icons in one night. Usyk and Dubois went to purse bids, which is one of boxing\u2019s ancient rituals, and Usyk\u2019s team won. The fight is scheduled for August. Looking in from the side of the crowded stage is Joshua. His fight with Fury was announced by Fury on 10 June, 2020; it would have been a fight for the ages, for all the belts and all the bragging rights. It never happened and it has come close a couple of times since then. Joshua, meanwhile, will fight in August and it might be Dillian Whyte. There is a rumour that Whyte wants too much for the fight; the flip side of that rumour is that Whyte was offered too little. In America, Deontay Wilder, twice beaten in classics by Fury, has not fought since last October. There is a plan, under the Saudi deal, for Wilder to fight Joshua in Saudi Arabia on the same night as Usyk and Fury fight. There is, so the paid publicists insist, a total purse of $400million on the table for the four boxers to split. It must be a strong table.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cOne month before the fight, we were so happy; it was a dream,\u201d Ciryl Gane reminisces. Then comes a laugh. \u201cOne minute after the fight, it was a nightmare.\u201dIt is easy to forget, but the hype around Gane\u2019s title fight with Jon Jones in March was not based on the latter\u2019s long-awaited return alone. There was genuine anticipation for what could have been an intriguing contest between a light-heavyweight great, in Jones, and a heavyweight contender who moves like a welterweight, in Gane. Once the fight started, however, that intrigue was extinguished within moments. Gane, failing to do himself justice \u2013 as he would tell you \u2013 was taken down early and submitted as the clock ticked past the two-minute mark. \u201cMy coach told me every day, every time, every training [session]: \u2018Don\u2019t throw the backhand,\u2019\u201d Gane tells The Independent. \u201c\u2018If you want, [throw] the jab \u2013 maybe the uppercut \u2013 but not the backhand.\u2019 I threw the backhand, he caught me.\u201dRecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett live stream: How to watch UFC Fight Night online and on TV this weekendIndeed, Jones dipped his head off the centre line as Gane overcommitted to a left cross, then engulfed the 33-year-old, hauling him to the canvas \u2013 weighing down on Gane with every ounce of his new, 248lbs heavyweight frame. Once Gane had been forced to the fence, there was no escape. Jones locked in a guillotine choke, and before the fans in Las Vegas had time to comprehend what had happened, the American had forced his opponent to tap. The vacant heavyweight title was vacant no longer.To many onlookers, Jones\u2019s status as the greatest ever was confirmed within those 124 seconds. And what of Gane, the former interim champion who was sitting with his back against the cage, staring up at his victorious opponent, and coming to terms with a second loss in an undisputed-title fight? The Frenchman was, suddenly, no longer an example of the \u2018modern\u2019 heavyweight, and instead a kickboxer with a gaping hole in his game\u00a0\u2013 a gap that Jones had exploited mercilessly.Ciryl Gane reveals key coaching tip that he ignored in Jon Jones loss\u201cI was confident in this position [on the mat],\u201d Gane insists, \u201cbut I did [something] wrong. When we went back to the gym after the fight, we did only wrestling and grappling, every day. I was already confident, but I know it\u2019s really normal to be more confident and have better reflexes when you do something every day. This is gonna help me for sure.\u201dTechnical faults can be addressed, of course, but fighters sometimes suffer from intangible issues in bouts of this magnitude \u2013 in moments of this magnitude \u2013 that can define results and careers, and that are less easily expelled. \u201cIt was really difficult to explain,\u201d Gane says. \u201cPeople asked me if I felt a lot of pressure during the fight, during the press conference, the waiting... Did you see me afraid? No, I was really happy to be there! I wanted to fight against the GOAT and prove that I\u2019m a good fighter. In the cage, in front of the opponent, everybody saw me really confident. But when we started, and during the fight, something switched \u2013 I don\u2019t know exactly why. I couldn\u2019t manage the distance, I was not there. I think when you have a bad feeling, it\u2019s harder to be good technically.Jones controls Gane before submitting the Frenchman to win the vacant UFC heavyweight title  (Getty Images)\u201cI was not \u2018here\u2019,\u201d Gane stresses again. \u201cIt was not me, it just was not me \u2013 everybody knows that. That\u2019s why today, when everybody asks me if I want revenge: Yes, I want revenge, just because I want to prove that I\u2019m better than that and can put Jon Jones through more adversity.\u201dIt is unclear whether Jones will still be around by the time Gane earns a prospective third shot at the UFC heavyweight title. The American, 35, was absent from the Octagon for three years before returning to fight Gane, and his plan to face heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Stipe Miocic before the end of the year looks fragile. Jones has also continually exchanged verbal barbs with Francis Ngannou \u2013 his predecessor as UFC heavyweight champion, and a former teammate and opponent of Gane.Prior to his loss to Jones, Gane knocked out Tai Tuivasa in Paris last September  (AFP via Getty Images)But while Jones\u2019s next step is ambiguous, Gane\u2019s is clear. The Frenchman, a year on from headlining the UFC\u2019s first-ever French card, will once again fight in a main event in Paris this September. Sergey Spivak, the Moldovan heavyweight with three stoppage wins in his last three fights, will be the tormented tourist at the Accor Arena.\u201cThis is my mindset: Every time people ask who I want to fight next, it doesn\u2019t matter who,\u201d Gane says. \u201cI just want to fight, do my job, my mission. I\u2019m a competitor, so any opponent you put in front of me is going to be my mission. Spivak is well rounded \u2013 good ground game, good wrestler \u2013 so yes, it\u2019s gonna be a test.

I liked Relief Rally\u2019s wins at Windsor and Salisbury \u2013 and she can outrun her odds. I was also really impressed with Princess Chizara when she won at Bath last time out. Visually, she looks brilliant and she\u2019s overpriced after bolting up in a really good time.15:05 \u2013 CRYSTAL CAPRICECrystal Caprice, Tamarama and Indian Wish are all drawn really high and I can feel a tricast coming on! Farhh To Shy could also be thrown in too. I can\u2019t decide so take your pick!15:40 \u2013 JUMBLY (NAP)I was at the Curragh on the weekend that Jumbly ran and she tried to come way off the pace. Jumbly did well to even deliver a challenge and she will have improved. I\u2019m with her to go one better.16:20 \u2013 LUXEMBOURGI watched Luxembourg make his seasonal reappearance and I thought he was finished, however, he bounced back and was unrecognisable when winning the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh last month. He looked a different horse and while he got a good ride, he was brilliant. He can improve from that win and land the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes.17:00 \u2013 INTELLOGENTI\u2019ve got five that I fancy: Perotto,Intellogent, Atrium, Bless Him and Sonny Liston. In terms of picking the winner, I\u2019m keen on Intellogent with James Doyle on board for Jane Chapple-Hyam. He ran a blinder last year and he was eye-catching on his last start at Newbury.17:35 \u2013 PEKING OPERAI\u2019m with Peking Opera for Ryan Moore and Aidan O\u2019Brien. It looks like he\u2019s done just enough to win on his last two starts but he won with plenty in hand at Navan last time out. I don\u2019t like Gregory as the favourite so I\u2019m on Peking Opera instead.18:10 \u2013 BARNWELL BOYI like the favourite Barnwell Boy.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTeam GB\u2019s first male artistic swimmer is thoroughly satisfied to have earned the respect of friends who once asked why he did not just play football like everyone else.Ranjuo Tomblin is one of 12 British artistic swimmers hoping to top the podium at the European Games this week in Krakow, but the 17-year-old knows he will be making history no matter what the result.When he and Beatrice Crass slip into the pool for Thursday\u2019s mixed duet technical event, Tomblin will also be making his milestone senior debut with Team GB.\u201cDefinitely my friends at the start were like, \u2018Oh, why are you doing that? Why aren\u2019t you doing football, you know, the generic sports?'\u201d he said.\u201cBut as I\u2019ve grown and developed and I\u2019ve got a few medals in the bank, they definitely more respect what I do, now they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a really cool thing you do\u2019.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveTomblin\u2019s ambitions to erase stigma and stereotype around his chosen sport, once known as synchronised swimming, extend well beyond his circle of friends.Artistic swimming is, like a duck gliding smoothly across a lake, an illusion of effortlessness when in reality it is anything but. Asked about the biggest misconception people hold, Tomblin\u2019s answer comes immediately.\u201cThat it is easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. A lot of people just think it\u2019s having a play about in the water. It\u2019s really not.\u201dTraining comprises working on everything from strength and conditioning to flexibility, knee extensions, toe points, breath-holding, swimming, stamina and timing.Consider the feeling of, as American synchro coach Joyce Lindeman once put it, \u201crunning a marathon while holding your breath\u201d.Also it is set to music, and you are judged on how good you look doing it.Tomblin spent nearly a decade in gymnastics and it was only by fluke that the woman coaching his \u201cnormal\u201d swimming lessons at Atlantis Flamingos also happened to be the synchro coach.Hearing about his gymnastics background, she asked if he wanted to give artistic swimming a go.\u201cI immediately loved it. It\u2019s really grown from there,\u201d said Tomblin, though he admits there was an adjustment period, adding: \u201cIt definitely did feel a bit weird, especially with the first team I joined.\u201cThere were no boys, it was full of girls and it was a bit awkward and it was hard to make friends, but I feel like after I joined the national squad everyone\u2019s really lovely. We\u2019re all good friends.\u201dA landmark December 2022 World Aquatics decision paved the way for male artistic swimmers to compete at next summer\u2019s Paris Olympics, which will now allow up to two men in the eight-athlete team event.Tomblin won silver at the inaugural male free solo event at the 2022 LEN European Junior Championships as well as bronze alongside Cass and, while he is certainly open to the possibility of the team event, mixed duet \u2013 appearing for the first time at a European Games \u2013 is Tomblin\u2019s speciality.Mixed duet is not on the programme for Paris, but December\u2019s announcement allowed Tomblin to be cautiously optimistic that his event could feature at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\u201cWhen I first heard that, I felt really excited and hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh there\u2019s loads of boys so let\u2019s let them in the Olympics\u2019\u2026 then hopefully that will lead towards the mixed duet going into the Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nI'd like to inspire someone.Ranjuo TomblinRecommendedWhat do England need to do to win the Ashes?England and Australia fined and deducted two WTC points for slow over-ratesOn this day in 2015: Jordan Spieth wins US Open to claim second straight majorWhile records will fall and champions change, there can only ever be one person who does something first, and Tomblin is delighted by the role he could play in ensuring he will not be the last.\u201cIt would mean so much to me,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m working so hard because I\u2019ve seen males older than me, like (Team USA\u2019s) Bill May.

It\u2019s the place where he rode his \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d winners in one day at odds of 25,095-1. A feat that cost the betting industry an estimated \u00a340m and earned Dettori a statue at Ascot to mark the achievement.He is a jockey like no other, propelled to stardom off the back of those seven winners, he remained in the limelight due his personality, charisma, and knack for winning big races. Ask anyone on the street to name a horseracing jockey and the response you\u2019ll get more than most is: \u2018Frankie Dettori.\u2019Outside racing circles, Dettori is the name and face of horse racing. His persona transcended the sport and reached a wider audience. The type of people who tune in each year for Cheltenham or the Grand National but show no interest outside the bigger events all know who Frankie Dettori is.A racegoer takes a phone call near the Frankie Dettori statue at Ascot Racecourse (PA)They\u2019ll have a vague picture or memory of the little jockey leaping off his horse, arms stretched wide with a cheeky grin on his face, celebrating yet another triumph.His flying dismount is an iconic image, created by a horseracing superstar. Dettori has been racing in Britain since the 1980s. He started as an apprentice jockey earning a first win in at\u00a0Goodwood\u00a0on 9th June 1987. At 19, Dettori became the first teenager since Lester Piggott to win more than 100 races in a season and finished fourth in the Champion Jockey table.He partnered with\u00a0Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s\u00a0newly-founded\u00a0Godolphin Racing\u00a0in 1994, earning the first of his Champion Jockey titles that same year and followed up with two more wins in 1995 and 2004.He spent 18 years and earned many successes allied with Godolphin \u2013 including the previously mentioned seven winners in a day at Ascot in 1996 \u2013 but they parted ways in 2012 just months before Dettori was suspended for failing a drug test.He admitted to using cocaine stating: \"Things were going bad, I was depressed and I guess a moment of weakness and I fell for it and I\u2019ve only got myself to blame\".King Charles III, Queen Camilla and John Warren speak with Frankie Dettori (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)Over such a long career there are bound to be failures and mistakes like this but greatness is measured by how a person responds.Dettori served his time away from the sport - six months in total - and came back in style, riding Asian Trader to victory at Sandown just one week into his return.The latter end of his career saw him pair up with trainer John Gosden and brought him more success. Atop Stadivarius, Dettori won three consecutive Ascot Gold Cups between 2018-2020, though jockey and horse were beaten by a length into third place in the 2022 Gold Cup race.Three Champion Jockey triumphs and 286 Group 1 winners, including 23 winners in the British Classics, brings Dettori up to date and facing his final rides at Royal Ascot this week. The Italian will have to overcome a frustrating opening day after being given a nine-day careless riding ban by the stewards.There is still time for Dettori to land a 78th winner at this meeting but perhaps a different prize will take precedent.He\u2019ll drink in the adulation and the applause. He\u2019ll make sure to remember the feel of the turf as the horses thunder across it, he\u2019ll note the noise of the crowds as they cheer and the tingly sensation that shoots through the body as the thrill of racing to finish line kicks in.His last races here will truly make this week a special one for the Italian.RecommendedProtester removed from Epsom Derby track following arrestsLGBT+ sports fans call for more inclusivity as Derby Day to host drag showTrain strikes announced on day of FA Cup final and Epsom DerbyWhether he wins or not, the watching crowds at Royal Ascot will celebrate a man who has brought smiles, tears, and joy to this most thrilling of sports.They\u2019ll back him, as they have many times before, and maybe, just maybe, their reward will be that Frankie Dettori\u2019s final performance at Royal Ascot is his greatest one yet."}, {"_id": "64940d2851ac334f3a315f83", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/glastonbury-festival-live-weather-lineup-b2362085.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glastonbury 2023 \u2013 live: Festival kicks off at Worthy Farm with spectacular fireworks display", "lead": "<p>Immigration enforcement officers told festival-goer they are monitoring crowds for \u2018adverse reactions\u2019 </p>", "author": "Roisin O'Connor,Peony Hirwani and Tom Murray", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 08:31:51", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:16.050139", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T08:31:51+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/22/08/2023-06-21T222414Z_1455075555_RC2YN1ACBLBH_RTRMADP_3_MUSIC-GLASTONBURY.JPG?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseDownpour drenches Glastonbury revellers on opening day of festival\nSign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

His was an original sound: cheeky, conversational lyrics about everything from love to social justice, delivered with astute, contemplative flair over pulsing rhythms.Armed with charisma and imagination, not to mention a formidable stage presence that puts him in a league of his own, Tippa has been hailed by music legends including Yellowman and Peter Metro. In reggae scenes around the world, he is revered as a pioneer.Throughout his illustrious career, Tippa has collaborated with a number of global artists. You might have heard him on \u201cHey Mama\u201d by US group the Black Eyed Peas in 2004, for which he earned a Grammy nomination. Maybe you\u2019ve heard his collaborations with Jurassic 5, soul icon Alexander O\u2019Neal, the Far East Band and Congo Natty, aka Rebel MC.It\u2019s not surprising, then, that the 58-year-old is inundated by fans as he sits down for an interview in Brixton, the south-London district that welcomed his Jamaican parents after they migrated to England in the Sixties. \u201cTippa, I just have to shake your hand.

At its peak, this collective was The Beatles of UK dancehall. Tippa enjoyed an explosion in success during the Eighties, as he and his Saxon peers were courted by labels including Island Records, Greensleeves, and Virgin Records.After signing a recording contract with Greensleeves in 1984, Tippa released a string of hits including \u201cGood To Have That Feeling\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re The Best\u201d, \u201cComplain Neighbour\u201d and \u201cHello Darling\u201d, which hit No 1 on the UK reggae chart and crossed over to Number 22 on the UK Top 40 Chart.He has gone on to tour across all seven continents around the world and in between, captivating crowds and releasing numerous tracks over the years including more recent offerings\u201cI\u2019m An African\u201d, \u201cFlat Foot Hustle\u201d and \u201cHot Like Fire\u201d.Yet, for all his success, Tippa comes across as unassuming and laid back, as we chat over chicken wings, fried plantain and orange juice in a Jamaican restaurant on \u201cthe ends\u201d.

Tippa started his musical career as a teenager on his father\u2019s sound system, Musical Messiah in the 1970s.The senior Mr Henry ran a greengrocers shop on Brixton\u2019s Coldharbour Lane by day and hosted shubeen parties by night. Meanwhile, Tippa\u2019s older sister Jacqui would perform at gigs at legendary jazz venue Ronnie Scotts, as a member of the band Metropolis, while his late younger sister Avril, who went by the name \u201cMiss Irie\u201d, was also an MC who regularly performed with her older brother. She died in 1999.Tippa\u2019s own music career was sparked by rave reviews from his schoolmates after he performed chatting lyrics in a school assembly when he was 15. Word of the sleepy-eyed teen\u2019s talent spread, and he began to enter competitions around Brixton. Many of the local sound systems in the area also recognised his talent and invited him to perform on their platform. The rest, as they say, is history. (Tippa Irie (3))Not everyone immediately envisioned the heights to which Tippa\u2019s talent would propel him. After his father retired to Jamaica in 1981, when his son was 16, he was amazed to see Tippa performing onstage in the six years later atReggae Sunsplash, a leading festival or \u2018stage show\u2019 in the country at the time.\u201cMy mum was always supportive of my career,\u201d Tippa says. \u201cShe\u2019d ask, \u2018Why are you always sitting down writing lyrics?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Mum, you will see.\u2019 When \u2018Hello Darling\u2019 came out, then mum saw me on Top of The Pops. She said, \u2018I get it now.\u2019\u201dFollowing the success of \u201cHello Darling\u201d, Tippa bought his mother a house. \u201cI was always confident that I\u2019d make it in the business,\u201d he says. \u201cI believed in myself.\u201dLongevityThe pioneering Windrush migrants brought with them an effervescent energy and the unique sounds of the Caribbean. This didn\u2019t just influence the UK music scene... it transformed it altogether. New arrivals like Tippa\u2019s parents carried with them Jamaica\u2019s sound system culture and a fusion of musical influences that eventually birthed quintessential Black British genres, from UK lovers rock to homegrown iterations of Jamaican dancehall. Newer genres such as grime music would follow decades later.Faced with chronic discrimination, alienation from wider British society and a lack of access to broadcast platforms, the Windrush migrants and their children had the fortitude to develop a sense of community and preserve their culture through music.And, for those who were present to witness Black Britain in the Seventies and Eighties, it seemed that a reggae industry was beginning to thrive through the production of music, formation of labels, launching of record shops, importing of records from Jamaica and staging of events for Black Britons by Black Britons.In 2023, such an industry does not exist. Few venues consistently host Black events, and even fewer are Black-owned; reggae and dancehall music is marginalised in mainstream spaces. Many of the great artists of yesteryear, who came up with Tippa, have long been forced to either give up music or perform on evenings and weekends, alongside their 9-5 jobs. Where many of them should be millionaires and household names, few outside of Black communities know who they are. So what happened?\u201cRacism,\u201d Tippa says, without hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason. As Black British artists of my generation, it\u2019s difficult for us because we\u2019re here and our tunes are not being played on the radio stations that pay money. Even \u201cSilly Games\u201d by Janet Kay or \u201cHopelessly in Love\u201d by Carroll Thompson don\u2019t get played on Smooth or Magic, but you may hear a Bob Marley.\u201d (AFP via Getty Images)He continues: \u201cThe people at the helm of these stations don\u2019t respect our music. You can\u2019t tell me that if they play \u2018Sexual Healing\u2019 by Marvin Gaye, they can\u2019t play a smooth Don Campbell, Lloyd Brown, Peter Hunnigale or Bitty McLean track.\u201cIf we got played on these stations, we\u2019d have more money and power. Evidently, this isn\u2019t what gatekeepers want. Even when there was a reggae industry, the mainstream didn\u2019t support us. Our music is just as good as any other genre\u2026so why isn\u2019t it getting played on the radio?\u201dHe quotes an old saying: \u201cIf you get airplay, you get a lot of say.\u201d\u201cThe reason why a lot of artists are broke is because of this lack of support,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to have a fair playing field, so that listeners can judge for themselves, the kind of music they want to hear.\u201cA lot of time, if you don\u2019t get played on these stations, it\u2019s harder to tour. It\u2019s sad, and depressing that institutional racism \u2013 that\u2019s what it is \u2013 has brought about this situation. The people in England don\u2019t really support their own; this is not our country, really, as Black people. \u201cThen when we go to Jamaica or the US, they\u2019re not paying us no mind there either. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones and I\u2019m grateful because I\u2019m still managed to survive.\u201dFour decades down the line and over a dozen studio albums later, Tippa is still able to live off of music on a full-time basis, collecting publishing cheques, operating a recording studio, voicing dubplates, touring and releasing new music. He also runs his own production company, Lockdown.HomeAs the UK celebrates the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush shop on Britain shores in 1948, many people of Black Caribbean heritage describe the occasion as \u201cbittersweet\u201d, while victims of the Windrush scandal are still waiting for compensation.Tippa agrees.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because there\u2019s so much money being wasted in this country \u2013 the PPE scandal, billions on Brexit \u2013 but the government can\u2019t give some of those billions of pounds to the people that came here to help build it,\u201d he says.\u201cThat\u2019s just another reason why I\u2019d never accept an MBE. I can\u2019t relate to this country when it comes to our people, Black people, because we\u2019re always getting the rough end of the stick because it\u2019s not our country. We\u2019re the minority here and maybe if we had a bit more unity amongst ourselves too, we might be a bit further along.\u201cStill, when it comes to Windrush Day, we have to big up our mums, dads, grandparents; they put up with a lot when they came here, so that we can be here doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\u2018Empire Windrush\u2019 arriving at Tilbury Docks (Getty)The Windrush scandal brought into sharp focus a dilemma that many Black Britons feel: where to truly regard as \u2018home\u2019. Is it the land in which you were born, and can evidently be expelled from under certain circumstances, or the land of your parents\u2019 birth?\u201cUs Black Brits, because we\u2019re not accepted in England and then when we go to our parents\u2019 birth countries, we are still regarded as foreigners,\u201d Tippa summarises.\u201cI really love Jamaica. I love the food, the tropics, the weather...but as much as it is like home, it\u2019s still not because I am not from there. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d (Tippa Irie)Tippa describes his new biography, Stick To My Roots, out in August, as a \u201chistory lesson\u201d that breaks down his life and times to date in intricate detail, from soaring to the top of the industry to dodging bullets as villains stuck up his performances in gritty, New York-based dances.It\u2019s certainly been quite the journey.\u201cFocusing on my craft, investing in myself and putting my energies into what I do has enabled me to survive in the music industry for 40 years,\u201d the artist says.RecommendedThe 22 greatest Glastonbury performances everThe earthy magic and lawless energy of being a child at GlastonburyN-Dubz interview: \u2018We\u2019re still young\u2026 we look good, we sexy, we here baby!\u2019\u201cI\u2019ve managed to be disciplined when it comes to writing songs, who I work with, how I treat people - you treat people how you want to be treated yourself.

She was later joined by her father, Glastonbury co-founder Michael Eavis. John, who is currently playing the final leg of his much-delayed Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour in Europe, will headline the Pyramid Stage on Worthy Farm on Sunday (25 June). His set, which will stretch over two hours in length, is not only his first time playing the festival, but his final ever UK tour date.Speaking to Sky News, Furnish said John would bring on \u201cfour collaborators of his choosing\u201d.When pressed as to who the artists could be, Furnish said: \u201cSorry.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEric Andr\u00e9 is rolling around on the floor. The comedian and creator-host of\u00a0The Eric Andre Show, Adult Swim\u2019s brilliantly anarchic chat-series-cum-prank-show, dangles a webcam above his face as he speaks to me about the imminent return of the series. \u201cIt\u2019s the most satanic season yet,\u201d he says, before sinking into a fit of giggling. \u201cWe brought the Devil in as a creative consultant. It\u2019s season 666, baby. Season of the beast.\u201dOver the course of five \u2013 soon to be six \u2013 seasons of\u00a0The Eric Andre Show\u00a0(streaming in the UK on All 4), I\u2019ve watched Andr\u00e9 wrong-foot countless celebrities, from Jack Black to Mel B. I\u2019ve watched him draw a swastika on his forehead while interviewing US reality star Lauren Conrad (Andr\u00e9 is Jewish), and nearly get beaten up by\u00a0The Sopranos\u2019 Bobby Baccalieri (Steve Schirripa)\u00a0after holding a microphone to his penis. I\u2019ve watched similarly madcap out-of-character\u00a0appearances, including an episode of\u00a0the YouTube interview series\u00a0Hot Ones\u00a0in which he smashed crockery over his head while belting out\u00a0Tay Zonday\u2019s viral 2007 song\u00a0\u201cChocolate Rain\u201d. I assume, naturally, that these antics are a performance for the cameras, that our conversation will be more of a conventionally down-tempo chat about his life and career. I am wrong.Within moments, our interview has taken on the elastic, free-associative vibe of an acid trip. Andr\u00e9 sings a few bars of \u201cLouie Louie\u201d (my name). \u201cDon\u2019t get shy on me,\u201d he says, a little pre-emptively. \u201cDon\u2019t get all coy on me like a geisha girl. Ask me anything. AMA.\u201d\u00a0He is almost completely horizontal, holding himself at a visibly uncomfortable slant for either my or his own amusement \u2013 I can\u2019t quite tell which. I try to ask a question and am twice interrupted as he cries out, \u201cBooyakasha\u201d. Andr\u00e9\u2019s mischievous schoolboy temperament belies the fact he turned 40 last month. \u201cForty is the new 50, brother,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I turn 69.\u201dFans of Andr\u00e9 and his cult series will know what to expect from the new season of\u00a0The Eric Andre Show. Manic sight gags.\u00a0Meme-ready celebrity interactions. Pranks that push the boundaries of what you can show on TV. And, underneath it all, deceptively incisive pop-culture satire. Previous seasons featured\u00a0Broad City\u2019s Hannibal Burress as Andr\u00e9\u2019s sidekick; he left midway through season five and was replaced by Mexican comic Felipe Esparza. This time around, interviewees include actors Natasha Lyonne and Jon Hamm, and rappers Lil Yachty and Lil Nas X. \u201cI think that the show has some cultural cachet [with hip-hop stars],\u201d Andr\u00e9 admits. \u201cIt\u2019s the only show like it. I suppose rappers are of my generation and younger and grew up on the same influences as me, so they\u2019re excited to do something so crazy.\u201dAlso on the guest roster this season \u2013 though Andr\u00e9 may already regret it \u2013 is Chet Hanks, the, shall we say, somewhat notorious third son of Tom Hanks.\u00a0The actor and rapper has previously drawn criticism for cultural appropriation, anti-vaccine rants and allegations of domestic abuse, which he has denied.\u00a0After filming finished, Andr\u00e9 and the younger Hanks exchanged pointed words on social media, with Andr\u00e9 claiming that the \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d actor engaged in \u201cdangerous\u201d behaviour on set, spontaneously riding a dirt bike around the studio. Hanks shared an Instagram post calling Andr\u00e9 \u201ca p***y\u201d, claiming that he had been trying to \u201cmatch the energy\u201d of the show. Was this some confected beef to promote the new season? Not in the slightest. \u201cTell him to say that s*** to my f***ing face,\u201d Andr\u00e9 says, emphatically. He remarks on the stark reputational divide between Hanks and his Oscar-winning father. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019s Tom Hanks\u2019s son,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI want him to f***ing come down here and show us his birth certificate.\u201dRecommendedAlice Lowe: \u2018Cambridge was so many posh boys putting me down \u2013 I carried that with me for quite a long time\u2019Andrew Barth Feldman spent a whole summer being (badly) seduced by Jennifer LawrenceAnd Just Like That season two review: A toothless imitation of Sex and the CityAndr\u00e9 is now supine on the floor,\u00a0looking up at the phone he is holding above his head.\u00a0\u201cWere you named after\u00a0Louis XV?\u201d he asks. \u201cI thought you were named after Louis CK.\u201d I\u2019m beginning to get a vague sense of what it must be like to be a guest on\u00a0The Eric Andre Show, to be probed by a barrage of nonsense and provocation. \u201cYou\u2019re my little cupid,\u201d he coos, \u201cand I want you to shoot your arrow to my heart.\u201d On his series \u2013 whether it\u2019s the in-studio interviews or the \u201cman on the street\u201d-style pranks \u2013 Andr\u00e9 seems an unflappable presence, impossible to throw off his eccentric comic rhythm. He insists this isn\u2019t the case. \u201cMost things faze me,\u201d Andr\u00e9 claims. \u201cIt\u2019s actually surprising how easy I am to prank. I\u2019m very sensitive.\u201d He belches.A typically chaotic scene from season six of \u2018The Eric Andre Show' (Tyler Golden/Sony Pictures Television)Those unfamiliar with his Adult Swim series may know Andr\u00e9 from his tabloid-catnip romance with supermodel Emily Ratajkowski. Or\u00a0for\u00a0his recent stint in the Jackass troupe. Or\u00a0for\u00a0his voice acting work, which began with a main role in Matt Groening\u2019s Netflix animation\u00a0Disenchantment\u00a0(playing, fittingly, an impish demon), before he moved on to mainstream family films:\u00a0The Lion King\u00a0(2019);\u00a0Sing 2\u00a0(2021);\u00a0Trolls Band Together\u00a0(forthcoming). Andr\u00e9 is a distinctly \u201cadult\u201d entertainer who is outspoken about sex and drug use, with a proclivity for posting full-frontal photos of himself online. I\u2019m surprised that a company as traditionally censorious as Disney wouldn\u2019t baulk at the association with him. Andr\u00e9 isn\u2019t. \u201cRichard Pryor did\u00a0Sesame Street,\u201d he says. \u201cEddie Murphy did\u00a0The Klumps\u00a0and\u00a0Shrek. Chris Rock does\u00a0Madagascar. You know, we\u2019ve all done it.\u201dTalking of sex: Andr\u00e9 has previously suggested he was bi- or pansexual, telling the\u00a0LGBT+\u00a0website\u00a0Towleroad\u00a0in 2016 that \u201csexual orientation, race, and gender\u201d were \u201cobsolete man-made concepts\u201d. I ask if he still feels this way today \u2013 is there a label he likes to use for himself? \u201cA hole is a hole, man,\u201d he replies. \u201cWe all feel like hot spaghetti in the dark, you know?\u201dHe goes on: \u201cYou know, the Abrahamic religions created homophobia. Before that, everybody was just sucking and f***ing. I think that\u2019s\u00a0why\u00a0the Abrahamic religions created homophobia. They were like, \u2018Hey, Greg, I know it\u2019s fun to f*** your friend Ralph, but we gotta get our numbers up.

It was so stressfulEric Andr\u00e9As well as the returning\u00a0Eric Andre Show, Andr\u00e9 recently fronted the prank-based reality series\u00a0The Prank Panel\u00a0with\u00a0Jackass\u2019s Johnny Knoxville and\u00a0Precious\u00a0actor Gabourey Sidibe, in which contestants pitch elaborate practical jokes to the stars, the best of which are then staged. Over the course of filming, behind-the-scenes mischief between Andr\u00e9 and his co-stars escalated; before long, everybody was showing up to set armed with\u00a0Tasers, stun guns and pepper spray. \u201cWe all had weapons on us towards the end,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was so stressful.\u201d How on earth did this get the green light from the show\u2019s health and safety department? Andr\u00e9 bursts out laughing. \u201cIt didn\u2019t. It was illegal.\u201dBy this point, he has seemingly calmed down a bit. I take the opportunity to bring up\u00a0The Eric Andre Show\u2019s demographics: the audience skews heavily male, around 90 per cent so. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not by design,\u201d Andr\u00e9 says. \u201cIt was a little bit of a bummer when I got that information. There\u2019s been a lot of research done around this and historically [US network] Adult Swim has struggled with that in general. But my show\u2026 it\u2019s non-narrative. It\u2019s non-linear. There\u2019s no emotional investment. And it\u2019s just two dudes hosting. So that\u2019s a big hindrance for the ladies. It\u2019s also gross. It\u2019s loud. It\u2019s violent.\u201dEach episode of \u2018The Eric Andre Show\u2019 begins with its host demolishing the set (Adult Swim/Sony)Andr\u00e9 points to his 2021 Netflix film\u00a0Bad Trip\u00a0\u2013 which hit upon a similar vein of hidden camera malarkey but situated it within a fictionalised road narrative \u2013 as a counterpoint. \u201cBad Trip\u00a0was gross and violent too, but it had [Girl\u2019s Trip\u2019s] Tiffany Haddish, and [Bones\u00a0star] Michaela Conlin, and it did way, way better with women, ratings-wise. So I think if I could do [The Eric Andre Show] all over again, I\u2019d at least have more female cast members.\u201dIt is true, of course, that Andr\u00e9\u2019s oeuvre is loud and gross \u2013 not to mention often quite crass. He doesn\u2019t seem beholden to good taste any more than he seems beholden to wearing clothes on camera, or sitting upright in a chair. \u201cI think there\u2019s \u2018good\u2019 bad taste and there\u2019s \u2018bad\u2019 bad taste,\u201d he says, \u201cand that line is in the eye of the beholder, and constantly changing. To apply one year\u2019s line to another year is impossible.\u201dA PR interjects to say we are out of time.\u00a0Andr\u00e9 holds the camera even closer to his face; more or less my entire screen is taken up by his mouth. I am conscious of the fact that I don\u2019t understand the mind of Eric Andr\u00e9 any more than I did when we started. I see only his disembodied lips.

The live special will air at 7pm \u2013 just hours after the Titan submersible is due to run out of oxygen \u2013 and is presented by former Football Focus host Dan Walker.The submersible had a 96-hour oxygen supply when it left its surface ship around 900 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Sunday morning (18 June), meaning it is due to run out around 10am (BST) on Thursday (22 June).

Kanye West \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015Lee Nelson invades the stage as Kanye West performs (Rex)As far as classic Glastonbury talking points go, nothing since Michael Jackson died has come close to Kanye\u2019s 2015 slot. For all his claims to be \u201cthe biggest rock star on the planet\u201d, nerves got the better of what was arguably Kanye\u2019s highest-profile show ever. His attempt to echo Jay-Z\u2019s rock-embracing \u201cWonderwall\u201d from 2008 fell flat when he forgot the words to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d, and he had to restart \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d\u2019 after comedian Lee Nelson invaded the stage pretending to be a surprise guest rapper. Nonetheless (look away now, Noel), some class this as another key victory in hip-hop\u2019s Glastonbury takeover.20. Primal Scream \u2013 NME Stage, 1992The volume, according to some onlookers, was like listening to a car stereo playing \u201dMovin\u2019 On Up\u201d underwater three miles away. Yet Primal Scream bringing Screamadelica to the NME Stage in 1992 was more of a collective celebration of music\u2019s most double-visioned zeitgeist. Generation \u201cLoaded\u201d came together as one, and rock and dance cultures mated furiously in the bushes at this peak of the ecstasy rave explosion.19. T Rex \u2013 Main Stage, 1970\u201cDon\u2019t touch my car!\u201d Marc Bolan barked at Michael Eavis when the burgeoning festival don \u2013 en route to Minehead Butlin\u2019s to replace The Kinks at what was then essentially a farmer\u2019s party taking place on a stage held together with string \u2013 tried brushing leaves off his Cadillac. Yet Bolan\u2019s T Rex stormed the inaugural Glastonbury (or the Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues Festival as it was known \u2013 \u00a31 per ticket and all the milk you could drink). \u201cBolan played on and on and on as the sun was going down,\u201d Eavis recalled, \u201call the hits, the full works, and it sounded fantastic.\u201d18. Kylie Minogue \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Kylie performs All The Lovers at GlastonburyIn 2005, Kylie was forced to pull out of her Pyramid Stage headline slot due to her cancer diagnosis, a wrench for fans and artist alike despite Coldplay\u2019s spectacular replacement set. The Eavises, however, couldn\u2019t get her out of their heads. When she finally honoured the booking 14 years later, for 2019\u2019s Legends slot, she pulled out all the stops, putting on a headline-worthy show rammed with her biggest hits. There were celebrity guests, too, including Chris Martin on \u201cCan\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\u201d and Nick Cave for \u201cWhere the Wild Roses Grow\u201d. Dolly-beating stuff.17. Portishead \u2013 Acoustic Tent, 1995As many a troubadour will attest, it\u2019s rare to find a crush of 15,000 people stuck outside the Acoustic Tent. But the arrival of local (ish) heroes Portishead bearing the sumptuous jazz lounge trip-hop of their hugely acclaimed debut album Dummy prompted just such polite chaos. The lucky few inside reported a bewitching set of very modern heartache \u2013 \u201cGlory Box\u201d and \u201cSour Times\u201d capping a show of immense grace and emotion. As many tears inside as out.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up16. The Killers \u2013 New Tent, 2004The Killers headlining Glastonbury in 2019 \u2013 15 years after they played the New Tent (REUTERS)The best sign of encroaching superstardom, they say, is when your John Peel Stage debut is as rammed and rambunctious as Theresa May\u2019s leaving drinks. Arguably the first and finest example was the tsunami of fans descending on the New Tent early on the Saturday evening in 2004, to toast the arrival of Las Vegas indie pop showmen The Killers. The crowds stretched far outside the tent but even the ones on the outskirts bawled along to \u201cMr Brightside\u201d and \u201cAll These Things That I\u2019ve Done\u201d. It was such a \u201cmoment\u201d that the band returned to the stage (now the John Peel Stage) for a secret encore in 2017.15. Orbital \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Dance music had long since conquered clubland, but its clout as a force to unify a vast festival crowd was unrecognised until Orbital took Glasto \u201994 by synthetic storm. Drawing 40,000 ravers to the NME Stage for their headline set with little more than compulsive beats and headlights on their faces, the Hartnoll brothers dazzled not just the millions watching Glastonbury\u2019s first televised broadcasts on Channel 4, but Eavis himself. So much so, in fact, that he was inspired to open a dedicated Dance Tent the following year. It\u2019s since grown into its own festival-within-a-festival in the Silver Hayes dance village.14. New Order \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1981By 1981, Glastonbury had grown from its Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues roots, but not far. It was a CND charity gathering of around 3,000 bikers burning up the site as they waited for Hawkwind to come on. \u201cIt was our version of Altamont but without any trouble,\u201d said New Order\u2019s Peter Hook of their \u201cspirited\u201d support slot, but it was also the moment the band emerged from beneath the lingering clouds of Joy Division and proved themselves the silvery scouts of the new electronic age.13. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2011If Jay could do it, so could Bey. Following her husband\u2019s celebrated 2008 headline slot (and pregnant with their first child at the time), Beyonc\u00e9 delivered Glastonbury\u2019s ultimate pop experience to date. \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\u201d, \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d, glitzy covers of both \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d and \u201cSex On Fire\u2019, billowing ballads sung while kneeling on white grand pianos\u2026 even the bells had whistles on them. All of this was wrapped up with the most bootylicious of Destiny\u2019s Child medleys.12. Stormzy \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Stormzy performs Shut Up at GlastonburyBoasting what was rumoured to be the most expensive Glastonbury set ever staged \u2013 a Banksy stab-vest! Ballet dancers! Chris Martin! \u2013 Stormzy had only released one album, his hit debut Gang Signs & Prayer, when he became the first black British solo artist to ascend to the revered Glastonbury headline slot in 2019. He used it as a battering ram to break the new grime uprising onto the most respected stage in the world. Historic.11. Happy Mondays \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1990By its very nature as a gigantic concave mirror on alternative culture, Glastonbury reflects and exaggerates music\u2019s pivotal moments. Case in point: Happy Mondays roll onto the Pyramid Stage in 1990 \u2013 just as ecstasy is reshaping youth culture into very bendy shapes indeed \u2013 and twist the melon of an entire generation with \u201cStep On\u201d, \u201cWrote For Luck\u201d and \u201cHallelujah\u201d. Where the Second Summer of Love (1988-1989) was an in-the-know affair, this set made it universally hip to be hairy, lairy, baggy and boggle-eyed.10. Jay-Z \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2008Noel Gallagher wasn\u2019t having it, but Glastonbury 2008 certainly was. Gently mocking Noel\u2019s disgust as rap infiltrated rock\u2019s most revered stage, Jay-Z entered with a ramshackle solo rendition of \u201cWonderwall\u201d, then all but smashed his acoustic guitar as he burst into \u201c99 Problems\u201d. There followed a veritable firestorm of hip-hop classics \u2013 \u201cIzzo (H.O.V.A.)\u201d, \u201cGirls, Girls, Girls\u201d, \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d, \u201cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\u201d \u2013 almost as though Jigga was beating the spirit of Glastonbury into submission before forcing it to wear a Brooklyn Nets shirt. The festival\u2019s mind was opened forever, that night.9. Patti Smith \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015Most so-called \u201cheritage\u201d acts go through the motions at Glastonbury \u2013 a stout chunk of their folky new record and, begrudgingly, a smatter of their old hits. Not Patti Smith. She attacked the Pyramid Stage in 2015 like a white-haired tornado. Ripping strings from her guitar by the fistful and hailing \u201cFreedom!\u201d at the top of her voice, she tore through \u201cLand\u201d, \u201cGloria\u201d and The Who\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d like the age-defying punk pioneer she is. She even found time to present the actual Dalai Lama with a birthday cake on stage and fall on her face, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a f***ing animal!\u201d Amen.8. Oasis \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Scenes become seismic events when they prove they can dominate an entire Glastonbury festival. Take Sunday 26 June 1994, when a young, cocksure Liam Gallagher strode onto the NME Stage in a black jumper and shades and demanded of a distinctly mad-ferrit crowd: \u201cAre you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?\u201d Songs rarely came so \u201cproper\u201d as \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol\u201d, \u201cLive Forever\u201d and \u201cFade Away\u201d, which joined \u201cShakermaker\u201d and \u201cSupersonic\u201d in the wider public domain that day \u2013 bombardments from Britpop\u2019s northern armies. The Nineties suddenly had some real fight in them.7. The Cure \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Robert Smith pulled a Bowie in 2019, returning to Glastonbury after a decades-long break \u2013 24 years to be precise \u2013 and levelling the Tor with the hits. As one of Britain\u2019s greatest singles bands cunningly disguised as one of its greatest album bands, The Cure unleashed their formidable melodic side of their canon, from gothic classics (\u201cThe Walk\u201d, \u201cA Forest\u201d) to formative alt-pop greats (\u201cClose to Me\u201d, \u201cIn Between Days\u201d, \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d) and indie dancefloor mainstays (\u201cFriday I\u2019m in Love\u201d, \u201cWhy Can\u2019t I Be You?\u201d, \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d). There was space, too, for more chest-bursting moments such as \u201cPictures of You\u201d, \u201cPlainsong\u201d and \u201cDisintegration\u201d in one of the most brilliantly balanced Glastonbury headline sets of all time.6. Blur \u2013 NME Stage, 1994By the time Pulp and Radiohead had played that same stage, that same day, in a line-up that Johnny Greenwood would describe as \u201dlike the Champions League\u201d, Britpop had officially arrived. To herald this cultural breakout, Blur rolled up in their Parklife charabanc at sundown for a coming-of-age party that saw \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d, \u201cEnd of a Century\u201d and the era-defining title track taken on as generational anthems, at a show as celebratory and momentous as any headline set. It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade.5. Radiohead \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1997Thom Yorke of Radiohead during the band's legendary Glastonbury performance in 1997 (Rex)Radiohead\u2019s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle \u2013 against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. \u201cEverything broke onstage,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt turned into the worst night of our lives. I don\u2019t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.\u201d But it\u2019s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. \u201cLucky\u201d rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead\u2019s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia \u2013 \u201cNo Surprises\u201d, \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cAirbag\u201d \u2013 made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling.4. The Smiths \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1984\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 \u2013 shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn\u2019t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as \u201cHand in Glove\u201d, \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d and \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d. The performance inspired Glastonbury\u2019s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely \u201chippy festival\u201d again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous.RecommendedPaul McCartney review, Glastonbury 2022: It\u2019s a historic privilege just to be alive at the same time as him3. Paul McCartney \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2004 and 2022Sometimes all it takes to slip seamlessly into Glastonbury legend is the greatest songbook known to mankind. Sir Paul\u2019s first-ever UK festival show \u2013 no, really \u2013 was the singalong to end them all: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d into \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cBand On the Run\u201d, \u201cBack In the USSR\u201d, \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d and a \u201cHey Jude\u201d you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. Eighteen years later, Macca bettered himself. Playing close to three hours, he plundered his peerless canon for deeper cuts, did virtually the whole Abbey Road medley, brought out Dave Grohl and Bruce Springsteen for history-making duets and \u2013 in a truly moving moment \u2013 sang with John Lennon\u2019s isolated vocals from \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u201d. Sublime.2. David Bowie \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2000Bowie at Glastonbury in 2000 (PA Archive)Bowie\u2019s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We\u2019d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum\u2019n\u2019bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t exactly expecting \u201cChanges\u201d. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang \u201cChanges\u201d. And \u201cLife On Mars?\u201d And \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d and \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d and \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cStarman\u201d and \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could\u2019ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered.1. Pulp \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1995Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Pulp headlined in 1995.  (Getty)When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement \u2013 they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world\u2019s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of \u201cBabies\u201d, \u201cDisco 2000\u201d and \u201cCommon People\u201d crystallised Britpop\u2019s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes. They even unveiled a new song seemingly penned for the occasion \u2013 \u201cSorted For E\u2019s & Wizz\u201d \u2013 and encapsulated the bewildering, otherworldly spirit of Glastonbury in 20 words: \u201dIs this the way they say the future\u2019s meant to feel?/ Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d And to think, they asked Rod Stewart to fill in first."}, {"_id": "64940d3851ac334f3a315fa6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/glastonbury-best-performances-beyonce-mccartney-b2362051.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The 22 greatest Glastonbury performances ever, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Paul McCartney", "lead": "<p>Ahead of the festival\u2019s return to Worthy Farm,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/author/mark-beaumont\">Mark Beaumont</a> picks some of Glastonbury\u2019s greatest ever music moments</p>", "author": "Mark Beaumont", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 04:45:26", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:32.909323", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T04:45:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/19/glasto-best.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Portishead \u2013 Acoustic Tent, 1995As many a troubadour will attest, it\u2019s rare to find a crush of 15,000 people stuck outside the Acoustic Tent. But the arrival of local (ish) heroes Portishead bearing the sumptuous jazz lounge trip-hop of their hugely acclaimed debut album Dummy prompted just such polite chaos. The lucky few inside reported a bewitching set of very modern heartache \u2013 \u201cGlory Box\u201d and \u201cSour Times\u201d capping a show of immense grace and emotion. As many tears inside as out.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up16. The Killers \u2013 New Tent, 2004The Killers headlining Glastonbury in 2019 \u2013 15 years after they played the New Tent (REUTERS)The best sign of encroaching superstardom, they say, is when your John Peel Stage debut is as rammed and rambunctious as Theresa May\u2019s leaving drinks. Arguably the first and finest example was the tsunami of fans descending on the New Tent early on the Saturday evening in 2004, to toast the arrival of Las Vegas indie pop showmen The Killers. The crowds stretched far outside the tent but even the ones on the outskirts bawled along to \u201cMr Brightside\u201d and \u201cAll These Things That I\u2019ve Done\u201d. It was such a \u201cmoment\u201d that the band returned to the stage (now the John Peel Stage) for a secret encore in 2017.15. Orbital \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Dance music had long since conquered clubland, but its clout as a force to unify a vast festival crowd was unrecognised until Orbital took Glasto \u201994 by synthetic storm. Drawing 40,000 ravers to the NME Stage for their headline set with little more than compulsive beats and headlights on their faces, the Hartnoll brothers dazzled not just the millions watching Glastonbury\u2019s first televised broadcasts on Channel 4, but Eavis himself. So much so, in fact, that he was inspired to open a dedicated Dance Tent the following year. It\u2019s since grown into its own festival-within-a-festival in the Silver Hayes dance village.14. New Order \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1981By 1981, Glastonbury had grown from its Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues roots, but not far. It was a CND charity gathering of around 3,000 bikers burning up the site as they waited for Hawkwind to come on. \u201cIt was our version of Altamont but without any trouble,\u201d said New Order\u2019s Peter Hook of their \u201cspirited\u201d support slot, but it was also the moment the band emerged from beneath the lingering clouds of Joy Division and proved themselves the silvery scouts of the new electronic age.13. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2011If Jay could do it, so could Bey. Following her husband\u2019s celebrated 2008 headline slot (and pregnant with their first child at the time), Beyonc\u00e9 delivered Glastonbury\u2019s ultimate pop experience to date. \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\u201d, \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d, glitzy covers of both \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d and \u201cSex On Fire\u2019, billowing ballads sung while kneeling on white grand pianos\u2026 even the bells had whistles on them. All of this was wrapped up with the most bootylicious of Destiny\u2019s Child medleys.12. Stormzy \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Stormzy performs Shut Up at GlastonburyBoasting what was rumoured to be the most expensive Glastonbury set ever staged \u2013 a Banksy stab-vest! Ballet dancers! Chris Martin! \u2013 Stormzy had only released one album, his hit debut Gang Signs & Prayer, when he became the first black British solo artist to ascend to the revered Glastonbury headline slot in 2019. He used it as a battering ram to break the new grime uprising onto the most respected stage in the world. Historic.11. Happy Mondays \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1990By its very nature as a gigantic concave mirror on alternative culture, Glastonbury reflects and exaggerates music\u2019s pivotal moments. Case in point: Happy Mondays roll onto the Pyramid Stage in 1990 \u2013 just as ecstasy is reshaping youth culture into very bendy shapes indeed \u2013 and twist the melon of an entire generation with \u201cStep On\u201d, \u201cWrote For Luck\u201d and \u201cHallelujah\u201d. Where the Second Summer of Love (1988-1989) was an in-the-know affair, this set made it universally hip to be hairy, lairy, baggy and boggle-eyed.10. Jay-Z \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2008Noel Gallagher wasn\u2019t having it, but Glastonbury 2008 certainly was. Gently mocking Noel\u2019s disgust as rap infiltrated rock\u2019s most revered stage, Jay-Z entered with a ramshackle solo rendition of \u201cWonderwall\u201d, then all but smashed his acoustic guitar as he burst into \u201c99 Problems\u201d. There followed a veritable firestorm of hip-hop classics \u2013 \u201cIzzo (H.O.V.A.)\u201d, \u201cGirls, Girls, Girls\u201d, \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d, \u201cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\u201d \u2013 almost as though Jigga was beating the spirit of Glastonbury into submission before forcing it to wear a Brooklyn Nets shirt. The festival\u2019s mind was opened forever, that night.9. Patti Smith \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015Most so-called \u201cheritage\u201d acts go through the motions at Glastonbury \u2013 a stout chunk of their folky new record and, begrudgingly, a smatter of their old hits. Not Patti Smith. She attacked the Pyramid Stage in 2015 like a white-haired tornado. Ripping strings from her guitar by the fistful and hailing \u201cFreedom!\u201d at the top of her voice, she tore through \u201cLand\u201d, \u201cGloria\u201d and The Who\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d like the age-defying punk pioneer she is. She even found time to present the actual Dalai Lama with a birthday cake on stage and fall on her face, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a f***ing animal!\u201d Amen.8. Oasis \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Scenes become seismic events when they prove they can dominate an entire Glastonbury festival. Take Sunday 26 June 1994, when a young, cocksure Liam Gallagher strode onto the NME Stage in a black jumper and shades and demanded of a distinctly mad-ferrit crowd: \u201cAre you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?\u201d Songs rarely came so \u201cproper\u201d as \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol\u201d, \u201cLive Forever\u201d and \u201cFade Away\u201d, which joined \u201cShakermaker\u201d and \u201cSupersonic\u201d in the wider public domain that day \u2013 bombardments from Britpop\u2019s northern armies. The Nineties suddenly had some real fight in them.7. The Cure \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Robert Smith pulled a Bowie in 2019, returning to Glastonbury after a decades-long break \u2013 24 years to be precise \u2013 and levelling the Tor with the hits. As one of Britain\u2019s greatest singles bands cunningly disguised as one of its greatest album bands, The Cure unleashed their formidable melodic side of their canon, from gothic classics (\u201cThe Walk\u201d, \u201cA Forest\u201d) to formative alt-pop greats (\u201cClose to Me\u201d, \u201cIn Between Days\u201d, \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d) and indie dancefloor mainstays (\u201cFriday I\u2019m in Love\u201d, \u201cWhy Can\u2019t I Be You?\u201d, \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d). There was space, too, for more chest-bursting moments such as \u201cPictures of You\u201d, \u201cPlainsong\u201d and \u201cDisintegration\u201d in one of the most brilliantly balanced Glastonbury headline sets of all time.6. Blur \u2013 NME Stage, 1994By the time Pulp and Radiohead had played that same stage, that same day, in a line-up that Johnny Greenwood would describe as \u201dlike the Champions League\u201d, Britpop had officially arrived. To herald this cultural breakout, Blur rolled up in their Parklife charabanc at sundown for a coming-of-age party that saw \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d, \u201cEnd of a Century\u201d and the era-defining title track taken on as generational anthems, at a show as celebratory and momentous as any headline set. It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade.5. Radiohead \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1997Thom Yorke of Radiohead during the band's legendary Glastonbury performance in 1997 (Rex)Radiohead\u2019s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle \u2013 against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. \u201cEverything broke onstage,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt turned into the worst night of our lives. I don\u2019t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.\u201d But it\u2019s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. \u201cLucky\u201d rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead\u2019s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia \u2013 \u201cNo Surprises\u201d, \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cAirbag\u201d \u2013 made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling.4. The Smiths \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1984\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 \u2013 shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn\u2019t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as \u201cHand in Glove\u201d, \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d and \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d. The performance inspired Glastonbury\u2019s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely \u201chippy festival\u201d again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous.RecommendedPaul McCartney review, Glastonbury 2022: It\u2019s a historic privilege just to be alive at the same time as him3. Paul McCartney \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2004 and 2022Sometimes all it takes to slip seamlessly into Glastonbury legend is the greatest songbook known to mankind. Sir Paul\u2019s first-ever UK festival show \u2013 no, really \u2013 was the singalong to end them all: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d into \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cBand On the Run\u201d, \u201cBack In the USSR\u201d, \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d and a \u201cHey Jude\u201d you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. Eighteen years later, Macca bettered himself. Playing close to three hours, he plundered his peerless canon for deeper cuts, did virtually the whole Abbey Road medley, brought out Dave Grohl and Bruce Springsteen for history-making duets and \u2013 in a truly moving moment \u2013 sang with John Lennon\u2019s isolated vocals from \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u201d. Sublime.2. David Bowie \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2000Bowie at Glastonbury in 2000 (PA Archive)Bowie\u2019s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We\u2019d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum\u2019n\u2019bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t exactly expecting \u201cChanges\u201d. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang \u201cChanges\u201d. And \u201cLife On Mars?\u201d And \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d and \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d and \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cStarman\u201d and \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could\u2019ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered.1. Pulp \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1995Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Pulp headlined in 1995.  (Getty)When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement \u2013 they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world\u2019s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of \u201cBabies\u201d, \u201cDisco 2000\u201d and \u201cCommon People\u201d crystallised Britpop\u2019s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes. They even unveiled a new song seemingly penned for the occasion \u2013 \u201cSorted For E\u2019s & Wizz\u201d \u2013 and encapsulated the bewildering, otherworldly spirit of Glastonbury in 20 words: \u201dIs this the way they say the future\u2019s meant to feel?/ Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d And to think, they asked Rod Stewart to fill in first."}, {"_id": "64940d3951ac334f3a315fa7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/secret-invasion-ai-intro-marvel-b2361973.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Secret Invasion: Marvel faces backlash from artists and fans over AI-generated opening sequence", "lead": "<p>Show\u2019s executive producer argued that the use of AI fitted into the show\u2019s themes </p>", "author": "Tom Murray", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 04:42:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:33.173796", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T04:42:36+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Who did this? Who is this?\u201dAdmitting that he didn\u2019t \u201creally understand\u201d how AI works, Selim further explained: \u201cWe would talk to them about ideas and themes and words, and then the computer would go off and do something.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMarvel is facing backlash from artists and fans alike over the opening credits scene to its new Disney+ series, Secret Invasion.The series follows Samuel L Jackson\u2019s Avengers founder Nick Fury and his allies as they attempt to thwart an invasion of extraterrestrial shapeshifters (Skrulls) on Earth.Executive producer Ali Selim confirmed to Polygon on Wednesday (21 June), the day of the show\u2019s release, that Secret Invasion\u2019s opening sequence was created using Artificial Intelligence.He said he believes that the decision helped play into the show\u2019s themes: \u201cWhen we reached out to the AI vendors, that was part of it \u2013 it just came right out of the shape-shifting, Skrull world identity, you know? Who did this? Who is this?\u201dAdmitting that he didn\u2019t \u201creally understand\u201d how AI works, Selim further explained: \u201cWe would talk to them about ideas and themes and words, and then the computer would go off and do something. And then we could change it a little bit by using words, and it would change.\u201dRecommendedStepson of Titanic submarine\u2019s billionaire passenger Hamish Harding attends Blink-182 gig: \u2018My family would want me to be here\u2019Channel 5 to air Titanic Sub: Lost at Sea documentary hours after submarine runs out of oxygenExtraction 2 viewers spot \u2018ridiculous\u2019 blunder in Chris Hemsworth sequelHowever, many people have responded negatively to the sequence, arguing that the use of AI takes away work from real artists.\u201cThis is salt in the wounds of all Artists and Writers in the WGA strike,\u201d Jon Lam, a storyboard artist, wrote on Twitter.\u201cSaid it before but I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 we really went from Spiderverse celebrating the arts and artists to Secret Invasion spitting on us,\u201d another wrote, comparing the new series to Marvel\u2019s animated Spider-Man movie franchise, which required the work of 140 animators.\u201cEven ignoring the concerns over the MCU proudly dipping its toe into AI this early, the Secret Invasion MidJourney intro is repulsive,\u201d a third wrote.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI wasn\u2019t conceived at Glastonbury, but for the first decade of my life I may as well have been. I was, in many respects, a Glastonbury baby. Born and raised in nearby Bristol, I first visited in 1994, aged two with potty in hand, and attended for the five years that followed. I have not been back since. But even if Glastonbury has changed hugely in the decades in between, it still exists as a joyous, creative paradise of jugglers, acrobats and enormous fire-breathing spiders for those lucky enough to experience it as a child. Enough to grant it an almost mythical hold over many of the children who have passed through over the years, like a soothing imprinton the soul.Back then, against the withering judgements of outraged co-workers, my parents saw it as an adventure and an education, for themselves and for me. My dad sometimes worked there as a steward, picking up litter and ushering in guests in exchange for a free ticket. But the tickets themselves were also relatively affordable \u2013 around \u00a350 each, picked up from a local ticket shop, with under-12s getting in for free. Too broke to afford any sort of overseas holiday, Glastonbury was our version of an annual family sojourn, and a bargain considering what was on offer.Music lovers and former punks, my parents felt at home there primarily for political reasons. As alien as it might appear today in the era of Wayne and Coleen Rooney arriving by private helicopter, Glastonbury was formally the main fundraiser for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and widely recognised as a space for anarchist bands and protest, both of which my parents were active in. To me, unaware of the anti-capitalist ethos that historically underpinned it all, it was mainly a land full of pretty colours and loud noises, a sensory dream factory that felt earthy and magical and escapist.It was also terrifying. I was a nervous child at the best of times, but there was something in Glastonbury\u2019s lawless energy that felt particularly disquieting, with every part of it somehow ripe with danger. I remember spending the entirety of REM\u2019s headlining set in 1999 with my eyes locked on the chunky yellow lantern we had bought from Woolworths several weeks earlier, so sure that someone would come along and scoop it up. And that same paranoia permeated my time there over the years. It appeared whenever I ventured into the site\u2019s long drop toilets, erected above enormous communal pits holding a festivals\u2019 worth of human waste, with seats wide enough that I felt constantly at risk of falling in. And the tents in which we rested were natural incubators for childhood fear; I was certain that they would be unzipped and rifled through by maniacs, likely when we were sleeping. And that was only if they hadn\u2019t been stolen altogether while we were out exploring. Every walk back from one stage or another was buoyed by a persistent feeling of dread. I\u2019d be certain that we\u2019d return to a gaping patch of grass where our makeshift home used to be, the tent having been pilfered by some imagined criminal hippie.The irony of it all is that Glastonbury has long been safe for kids. Certainly it is now, having become about as dangerous as your average Hay Festival. But even 25 years ago and in the last gasps of its more unpredictable youth, where the only newspaper headlines Glastonbury regularly spawned involved criminality and overdoses, it was always strictly PG unless you went out of your way to look for the badness. And for the children there, many of us being exposed for the first time to alternative lifestyles or individuals under the influence, it served as an unparalleled education.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Live updates as Arctic Monkeys headline set in doubt over Alex Turner\u2019s acute laryngitis30,000 steps a day and \u2018Glasto Lip\u2019: What it\u2019s like to work at Glastonbury FestivalGlastonbury weather: Latest Met Office forecast predicts sunny festival with the odd showerFreelance arts worker and PhD student Megan Vaughan regularly went to Glastonbury with her dad throughout the Nineties, and remembers a specific moment from one of their first trips there. \u201cIt started raining one afternoon and everyone obviously ran for shelter under the nearest tree or marquee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut there were a group of people who stayed dancing in the rain outside a burger van, and I remember my dad stopping me and pointing out that those people were \u201con drugs\u201d.\n\nMy parents skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J\u201cI threw more awkward questions at him in those four days every summer than at any other time in his life as a father. I was hearing new terminology for different kinds of drugs, new swear words and new sexual references \u2013 I had certainly never encountered anything like that back in Macclesfield. I guess I was very lucky that I had a cool dad who was ready to answer those difficult questions in an adult way for me.\u201dOne of the odd side effects of the Glastonbury experience for a child is that sudden dissolving of shame, where sights or words that we recognise, consciously or not, as \u201cadult things\u201d suddenly become less frightening or at least OK to be talked about. It\u2019s likely a product of so much forced intimacy \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen each other caked in mud, and heard the neighbours in the next-door tent make noises that no four-year-old should ever hear, so what difference would an awkward question make?And it applies to the music, too. The acts I have vivid memories of seeing as a kid are often of the more commercial Top of the Pops variety, purely because those were the big pop anthems I unashamedly loved as a kid. I have absolutely no memory of seeing Johnny Cash on the Pyramid Stage in 1994, which my mum always insists that I witnessed, but I sure as hell remember sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders while Heather Small sang \u201cMoving on Up\u201d the day before. And while any self-respecting six-year-old can lose their minds to Hole\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Skin\u201d and I might tell people that my highlight of 1999\u2019s festival was seeing Hollywood-glam-phase Courtney Love sing \u201cMalibu\u201d while Melissa Auf der Maur wafted away behind her, I can\u2019t deny that I was mostly hyped for The Corrs that year. But being a child at Glastonbury also means a brilliant absence of good taste, with no awareness of what it means to be cool or the importance of being seen at the right places.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cWe used to print off a clash list and highlight what we all wanted to see and compare what sacrifices we had to make,\u201d recalls film journalist Millicent Thomas, who went to Glastonbury three times with her parents between the ages of 11 and 13. \u201cBecause obviously they couldn\u2019t let me just go off and see the bands I wanted to see. I can\u2019t remember who it was they skipped, but I remember they were really gutted about it because they skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J. I feel so bad looking back on it.\u201dMillicent, aged 11, with her dad at Glastonbury 2011  (Millicent Thomas)Most of all, childhood is the best way to spot just how transformative Glastonbury can be, its excess and noise not only creating a vast new world unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before, but shifting how you see yourself.Glastonbury threw me into a state somewhere between childhood and adulthood. I had never felt more young, nor more aware of my physical size, but I also remember feeling oddly defiant and assertive. Glastonbury was terrifying in its loose recklessness, but not so much that I didn\u2019t feel like it could bend to my will if I thought hard enough. Here was a space where typical rules didn\u2019t apply, where my parents wouldn\u2019t be as firm or as protective as they were at home, I thought. I recall being genuinely hurt that they refused to let me see Scream 2 at the festival\u2019s cinema tent in 1998, as if merely being at Glastonbury meant it would be OK for a six-year-old to watch.And it\u2019s a strange power that feeds into why I\u2019m in no rush to go back. Those years were so formative that the idea of returning would feel like the worst kind of nostalgia, with its inevitable disappointment and awareness of the changes that have occurred. And where once speculation that Kate Moss had been spotted walking around the campground was written off as an unlikely rumour, the festival is now so bombarded with celebrities, gourmet food trucks and luxury tents that there\u2019s little chance of it feeling the same.Millicent agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself wanting to go again,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are different kinds of crowds that go now, and it\u2019s got a lot bigger \u2013 I just don\u2019t think I could manage it. I think I\u2019d be very anxious there now.\u201dA far younger Adam White, aged around 2 or 3, at an early 1990s Glastonbury (Adam White)But Glastonbury still lingers in other ways, regardless of how alien it is to me today. I still get a nostalgic rush from seeing a truly pitch-black night sky unburdened by street lights or buildings, throwing me back to seeing it for the first time in Pilton, and the acts I remember enjoying back then are still in semi-regular rotation on my phone. And that includes, with zero shame, The Corrs.Megan has gone back with friends as an adult, her trips with her dad brought to a close after a year in which she \u201cgot off with a teenage boy a couple of years older than me on the second day and then completely disappeared\u201d. But how it\u2019s changed in the interim or whether she\u2019s physically there every year are also largely irrelevant, with Glastonbury long having seeped into her everyday life.\u201cI work in the most experimental edges of fringe performance now,\u201d she explains, \u201cand I can absolutely see that the things that I was discovering at Glastonbury in those theatre and circus fields, or the late-night cabaret stuff or the weird X-rated spoken word, and all the weird subcultural, surreal visuals in those performance areas, all informed my taste as an adult but also my career. It was totally an appetite that I developed when I was a kid there.\u201dFor a few years as a teenager, I was sure that I might have imagined my time at Glastonbury, existing as it did in arbitrary images or strange flashes, while our photo albums laid untouched for a decade. But found buried at the bottom of an old suitcase, when I was 20 or so, was a child-sized T-shirt from Glastonbury 1999, the festival\u2019s logo on the front and that year\u2019s line-up printed on the back.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI wasn\u2019t conceived at Glastonbury, but for the first decade of my life I may as well have been. I was, in many respects, a Glastonbury baby. Born and raised in nearby Bristol, I first visited in 1994, aged two with potty in hand, and attended for the five years that followed. I have not been back since. But even if Glastonbury has changed hugely in the decades in between, it still exists as a joyous, creative paradise of jugglers, acrobats and enormous fire-breathing spiders for those lucky enough to experience it as a child. Enough to grant it an almost mythical hold over many of the children who have passed through over the years, like a soothing imprinton the soul.Back then, against the withering judgements of outraged co-workers, my parents saw it as an adventure and an education, for themselves and for me. My dad sometimes worked there as a steward, picking up litter and ushering in guests in exchange for a free ticket. But the tickets themselves were also relatively affordable \u2013 around \u00a350 each, picked up from a local ticket shop, with under-12s getting in for free. Too broke to afford any sort of overseas holiday, Glastonbury was our version of an annual family sojourn, and a bargain considering what was on offer.Music lovers and former punks, my parents felt at home there primarily for political reasons. As alien as it might appear today in the era of Wayne and Coleen Rooney arriving by private helicopter, Glastonbury was formally the main fundraiser for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and widely recognised as a space for anarchist bands and protest, both of which my parents were active in. To me, unaware of the anti-capitalist ethos that historically underpinned it all, it was mainly a land full of pretty colours and loud noises, a sensory dream factory that felt earthy and magical and escapist.It was also terrifying. I was a nervous child at the best of times, but there was something in Glastonbury\u2019s lawless energy that felt particularly disquieting, with every part of it somehow ripe with danger. I remember spending the entirety of REM\u2019s headlining set in 1999 with my eyes locked on the chunky yellow lantern we had bought from Woolworths several weeks earlier, so sure that someone would come along and scoop it up. And that same paranoia permeated my time there over the years. It appeared whenever I ventured into the site\u2019s long drop toilets, erected above enormous communal pits holding a festivals\u2019 worth of human waste, with seats wide enough that I felt constantly at risk of falling in. And the tents in which we rested were natural incubators for childhood fear; I was certain that they would be unzipped and rifled through by maniacs, likely when we were sleeping. And that was only if they hadn\u2019t been stolen altogether while we were out exploring. Every walk back from one stage or another was buoyed by a persistent feeling of dread. I\u2019d be certain that we\u2019d return to a gaping patch of grass where our makeshift home used to be, the tent having been pilfered by some imagined criminal hippie.The irony of it all is that Glastonbury has long been safe for kids. Certainly it is now, having become about as dangerous as your average Hay Festival. But even 25 years ago and in the last gasps of its more unpredictable youth, where the only newspaper headlines Glastonbury regularly spawned involved criminality and overdoses, it was always strictly PG unless you went out of your way to look for the badness. And for the children there, many of us being exposed for the first time to alternative lifestyles or individuals under the influence, it served as an unparalleled education.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Live updates as Arctic Monkeys headline set in doubt over Alex Turner\u2019s acute laryngitis30,000 steps a day and \u2018Glasto Lip\u2019: What it\u2019s like to work at Glastonbury FestivalGlastonbury weather: Latest Met Office forecast predicts sunny festival with the odd showerFreelance arts worker and PhD student Megan Vaughan regularly went to Glastonbury with her dad throughout the Nineties, and remembers a specific moment from one of their first trips there. \u201cIt started raining one afternoon and everyone obviously ran for shelter under the nearest tree or marquee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut there were a group of people who stayed dancing in the rain outside a burger van, and I remember my dad stopping me and pointing out that those people were \u201con drugs\u201d.\n\nMy parents skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J\u201cI threw more awkward questions at him in those four days every summer than at any other time in his life as a father. I was hearing new terminology for different kinds of drugs, new swear words and new sexual references \u2013 I had certainly never encountered anything like that back in Macclesfield. I guess I was very lucky that I had a cool dad who was ready to answer those difficult questions in an adult way for me.\u201dOne of the odd side effects of the Glastonbury experience for a child is that sudden dissolving of shame, where sights or words that we recognise, consciously or not, as \u201cadult things\u201d suddenly become less frightening or at least OK to be talked about. It\u2019s likely a product of so much forced intimacy \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen each other caked in mud, and heard the neighbours in the next-door tent make noises that no four-year-old should ever hear, so what difference would an awkward question make?And it applies to the music, too. The acts I have vivid memories of seeing as a kid are often of the more commercial Top of the Pops variety, purely because those were the big pop anthems I unashamedly loved as a kid. I have absolutely no memory of seeing Johnny Cash on the Pyramid Stage in 1994, which my mum always insists that I witnessed, but I sure as hell remember sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders while Heather Small sang \u201cMoving on Up\u201d the day before. And while any self-respecting six-year-old can lose their minds to Hole\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Skin\u201d and I might tell people that my highlight of 1999\u2019s festival was seeing Hollywood-glam-phase Courtney Love sing \u201cMalibu\u201d while Melissa Auf der Maur wafted away behind her, I can\u2019t deny that I was mostly hyped for The Corrs that year. But being a child at Glastonbury also means a brilliant absence of good taste, with no awareness of what it means to be cool or the importance of being seen at the right places.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cWe used to print off a clash list and highlight what we all wanted to see and compare what sacrifices we had to make,\u201d recalls film journalist Millicent Thomas, who went to Glastonbury three times with her parents between the ages of 11 and 13. \u201cBecause obviously they couldn\u2019t let me just go off and see the bands I wanted to see. I can\u2019t remember who it was they skipped, but I remember they were really gutted about it because they skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J. I feel so bad looking back on it.\u201dMillicent, aged 11, with her dad at Glastonbury 2011  (Millicent Thomas)Most of all, childhood is the best way to spot just how transformative Glastonbury can be, its excess and noise not only creating a vast new world unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before, but shifting how you see yourself.Glastonbury threw me into a state somewhere between childhood and adulthood. I had never felt more young, nor more aware of my physical size, but I also remember feeling oddly defiant and assertive. Glastonbury was terrifying in its loose recklessness, but not so much that I didn\u2019t feel like it could bend to my will if I thought hard enough. Here was a space where typical rules didn\u2019t apply, where my parents wouldn\u2019t be as firm or as protective as they were at home, I thought. I recall being genuinely hurt that they refused to let me see Scream 2 at the festival\u2019s cinema tent in 1998, as if merely being at Glastonbury meant it would be OK for a six-year-old to watch.And it\u2019s a strange power that feeds into why I\u2019m in no rush to go back. Those years were so formative that the idea of returning would feel like the worst kind of nostalgia, with its inevitable disappointment and awareness of the changes that have occurred. And where once speculation that Kate Moss had been spotted walking around the campground was written off as an unlikely rumour, the festival is now so bombarded with celebrities, gourmet food trucks and luxury tents that there\u2019s little chance of it feeling the same.Millicent agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself wanting to go again,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are different kinds of crowds that go now, and it\u2019s got a lot bigger \u2013 I just don\u2019t think I could manage it. I think I\u2019d be very anxious there now.\u201dA far younger Adam White, aged around 2 or 3, at an early 1990s Glastonbury (Adam White)But Glastonbury still lingers in other ways, regardless of how alien it is to me today. I still get a nostalgic rush from seeing a truly pitch-black night sky unburdened by street lights or buildings, throwing me back to seeing it for the first time in Pilton, and the acts I remember enjoying back then are still in semi-regular rotation on my phone. And that includes, with zero shame, The Corrs.Megan has gone back with friends as an adult, her trips with her dad brought to a close after a year in which she \u201cgot off with a teenage boy a couple of years older than me on the second day and then completely disappeared\u201d. But how it\u2019s changed in the interim or whether she\u2019s physically there every year are also largely irrelevant, with Glastonbury long having seeped into her everyday life.\u201cI work in the most experimental edges of fringe performance now,\u201d she explains, \u201cand I can absolutely see that the things that I was discovering at Glastonbury in those theatre and circus fields, or the late-night cabaret stuff or the weird X-rated spoken word, and all the weird subcultural, surreal visuals in those performance areas, all informed my taste as an adult but also my career. It was totally an appetite that I developed when I was a kid there.\u201dFor a few years as a teenager, I was sure that I might have imagined my time at Glastonbury, existing as it did in arbitrary images or strange flashes, while our photo albums laid untouched for a decade. But found buried at the bottom of an old suitcase, when I was 20 or so, was a child-sized T-shirt from Glastonbury 1999, the festival\u2019s logo on the front and that year\u2019s line-up printed on the back. It was partly infuriating, decorated in the names of bands I love today that I could have seen then but didn\u2019t. But it was heartwarming most of all, a physical object confirming what an unusually exciting time I had for a few summers when I was barely a person. I no longer understand how I could have ever fit inside of it, but it brings me unparalleled joy knowing for a fact that I once did.RecommendedHow to watch the BBC\u2019s live Glastonbury coverageA day-by-day guide to the weather forecast for Glastonbury FestivalWatch moment Emily Eavis opens gates for 2023 Glastonbury FestivalThis piece was originally published in June 2019Glastonbury 2023 is held from Wednesday 21 June to Sunday 25 June"}, {"_id": "64940d3a51ac334f3a315fad", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/how-to-watch-glastonbury-live-webcam-b2361367.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glastonbury Festival 2023: How to watch the BBC\u2019s live coverage", "lead": "<p>Arctic Monkeys, Lizzo, Guns N\u2019 Roses and Elton John will all be taking to the Pyramid stage for this year\u2019s event</p>", "author": "Megan Graye", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 05:58:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:34.766195", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T05:58:45+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/18/09/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEven some of Wes Anderson\u2019s most die-hard fans were put off by his 2021 film The French Dispatch, with its three-story structure and stilted, self-conscious evocation of literary France. Anderson hasn\u2019t changed his storytelling technique in the slightest for his new film Asteroid City, but his recent detractors will be relieved nonetheless: this is his most enrapturing feature since The Grand Budapest Hotel nearly a decade ago.As in many of Anderson\u2019s films, the plot comes with multiple framing devices. We first see Bryan Cranston in black and white as an Edward R Murrow-esque TV host who introduces us to an earnest playwright called Conrad Earp (Edward Norton), who is working on the story we are about to watch. Asteroid City, then, is a film within a play within a TV show, or something like that. It is, we are told early on, an \u201capocryphal fabrication\u201d \u2013 and it even has an optional intermission.As soon as the action begins in earnest, the director switches his palette to iridescent Kodak colour. The main setting is Asteroid City, a desert town in the American southwest known for its observatory and enormous meteor crater. The military uses the empty plains to test atomic weapons, while junior stargazers and space cadets flock here to look at the night-time sky. Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman), a pipe-smoking photographer, rolls into town in his station wagon with his children in tow. His wife has recently died and he has her ashes with him. Then the car conks out, meaning he is stuck here. The genial but dim-witted local mechanic (a strong cameo from Matt Dillon) can\u2019t do anything to help. Augie asks his father-in-law Stanley (Tom Hanks), with whom he doesn\u2019t get on, to drive over and rescue them.Anderson has put together one of his huge, familiar ensemble casts. Much of the pleasure here comes from the perfectly calibrated and very deadpan performances from his actors, even those in the minor parts. Rupert Friend excels in a cameo as a singing cowboy with a nice line in folksy, homespun wisdom. Jeffrey Wright is very funny as the gruff military commander who locks down the town after an alien (Jeff Goldblum) puts in an appearance. (The spaceship scenes seem intended as a gentle parody of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.) Steve Carrell is the manager of the motel where our heroes are staying, a place where new settlers can buy themselves parcels of land from vending machines. Tilda Swinton is a scientist in a white coat, desperate to crack the secrets of the universe.While junior stargazers are peering through telescopes or having their first experiences of young love, Augie starts up a strange romance with Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Midge, a suicidal Hollywood star staying in the cabin opposite to him. Johansson is brilliant, embuing her character with both sex appeal and pathos.RecommendedIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, review: Harrison Ford carries this ragged exercise in nostalgiaMay December, Cannes review: Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore are tremendous in this Todd Haynes melodramaJeanne du Barry, Cannes review: Johnny Depp comeback film is surprisingly greatMany of the actors here are Anderson regulars. Newcomers, including a late-arriving Margot Robbie as a worldly stage actor and Maya Hawke as a prim school teacher, adapt brilliantly to the minimalist comedic style that the director favours. Some of the best scenes here involve fellow Anderson neophyte Tom Hanks and his on-screen grandchildren debating what precisely they should do with their mother\u2019s ashes.In its own offbeat way, Asteroid City is an Anderson patchwork of Cold War paranoia and American family values in all their often hypocritical glory.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0premiered on HBO in 1998, it was like nothing on TV. A metatextual pastiche of the newspaper advice column, it followed four friends \u2013 Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) \u2013 through the trials and tribulations of being rich, successful, and beautiful in turn-of-the-millennium New York. Whether the show\u2019s candour was an expos\u00e9 of its characters\u2019 lack of self-awareness, or whether the show\u2019s lack of self-awareness imbued its characters with a strange candour, was immaterial: it was a hit. It\u2019s striking, then, that its reboot,\u00a0And Just Like That\u2026\u00a0(Sky Comedy),\u00a0seems entirely ambivalent about all the things that made its forebear great, event TV.Returning now for\u00a0the second series, Carrie is still dealing with the death of her husband and Miranda has transplanted to California and given up her corporate lifestyle. Charlotte, as ever, is given a few taffeta-thin plotlines, and Samantha remains, conspicuously, offscreen. The gang, no longer in their thirties, are dealing with problems from the fag-end of mid-life: truculent teenagers, devious divorcees, marital malaise. \u201cMany years ago I thought I\u2019d start poaching eggs,\u201d Carrie tells her hunky podcast producer, from the rumpled sheets of their bed. \u201cBut I was 30: too busy to slow my roll for a three-minute egg.\u201dThe roll is not much slowed here: Carrie is still on the hunt for a Big replacement, even as her podcast, Sex and the City, flounders. Miranda, having left Steve (David Eigenberg), is discovering herself thanks to non-binary comedian Che (Sara Ramirez). And Charlotte is still finding the slightest excuse to fuss about things. Around them, the new additions to the core cast revolve like wayward satellites: realtor Seema (Sarita Choudhury), professor Nya (Karen Pittman), and Charlotte\u2019s fellow helicopter parent Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker). They\u2019re all invited to the brunches, allowed to sip their Bloody Marys, but never given much of an emotional look-in. \u201cI\u2019m done supporting this pity party for a brilliant, tenured Ivy League professor,\u201d Miranda tells Nya, and that\u2019s, essentially, the show\u2019s position.Much was made when And Just Like That\u2026 first appeared of the attempt to retrofit modern social norms on to the rather dated Sex and the City structure. The inclusion of non-white and non-binary characters, as a foil to the show\u2019s whiteness and straightness, was done with all the subtlety of a climate change theme at Milan Fashion Week. And for all the backlash to the depiction of Che and their relationship with Miranda, those two continue to take centre-stage as the show\u2019s star couple.\u201cI won\u2019t be party to upholding the patriarchy and the heteronormative standards of beauty,\u201d Charlotte\u2019s gender-nonconforming kid Rock (Alexa Swinton) tells their mum in the new episodes. Lines such as that aside, the new season is actually more sensitive to its prescriptive political correctness (Miranda, for example, engages in a beach-cleaning exercise, only to lose her phone in a mass of seaweed), but it still cannot overcome the cognitive dissonance of combining a hectoring tone with a vision of capitalistic America that would make a Rockefeller blush. In the end, it\u2019s all affirmative and no action.RecommendedBlack Mirror season six review: Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi mishmash needs to stop messing with a winning formulaBest Interests review: Unflinching Sharon Horgan drama imagines parents\u2019 ultimate nightmareThe Crowded Room review: Tom Holland works hard in clich\u00e9d, generic muddleThis would be less of a problem if Michael Patrick King and co\u2019s writing was able to recapture the zingy tone of its predecessor. But what once seemed edgy for primetime TV now feels like a parody of itself. \u201cI think my vagina has to write its own monologue,\u201d Carrie wistfully observes, having been asked to record an advert for a feminine hygiene product. This sort of light vaginocentrism might\u2019ve felt revolutionary 25-years ago, but feels half-hearted now. In the absence of a big event (or should that be \u201cBig\u201d event?) like the one that opened the first series of\u00a0And Just Like That\u2026, more time is given to low-stakes margherita musings. But in a post-Girls, post-Broad City, post-Insecure\u00a0world, that all feels a bit tame.There\u2019s always a pleasure in the reunion of beloved TV characters, and there\u2019s no denying the chemistry between Parker, Nixon and Davis (though\u00a0Nixon\u2019s coastal move upsets that trio). But the show still seems uncertain about its place in the world. Is it a throwback? A reimagining? An update? Or an entirely new thing? Caught between all these potential aspirations,\u00a0And Just Like That\u2026\u00a0has ended up a toothless imitation of its ancestor. Where\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0gave a voice in prestige TV to a generation of women, And Just Like That\u2026\u00a0is giving little more than pay cheques to its well-coiffed stars."}, {"_id": "64940d3d51ac334f3a315fb6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/samuel-l-jackson-brie-larson-trump-election-b2361674.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Samuel L Jackson says he bonded with Brie Larson over Trump: \u2018She was broken\u2019", "lead": "<p>\u2018She\u2019s not going to let any of that stuff destroy her,\u2019 said the Marvel actor </p>", "author": "Louis Chilton", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:16:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:37.018463", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T14:16:18+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/16/Collage%20Maker-20-Jun-2023-04-43-PM-3872.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNo Hard Feelings was marketed in the most unappealing way \u2013 as a bad-taste stick prodded into the ribs of its supposedly puritanical audience; a raunchy comedy in which Jennifer Lawrence attempts to seduce a 19-year-old boy. But rarely do films that call themselves \u201cedgy\u201d ever turn out to be more than mildly immature. Director Gene Stupnitsky\u2019s last film, the Jacob Tremblay-headlined Good Boys, heralded itself as the new Superbad. In reality, it was a good-natured, adorable-to-boot adventure into pre-teen befuddlement. His follow-up is no different: all bark, and far better with no bite. Behind the lazy, shock-tactic humour lies a streak of genuine humanity, something to carry the film beyond mere butts and boobs.Here\u2019s an Oscar-winning actor, one of the best of her generation, in the role of Maddie, a 32-year-old native of Montauk, a favoured summer retreat of the New York elite. She can\u2019t keep up with the area\u2019s rising property taxes and is now at risk of losing her late mother\u2019s home. Then she stumbles across a personal ad, posted by a wealthy couple (Laura Benanti and Matthew Broderick) and asking for a woman to date their introverted son Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman) before he shoots off to Princeton University. If she\u2019s successful in bringing Percy out of his shell, she\u2019ll take home a second-hand Buick. Maddie thinks, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She\u2019s had sex for far more frivolous reasons in the past.Maddie was tailor-made for Lawrence by Stupnitsky and his co-writer John Phillips. And it certainly feels like one of the first times we\u2019ve ever seen a film actually attempt to capture the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence, the celebrity: confident, but a little gawky. She\u2019s the head cheerleader if she actually turned out to be nice. Her physical comedy is pristine, as she stomps up the front steps of a house in rollerskates, or tries to seductively scooch a couch across an office. But she\u2019s even better when Maddie\u2019s antics falter, and we\u2019re shown the very lonely person behind them \u2013 a millennial existentially horrified to have reached the \u201cma\u2019am\u201d age, while still feeling as vulnerable and inadequate as the Gen-Zers whose world she\u2019s trying to infiltrate.Maddie and Percy are separated not only by generation but by class, and Stupnitsky and Phillips\u2019s script is surprisingly adept at navigating the somewhat complex power dynamics of this decade-age-gap, sex-work-aligned situationship. Feldman, known mostly for being cast in Broadway\u2019s Dear Evan Hansen at the age of only 16, allows Percy to have emotions beyond \u201cdorky\u201d and \u201chorny\u201d. He\u2019s fully rounded in a way that defies Maddie\u2019s description of him, that he\u2019s \u201cencased in bubble wrap\u201d.The fact Lawrence and Feldman feel so comfortable and honest in their work makes it all the more clumsy, then, when No Hard Feelings rampages into its \u201coutrageous comedic setpieces\u201d. There\u2019s slapstick violence and full-frontal nudity. Someone, inevitably, gets maced. None of it\u2019s silly or clever or even shameless enough to actually be funny. It\u2019s a little ironic that Lawrence\u2019s big showcase of her comedic talent would probably have been a better film if all the jokes had been cut out.RecommendedAndrew Barth Feldman spent a whole summer being (badly) seduced by Jennifer LawrenceAsteroid City review: Wes Anderson\u2019s enrapturing cosmic comedy is an offbeat Close EncountersThe Flash review: Muddled, poignant and \u2013 because of Ezra Miller \u2013 morally trickyDir: Gene Stupnitsky.

Based on recent updates with the US Coast Guard and as confirmed with The Independent, it is believed that the oxygen supply within the vessel is due to run out at around 1pm UK time. The submersible was launched at 8am Eastern Time on Sunday, which equates to 1pm in the UK. There was an estimated 96 hours of oxygen on the sub for 5 people.

The five passengers aboard were hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, getting to view the Titanic wreckage.Follow the latest updates on the missing Titanic submarine hereBut, in a chilling echo of the fate of the doomed 1912 vessel, the adventure took a dramatic turn.Just one hour and 45 minutes into the journey, the submersible lost contact with the surface ship.Five things we know about the missing Titanic submersibleNow, more than three days on, the watercraft is nowhere to be found.RecommendedTimeline of missing OceanGate Titanic sub\u2018Banging\u2019 heard in search for missing Titanic tourist submarine with less than 24 hours of oxygen left \u2013 liveWhere is the Titanic wreck \u2013 and how far down is it?In a press conference on Wednesday (21 June) afternoon, Captain Jamie Frederick of the US Coast Guard assured people that authorities are doing everything possible to locate the missing vessel as the search intensified with more technology.Mr Frederick confirmed that the vessel has less than 24 hours of oxygen supply left, meaning it is expected to run out around 5.30am ET on Thursday.He also acknowledged that officials do not know if crews will be able to rescue the people on board even if they do manage to find the sub before the oxygen runs out.In a dramatic turn, a Canadian aircraft searching for the missing sub detected intermittent banging noises from the vicinity where the divers were last located. The crew heard banging sounds every 30 minutes on Tuesday and again four hours later, after additional sonar devices were deployed.Here\u2019s what we know so far:What happened?On Sunday morning (18 June) at 9am Atlantic Daytime Time, the Titan, a submersible owned by OceanGate Expeditions, set off on its excursion to the Titanic\u2019s underwater grave with the research vessel the Polar Prince. The expedition began with a 400-nautical-mile journey out into the Atlantic Ocean, about 900 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Titan prepares to launch from its submersive platform on a test run (OceanGate/YouTube)The submersible was then released from its surface ship and began its descent 13,000 feet below the water\u2019s surface to the wreckage. The vessel is supposed to transmit a signal back to the Polar Prince every 15 minutes but it lost contact around 11.47am ADT, one hour and 45 minutes into the submerge.What happened to the sub and its occupants remains a mystery.Former British Navy Rear Admiral Chris Parry told Sky News that the OceanGate Expeditions vessel could have fallen foul of a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d or even have become tangled up in the debris of the famed shipwreck.\u201cThere\u2019s an optimistic option and that\u2019s that it\u2019s either lost an umbilical communication with the surface or indeed there\u2019s been a malfunction and the submarine continues to operate but obviously out of contact with its mother ship,\u201d Mr Parry said.\u201cObviously on the other end of the scale, there could have been an accident. It could have become entangled in the wreckage of the Titanic. It could indeed have had a catastrophic failure.\u201dThe OceanGate Expeditions submersible vessel named Titan (PA Media)OceanGate Expeditions alerted the US Coast Guard around 6.40pm ADT after the missing sub after failed to surface and its expected time, 4pm ADT. Immediately, a search effort began for the overdue submersible. Where did it go missing?It is unclear where exactly the sub went missing but the US Coast Guard said it was searching 900 miles east of Cape Cod \u2013 where the famed Titanic shipwreck lies beneath the surface.The Titanic shipwreck sits approximately 12,500 feet at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, about 380 nautical miles south of Newfoundland, Canada and 1,240 nautical miles east of New York City. The shipwreck\u2019s coordinates are 41\u00ba43\u201932\u201dN, 49\u00ba56\u201949\u201dW.The US Coast Guard said it was searching in water depth of \u201croughly 13,000 feet\u201d.In a press conference on Monday (19 June), Rear Admiral John Mauger said the area the submersible went missing is \u201cremote\u201d which makes the search challenging. Combined with the fact that the sub could be on the surface of the ocean or underneath makes for a challenging operation.OceanGate said in a statement: \u201cOur entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families\u201d.It added that the company is \u201cdeeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to establish contact with the submersible.\u201dAt Wednesday\u2019s press conference, US Coast Guard Captain Jamie Frederick confirmed that there is still no sign of the Titan. Mr Frederick refused to comment on the less than 24 hours of oxygen left, instead saying he remained hopeful and efforts were \u201c100%\u201d focused on a search and rescue mission. Under the parameters, the oxygen supply will run out by 5.30am ET on Thursday.The world\u2019s deepest under sea search and rescue missionMultiple agencies, multiple nations and both private and public entities are desperately working together to locate and rescue the five missing on board the Titan submersible.The search is unlike anything that has ever been executed before \u2013 making this the deepest underwater search and rescue mission in the world.Search and rescue efforts are being led by the US Coast Guard in Boston but the Canadian Coast Guard, Canadian Armed Forces, US Navy and others are involved in the search. The US Coast Guard deployed two C-130 aircrafts, the New York Air National Guard deployed another C-130, the Canadian Coast Guard deployed one C-130 and one P-8 aircraft.A US Navy Curv-21, an unmanned submersible vessel that can reach a depth of 20,000 feet, is being used in the search for the missing Titanic wreck vessel (US Navy)In addition, several Canadian Coast Guard ships, a French research vessel L\u2019Atalante and commercial vessels are being used in the search.The Royal Canadian Navy has also deployed HMCS Glace Bay, which carries a medical team specialising in dive medicine. Onboard the ship is a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber that can be used to treat or prevent decompression sickness.However, the French ship Atalante carrying the Victor 6,000 underwater (ROV) and winch \u2014 the only one capable of reaching the Titanic wreck 4,000m under the ocean surface \u2014 is only expected to reach the search site on Wednesday night.The first photo emerged of the Deep Energy rescue ship, which carries two remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) capable of operating to a depth of 3,000m, arriving at the search site on Wednesday. The John Cabot, which has \u201cside-scanning sonar capabilities\u201d, the Skandi Vinland and the Atlantic Merlin also arrived at the search site on Wednesday morning, the US Coast Guard said in a Twitter post.3 A handout photo made released by the US Coast Guard showing the Bahamanian research vessel \u2018Deep Energy\u2019 (US Coast Guard/EPA)But, despite the multi-agency mission, David Concannon, an attorney and explorer who pulled out of the Titanic expedition at the last minute, claimed that the rescue efforts have been hampered by red tape, bureaucracy and a lack of urgency by the US government.British company Magellan Limited has had a deep-sea submersible craft \u201cready to support\u201d the rescue mission since early on Monday, with the ability to reach depths of 6,000 metres and prior experience of visiting the Titanic wreckage site. But the US First Coast Guard District told The Independent it has not requested assistance from the firm as the vessel, currently sat on a plane awaiting US clearance to be deployed, is too far away.Banging noises overheard One Canadian P-8 aircraft reportedly detected intermittent banging noises from the area the divers disappeared on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. On Twitter, the US Coast Guard based in Boston said it \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area. As a result, ROV operations were relocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises.Internal email updates sent to Department of Homeland Security leadership read: \u201cThe P-8 deployed sonobuoys, which reported a contact in a position close to the distress position. The P8 heard banging sounds in the area every 30 minutes. Four hours later additional sonar was deployed and banging was still heard.\u201dThe memo however did not state exactly when the banging was heard. Officials admit that the noises are \u201cinconclusive\u201d and are still being analysed by Navy experts.\u201cWith respect to the noises specifically, we don\u2019t know what they are, to be frank with you,\u201d Captain Jamie Frederick of the First Coast Guard District told reporters on Wednesday.Mr Frederick said that the area of the search was now twice the size of the state of Connecticut on the surface and was being conducted 2.5 miles deep below the Atlantic.\u201cThis is a search and rescue mission, 100 per cent,\u201d Cap Frederick said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the middle of a search and rescue case, you always have hope.\u201dAnd he added: \u201cSeveral P3 flights have heard noises yesterday and we relocated assets immediately.\u201cI think you need to be careful, we need to have hope but I can\u2019t tell you what the noises are but we are searching where the noises are and that\u2019s all we can do at this point.\u201cMy understanding is that the P3 had heard some noises today as well.\u201dCarl Hartsfield of the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution told reporters that the noises had been described as \u201cbanging\u201d and that they were being analysed by maritime acoustics experts.He went on to say that there was a large number of vessels now in the area which all give off noises picked up by sensors.Who are the five missing?Hamish Harding is one of the people aboard the Titan.Mr Harding, 58, previously travelled on the Challenger Deep to the bottom of the ocean and on Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin into space. He wrote on Facebook on Saturday to announce that he was joining OceanGate Expeditions for its Titanic mission this week.\u201cI am proud to finally announce that I joined OceanGate Expeditions for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic. Due to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023,\u201d Mr Harding wrote.Hamish Harding  (Jannicke Mikkelsen via REUTERS)On Monday \u2013 as news of the missing submersible broke \u2013 Mr Harding\u2019s stepson Brian Szasz confirmed that his stepfather was on board the vessel when it went missing.The father-of-two is a seasoned explorer and holds three Guinness World Records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel when in March 2021, he and ocean explorer Victor Vescovo dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench. In June 2022, he went into space on Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket.Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, is also one of the five passengers missing at sea. A friend \u2013 and fellow Titanic expert \u2013 Larry Daley confirmed to CBC that Mr Nargeolet, a French diver, was also on the vessel.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOne year on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions appears as intractable as ever. More walk-outs are expected to be announced in the next few days by the main rail union, the RMT.Speaking exclusively to The Independent, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned: \u201cOur executive will meet again this week and I\u2019m fairly certain they will put more strike action down.\u201dSince 21 June 2022, members of the RMT union have walked out on 28 occasions.While one dispute involving Network Rail has been settled, negotiations with train operators \u2013 including all the leading long-distance and commuter firms \u2013 appear to have stalled.RecommendedHours of oxygen left as rescuers searching for missing sub hear new \u2018banging\u2019 sounds A billionaire, father and son and renowned diver: Who is on missing Titanic sub?What we know about missing Titanic tourist submarineThe train operators are represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), with any settlement signed off by ministers \u2013 since the cost will ultimately be footed by taxpayers.Mr Lynch said: \u201cWe\u2019re available all of the time to talk about a settlement and negotiate a deal, but there isn\u2019t one available.\u201cThe government have locked the dispute down, and have gone to radio silence, I\u2019m afraid.\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up. We\u2019ve had a mass meeting of our reps last week and the message was very firm: that they wanted to continue.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that [industrial action] will be at this stage, but it will be another campaign of action to try and keep the dispute alive so that we can get a settlement for our people.\u201dA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cIt is completely false to say the government is blocking a deal. \u201cThe Transport Secretary [Mark Harper] and Rail Minister [Huw Merriman] have regularly met union leaders and facilitated a fair and reasonable offer, which includes a generous pay rise and no compulsory redundancies.\u201cThe government wants to see an end to this dispute, but that requires union leaders to put offers to a vote of their members.\u201dMr Lynch insisted that the recent ballot to continue industrial action was effectively a referendum on the employers\u2019 \u201cbest and final offer\u2019, and that a separate vote would be unnecessary.At the heart of the issue are reforms to working practices \u2013 which the RMT leader characterises as \u201ccuts\u201d.The general secretary said: \u201cThey want us to just give up on our terms and conditions \u2013 where we say we\u2019ll go into negotiations or consultations on a second phase, where we haven\u2019t even seen the detail, but we must declare the dispute over.\u201cNo responsible union would do that.\u201dA spokesperson for the RDG said: \u201cThe deals offered have been fair and affordable, worth up to 13 per cent over two years for the lowest paid, along with job-security guarantees. \u201cIt is to the detriment of its own membership, and the financial viability of an industry of vital economic importance, that the RMT leadership has blocked its members from having their say on their own offer and instead opted to prolong this dispute.\u201cThe reality is that members of the RMT have already lost around \u00a32,000 pounds due to industrial action, while taxpayers shoulder the burden of making up for a 30 per cent revenue shortfall post-Covid as confirmed in the latest Passenger Usage report.\u201cWe urge the RMT to work constructively with industry to put in place common-sense and long-overdue reforms that would improve the service for our passengers, fund a pay rise and help secure the long-term future of the industry.\u201cOn the employers\u2019 side, a sense is building that talks have run into the sand, with the RMT\u2019s executive committee unwilling to sign off a possible settlement \u2013 or put it to a vote of members.The next step could be to impose changes such as booking office closures, or to devolve talks to individual train operators \u2013 which Mr Lynch characterised as \u201cless easy to handle from both sides of the equation\u201d.RecommendedHours of oxygen left as rescuers searching for missing sub hear new \u2018banging\u2019 sounds A billionaire, father and son and renowned diver: Who is on missing Titanic sub?What we know about missing Titanic tourist submarineAslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, will resume national industrial action in 2 July with a six-day overtime ban among members working for more than a dozen train operators.

Its straight-to-Instagram glam impresses adults, but it cannily tempts teens too. Family rooms cleverly create a separate space with bunk beds hidden way from prying parents. Taller teens might prefer the family room option of two interconnecting Chamber King Rooms. The 222 bedrooms and the public spaces are boldly flourished with striking art, extravagant fabrics and ever bright colours. Phone photos will be snapped and videos shared on TikTok. The green messaging will please eco-conscious teens as Virgin plants a tree for every room booked.Best hotel for budget city breaks: Aparthotel Adagio Glasgow CentralLocation: GlasgowApartments feature comfortable beds and kitchen areas (abacapress/giuliano ottaviani)The location couldn\u2019t be better at this 162-apartment complex right in the heart of Scotland\u2019s largest city. The prime shopping district unfurls right outside too, with myriad family-friendly places to eat and cafes. The River Clyde lies just outside, too, for calming strolls and burning off energy. Apartments are comfortable rather than luxurious, and come with a bedroom for parents and a twin sofa bed large enough for teens.

The kids\u2019 and teens\u2019 clubs are top notch, but there is always another level at Gleneagles: training gun dogs, firing off arrows on an archery range, having a bird of prey swoop in to grab food from a child\u2019s arm, or kids driving around in a mini Range Rover. Gleneagles may boast Scotland\u2019s only two-Michelin-star restaurant, but it is adept at giving wee gastronomes the full treatment too.

The bedrooms have an understated industrial chic, but the real star of the show is the creative twist on brunch in the cosy lounge... which you shouldn\u2019t tell anyone about, lest it gets overcrowded.Best hotel for a central location: Mimi\u2019s Hotel SohoNeighbourhood: SohoClosest tube station: Tottenham Court RoadSoho is bustling with lively bars and restaurants  (Mimi's Hotel Soho)Combining the sumptuous grandeur of old Soho with modern style, the hotel \u2013 more of a bar with some very nice rooms attached to it \u2013 is divided between two addresses: Henson\u2019s bar on Frith Street, and a second property just around the corner.\u00a0Either way, you\u2019re slap bang in the middle of Soho, which, despite a lot of recent redevelopment, remains the beating heart of bar and cafe life in central London. With an interior showing off an embarrassment of Italian marble, the rooms are small but perfectly formed, and the buzzy Henson\u2019s bar serves tremendous cocktails. There is nowhere to eat on-site, but as we may have mentioned, you\u2019re in the middle of Soho.Read more of our UK hotels reviews: Best affordable hotels in LondonWhere to stay in ShoreditchBest boutique hotels in LondonBest family-friendly hotels in LondonBest luxury hotels in LondonBest spa hotels in LondonRecommendedThe best London hotels for afternoon tea 2023: Where to visit for great views, elegance and delicious treatsLondon city guide: Where to stay, eat, drink and shop in the UK capital, according to a localBest country hotels near London: Spa breaks, golf courses and more are just a train ride awayRead more about UK travel:UK holiday destinations for families Best spa hotels in Cornwall Best boutique hotels in the Lake District "}, {"_id": "64940d4451ac334f3a315fcf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/amazing-bridges-longest-tallest-highest-ribblehead-viaduct-danyang-kunshan-b2360953.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "14 of the world\u2019s most incredible bridges", "lead": "<p>Marvel at the engineering genius behind some of the world\u2019s most remarkable bridges</p>", "author": "Joanna Whitehead", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:03:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:44.574493", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:03:41+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/07/15/golden-bridge-main.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSometimes inspiration can be found in the most unlikely of places. Take the humble bridge; some have been traced back to Roman times, others are continuously being built, but how much thought do we give to something that simply transports us from one place to another? Necessity and practicality are words rarely associated with beauty, but some of the world\u2019s bridges have become the ultimate symbols of their respective cities, such as New York\u2019s Brooklyn Bridge or London\u2019s Tower Bridge. While appearance is often a factor, as technology advances, newer bridges can incorporate modern ingenuity into their construction, meaning that the most spectacular bridges on the planet are often a mix of aesthetically pleasing features and ingenious feats of engineering. You may have previously thought of bridges as simply facilitating travel, but our selection of the world\u2019s most incredible bridges could make you see these majestic structures through new eyes.Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge, China Recommended\u2018Banging\u2019 heard in search for missing Titanic tourist submarineCabin crew restrain teenager with \u2018lasso rope\u2019 after he tries to open plane doorFinland introduces the world\u2019s first phone-free tourist islandThe Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge is the longest in the world  (Rex)At 102 miles in length, this extensive bridge is the world\u2019s longest. Opened to the public in 2011, it took around 10,000 people to construct it over just four years and cost $8.5bn. This incredible structure connects Shanghai to the town of Nanjing, the capital of China\u2019s Jiangsu province. Millau Viaduct, FranceMillau Viaduct is the tallest bridge in the world (Getty Images)Surpassing even the mighty Eiffel Tower in height, France\u2019s Millau Viaduct holds the current title of the tallest bridge in the world. With a structural height of 343 metres, the bridge opened in 2004 and straddles the Tarn Valley between Clermont-Ferrand and B\u00e9ziers and Narbonne. For a different view of the statuesque structure, bridge enthusiasts can canoe underneath. Ribblehead Viaduct, North YorkshireRibblehead Viaduct is a great example of Victorian engineering (Rex)Comprised of 24 stone arches and sitting 32 metres above the moorland below, the Ribblehead Viaduct is one of the UK\u2019s best examples of Victorian engineering. Built between 1870 and 1874, the bridge secured Grade II listing in 1988. Forming part of the picturesque Settle-Carlisle railway route, the bridge is located in the middle of the Three Peaks mountain challenge and is on the border of Cumbria and Yorkshire.

Opened to the public in 1998, it was named after the Portuguese explorer who was the first European to reach India by sea in the 15th century. Spanning the Tagus River, the bridge cannot be accessed on foot and has been built to withstand winds of up to 155mph.Beipanjiang Bridge, ChinaThe Beipanjiang or Duge Bridge is the highest in the world (AFP via Getty Images)Over 560m in height, the Beipanjiang or Duge Bridge is the highest in the world. The structure has substance as well as style; this critical stretch of motorway links the cities of Liupanshui and Qujing, reducing travel time by up to three hours. At nearly double the height of London\u2019s Shard, the bridge cost \u00a51.023bn (roughly \u00a3112m) to construct.Golden Bridge, VietnamTourists are flocking to see the giant hands on the Golden Bridge (AFP/Getty Images)Since opening in 2018, Vietnam\u2019s 150 metre long Golden Bridge has become a major tourist attraction. Perched on a mountaintop near the city of Da Nang, the distinctive bridge is designed to look as if it is being held up by a giant pair of hands.Pont du Gard Aqueduct, FranceThe Pont du Gard was built in Roman times (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Claiming the title of the oldest bridge in this list, the Pont du Gard aqueduct is a Roman monument built in the first century AD. Originally designed to supply the city of N\u00eemes with water, this three tier aqueduct is 50 metres in height. Constructed from soft, yellow limestone rock, this remarkable edifice was declared a historical monument by the French government in 1840. Golden Gate Bridge, USAThe Golden Gate Bridge has become an iconic structure (Getty Images/iStockphoto)A contender for the world\u2019s most famous bridge, San Francisco\u2019s iconic crossing opened in 1937 \u2013 just six months after the city\u2019s other main bridge, the (Oakland) Bay Bridge \u2013 at a cost of $35m at the time. Painted in international orange, the opening of the structure to the public resulted in a week-long celebratory fiesta. Last year, the US government approved a $400m project to help protect the bridge against earthquakes. Hartland/New Brunswick Bridge, CanadaNew Brunswick Bridge is the longest covered bridge in the world (Rex)Opened in 1901, the longest covered bridge in the world was declared a National Historic Site in 1980. Also known as a \u201ckissing bridge\u201d, the 391m long structure dates back to when young men \u201ctrained\u201d their horses to stop halfway across the bridge in order to steal a few kisses, before continuing on to the other side. This one-way bridge was covered over in 1922 despite opposition from local people, who worried that \u201ccovering\u201d the bridge was a threat to the moral fibre of the young people. In 1995, a Canadian postage stamp was issued honouring the bridge. Eshima Ohashi, JapanThe Eshima Ohashi Bridge connects Matsue, Shimane and Sakaiminato over Nakaumi lake (Getty Images)Looking at a picture of this infamous bridge, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for some sort of endurance run for racing cars. Proof that you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover, this seemingly incredibly steep motorway only has a maximum gradient of 6.1 per cent. For comparison, cyclist\u2019s favourite Box Hill in Surrey has an average gradient of five per cent. At just over one mile, the Eshima Ohashi Bridge connecting Matsue and Sakaiminato is the largest rigid frame bridge in Japan. 1915 Canakkale Bridge, TurkeyA view of the 1915 Canakkale Bridge (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Opened in March last year, the 1915 Canakkale Bridge is now the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a distance of 2,023 metres on its main span. Overall, the structure measures 2.9 miles long, and was built over five years at a cost of \u00a32.1bn. It won the record from the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan, and will serve a connecting link on Turkey\u2019s new K\u0131nal\u0131-Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7anakkale-Bal\u0131kesir motorway. Sky Bridge, Czech RepublicSky Bridge 721 opened in May 2022 (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The world\u2019s longest suspension footbridge opened in May 2022 in the Dolni Morava region in the east of the country. Measuring 721 metres long and just 1.2 metres wide, it overtook the recently-opened Arouca 516 in Portugal by 154 metres, and sits 95 metres above a steep valley for a unique, if perhaps unsettling, walk in the Dolni Morava resort.George Washington Bridge, USAThe George Washington Bridge is the busiest in the world (Getty Images)One of several famous bridges in the Big Apple, the George Washington bridge is the busiest bridge in the world, reportedly carrying over one hundred million vehicles per year (or up to 250,000 per day). The original structure was completed in 1927, though a lower level was opened in 1962, meaning that today the bridge shuttles vehicles over 14 different lanes of traffic (the most of any bridge in the world).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNestled high in the Baltics, Estonia\u2019s burgeoning popularity has long moved beyond simply the stag party crowd. Step outside the culture-filled cities, all steeped in medieval history, and you\u2019ll find half of this compact country is pure nature, covered in dense coniferous forest and preserved peat bogs, while just off the west coast are 2,000 virtually uninhabited islands dotted with wooden windmills, blinking lighthouses and the occasional isolated community. With its famously clean air and rich cultural heritage of handicrafts and folk music, Estonia is peaceful, natural, and entirely unexpected.Travel restrictions and entry requirementsThere are no Covid-19 restrictions for travellers entering Estonia. No tests or proof of vaccination certificates are needed, and masks are not mandatory.You can travel to countries in the Schengen area, such as Estonia, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa.

Kadriorg Art Museum is housed in a Baroque palace, Toompea Castle plays host to parliament, and street parades regularly dance between the perfectly preserved Viru Gates. The best way to explore? Get lost on foot in Tallinn\u2019s walled Old Town, following needle-sharp Gothic church spires and steep alleyways that open into large courtyards lined with pastel painted Hanseatic merchant houses. Find modern life wrapped in history in Estonia\u2019s capital  (Getty Images)For panoramic rooftop views, walk along the city\u2019s still-intact defensive walls to climb the six-storey rotund guard towers \u2013\u00a0or take the modern route with the 314m-high TV Tower\u2019s observation deck. Tallinn\u2019s vibrant cafe culture and teeming nightlife of subterranean bars explains its stag party popularity (check out former fishing village Kalamaja, now a popular student neighbourhood), but the edges of the capital offer the nature Estonia\u2019s known for: Stroomi beach is primed for surfing, Paljassaare Peninsula is a birdwatcher\u2019s paradise, and the dramatic J\u00e4gala waterfall is surrounded by hiking trails.TartuKnown as Estonia\u2019s second city, Tartu is famous for its lively student population thanks to the historic and still operational 17th-century university. A boisterous and creative energy runs rampant in Tartu, past bronze statues and down wide bicycle-friendly streets that lead to playgrounds, museums and huge green spaces. The Botanical Garden is a must, as are the Gothic ruins of Tartu cathedral at Toome Hill. The Supilinn district \u2013\u00a0\u201cSoup Town\u201d \u2013 was once a 19th-century slum, and\u00a0still features original wooden houses on streets named for soup ingredients, such as peas and potatoes.

Try to visit for Tartu\u2019s \u201cStudent Days\u201d, held biannually in spring and autumn, when students hold boat rallies and water jousting across the city.Here\u2019s why Tartu, Capital of Culture 2024, should be on everyone\u2019s lipsSaaremaa islandEerie and ethereal Saaremaa is Estonia\u2019s largest island, and a historian\u2019s dream. Over time, Saaremaa has been home to pirates and Vikings, ruled by four different nations, and even contains 7,000-year-old craters and Bronze Age stone walls at the Kaali meteorite site \u2013\u00a0all of which have led to a wealth of mythology on the island. Explore the dolomite stone castle in Saaremaa\u2019s capital (the best-preserved medieval castle in the country) and chase ancient traditions inside the wooden Anga windmills, before immersing yourself in the adventures at Asva Viking Village. The tranquil S\u00f5rve Peninsula, created when Estonian hero Great T\u00f5ll threw rocks at the devil, according to legend, is a haven for birdwatchers and hikers. But the best views are from the striking black and white S\u00f5rve lighthouse: at 52m, it\u2019s the tallest on the Baltic Sea.Get away from it all with a visit to Saaremaa  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)P\u00e4rnuOnce a coastal summer retreat for the wealthy then a sanatorium town during Soviet occupation, P\u00e4rnu\u2019s faded glamour still launches into life each summer. Jazz festivals held on the expansive white sand beach attract young families and \u201calternative\u201d crowds, while hikers explore coastal meadows right on the seafront. P\u00e4rnu\u2019s centrepiece, a grand neoclassical spa, sets the tone for wandering past brightly painted wooden villas set on wide, tree-lined boulevards. It\u2019s classic seaside fun, just two hours from the capital.Best under-the-radar destinationsNarvaCalled the \u201cwild east\u201d, frontier city Narva teeters close to Russia\u2019s border, divided only by a river of the same name. It\u2019s a fascinating spot for Soviet history and architecture fans; heavily bombed in WWII, Narva experienced a rather Stalinist rebuild that is still visible today. Hermann Castle still stands despite the bombing \u2013\u00a0a 13th-century relic amid the industrialism \u2013 and offers good views of Ivangorod castle on the Russian riverbank. The city\u2019s promenade along the river is particularly beautiful at sunset.KihnuAn hour\u2019s ferry ride from P\u00e4rnu is Kihnu, an island home to just 500 inhabitants. Cultural heritage is strong here: women wearing striped woollen skirts drive sidecar motorbikes and open trucks through impossibly tall pine tree forests, explaining their uniquely traditional lifestyle to visitors. At night, a lack of light pollution means spectacular stargazing, and the island\u2019s end-of-summer bonfire festival in August \u2013 which spans the entire Baltic coastline \u2013 reveals dozens of international fires flickering on the horizon.Summer solstice celebrations on Kihnu  (Getty Images)Soomaa National ParkHumans have lived in the wetlands of Soomaa since the Stone Age, and this ancient wilderness of peat bogs and rivers is now home to a wealth of wildlife. Visitors can spot brown bears, wolves, elk, and golden eagles, and the Beaver Trail leads past a number of dams. Soomaa\u2019s 40,000 hectares are best explored during Estonia\u2019s \u201cfifth season\u201d, when annual springtime floods allow for kayaking, canoeing and bog-shoe hikes through the watery meadows. Raised wooden walkways are built above the boggier parts for cyclists to traverse, and Sooma\u2019s historic farmhouses are on stilts for when the floods transform them into impromptu islands.Best things to do\u201cBikepack\u201d along the Baltic coastThe shoreline may be rocky but Estonia\u2019s well-maintained roads are loved by cyclists, particularly the flat terrain in the north and west. The clearly marked EuroVelo 10 route takes \u201cbikepackers\u201d north from P\u00e4rnu, along 981km (610 miles) of Estonia\u2019s coast (including three islands accessed by ferry) until it reaches the Russian border at Narva.

Locals bring their own whisks of birch twigs (called vihta) to hit their skin with; you can purchase your own for a few euros.Find a local festivalFor a true taste of local culture and tradition, attend one of Estonia\u2019s many festivals, like P\u00e4rnu\u2019s beachside jazz festival each July or Saaremaa\u2019s food festival in September. Viljandi\u2019s folk music festival is held in the town\u2019s medieval castle, while Kihnu\u2019s bonfire festival marks the end of summer, ushering in Tallinn\u2019s wintertime Black Nights Film Festival. Most special of all is the 30,000 strong choir that joins the Estonian Song Festival once every five years, filling Tallinn with a chorus of unmatched proportions (the next iteration is in 2025).Getting aroundEstonia\u2019s tiny size means domestic flights aren\u2019t common or necessary. Trains link Tallinn with various larger towns, and LuxExpress buses cover the rest of the country\u2019s long-distance routes. There are well established public transit networks in major cities.A baroque palace houses Kadriorg Art Museum  (Getty Images)Ferries departing from Estonia\u2019s west coast service many of the islands, and taking a hire car on board is no issue. Estonia was the first country in the world to implement nationwide charging points for electric vehicles \u2013 including on the islands \u2013\u00a0so rent-a-car road trips are particularly eco-friendly.How to get thereThe cheapest way to get to Estonia is a direct flight to Tallinn Airport, which takes three hours from London Stansted (Ryanair) or London Gatwick (easyJet). AirBaltic and WizzAir fly indirect routes from the UK.Though there are no direct trains running from Western Europe into Estonia, fans of overlanding can arrive by taking the Eurostar, catching onward trains to Hamburg and Stockholm, then a ferry to Tallinn.Money-saving tipSummer in Estonia is packed with Scandinavian tourists, particularly in July. To take advantage of the warm weather and daylight hours for hiking and cycling, aim for the shoulder seasons: either in April/May or late August into September. Prices and people reduce but the cooler temperatures are still comfortable for outdoor pursuits.FAQsWhat\u2019s the weather like?Temperate, warm summers (18\u201322C) and cold, snowy winters, with a fair amount of rain throughout the year.

Even the words themselves carry connotations that seem to have fallen far out of sync with the sartorial zeitgeist. Is anyone still slathering themselves in glitter? Do we still care about sequins and novelty sunglasses? And surely we\u2019ve all long-tired of neon by now? With Glastonbury Festival underway this weekend, all of this begs one crucial, singular question: Does festival fashion still exist?The fashion industry\u2019s growing environmental conscience might provide an answer. Today, it\u2019s much cooler to source your wardrobe from the likes of Depop and your local charity shop than Asos or Big Topshop (RIP). We fell out of love with fast fashion some time ago and, as a result, generally far more considerate consumers when it comes to our clothing. This is, of course, a very good thing. But it\u2019s also completely at odds with the concept of festival fashion.Few modes of dressing revolve around disposability quite like it. Think about it. A typical festival lasts one weekend, during which time you will inevitably be camping in a wide range of weather scenarios, sweating and dancing for hours on end without access to showers. You\u2019ll also be surrounded by scores of people who may or may not raid your tent for all of your belongings. In short, you don\u2019t exactly want to bring items you care about.Hence why fast fashion and festivals made so much sense; flimsy, cheap, tacky garments comprised the optimum capsule wardrobe. At least they did, anyway \u2013 until everyone wised up to the environmental consequences. Nonetheless, if you\u2019re going to a festival this summer, it\u2019s a universally accepted truth that you will probably have to wear some clothes. Where, then, does that leave you? And what of festival fashion trends? Is there space to tap into the latest cool, new thing when you\u2019re trying to shop sustainably and save money? Can we still have a hot girl (festival) summer?\u201cThe cost of living crisis is having a huge impact on young peoples\u2019 purchasing patterns, particularly when it comes to ad hoc events, so second-hand buys are proving a big hit for festival season,\u201d says Emily Gordon-Smith, content director and sustainability lead at the trend and insights forecaster Stylus. \u201cThis means tapping into more personalised looks, not straight off the high street, and often with a nod to iconic festival-ready styling that definitely includes Kate Moss in her Glasto heyday.\u201dRecommendedGlastonbury 2023 \u2013 live: Immigration enforcement officers spotted near festival site at Castle Cary stationFlip-flops, nudity and \u2018up the vajayjay!\u2019: How the red carpet became a platform for protestSubversive? Dangerous? Boring?: How the red carpet became a barometer for modern masculinityAs any seasoned festival-goer will know, few outfits have stood the test of time quite like Moss\u2019s from the early Noughties. One quick Google search will bring up hundreds of infamous shots of the model stomping through the muddy fields in micro-shorts, leather trousers, waistcoats, belted mini dresses, and other understated, utilitarian looks that couldn\u2019t be further from the festival fashion aesthetic du jour. Other style mavens for the era? Alexa Chung in a silver mini dress with a jumper tied loosely around her waist. Sienna Miller in yellow sunglasses and a studded belt. And so on.They weren\u2019t so much dressing for festivals as they were just dressing for a day of drinking beer and watching live music. Yes, they looked amazing, but it wasn\u2019t because they were soaking themselves in lame co-ords. It was because they weren\u2019t trying very hard, and it\u2019s this modus operandi that has established itself at the centre of festival fashion now.\n\nKate\u2019s festival looks are still being recreated on the runways, with key items like the waistcoats and flat knee boots appearing in many collectionsEmily Gordon-SmithIt\u2019s also at the root of the Y2K trends reigning supreme on catwalks across the globe for the last year. \u201cThe Nineties and Noughties continue to be eras of stylistic fascination for those not even old enough to remember them, so of course style icons like Kate Moss are a major reference point,\u201d adds Gordon-Smith. \u201cHer festival looks are still being recreated on the runways, with key items like the waistcoats and flat knee boots appearing in many collections including those from Celine and Stella McCartney.\u201dAs for how to incorporate all this into your own festival wardrobe, it\u2019s obviously not as easy as popping into a high-end luxury store and snapping up a \u00a3700 waistcoat. But if you want to follow in Moss and Co\u2019s footsteps, the way to do it is to actually do the exact opposite and try and find something unique. It might sound counterintuitive but, ultimately, that\u2019s what made their outfits so memorable in the first place; you couldn\u2019t easily replicate them.That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t look for key items, like tinted sunglasses and mini dresses, but you can find standout ones by taking your search onto secondhand shopping platforms, where you\u2019ll find limitless options and one-off pieces. On Depop, some of the most searched-for items reflect a wide range of trends for festival season, spanning from \u201csilver\u201d (21 per cent increase in searches) and \u201clace cami\u201d (37 per cent) to \u201cmirror\u201d (65 per cent) and \u201cparachute pants\u201d (1,200 per cent).If you do find yourself wanting to follow the crowd, though, the leading trend of the season is \u201cWestern\u201d. According to money-saving platform WeThrift, searches for the \u201ccowboy aesthetic\u201d have increased by 40 per cent on Pinterest in the last 90 days. Meanwhile, over on TikTok, the #cowboyaesthetic hashtag has surpassed more than 4.3 million views. The hashtag #cowboyboots has more than 920.9 million views. Similar data has been found by retailers, with Pretty Little Thing reporting a 57 per cent increase in searches for cowboy boots in the last month, while \u201cWestern\u201d searches have surged by 49 per cent.The first attendees pile into Glastonbury Festival this week (Getty Images)So long as you wear it right, it\u2019s a look that reflects the boho chic image of the early Noughties Glastonbury set. Our suggestion is to pair some brightly coloured boots (we love these ones) with a secondhand slip dress and a pair of yellow-tinted shades. Throw on an oversized cargo jacket and you\u2019re all set.Recommended5 sandal trends that will be huge this summerRoyal Ascot attendees bring colour and vibrancy to big race dayPharrell Williams makes his Louis Vuitton debut in star-studded Paris showAlternatively, if the sun is shining you might find yourself wanting to opt for a pair of statement trainers (these ones are very Nineties), which would work well with some classic Adidas tracksuit bottoms, a lace cami and some tiny sunglasses, amounting to a very Bella Hadid look. If you must do the crop top and denim cut-offs combo, there are ways to reinvent it a little. Try a knitted option from sustainable Australian brand MNK, for example, and there are plenty of secondhand denim shorts available across the web.All of it is easy to do \u2013 and far more comfortable than the festival outfits of yore \u2013 if you know what you\u2019re doing. Just remember, though, that if you\u2019re channelling Moss, less is always more. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks. And stay very far away from the glitter."}, {"_id": "64940d4751ac334f3a315fda", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/trevor-phillips-harry-meghan-race-b2362172.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sir Trevor Phillips says Harry and Meghan \u2018squandered\u2019 opportunity to become \u2018beacon of reconciliation\u2019", "lead": "<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have previously spoken out about experiencing racism in the UK </p>", "author": "Kate Ng", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 08:30:17", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:47.945571", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-22T08:30:17+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/22/09/trevoe-harry-meghan.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free fortnightly newsletter from The Independent's Race Correspondent Nadine WhiteSign up to our free fortnightly newsletter The Race Report\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

and finally, beginning to accord a rightful place to those men and women of the Windrush generation.\u201cThe 10 portraits in this series, together with the tributes to other members of that indomitable generation, are a small way to honour their remarkable legacy.Charles speaks with a guest during a reception at Buckingham Palace to celebrate the Windrush generation (PA Wire)\u201cIt is, I believe, crucially important that we should truly see and hear these pioneers who stepped off the Empire Windrush at Tilbury in June 1948 \u2013 only a few months before I was born \u2013 and those who followed over the decades, to recognise and celebrate the immeasurable difference that they, their children and their grandchildren have made to this country.\u201dHe added: \u201cThose pioneers, who arrived in a land they had learned about from afar, left behind all that was familiar to them.\u201cMany served with distinction in the British Armed Forces during the Second World War, just as their fathers and grandfathers had in the First World War.\u201cOnce in Britain, they worked hard, offering their skills to rebuild a country during peacetime and seeking opportunities to forge a better future for themselves and their families.\u201cWhen they arrived on our shores with little more than what they were able to carry with them, few could hardly have imagined then how they, and those that followed them, would make such a profound and permanent contribution to British life.\u201dCharles said it is his \u201csincere hope\u201d that the portrait project acts as a reminder that \u201cour society is woven from diverse threads, each comprising stories of remarkable courage and sacrifice, determination and strength\u201d.He added: \u201cThough drawn from different parts of the world, they collectively enrich the fabric of our national life and the remarkable tapestry of the Commonwealth.\u201cThis year, as we honour the legacy and achievements of the Windrush generation, I dearly hope that we can continue to embrace differences, listen to each other\u2019s stories, and learn from one another\u2019s experiences.\u201cIt is these stories that help light the path of progress and remind us of a fundamental truth: that though we might all be different, every individual, no matter their background, has something unique to contribute to our society in a way that strengthens us all.\u201dLast week, Charles hosted a Buckingham Palace reception where he met the 10 individuals whose faces have been immortalised in paint, and was given a special preview of the

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith bank holidays, festivals, trips and social commitments in the summer, it can feel difficult to say no, even if you really want to take some time out for yourself.\u201cSummer can feel like a never-ending list of activities and events, and this might encourage us to overindulge in too many late nights, alcohol, and food, \u201d says psychologist Dr Alison McClymont.\u201cOf course, doing this occasionally is not going to hurt, but to do it repeatedly will have a negative effect on your overall wellbeing. Rest and relaxation are the petrol you need to ensure your car keeps running,\u201d she says.So, what can we do to make that a priority, while not totally abandoning our social lives?What do you actually want to do?RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that \u2018no\u2019 is a sentence, and your boundaries matter,\u201d says Carly Rowena, wellbeing influencer, who\u2019s been working with Sky Stream.\u201cRemember to simplify your mind and your decisions, by prioritising what you actually want to do, rather than what you feel you should do. I\u2019d recommend finding out what you want this summer by journaling, stretching, or meditating,\u201d she explains.Think about how you feelYou may not know who to prioritise.\u201cWe can be mindful of our internal experiences by being aware of the emotions we experience when socialising,\u201d says Chloe Wheeler, assistant psychologist at Cygnet Health Care. \u201cThis can support us to recognise who makes us feel safe, uplifted and loved, and who may add to feelings of burnout, stress or anxiety.\u201dBe present and slow down\u201cMindfulness isn\u2019t sitting quietly and trying to stop your thoughts, it\u2019s allowing yourself to be present and to allow those thoughts to float past you like sticks floating down a river.\u201cAdding mindfulness into your routine gives you a chance to find out about yourself, slow down, prevent burnout and instead, find gratitude and joy throughout your day,\u201d Rowena explains.\u201cAccording to research by Sky Stream, 94% of Brits wish their lives were simpler, with 74% agreeing that life is more complicated now than it was five years ago, which is why it\u2019s more important than ever to focus on finding pockets of stillness and connection,\u201d she says.Drink less when socialisingMany summer events revolve around drinking.\u201cPhysically, as well as psychologically, alcohol directly affects a person\u2019s ability to focus,\u201d says Dr Henk Swanepoel, lead neuropsychologist at Cygnet Health Care.\u201cAs we know, a key principle of mindfulness is to focus attention on the present moment, by practising mindfulness breathing. However, alcohol can reduce a person\u2019s ability to concentrate and pay attention to this experience.\u201dGet outdoors\u201cGet outside as much as you can and ground yourself,\u201d says Rowena.Recommended5 sandal trends that will be huge this summer6 triggers asthma sufferers should watch out for this summerImposter syndrome \u2013 what is it and why does Kim Kardashian have it?And for parents, this is important to do with or without your children. \u201cChildren are incredible at being present and mindful, and need very little to find this.

As she noted that she loved \u201ccreating love,\u201d seemingly in reference to her children with Alec, she also detailed how she sometimes looks after her spouse. \u201cAm I his mommy?\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m his mommy. Sometimes.\u201dHilaria acknowledged the irony behind her joke, as she claimed her peers used to make comments about Alec being older than her.\u201cAt the beginning of our relationship, everyone was like: \u2018She must have daddy issues because she\u2019s married to somebody older.\u2019 But it\u2019s actually the opposite,\u201d she said.RecommendedCelebrity chef bans vegans from his restaurant \u2018for mental health reasons\u2019Stepson of Titanic submarine\u2019s billionaire passenger Hamish Harding attends Blink-182 gig: \u2018My family would want me to be here\u2019\u2018What in the wingardium leviosa?\u2019: Emma Watson stuns fans with \u2018levitating\u2019 dressAfter officially tying the knot more than 11 years ago, Hilaria and Alec went on to welcome seven children: Carmen, nine, Rafael, seven, Leonardo, six, Romeo, four, Eduardo, two, Lucia, two, and Ilaria, seven months.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSummer brings days out, holidays and festivals, but for those with lung conditions it can also be a risky time of year.High pollen levels, pollution, heat, and even smoke from things like BBQs can be dangerous, so it\u2019s important to know what precautions those who are vulnerable need to take, say Asthma + Lung UK.\u201cWe all look forward to summer and all the fun it brings with it, but people with asthma and other lung conditions must be careful to keep themselves safe too,\u201d says Erika Radford, head of health advice at the charity.\u201cThings like hot weather, dust in the atmosphere, or higher levels of pollen can make it harder for those with lung illnesses to breathe. Strong emotions, stress and even laughing a lot are also known asthma triggers, so we want people to be armed with the knowledge they need to protect themselves while enjoying themselves in the sun.\u201dHere are the summertime triggers to look out for and how people with lung conditions can protect themselves.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live1. Hot weather\u201cHot weather can be problematic for people with asthma or other lung conditions, because warmer air can cause the airways to narrow, leading to coughing and shortness of breath,\u201d says\u00a0Radford.\u00a0\u201cStrong sunshine also causes the level of ozone and other air pollutants in the atmosphere to rise, which can trigger symptoms.\u201dShe advises using your preventer inhaler regularly as prescribed and carrying your reliever inhaler everywhere.\u201cStaying out of the heat and in shaded areas as much as possible and cooling down with a handheld fan can help relieve breathlessness. Keep hydrated with regular cold drinks and take a cool shower if you become too hot.\u201dAlso, make sure you keep inhalers in a cool place out of direct sunlight, so they continue to work well, and in a cool bag when you\u2019re out and about. \u201cDon\u2019t add any ice to the bag though, as your inhaler needs to be kept dry,\u201d she says.2. PollenPollen levels tend to be highest between May and September.\u201cPollen is a trigger for almost half of people living with asthma and a quarter of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\u201d Radford says.Again, minimise the impact of pollen with your inhalers.\u201cTaking antihistamines or using a steroid nasal spray to reduce their allergic reaction to pollen is also really important,\u201d she adds, \u201cAs it\u2019s this allergic reaction that can cause your airways to narrow and fill with mucus, potentially setting off an asthma attack.\u201d3. Aerosols\u201cSweating more in the heat means you may want to carry things like deodorant or hairspray with you while commuting to work. But some of these sprays contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can cause irritation to the lungs and may increase the risk of experiencing symptoms or having an asthma attack,\u201d Radford\u00a0suggests.\u201cIf you live with a lung condition, your airways are more likely to be irritated, so try to use allergy friendly and chemical-free products, which have lower levels of VOCs and are usually fragrance-free, on your travels.\u201dYou may also benefit from using solid products, like roll-on deodorant. Unlike sprays, these won\u2019t get into the air for you to breathe in.4. DustDusty holiday homes, camping equipment or sun loungers that have been kept in storage can contain dust mites, which many people with lung conditions like asthma are allergic to. This allergic reaction can cause your airways to inflame and produce more mucus, Radford says.If you\u2019re getting dusty items out of storage, vacuum them or wipe them down with a damp cloth before use, ideally outdoors \u2013 or get someone else to do this for you. If you use airtight plastic bags or boxes when you pack the items away again, they are likely to get less dusty through the year when not in use.Make sure you carry antihistamine medicine in case your dust allergy is triggered.5. SmokeThere are\u00a0 likely to be people puffing away on cigarettes or vapes outdoors when the weather is nice, and it\u2019s wise to stay away from them if you have a lung condition.\u201cSmoking and breathing in secondhand smoke can not only make existing symptoms such as breathlessness worse and trigger asthma attacks, it can also cause many lung conditions, including COPD, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), and lung cancer,\u201d says Radford.\u201cSmoke from BBQs or grills can also trigger asthma so if you are hosting a gathering, try and get someone else to cook and stand well away from the area.\u201d6. MouldHot, damp environments like the inside of a tent can be breeding grounds for mould spores, which can grow in damp places in just 24 hours, says Radford.\u201cIf you are allergic to mould, this can cause symptoms like coughing, wheezing or sneezing. In those with asthma, it could trigger asthma symptoms. Exposure to mould can also cause an allergy or hypersensitivity to it, or a fungal infection within the lungs.\u201dRecommendedImposter syndrome \u2013 what is it and why does Kim Kardashian have it?The best TV shows, books and podcasts about WindrushHow can I be a better ally to trans people right now?So if you are going camping this summer and do notice mould or a damp and musty smell in your tent or on sleeping bags, make sure it\u2019s removed and they\u2019re fully dried and aired afterwards.For more information on how to stay safe with a lung condition visit asthmaandlung.org.uk or call the Asthma + Lung UK helpline on: 0300 222 5800."}, {"_id": "64940d4c51ac334f3a315fec", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/the-union-rye-restaurant-review-b2360711.html", "primaryCategory": "Food and Drink", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Union Rye, review: Finally, a decent restaurant in East Sussex", "lead": "<p>Awash with independent shops and eateries, Rye is a place close to Kate Ng\u2019s heart.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe town of Rye is one of my happy places. I go there at least once or twice a year to visit in-laws and its charm never fails to make me smile. It\u2019s all twisting alleys and cobblestone and centuries-old houses. Retail and restaurant chains haven\u2019t got the same hold here as they do in every other town in the UK \u2013 there\u2019s a Boots and a Waterstones, but no Primark, H&M, Pret or Caff\u00e9 Nero. There isn\u2019t even a Costa.It\u2019s a place that takes pride in its independent shops and restaurants. Some are quirky \u2013 a shop that sells antique French confit pots for hundreds of pounds, for example, or a pub called the Waterworks that renovated and refurbished the old, unused public toilets and now sells local beers and ciders. It\u2019s very historic, too; the oldest hotel, The Mermaid Inn, was built in 1156 and is said to be haunted. I\u2019m inclined to agree as my partner and I received a phone call just after falling asleep during our one night there, but no one was on the other side. Spooky indeed. But I\u2019ve always thought there was one thing that the town desperately needed: a Nice Restaurant.Before Covid brought the restaurant industry to its knees, there used to be a family-owned Italian, Tuscan Kitchen. I never got the chance to visit for one reason or another, but my in-laws sang its praises all the time. But a couple of years ago, it closed when the family packed up and went back to Italy, understandably tired of life in the UK. Since then, the only other place to go if you didn\u2019t want to cook and you didn\u2019t want fish and chips has been Mahdi Lounge. It\u2019s good, but the town has been gasping for something different.RecommendedForest Side: Heavenly Cumbrian produce elevated to Michelin-starred proportionsPapi: Pandemic troublemakers\u2019 restaurant is a fun, flirty hitI tried the food at Idris Elba\u2019s restaurant \u2013 he should stick to wineThen came The Union Rye. Previously The Union Steakhouse, the restaurant was taken over by Rajh Siva, who also runs The Plough, located closer to Winchelsea, and has since overhauled the menu to focus on modern British cuisine. The building was built in 1401 and is a rustic, relaxed space with cosy open fireplaces, exposed brick and wooden furniture. The warm and welcoming restaurant is headed by chef Ben Dafforn, previously of J Sheekey and Simpsons on the Strand in London.I visited The Union Rye recently while on a weekend away with friends, excited at the prospect of trying a new Nice Restaurant in my favourite small British town. I was first alerted to its existence by Marina O\u2019Loughlin, former restaurant critic for The Times, and had been keen to try it for months. The four of us swept in on a Sunday night, and while it was rather empty, we hardly minded \u2013 it almost felt like having the entire restaurant to ourselves. Though I hope being empty at dinnertime won\u2019t be an issue for it for much longer, as it truly deserves a visit.Resisting the urge to order the entire menu, we opted for lots of dishes to share. The seasonal menu changes on a daily basis as the chefs work with whatever fresh local produce is available, but this is exciting for me as it means trying new dishes and flavours each time I go. We started with marinated anchovies with caper berries that were simultaneously fresh, sweet and tart, and got very into a plate of ham knuckle croquettes that were fatty and rich, accompanied by a creamy aioli.We also had a rather unusual sweet and savoury granola dish, which comprised of cottage cheese-like curds with granola flavoured with fennel seeds and a jam to cut through the almost bitter, herby flavours. It was imaginative and surprising, which I took great pleasure in. Large fried sardines arrived with their heads still intact, opaque eyes and all, to be covered in burnt lemon. Fat, juicy scallops and their bright orange tongues with samphire on toast. Fried, caramelised mushrooms with hazelnuts and plenty of butter. A succulent pork chop with syrupy charred fruit. A burnt basque cheesecake to share among friends. Oh, how we feasted.The Union Rye is the Nice Restaurant that the town deserves. The dishes are bright and refreshing, but comforting at the same time. I highly recommend going with a group of family or friends so you can order plenty of dishes. It was certainly a night to remember, and I\u2019ll be back there soon, I\u2019m sure.The Union Rye, 8 East Street Rye, East Sussex, TN31 7JY | 01797 229289 | www.theunionrye.co.uk"}, {"_id": "64940d4d51ac334f3a315fed", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/hilaria-baldwin-amy-schumer-accent-spanish-b2361905.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hilaria Baldwin addresses \u2018cruel\u2019 critics after Amy Schumer mocked her \u2018pretend\u2019 Spanish heritage", "lead": "<p>Comedian poked fun at Baldwin\u2019s accent in her new Netflix special,  \u2018Amy Schumer: Emergency Contact\u2019 </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 20:44:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:53.254308", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T20:44:55+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/21/hilaria%20baldwin%20amy%20schumer.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She explained how some critics have taken things too far, such as allegedly filing a false report with the New York City Department of Health, pretending to be Hilaria and claiming she had leopards in her home.Speaking to the outlet, Hilaria revealed that she hired a private investigator to disclose the real identities of some of her critics on Reddit. While the former yoga instructor doesn\u2019t plan on exposing her findings, she said it makes her feel better to know that her haters are \u201clonely, lost people\u201d.In the new Netflix comedy special Amy Schumer: Emergency Contact, which debuted on 13 June, the Trainwreck star can be seen asking the audience if they know who Hilaria, the wife of Alec Baldwin, is, before pronouncing her name in a Spanish accent.RecommendedAmy Schumer ruthlessly mocks Hilaria Baldwin for \u2018pretend\u2019 Spanish heritageA timeline of Alec and Hilaria Baldwin\u2019s relationship: From tying the knot to welcoming seven childrenAlec Baldwin criticised over \u2018shallow\u2019 request for fans to follow wife Hilaria on Instagram for her birthdaySchumer explained how she first met the yoga instructor \u201cyears ago\u201d while backstage at Saturday Night Live.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRegulators in the United States have approved the sale of chicken made from cultivated cells, marking a huge step for the nation\u2019s first \u201clab-grown\u201d meat.The move comes after Good Meat, a developer of chicken grown from animal cells, announced in March 2023 that it had received a \u201cno-questions\u201d letter from the Food and Drug Administration, which indicated the FDA was satisfied that the product was safe to sell, according to CNN.Upside Foods, another company that makes chicken using cultured cells, received a similar letter from the FDA in November, the outlet reported. At the time, Dr Uma Valeti, the founder and CEO of Upside Foods, called the approval a \u201cwatershed moment,\u201d noting it\u2019s \u201cnever happened before in the history of humanity\u201d.However, before the lab-grown meat could be made available to US consumers, it required approval from the US Department of Agriculture.With Tuesday\u2019s approval by the Agriculture Department of federal inspections required to sell meat and poultry in the US, the two California companies will be able to make the lab-grown chicken available to restaurants and, later, to supermarkets.RecommendedLab-grown meat is worse than real thing for climate. But will it always remain that way?Company creates mammoth meatballs using DNA from extinct animalLab-grown meat takes one step closer to hitting supermarket shelvesThe goal of lab-grown meat is both to eliminate harm to animals and to reduce the enivornmental impacts of traditional animal agriculture. \u201cInstead of all of that land and all of that water that\u2019s used to feed all of these animals that are slaughtered, we can do it in a different way,\u201d said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and chief executive of Eat Just, which operates Good Meat.The cultivated meat is made using cells from a living animal and grown in steel tanks. Upside\u2019s lab-grown meat, which is made using cells from live animals that have been chosen as being the most likely to taste good and reproduce quickly, first comes out in large sheets, before it is then formed into recognisable chicken shapes. Good Meat turns the chicken cells, which are created from a master cell bank formed from a commercially available chicken cell line, into cutlets, nuggets, shredded meat and satays. Good Meat\u2019s chicken is already available in Singapore, the first country to allow the sale of lab-grown meat. As for when individuals living in the US can expect to see the meat in grocery stores, it will likely be some time, as the lab-grown chicken is more expensive than traditional meat, and cannot yet be produced on the same scale, according to Ricardo San Martin, director of the Alt:Meat Lab at University of California Berkeley.According to Upside, its Emeryville facility can produce up to 50,000 pounds of cultivated meat products a year, though the goal is to expand to 400,000 pounds per year, which is significantly less than the 50 billion pounds of chicken produced by the US each year. However, those eager to try the cell-cultivated meat will be able to do so in certain restaurants, with Upside partnering with San Francisco restuarant Bar Crenn to make the meat available to consumers, while dishes made with Good Meat will be served at Chef Jose Andr\u00e9s\u2019 restaurant in Washington, DC.According to Amy Chen, Upside\u2019s chief operating officer, the most common response the company has gotten from people who have tried the meat is that it \u201ctastes like chicken\u201d. But not everyone is on board with trying lab-grown meat just yet, with Chen noting that the company is aware of the \u201cick factor\u201d its product is often met with. A recent poll conducted by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also found hesitancy among Americans to try meat made in a lab, with half of US adults revealing that they are unlikely to try meat grown using animal cells.According to the poll, the majority of respondents said their reluctance stemmed from a belief that the lab-grown meat \u201cjust sounds weird,\u201d while half said they worried the cell-cultivated meat wouldn\u2019t be safe.On social media, the reaction to the news that lab-cultivated chicken will soon be available in the US has been divided, with some open to trying the meat, while others have expressed their reluctance to try the product.\u201cIf it tastes like chicken and cooks like chicken, I\u2019m for it,\u201d one person tweeted, while another described the approval as \u201cpretty cool\u201d.RecommendedThe ultimate (and speedy) butter chicken recipeFeeling lazy at lunch?

For the tarka: This blend uses whole spices; simply mix the seeds together and store in a jar for when you need them.2. For the garam masala: Put any whole spices into a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar. Grind. Then add in any powdered ingredients and mix by hand to combine. Label and store in a clean jar in a cool, dark place for up to six months.3. For the harissa: Put any whole spices into your coffee grinder or pestle and mortar. Grind to your desired consistency. Then add in any powdered ingredients and your chilli flakes, garlic granules and salt. Mix by hand to combine. Label and store in a clean jar in a cool, dark place for up to six months.4. For the time-saving ginger-garlic: Peel and roughly chop your ginger and garlic and add to your blender with the salt and oil. Blend until you have a smooth paste. Either scoop into a clean jar or bottle and store in the fridge or freeze in ice-cube trays and pop out a cube when you need to cook.5. For the butter chicken: First make the marinade by combining all the ingredients in a large, non-metallic bowl. Add the chicken and give everything a good stir to combine. Cover and leave in the fridge overnight if you can, or for at least two hours to permeate the meat.6. When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chicken pieces with the marinade, and fry until browned, turning just once and resisting the urge to move them around the pan. They will need about three minutes on each side (you will finish cooking the chicken later in the sauce). Set aside.7. Give the pan a quick wipe and put it back over the heat. Add the ghee and, when hot, add the tarka and allow the seeds to sizzle and pop for around 30 seconds, being careful not to burn. Next, add in your onion slices and stir to coat them in the spice-infused ghee. Cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Once the onions have started to sweat and become translucent, add in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for about a minute. When the raw smell has disappeared, add in the garam masala. Cook for a further 10 seconds, stirring to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan and burns.8. Next, add the tomatoes, harissa and salt. Cook over a low-medium heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool a little, then, using a stick blender directly into the pan, carefully blend your sauce until it is completely smooth. If you\u2019re finding the sauce is splattering around too much, transfer it into a deeper pan for this step. You can also stir in a little water if the mixture is too thick.RecommendedThese are the viral TikTok recipes you have to make this Father\u2019s DayEddie Huang: \u2018I\u2019ll never eat at BAO London \u2013 I know mine\u2019s better\u2019Chef says \u2018don\u2019t get hung up on authenticity \u2013 it\u2019s unachievable\u20199.

That\u2019s before there\u2019s any mention of the amount of waste each used cartridge can amount to.That\u2019s where the Epson EcoTank ET-2820 All-in-One Wireless Inkjet Printer (Was \u00a3209.99, now \u00a3179.99, Currys.co.uk) comes in. Featuring Epson\u2019s EcoTank technology, The et-2820 replaces proprietary plastic cartridges with refillable ink tanks that can have a serious saving on your printing costs while still being able to print, all without the added hassle of cartridge reloads.Save up to 90 per cent on your printing costsRefilling printer ink can be a fiddly and messy process, not to mention the added difficulty of where to responsibly dispose used cartridges once they have been depleted. EcoTank technology means that each tank can be individually topped up from a bottle, which not only saves on the amount of plastic used per refill but also significantly reduces the cost of ink. It\u2019s no small bonus that as an inkjet, EcoTank has a positive impact on your energy bills as well, particularly compared to more energy-intensive laser printers.Each printer comes bundled with four refillable bottles \u2013 one for each tank \u2013 which provides up to three years worth of printing, or 7,500 colour pages to be more precise. Ink levels are also clearly displayed in transparent containers at the front of the printer, so there\u2019s no need for second guessing when the ink might run dry midway through a printing job.When you do eventually make it through each bottle, they can simply be disposed of with household recycling, so there\u2019s no need to plan a trip to your local recycling point or feel a pang of guilt for throwing it out with your household waste.No more messy cartridges (Currys)The \u201cjust fill and chill\u201d mentality, courtesy of none other than Usain Bolt, Epson\u2019s brand ambassador, is central to the EcoTank experience that places convenience and affordability at its centre, while still able to print up to ten pages per minute.It\u2019s why the ET-2820 is designed with the busy household in mind. Whether that\u2019s transferring documents from your hybrid office or printing off homework assignments, its all-in-one scanning, printing and copying capabilities make it well suited to a variety of different tasks all around the home, from the comfort of your smart device or the printer\u2019s 3.7cm LCD display.The Epson Smart Panel app enables you to control your printer with great ease.

The actor\u2019s transformation is the result of more than a decade of hard work, after he reportedly started working on his health back in 2007.In a new interview with Rolling Stone published on 17 June, Goodman revealed that he has lost a total of 200 pounds, ever since he first revealed to David Letterman in 2011 that he was \u201cpushing 400\u201d pounds when he was at his heaviest. \u201cI\u2019d get off of Roseanne every spring. I\u2019d lose 60 pounds every spring [but] I\u2019d gain it back and then some, every year,\u201d he told the late-night host at the time.At the start of his journey, Goodman hired health coach Mackie Shilstone who helped him to give up sugar and work out six days a week. The actor, who\u2019s been open about his struggles with alcoholism in the past, also stopped drinking after checking into a rehabilitation center in 2007.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Gates at Worthy Farm to open today as new \u2018secret set\u2019 announcedExtraction 2 viewers spot \u2018ridiculous\u2019 blunder in Chris Hemsworth sequel\u2018What in the wingardium leviosa?\u2019: Emma Watson shocks fans with \u2018levitating\u2019 dress\u201cIt takes a lot of creative energy to sit on your a** and figure out what you\u2019re going to eat next,\u201d he said in an interview with People in 2010. \u201cI wanted to live life better.\u201dFive years later, Goodman\u2019s health coach revealed to the New York Post that the Roseanne star had lost 100 pounds through a combination of diet and exercise.

You\u2019re shaving in the mirror and you don\u2019t want to look at yourself. It gets dangerous,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Peter Travers in 2016.Goodman also explained that his weight loss journey was made easier after he \u201cjust stopped eating all the time\u201d.Actor says weight loss was a combination of diet and exercise over the course of a decade  (AFP via Getty Images)\u201cI\u2019d have a handful of food and it\u2019d go to my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the old days, I would take three months out, lose 60 or 70 pounds, and then reward myself with a six-pack of Bud or whatever and just go back to my old habits.\u201d\u201cThen this time I wanted to do it slowly, move, exercise.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s the ideal time to pick up a new Xbox console to make the most of what those new titles have to offer.But investing in a new gaming device can be a costly endeavour, having to pay upfront for a console before any new games can be factored into that equation means that it can get prohibitively expensive.But picking up a new Xbox no longer has to be a daunting purchase, as customers can spread the cost through Xbox All Access at GAME.Xbox All Access allows new players to pick up either an Xbox Series X (\u00a3449.99, Game.co.uk) or an Xbox Series S (\u00a3249.99, Game.co.uk) from \u00a320.99 a month over 24 months, with zero per cent APR, no upfront cost and no additional cost compared to purchasing equivalent products outright.Not only that, it also includes a Game Pass Ultimate subscription (worth \u00a310.99 a month) for the duration of the 24 months period, Game.co.uk. Xbox Game Pass works much like a typical subscription service but instead of streaming films and shows, it allows players to play over 100 titles ranging from reimagined classics such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection to popular new releases like Minecraft Legends that the whole family can enjoy, all at no extra cost.Other Microsoft-exclusive titles, such as Forza Horizon 5 and the upcoming sci-fi role-playing game Starfield, are also regularly added to the service as soon as they are released, meaning that there\u2019s always new titles to play on a monthly basis. Those games aren\u2019t limited to your new Xbox either. Select titles can also be played across PC, console, mobile and tablet devices as well.So which console is right for you?

As Finn, a spokesperson for The LGBT Foundation says: \u201cAllyship is a year-long activity, and requires work.\u201dSo, whether it\u2019s everyday life, at work or among friends and family, where can you start?Proactive learningGina Battye, a psychological safety consultant and trainer who\u2019s done a lot of work on supporting LGBTQIA+ communities in the workplace, runs workshops levelled towards supporting people from any marginalised group. \u201cI tend to talk about four key areas: learning, support, visibility, and celebrate,\u201d she says.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThis might start with curiosity \u2013 for example, asking some well-intentioned questions if a colleague comes out to you as trans \u2013 but Battye says it\u2019s important to do your own learning too.\u201cBe proactive,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t rely on your LGBT-plus colleagues, friends and peers to educate you. You could start off by reading things like company policies and procedures at work. You could raise your awareness of your own unconscious biases and explore strategies to reduce or eliminate those. Watch films and documentaries, listen to podcasts, attend events, webinars, seminars focused on inclusion or allyship.\u201dGet informedAby Hawker, founder of TransMission PR, a communications consultancy specialising in trans and non-binary inclusion and awareness, also believes educating yourself is important \u2013 especially when it comes to learning about issues and challenges surrounding the community.\u201cTrans people represent 1% of the population. They are a marginalised community being disproportionately targeted by some very loud voices in order to stoke hatred and division,\u201d says Hawker, who started a \u2018TransAlly365\u2019 campaign on TikTok this year, posting daily tips.\u201cAnd there are loads of other resources to help,\u201d she adds. \u201cSubscribe to QueerAF, a media outlet dedicated to changing the narrative and championing queer talent.

Ask them questions like: what do you experience at work or socially, or when you\u2019re on public transport or on holiday \u2013 that kind of thing. And then ask: what can I do to help and support you? Super simple questions most people don\u2019t ask.\u201dBe mindful of what you\u2019re asking too. \u201cI have a general rule of thumb: If you wouldn\u2019t ask your grandma that question, don\u2019t ask [an LGBTQ+ person] it!\u201d Battye adds. \u201cYou get the idea. Don\u2019t ask questions that you wouldn\u2019t also ask somebody who is heterosexual or cisgender.\u201dJust listenFinn says: \u201cListen to trans and non-binary people\u2019s experiences without questioning them, particularly if they are reporting transphobia or discrimination. We are the experts of our own experience and can tell the difference between problematic discrimination vs good-faith questions.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to fully understand someone\u2019s identity to respect it, including using a person\u2019s correct pronouns. If someone tells you the language they use to talk about themselves and their experience of gender, use it.\u201dAnd if you accidentally say the wrong thing? \u201cApologise quickly and move on,\u201d adds Finn. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make it a big deal!\u201dSpeaking upYou can also show support by being \u201cwilling to have conversations with those around you to educate them on issues and challenges and how to be supportive\u201d, Battye adds. \u201cYou can start by just sharing the information you\u2019re learning, that\u2019s quite an easy thing to do.\u201cAnother thing is being aware of non-inclusive behaviours in conversations. If you hear or see other people being exclusive, if it\u2019s safe and you\u2019re comfortable to do so, then speak up. It might be as simple as saying something like, \u2018You know what, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate\u2019, or \u2018I don\u2019t think we should be talking in this way, maybe we should change the conversation\u2019.\u201dBattye says speaking with people privately is better than calling them out in front of others. \u201cDon\u2019t do it publicly \u2013 take them to one side and just have a conversation about why it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about what they\u2019ve been talking about. They might not realise, first of all, but also it can be really embarrassing and can go against what you\u2019re trying to do if you do it publicly.\u201dAnd if it\u2019s yourself being non-inclusive: \u201cApologise, correct yourself, and continue with the conversation,\u201d Battye adds. \u201cDon\u2019t dig a hole and continue to get yourself in it!\u201dHave a think afterwards about what that experience is showing you \u2013 is there a bias or privilege you need to be more aware of? \u201cDo that inner work to make sure you\u2019re not continuously making the same mistake,\u201d she says.Visibility and celebrationRecommendedThe wild and wonderful hats of Royal Ascot 2023King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at first Royal Ascot in their new rolesPrince William to celebrate first birthday as Prince of Wales as he turns 41Visibility is about \u201csignalling that you are an ally\u201d, says Battye. There are lots of ways you can do this in work and education settings \u2013 such as adding pronouns to email signatures, wearing inclusive badges and lanyards. You could attend network and community events to actively show support.Finally, celebrating \u2013 find out about important holidays, awareness events, anniversaries etc. \u201cThis is the bit most people do without doing the other bits, which can get quite frustrating at times!\u201d says Battye. \u201cBut certainly celebrate with your colleagues [and friends].\u201d"}, {"_id": "64940d5351ac334f3a316003", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/next-management-model-esmeralda-seay-reynolds-b2361179.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Whistleblower ex-model claims agent once told her to swallow cotton balls to suppress her appetite", "lead": "<p>Former fashion model worked for the agency as a teen </p>", "author": "Amber Raiken", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:20:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:58:59.386088", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T09:20:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/21/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

This isn\u2019t the first time that Seay-Reynolds has spoken candidly about her experiences in the modelling industry. During an interview with Real Women/Real Stories in December 2021, she recalled how her career as a teen model felt like an \u201cinsane whirlwind\u201d.\u201cLooking back, I was very young. For me, as a person who is very competitive and used to working very hard, to work really hard and have it not come to anything is very frustrating,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think I felt like my body was the one thing I could control, so I just sort of went crazy.\u201dShe then revealed that by the age of 17, she started to have some health struggles, including a seizure and liver failure. She also noted that she was struggling with an eating disorder. From there, she said that she left this career behind.\u201cMy agents actually pulled me out of modelling so that I could gain weight because people were complaining that I wasn\u2019t fitting in the clothes and I looked too \u2018vascular,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very bad.

She will die.\u2019\u201d (Getty Images)She went on to explain that during the next day of the photoshoot, she had to lay on frozen lava beds in the snow, before going to one of the hot springs in Iceland. She described the pain that she felt when walking towards the hot spring and how the photographer allegedly handled it.\u201cIf you step on one, it will melt your flesh off. So, you have to stay on this marked path for safety. But he says, \u2018Get off the path. And watch your footing,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou\u2019re told to do it, and you do it. And he is the adult, he is in charge.\u201dSeay-Reynolds said that for another part of the photo shoot, she noticed a large hole with a \u201cDanger. Do Not Enter\u201d sign on it. She alleged that the photographer removed the sign before they headed into a cave, which had stalagmites stretching across the floor of it. She described how her safety and career were at risk, after climbing over to one spot to pose with a fellow model. \u201cIce that will rip right through you if you slip,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no help, no medic. If you don\u2019t do what they say, they will blacklist you. And that not only will eff up your future career, but everything that you\u2019ve done and suffered up until that point will mean nothing.\u201dShe noted that when she returned to the United States, she complained about the photographer to her agents, who allegedly responded by saying: \u201cYeah, he\u2019s known for this.\u201d Seay-Reynolds, who was 17 at the time of this photoshoot, also claimed to Variety that she was never paid for the 18-hour days of work.When asked to comment on the photo shoot, Wilkenfeld said: \u201cWhen we send models to photo shoots, we vet the people, and we hope that that model would call us if they were exposed to conditions such as this. The unfortunate part is we\u2019re not on every shoot.\u201dThe photographer and producer also spoke to Variety about the photo shoot, with claims that the work conditions were safe. The photographer also alleged that Seay-Reynolds wasn\u2019t eating during the photoshoot and contacted NEXT management about his concerns. He also said that he was \u201cupset\u201d with the agency for sending a model who appeared to have struggles with an eating disorder to the photo shoot, especially as it was a destination project. This isn\u2019t the first time that Seay-Reynolds has spoken candidly about her experiences in the modelling industry. During an interview with Real Women/Real Stories in December 2021, she recalled how her career as a teen model felt like an \u201cinsane whirlwind\u201d.\u201cLooking back, I was very young. For me, as a person who is very competitive and used to working very hard, to work really hard and have it not come to anything is very frustrating,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think I felt like my body was the one thing I could control, so I just sort of went crazy.\u201dShe then revealed that by the age of 17, she started to have some health struggles, including a seizure and liver failure. She also noted that she was struggling with an eating disorder. From there, she said that she left this career behind.\u201cMy agents actually pulled me out of modelling so that I could gain weight because people were complaining that I wasn\u2019t fitting in the clothes and I looked too \u2018vascular,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very bad. I quit modelling not just because of that but the stress was just immense.\u201dRecommendedHow to make Eton mess with strawberries and black pepperCelebrity chef bans vegans from his restaurant after a negative review Italian waiter refuses to serve woman her cappuccino until she finishes pastaSeay-Reynolds said that she later checked herself into Evergreen Eating Disorder Recovery Center in Denver, Colorado.
