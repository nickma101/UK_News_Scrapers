\u201cinfluence\u201d how MPs might vote.No 10 said the Prime Minister\u2019s schedule on Monday \u201cdoesn\u2019t include attending Parliament\u201d and that he has commitments he \u201ccan\u2019t move\u201d.The cross-party committee concluded that Mr Johnson, who quit as an MP and labelled the probe a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d after being told in advance of its findings, should have faced a 90-day suspension for misleading the House when he told the Commons that Covid rules were obeyed in No 10 despite parties taking place.It also recommended banning the ex-premier from receiving a pass to access Parliament which is usually available to former MPs.It is not clear whether there will ultimately be a vote on the conclusions of the report, which could go through on the nod unless there are objections from Mr Johnson\u2019s supporters.The former prime minister was urging his allies not to oppose it, arguing that the sanctions have no practical effect, although critics argue that the level of support shown for him would have been very low anyway.Mr Johnson and his loyalists have sought to discredit the committee\u2019s inquiry, including by accusing its chairwoman, veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, of holding \u201cprejudicial views\u201d.But during the debate, Ms Harman said the Government gave her assurances that she would not be seen as biased in her judgment of Mr Johnson.After Tory former minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg highlighted her tweets criticising the ex-prime minister, Ms Harman said she told the Government she was \u201cmore than happy to step aside\u201d.\u201cI was assured that I should continue the work that the House had mandated with the appointment that the House had put me into and so I did just that,\u201d she added.Mrs May said she accepted the committee\u2019s findings and commended its members \u201cfor their painstaking work, and for their dignity in the face of slurs on their integrity\u201d.\u201cThe decision of the House on this report is important.\u201cIt is important to show the public that there is not one rule for them and another for us,\u201d she said.\u201cFollowing an unsettling period in our political life, support for the report of the Privileges Committee will be a small but important step in restoring people\u2019s trust in members of this House and of Parliament.\u201cAnd I also say to members of my own party that it is doubly important for us to show that we are prepared to act when one of our own, however senior, is found wanting.\u201cI will vote in favour of the report by the Privileges Committee, I urge all members of this House to do so \u2013 to uphold standards in public life, to show that we all recognise the responsibility we have to the people we serve and to help to restore faith in our parliamentary democracy.\u201dConservative MPs will be given a free vote, but allies of Mr Johnson warned they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.Mr Sunak has claimed his reticence about publicising his view on the report\u2019s conclusions is because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to influence anyone in advance\u201d of the potential vote.But publicly backing the report and its sanctions could risk deepening the Tory civil war between Johnson loyalists and his own administration.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said he had afternoon meetings on Monday, including hosting his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, before attending a dinner in the evening.Pressed repeatedly on whether Mr Sunak could make an appearance in the Commons, the official said: \u201cCurrently you\u2019ve got his schedule for today, which doesn\u2019t include attending Parliament.\u201dThe Prime Minister told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain the committee had carried out its work \u201cthoroughly\u201d and that he respected the Tory majority-panel.He added: \u201cIt will be up to each and every individual MP to make a decision of what they want to do when the time comes.\u201cIt\u2019s important the Government doesn\u2019t get involved in that because it is a matter for Parliament and members as individuals, not as members (of) Government.\u201dLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the programme the Prime Minister should participate if there is a Commons vote, saying: \u201cHe should show leadership \u2013 come along, get in the lobby, and show us where he stands on this.\u201dLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cRefusing to back this motion would be an insult to bereaved families who grieved alone while Johnson lied and partied.\u201cThe buck stops at the very top of Government, if Rishi Sunak really wanted to govern with integrity he shouldn\u2019t be running scared of this vote.\u201dIt came as the Metropolitan Police confirmed they were reviewing new material in relation to a Christmas party held at Conservative Campaign Headquarters during the height of the pandemic in December 2020.Tory activists were invited to what was described as a \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d party, according to the BBC, despite members of the public being banned

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCoronation Street actor Michael Le Vell told the High Court it makes him \u201cfurious\u201d to think journalists were hacking into his voicemails when he was accused of sexual offences and at his \u201clowest point\u201d.The 58-year-old, who plays Kevin Webster in the long-running soap, is suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) \u2013 publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People \u2013 for damages over alleged unlawful information gathering spanning 20 years.He claims journalists at the publisher\u2019s titles were linked to phone hacking, so-called \u201cblagging\u201d or gaining information by deception and the use of private investigators for unlawful activities.MGN denies Mr Le Vell\u2019s claim, arguing there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of voicemail interception or unlawful information gathering relating to him.Mr Le Vell, who is bringing the legal action under his real name Michael Turner, gave evidence at the High Court in London on Monday \u2013 the last of the four representative claimants whose cases are being considered.The other three are the Duke of Sussex, Hollyoaks actress Nikki Sanderson and Fiona Wightman \u2013 the ex-wife of comedian Paul Whitehouse.In his witness statement, Mr Le Vell said that following his arrest in 2011 on suspicion of sexual offences \u2013 of which he was later cleared \u2013 he remembered seeing an article about the arrest and \u201cwondering how the press got hold of this information\u201d.The actor said: \u201cThis was an incredibly difficult period of my life, and the only people I was confiding in at the time were my close friends and family.\u201cI remember at the time looking at my friends and wondering who had leaked this information which was incredibly upsetting. I was blaming every Tom, Dick and Harry for what I thought were leaks to the newspapers.\u201cThis caused me huge distress at the time, as I was so worried that the newspaper articles were causing damage to my reputation and prejudicing my defence to a very serious charge.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo find out that, as my world was falling apart, MGN\u2019s journalists and photographers were falling over themselves to dig up information and photographs about me makes me furious.\u201cKnowing what I know now, I think it is absolutely disgusting that MGN\u2019s journalists were hacking into my voicemail messages as such a traumatic time in my life.\u201cIt represents a total invasion of my privacy. It makes me so angry.\u201cWhilst ITV were brilliant at supporting me, I was at my lowest point. The defendant only wanted to capitalise on this.\u201dMr Le Vell also said he became an unofficial \u201ccast rep\u201d on Coronation Street who would act as a \u201cgo-between\u201d for the management and the cast, and was \u201cprivy to a huge amount of personal information\u201d about co-stars.He said that when articles appeared in the press about other cast members, \u201ceverybody was pointing the finger\u201d at him and he was considered the \u201cCorrie mole\u201d for a while.The actor said \u201clots of relationships were damaged\u201d by this, adding: \u201cSo many of my professional relationships cooled after this.\u201cWhilst most people know the truth now, the defendant\u2019s actions caused irreversible damage to a lot of my friendships at the time, as well as damage to my reputation.\u201cI also became extremely paranoid about stories coming out and blamed innocent people close to me.\u201cI didn\u2019t know who I could trust. I did the same things to my friends in the pub that my co-stars did to me.\u201cI thought that only they knew the information and had leaked it to the press. I am guilty of the same thing to my friends.\u201cI treated them with immense suspicion, and eventually abandoned my local pub as I felt so paranoid. I now deeply regret this.\u201dHe also said in his statement he is a very private person and that he did not want to come to London, but wants to see \u201cjustice done for the injustices done by the defendant in the past\u201d.He added: \u201cThe whole thing is frustrating, annoying and needless.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be reopening my private life ,but have been forced to relive the past again throughout the course of this litigation.\u201cI have had my fair share of the courts already, and am annoyed that I may be required to go to court again as the defendant is being unreasonable and refusing to engage sensibly with my claim.\u201cI feel that they are wasting everybody\u2019s time. They know they have done wrong, and I cannot understand why they are unable to hold their hands up and admit it.\u201cHaving revisited all this material again, I have decided that I want my day in court.\u201cI need an acknowledgment from MGN that it has had a huge impact on my life and needs to face up to what it has done.\u201dDuring cross-examination by Richard Munden, for MGN, the actor was asked why he had compared being a mole to being a sex offender in his witness statement, and said he had made that comparison before he was charged.Mr Le Vell added that being a mole \u201cwas one of the worst things you could do in our business\u201d.He added: \u201cIf there\u2019s no trust, then there\u2019s nothing there.\u201cFor Craig Charles to come up to me and accuse me of being a mole, it was mortifying.\u201dAsked again about the suggestion that being a mole was worse than being a sex offender, Mr Turner said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not.\u201dMr Le Vell\u2019s case relates to 28 articles published in MGN titles between 1991 and 2011.The court also heard evidence from David Seymour, a former political editor of the Mirror, who said he had \u201cwitnessed the work and behaviour\u201d of the newspaper\u2019s former editor Piers Morgan and regarded him as \u201cunreliable and boastful who was apt to tell untruths when it suited him\u201d.Mr Seymour said in a witness statement that he had also witnessed Mr Morgan\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in relation to an incident relating to phone hacking\u201d.He referred to a 2006 Daily Mail article written by Mr Morgan in which he said he was played a tape of a message left by Sir Paul McCartney to Heather Mills towards the end of their marriage, in which he said the former Beatle sang We Can Work It Out into the phone.Mr Seymour said in his statement: \u201cWhat I know about this episode was that I was walking through the newsroom one day, I assume this was in March 2001, and Piers Morgan was standing in the middle with a group of reporters around him.\u201cHe was holding a tape machine and was very jolly.

So, if you phoned up about your neighbour from three years ago, we\u2019re not going to reopen that. But clearly cases that are particularly serious, particularly concerning, we will do.\u201cAs people know, that case has been previously looked at based on a photo. It\u2019s very obvious a video tells a much richer, clearer story than a photo.\u201dHe also told the podcast: \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve taken account of in the past, of course, has been those involved in sort of setting the law and setting the policy being an aggravating feature, for example.\u201dMr Bailey had reportedly left the gathering when the video was taken and has previously apologised for his involvement.Opposition leader Sir Keir, who has ruled out submitting his own resignation honours if he becomes premier, said it was an \u201copen matter\u201d as to whether the Tory figures should be stripped of their Lords\u2019 seat and gong respectively.He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think they should be getting honours.\u201cI think the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, should have said no.

They had been in an Airbnb property and had been visited by strippers, they had then gone out to the bars in the Brighton area.\u201cIn July 2021, social distancing was still in place \u2013 many bars were not open or had closed early.\u201cThe group had been in the course of looking for somewhere to drink, met the group containing [the alleged victim] and indicated they were looking for somewhere to drink. The defendant and his group were complaining about the lack of choice.\u201c[The alleged victim] suggested that the bars in the beach area might still be open. The two groups ended up walking to the seafront together.\u201cAs they moved forward they were chatting, the defendant\u2019s group were unfamiliar with the Brighton area.\u201cAs the interaction between the groups continued you will see, because police obtained CCTV, [the alleged victim] was helping them, she was being friendly.\u201cAt various points she shares a bottle of wine with the defendant and one of his friends. At various points she hugs the defendant and one of his friends.\u201cThere\u2019s a point that she and the defendant hold hands then stop and continue walking separately.\u201dThe defendant and the woman then go to the seafront. In the alleged victim\u2019s police interview she told officers Knight wanted to go into the sea and she did not wish to but he persuaded her telling her \u201cit was his stag night, he was meant to be having fun but it was turning into a rubbish night\u201d, Miss Syed added.The defendant looked like he was going to cry, the prosecution told the jury, so the woman said yes and took off her dress as she did not want it to get wet.Knight moved behind the woman in the water then moved her underwear and that is when the alleged sexual activity took place, Ms Syed said.The woman asked the defendant \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d and said \u201cstop\u201d and he did not reply, she said in her police interview.\u201cI said you\u2019re getting married in two weeks, just stop, don\u2019t do that, and he just didn\u2019t stop,\u201d the prosecution said reading from the woman\u2019s police interview.The prosecution said the woman was then raped. The woman said during the interview she said \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d to the defendant and she did not move, she said she thought she was in shock.The woman said the defendant then got out of the water, then the woman got out, put her dress back on and went to sit by a friend.She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything and then the guy who I was in the sea with, his friend came over to me and said \u2018oh Larry, Larry wants me to tell you that he\u2019s sorry, Larry wants to say like, sorry\u2019.\u201cI didn\u2019t look up at him, I didn\u2019t want to engage with any of them.\u201dThe woman said she then told her friend what happened and called 999, the prosecution added.Knight was arrested on July 28 2021 and provided a prepared statement in which he said the woman was being \u201cflirtatious with all of them\u201d. He said she suggested they go into the sea and said she reached behind and touched his genitals and said he did not penetrate her.The defendant returned for a second interview on January 5 2022 and provided another prepared statement saying he moved her underwear and it was consensual, but then she said \u201caren\u2019t you getting married\u201d and he stopped.The prosecution said the defendant \u201ctook advantage of this young woman who was clearly in drink\u201d.Knight, of Albert Road, Leyton, Waltham Forest, east London, who the Met said has been suspended from duty, is on trial at Southwark Crown Court where he denies charges of rape and sexual assault.The trial continues."}, {"_id": "64909b2d51ac33155408ceb0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/covid-david-cameron-pandemic-flu-b2360203.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Covid inquiry: David Cameron defends austerity \u2013 but admits weakness in preparing for pandemic", "lead": "<p>The Trades Union Congress said David Cameron is \u2018in denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies\u2019 </p>", "author": "Sam Blewett and Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:03:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:09.801377", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:03:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/12/b521a7618c475b922117c2a7911299d3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjU4MzMz-2.72672577.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The former prime minister faced an hour-long grilling as he became the first politician to appear before the official Covid inquiry.

He said: \u201cI think it was the right economic policy.\u201dAnd Mr Cameron added: \u201cThe real problem was time spent quizzing the experts on what potential pandemics were coming and preparing for those in the right way.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) said Mr Cameron is \u201cin denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies\u201d. \u201cThe evidence is clear that the cuts he imposed massively damaged the readiness and resilience of our public services,\u201d said general secretary Paul Nowak. But Mr Cameron said you \u201ccannot separate\u201d the need to keep government borrowing under control from the funding of the health service. \u201cIf you lose control of your debt, and you lose control of your deficit, and you use control of your economy, you end up cutting the health service,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s shadow health spokesperson Wes Streeting said the Conservatives had \u201chollowed out the NHS ahead of the pandemic\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the Conservatives didn\u2019t fix the roof when the sun was shining, they dismantled the roof and ripped up the floorboards,\u201d he added.Focusing on the failure to anticipate a coronavirus-style pandemic, Mr Cameron told the inquiry on Monday that \u201cmany consequences\u201d followed from the focus on pandemic flu rather than other respiratory illnesses.\n\nI think it was a mistake not to look more at the range of different types of pandemicDavid CameronAnd Mr Cameron added that the time spent focusing on flu during contingency planning was \u201cthe thing I keep coming back to\u201d when considering the \u201chorrors of the Covid pandemic\u201d.\u201cI think it was a mistake not to look more at the range of different types of pandemic,\u201d Mr Cameron said, giving evidence under oath.He added: \u201cMuch more time was spent on pandemic flu and the dangers of pandemic flu rather than on potential pandemics of other, more respiratory diseases, like Covid turned out to be.\u201cAnd you know, I think this is so important because so many consequences follow from that.\u201dHe said he had been \u201cwrestling with\u201d the issue, adding: \u201cBut that\u2019s where I keep coming back to is, so much time was spent on a pandemic influenza and that was seen as the greatest danger \u2013 and we had very bad years for flu so it is a big danger\u2026\u201cBut why wasn\u2019t more time and more questions asked about what turned out to be the pandemic that we faced?\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to answer why that\u2019s the case. And I\u2019m sure this public inquiry is going to spend a lot of time on that.\u201dHe was questioned on his own warning back in 2015 that the Ebola outbreak was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the emergence of a \u201cmore aggressive and more difficult to contain\u201d virus.He said that his government did look at pandemics other than flu, such as Mers and Sars.\u201cSo I think that wasn\u2019t a failing, I think the failing was not to ask more questions about asymptomatic transmission, highly infectious\u2026 what turned out to be the pandemic we had,\u201d he added.He questioned whether there had been \u201cadequate follow-up to some of the work\u201d.The inquiry heard the witness statement from Sir Oliver Letwin, who was a Cabinet Office minister from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of resilience under Mr Cameron.Sir Oliver said that \u201cin retrospect\u201d it may \u201cseem surprising\u201d that his reviews did not cover the response to pandemic flu in the UK.\u201cI now believe, however, that it might have been helpful if I had delved into the pandemic influenza risks myself,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is not because I believe such a review would have been likely to lead to any significant improvements in our preparedness for a pandemic flu itself, but rather because it might have led me to question whether we were adequately prepared to deal with the risks of forms of respiratory disease other than pandemic influenza.\u201dMr Cameron was being questioned by barrister Kate Blackwell KC rather than the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel Hugo Keith, who has said he knows the former prime minister.The first phase of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry is examining whether the UK was sufficiently prepared for the pandemic.The British Medical Association representing doctors has accused Mr Cameron and his ministers of allowing the NHS to get into a \u201cparlous state\u201d.Ahead of the hearing, council chair Professor Philip Banfield wrote: \u201cI have seen first-hand the damage wrought by years of austerity and a failure to prioritise the nation\u2019s health.\u201cThe UK was severely on the back foot when Covid took hold, and this proved disastrous \u2013 for the doctors I represent and the millions who suffered at the hands of the virus.\u201dRecommendedKing attends first Order of the Garter service of his reignBoris Johnson could avoid \u2018early retirement\u2019 with pub work, Labour MP jokes\u2018Significant number\u2019 of Durham students face delays in receiving degree resultsOn Tuesday, Mr Cameron\u2019s chancellor, George Osborne, will give evidence, as well as Sir Oliver.Current chancellor and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is due on Wednesday, as is deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden."}, {"_id": "64909b2d51ac33155408ceb1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lucy-letby-countess-of-chester-hospital-manchester-crown-court-steve-allen-cold-b2360275.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Lucy Letby trial: Nurse \u2018gaslighted\u2019 hospital staff to hide \u2018murderous assaults\u2019, court told", "lead": "<p>Nurse tried to persuade colleagues baby collapses were just \u2018run of bad luck\u2019, prosecutor says in closing speech </p>", "author": "Kim Pilling", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:58:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:09.969689", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:58:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/15/b0f9f652c738507a93815e2e726ebe98Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjcwMDk0-2.71990715.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA student died outside a bar run by the UK\u2019s biggest pub owners when an \u201cunsuitable\u201d decorative screen used to manage the queue fell and collapsed on her, a court has heard.Olivia Burt, a first year at Durham University, died of severe head injuries she sustained outside Missoula, a busy nightclub in the city centre owned by the Stonegate Pub Company, while on a night out in 2018.The firm denies four breaches of health and safety legislation.Jamie Hill KC, prosecuting for Durham County Council, told Teesside Crown Court: \u201cTragically, on the night of the seventh into the early hours of the eighth of February 2018, a 20-year-old university student called Olivia Burt lost her life as she was queuing to get into the club.\u201cShe and her friends, and others waiting to gain access, were standing next to a decorative screen which marked an area used by customers sitting outside.\u201cThis screen should not have been used as a crowd control barrier or for queue management purposes.\u201cAs the queue swelled, the press of people caused Olivia to fall through a panel in the screen and then a section of the screen fell, with other customers landing on top.\u201cOlivia\u2019s head hit the concrete pavement and the metal bar of the screen with the weight of other customers landed on her head.\u201cShe suffered an unsurvivable head injury.\u201dMr Hill said the prosecution case was that Stonegate failed to ensure Ms Burt\u2019s safety, and that of other customers, failed to properly assess risks, used inappropriate equipment and ignored danger signs.He said Missoula, in the Walkergate precinct, had two entrances and the lower, rear one was where Ms Burt was queuing to get in to the busy Wednesday night Game Over event, frequented by university sports teams.\n\nFor at least 12 months, when queues formed, students were asked to stand along the side of the decorative screen.

Nobody from the club had turned their mind to the dangersProsecutor Jamie Hill KCMs Burt, from Milford on Sea, Hampshire, was a member of the Sailing Club and social secretaries of the various sports teams would distribute wristbands to members so they could queue-jump at the back entrance, Mr Hill said.Door staff were supplied by an external company, and Mr Hill said there was \u201csome criticism\u201d of the way they managed the queues, but the legal responsibility for health and safety remained with the pub company.CCTV footage showed queues building up in the precinct after 11pm as the venue filled towards its capacity of 630, the court heard.Mr Hill said: \u201cFor at least 12 months, when queues formed, students were asked to stand along the side of the decorative screen.\n\nWe say that by bringing the decorative screen into use to direct and order the queue to the back door, the club were using it for a purpose for which it was entirely unsuitableProsecutor Jamie Hill KC\u201cNobody from Stonegate had carried out any specific risk assessment of this measure.\u201cNobody from the club had turned their mind to the dangers.\u201dA nightclub queue was different from that of a museum, he said, with some people having had a drink and at times there would be pushing and shoving, \u201cbut nothing like a football crowd\u201d.\u201cWe say that by bringing the decorative screen into use to direct and order the queue to the back door, the club were using it for a purpose for which it was entirely unsuitable,\u201d he said.\u201cAny kind of risk assessment would have made the company realise that the screen could be pushed over and someone may well be injured.\u201dAlthough the decorative screen was not suitable for crowd management, it was \u201cnevertheless heavy\u201d, Mr Hill said, and it had toppled over about half-an-hour before the fatal incident.Mr Hill said it took four people to lift it back into place.Two panels had come off it, and the structure which was \u201calready unfit for the purpose of crowd management had been further weakened\u201d, Mr Hill said.This earlier collapse of the screen was an \u201cimportant missed opportunity\u201d, the prosecution said, and students should have been moved away from it.\n\nOlivia fell through the panels, the screen went over, others fell and tragically Olivia died despite the attempts of initially students, door staff and then paramedics, nothing could be done.

James White, 33, of Warwickshire, pleaded guilty at Willesden Magistrates\u2019 Court on Monday to displaying threatening or abusive writing likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. He smiled and chuckled after the banning order was made, and was also fined \u00a31,000 and ordered to pay a surcharge of \u00a3400 and \u00a385 in costs.James White arrives at Willesden Magistrates\u2019 Court (Jonathan Brady/PA Wire)White was seen wearing the Manchester United jersey \u2013 which had the number 97 underneath the words \u201cnot enough\u201d \u2013 at Wembley Stadium on 3 June. The image was widely shared on social media and received widespread condemnation.

Why hasn\u2019t it been stamped out?The shirt made reference to the 97 football fans who died as a result of a crush at a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield on 15 April 1989. An inquest jury ruled in 2016 that they were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors.District judge Mark Jabbitt said: \u201cIt is hard to imagine a more \u2026 offensive reference to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.\u201dThe judge added that the shirt White wore bore a \u201chateful expression\u201d \u2013 calling it an \u201cabhorrent message\u201d \u2013 and that the impact of his actions are \u201cprofound and distressing\u201d.After White was arrested at Wembley Stadium, the court heard he was cautioned and told police: \u201cYou haven\u2019t even asked me what the T-shirt means.\u201cMy grandad died aged 97 and didn\u2019t have enough kids.\u201dThe shirt sparked outraged when it was seen at the Wembley showpiece earlier this month (Twitter)The prosecution said White had \u201cmany\u201d previous convictions, dating most recently to 2021, but none were football-related.Police received a series of emails from people who saw an image of the shirt online.The court heard how members of the public wrote that they were \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d by it.Diane Lynn, vice-chair of Hillsborough Survivor Supporters Alliance, said it was \u201cvery personal\u201d for people who were at Hillsborough that day and that survivors suffered with \u201cguilt\u201d.\u201cHow dare he make us feel like this,\u201d she said.White claimed that the shirt was a reference to his grandad when he was arrested (Jonathan Brady/PA Wire)The defence told the court that White \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d his actions and accepts he \u201churt people very deeply\u201d.Responding to the viral picture, the FA said in a statement: \u201cThe FA strongly condemns the actions of the individual who wore a shirt referencing the Hillsborough disaster ahead of the Emirates FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium.\u201cWe saw a photograph of the offensive shirt on social media and immediately started working to identify the perpetrator.\u201cOur security team were able to quickly locate the individual based on the image, and we welcome the swift action which was then taken by the police.\u201cWe will not tolerate abuse relating to Hillsborough or any football tragedy at Wembley Stadium and we will continue to work with the authorities to ensure strong action is taken against perpetrators.\u201dA further 22 people were arrested during the FA Cup final policing operation, for offences such as affray, assault, possession of drugs and drunk and disorderly behaviour.

It's driving a major mental health crisis.To improve kids' mental health, some schools start laterThe groups\u2019 petition calling for universities to be legally obliged to care about their students - giving them the same rights to protection from harm that workers have - closed in March with 128,292 signatures and last week it was debated in Parliament. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, 319 university students died by suicide between the academic years of 2016/17 to 2019/20. Natasha was a \u201cwonderful\u201d person, her parents, from West Bridgford, Nottingham, said. She was bright, played the piano and cello and loved cooking.She also suffered from crippling social anxiety. According to her friends, they would have to talk to assistants in shops on Natasha\u2019s behalf or order her drinks at the bar.So when the second-year physics student was first faced with an oral assessment, she was said to have run out of the room.Mr Abrahart said the University of Bristol \u201clet us down, they let Natasha down\u201d  (Bob and Maggie Abrahart)According to her parents, she was forced to continue with these assessments throughout the six months before her death otherwise, she was told she would have failed the year and potentially been kicked out of university.The University of Bristol said its staff offered Natasha \u201calternative options for her assessments to alleviate the anxiety she faced\u201d.But she became depressed and started having suicidal ideations. This was when her flatmate sent that email from her account on her behalf.University staff did accompany her to a GP appointment and followed up a couple of times, her parents said, \u201cbut that was it\u201d. Meanwhile, the oral assessments continued, culminating in what her father described as \u201cthe final straw\u201d, a group presentation in front of an audience of 50.Former NHS mental health worker Mrs Abrahart and former university professor husband with their daughter in Bristol  (Maggie and Bob Abrahart)It was at the crack of dawn the day after the presentation when Mr Abrahart heard a knock at the door and opened it to a police officer, telling him the worst news a parent can hear.Mr Abrahart said: \u201cI had asked Natasha if the university knew what was going on with her and she said they did. We put complete faith in them - they let us down, they let Natasha down.\u201dIn their subsequent quest for answers, which began shortly after they both retired, former NHS mental health worker Mrs Abrahart and her former university professor husband successfully sued the University of Bristol under the Equality Act last March.Judge Alex Ralton found the university had breached its duties to make reasonable adjustments to how it assessed Natasha, engaged in indirect disability discrimination and treated her unfavourably.He found that these breaches led to her death, noting that experts said the main cause of her depressive illness was academic oral assessments and the university was ordered to award her parents \u00a350,000 in damages. However, the university has been granted permission to appeal the ruling, so the couple said they have not yet received the compensation.The court also failed to accept the university had a duty of care towards Natasha, leaving her parents frustrated at the lack of long-term change that could potentially help others. Natasha\u2019s parents said she was a \u201cwonderful\u201d person, fiercely bright, played the piano and cello, and loved cooking (Maggie and Bob Abrahart)Her father said: \u201cThe worst thing about Bristol is that rather than make changes to save people like Natasha, they\u2019ve made no changes and instead decided to argue in court to not make life-protecting changes. They focus on protecting institutions, not the students.\u201dNatasha was under the care of specialist mental health professionals at Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (AWP) when she died, which has since acknowledged that the care it provided was inadequate.

She claims that Anugrah told the university on multiple occasions he was struggling in the face of bullying in the police force, as well as routine racist attacks on the streets, \u201cgetting harassed, spat at, and called names\u201d.Yet Ms Alfred-Saggar, from Manchester, says little support was offered by Leeds Trinity. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t heard and that is terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe institutions that were supposed to look after Anu really let him down.\u201dThe Abraham family is demanding justice for Anugrah (left with, from left to right, his sister, his mother Sonia, his other sister, and his father Amar)  (Rita Alfred-Saggar)Anugrah\u2019s mother Sonia added: \u201cI trusted my boy to these institutions and they lost him.\u201dThe Abraham family held a vigil for Anugrah last week to mark what would have been his 22nd birthday.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA stolen car used in a shooting which killed a 26-year-old woman was burnt out a week later by the man accused of her murder, a court has heard.The black Mercedes A Class is alleged to have been used by Connor Chapman, 23, on Christmas Eve last year when Elle Edwards was killed by a gunman who opened fire with a Skorpion sub-machine outside the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village, Wirral, Merseyside.On Monday, a jury at Liverpool Crown Court was shown footage of the stolen Mercedes travelling in a convoy with another Mercedes vehicle, both with false registration plates, from Wirral to Frodsham, Cheshire, on New Year\u2019s Eve.Nigel Power KC, prosecuting, said cell site data showed the phones of Chapman and co-defendant Thomas Waring appearing to move with the cars as they travelled.The jury has been told Chapman accepts he was involved in burning out the car but Waring denies a charge of assisting an offender and claims he was separated from his mobile phone at the time.Footage played in court showed the car on fire at Grassy Lane just after 10pm.Detective Constable Steve Duke said the vehicle was set alight in an area near the M56 motorway.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very secluded place with high banks, so it is very concealed.\u201dThe car was found by a dog walker the following day and identified by its chassis number, the court heard.Home Office pathologist Christopher Johnson said Ms Edwards was hit by three bullets in the shooting.The court heard there were two gunshot entry wounds to the back of her head, as well as a graze to her shoulder where a bullet had gone through her coat.Dr Johnson said one of the injuries to her head was \u201cirrecoverable\u201d.The court heard the two men said to be the intended targets of the attack, Jake Duffy and Kieran Salkeld, were both taken to Aintree University Hospital following the shooting.A bullet was recovered from Mr Salkeld\u2019s chest and, after surgery and time in the intensive care and major trauma units, he was discharged on January 7, the jury heard.Mr Duffy had surgery for wounds to his thighs and was discharged from hospital on December 27.The court was told on December 30 a booking was made for Connor Chapman to travel on a ferry from Portsmouth to Santander in Spain on January 2, but it was later cancelled.The jury was told Chapman was arrested in a Tesco store in Newtown, North Wales, on January 10 and told officers: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201dHe answered no comment in police interviews but gave a prepared statement in which he said he was at home in Houghton Road, Woodchurch, at the time of the shooting.He said\u00a0he spoke to police on the phone on New Year\u2019s Day, when they searched his grandparents\u2019 house, and claimed an officer said he wanted to speak to him over a serious matter, but did not mention it was murder.He said: \u201cIn recent years, I have felt targeted by the police and I didn\u2019t want to go and speak to them.\u201dThe shooting is alleged to have been the culmination of a feud between a group of people on the Woodchurch and Beechwood estates, on either side of the M53 motorway in Wirral.Chapman denies the murder of Ms Edwards, two counts of attempted murder and three counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.He also denies possession of a Skorpion sub-machine gun with intent to endanger life and possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life.Waring, 20, of Private Drive, Barnston, Wirral, denies possessing a prohibited weapon and assisting an offender by helping Chapman to dispose of the car.The trial is expected to last three to four weeks."}, {"_id": "64909b2f51ac33155408cebc", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/croydon-families-old-bailey-london-transport-for-london-b2360292.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Families\u2019 \u2018disappointment\u2019 as Croydon tram disaster driver cleared", "lead": "Alfred Dorris was acquitted of failing to take \u2018reasonable care\u2019 of the health and safety of his passengers in an accident which left seven dead.", "author": "Emily Pennink", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:16:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:11.915102", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:16:25+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/16/d4c7a35010e869f0f67a74f9731fae02Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjcwNDgy-2.67364441.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFamilies have voiced\u00a0their shock and disappointment after a driver was cleared over the Croydon tram disaster in which seven passengers were killed and 21 more were seriously injured.Alfred Dorris, 49, appeared visibly shaken when a jury at the Old Bailey acquitted him of failing to take \u201creasonable care\u201d of the health and safety of himself and his 69 passengers on Tram 2551.He was doing three times the speed he should have been going when his tram derailed on a sharp corner at Sandilands in south London on the morning of November 9 2016.Mr Dorris denied he had a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d and said he became disorientated in the tunnel on approach to the curve, believing he was heading the other way.His confusion was blamed on a combination of external factors including poor lighting and signage in the Sandilands tunnel complex, darkness and bad weather.The jury deliberated for less than two hours on Monday to reach its unanimous verdict following the prosecution brought by the Office of Road and Rail (ORR).Transport for London (TfL) and Tram Operations Limited (ToL) have previously admitted health and safety offences relating to significant failings ahead of the catastrophic derailment and will be sentenced next month.The people who died were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, Robert Huxley, 63, and Philip Logan, 52, all from New Addington, and Donald Collett, 62, and Mark Smith, 35, both from Croydon.Families of the victims had sat in court one of the Old Bailey or attended the trial by video-link from Croydon.Speaking outside the court, Mr Smith\u2019s mother Jean said she was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at the verdict and called for a \u201cradical shake-up\u201d of the judicial system.She said: \u201cAt the end of the day, he may have been found not guilty, but he was driving that tram and nobody else was.\u201cWe\u2019ll get over this, like we get over everything else, and we\u2019ll just carry on our lives. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a lot emptier without our Mark.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a little eight-year-old boy who\u2019s going to wonder why nobody\u2019s responsible for what happened to his daddy.\u201dFather Colin Smith said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a burden of shame, basically, at the end of the day. Whoever was responsible for it is beside the point now it\u2019s been proven the other way.\u201dMr Collett\u2019s brother Joe there were \u201cno winners at all\u201d and also felt the system had let him down.He told reporters he felt \u201cvery disappointed\u201d because \u201cthe only one who knows what happened and the truth is Mr Dorris\u201d.He added: \u201cHe had done the journey several thousand times and this day he said he had a bad day \u2013 but seven people had a worst day.\u201dPhilip Logan\u2019s granddaughter Danielle Wynne said: \u201cA not guilty verdict to me is like someone stabbing me in the chest. It feels so deflating.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that morning (Mr Dorris) set out to kill anyone. But he did kill people. There has to be some kind of accountability.\u201dIn a statement outside court, Mr Dorris of Beckenham, south-east London, said: \u201cI woke up that morning and turned up for work as a professional tram driver.\u201cI had every intention to carry out my duties as a professional and that included to take reasonable care of my passengers and myself.\u201cUnfortunately, that morning went horribly wrong. And that was because of something I wasn\u2019t in control of.\u201cI am deeply and sincerely sorry I wasn\u2019t able to do anything to stop that tram from turning over.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that some of you have lost someone. Some of you have had life-changing injuries and all of you have suffered and endured the mental trauma since the accident.\u201cI\u2019m truly and deeply sorry. It\u2019s something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life. I would just like to end by saying there are no winners in this case.\u201dPreviously, the court heard it had been a wet, wintry morning when Tram 2551 embarked on its route from New Addington to Wimbledon via East Croydon.At a sharp left turn on the approach to Sandilands, drivers are instructed to reduce speed to 12mph (20kph) to safely negotiate the curve, with a sign on the bend confirming it.Mr Dorris was travelling in excess of 43mph (70kph), causing the inner wheels to come off the track and the tram to tip over.Survivors described being \u201cflung\u201d about as if in a washing machine or a pinball machine, then a moment of silence before people began to scream and shout.Mr Dorris broke down in court as he recalled the moments before the tragedy, saying: \u201cIt was like I went into shock. I could not do anything. I wanted to reach for the brake but at that stage the tram was already going over and I was thrown out of the chair, and I could not do anything.\u201cI can remember being thrown from the chair to the side of the cabin and my shoulder took the impact, and I hit the side of my head on the side of the cabin.\u201cI can remember lying on the floor and then it goes black; I passed out, because I cannot remember the tram sliding or becoming stationary.\u201cThe next thing, I remember hearing voices and people kicking trying to open the cabin door.\u201dProsecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman KC said it was an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d.Mr Dorris was described as having an \u201cimpeccable\u201d past record and was seen as one of the better drivers.The court heard of an alleged \u201cnear-miss\u201d 10 days before the derailment in an identical location at a similar time involving another driver.The Old Bailey jurors were not told that an inquest in 2021 concluded that the victims died as a result of an accident and were not unlawfully killed.Dorris had been excused from attending the inquest because he was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder."}, {"_id": "64909b3051ac33155408cebd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-liz-truss-punishment-harsh-b2360135.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Liz Truss says tabloid \u2018wet lettuce\u2019 gag was not funny", "lead": "<p>Former PM brands prophetic stunt \u2018puerile\u2019 </p>", "author": "Jon Stone", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:15:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:12.112246", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:15:43+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/09/10/debd6b6532c49d620b120ab8fb9567cfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjgzNzA5MjEw-2.69452669.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA tabloid newspaper\u2019s running joke that Liz Truss\u2019s premiership would be outlasted by a lettuce was not funny, the former prime minister has said.Ms Truss on Monday broke her silence over the prophetic gag, telling a conference: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I just think it\u2019s puerile.\u201dThe Daily Star ran a series of irreverent front pages in the dying days of her premiership, provoking mirth on social media and beyond.But speaking at the News Xchange conference in Dublin, Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister declined to say she could \u201csee the funny side\u201d of the joke.\u201cIf I\u2019ve got a criticism of the media \u2013 there\u2019s too much focus on the people and seeing it as a sort of entertaining story to follow\u2026 rather than discussions of the ideas. And I particularly find that true on economics,\u201d Ms Truss said.RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from Truss\u201cDid I and my colleagues get everything perfect about communication? No, we didn\u2019t. But I think we\u2019re operating in an environment where the economic ideas that I believe in are not widely understood.\u201dMs Truss was ultimately outlasted by the lettuce, resigning after just 49 days in the job after her economic policies unleashed a wave of chaos on the markets. A \u201cmini-budget\u201d meant to kickstart economic growth instead came close to collapsing the pension system and sent mortgage interest rates soaring.\u201cI think the British media are known around the world for being particularly vociferous\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly deferential to politicians,\u201d she also told the conference.But she said \u201cirreverence\u201d could be a good thing and that she would \u201crather live in a country where there is a robust debate than what the alternatives look like\u201d.Speaking at the same conference on Monday Ms Truss also moved to defend her predecessor, telling her audience that Boris Johnson's punishment for repeatedly holding parliament in contempt while prime minister is \"overly harsh\".Mr Johnson's short-lived successor said: \"None of us are perfect\".A privileges committee investigation into Mr Johnson published last week said the ex-PM should not get the complementary lifetime parliamentary security pass enjoyed by most former MPs.It accused him of repeatedly misleading parliament over the Partygate scandal and attacking democratic institutions through a strongly-worded resignation statement that branded the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". But Ms Truss, who served as foreign secretary under Mr Johnson, said she would unfortunately not be back in London in time to vote on the report in the House of Commons. This means she will dodge the politically difficult choice of whether to vote for or against sanctions on Mr Johnson. Either choice could potentially alienate groups of political supporters, were she ever to attempt to return to front line politics \u2013\u00a0as has been claimed by some allies.But asked about the committee's findings, she said she believed its \"judgment was pretty harsh\".\"He himself has said he's made mistakes, and none of us are perfect,\" she said.\"I'm not questing the integrity of the report that parliamentarians have put forward. I think the judgment is pretty harsh, but I'm not questioning the integrity of those people.\"Ms Truss said her predecessor had motivated some people with his vision of Britain and is \"not popular among what you might call the sort of 'elite intelligentsia' in Britain\".\n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK news in pictures17 June 2023Typhoon fighter jets fly over The

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe \u201cringleader\u201d of the notorious street gang Mali Boys has been found guilty of two murders amid a spate of tit-for-tat violence, it can now be reported.On November 16 2017, Hamza Ul Haq was involved in the fatal group stabbing of 18-year-old Kacem Mokrane in Walthamstow, east London.Months later, Ul Haq was involved in the mistaken identity murder of\u00a020-year-old Joseph Williams-Torres, who was shot dead as he sat with a friend in a van in March 2018.Both fatal attacks were in revenge for the murder of one of their own, 17-year-old Elijah Dornelly, in May 2017.The killers were associated with the Mali Boys gang which had been engaged in a bloody feud with the neighbouring Priory Court or Higham Hill gang in Walthamstow.In 2020, Ul Haq was found guilty of Mr Williams-Torres\u2019s murder and jailed for life.Following a three-month trial, Ul Haq was found guilty in May of Mr Mokrane\u2019s murder alongside Abdirisak Ali, 26, Luca Griffiths, 21, Kamil Kazmierski, 23.On Monday, Judge Angela Rafferty KC lifted reporting restrictions on reporting their convictions during a hearing at the Old Bailey .In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Mokrane\u2019s grandmother Marlene Sutton said: \u201cThe family have waited over five years for Kacem\u2019s murderers to be brought to court where the family have had to go through the whole event again due to these animals denying their guilt or making excuses for the part they played in Kacem\u2019s murder.\u201cIt has been impossible for the family to begin any form of healing process.\u201cThose who murdered Kacem, have demonstrated no remorse for their crime.\u201cThere are those in this pack who went on to commit further criminal activities and even another murder, identifying that they were out of control and dangerous.\u201dMr Mokrane was described by his family as a \u201cbig personality\u201d, who had been enjoying an apprenticeship at Thames Mead football club and had ambitions to become a professional footballer.His life was cut short when he was attacked as he made his way to a local trap house in Higham Hill Road.Two cars pulled up and 10 males got out and chased him down the road.Ul Haq was among those leading the chase with attackers brandishing knives, including a \u201cZombie flasher\u201d or \u201cpirate\u201d knife.In just 25 seconds, Mr Mokrane was surrounded, pushed up against a wall and suffered serious injuries including an eviscerated bowel and stab to the leg. He died four days later.The attacking group then ran back to the waiting vehicles which sped off.The court was told the immediate trigger for the \u201crevenge murder\u201d was an acid attack in Subway and Downtown Pizza in St James Walthamstow two days earlier.Ul Haq and others had been squirted with acid and one friend was stabbed, although not fatally.Jurors were told that incident happened amid a \u201cseries of violent retaliatory attacks\u201d between rival territorial gangs The Mali Boys, with whom the 10 attackers were associated, and the Priory Court/Higham Hill gang.The \u201cincreasingly bloodied and vengeful feud\u201d began in May 2017 with the murder of 17-year-old Elijah Dornelly. who was a friend of the defendants.Prosecutor Allison Hunter KC had said: \u201cAs a group, they were reckless and ruthless, and swift to seek revenge for any perceived challenge to their territorial supremacy.\u201cThey had grown increasingly angry, dangerous and confrontational since the murder of Elijah Dornelly which had marked the beginning of the tit-for-tat violence over the relevant period.\u201cTheir eagerness to exact their swift revenge typically resulted in either the careless mistaken identification of their specific target, or else in acts of indiscriminate violence against any member of a rival grouping.\u201dUl Haq, Ali, Griffiths, and Kazmierski will be sentenced for Mr Mokrane\u2019s murder on June 28 at the Old Bailey."}, {"_id": "64909b3051ac33155408cebf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/wiltshire-police-wiltshire-b2360316.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police dogs given body armour by force \u2018when needed\u2019", "lead": "The new \u2018canine vests\u2019 will shield the animals from knife attacks and bullets, Wiltshire Police said.", "author": "Joseph Draper", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:12:58", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:12.451742", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:12:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/16/3b002ff9983594b62dc8043e3159c4a4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjczNjEx-2.43212857.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA leading campaigner on the Windrush scandal said he fears the Home Office could be working towards closing the compensation scheme meaning thousands will miss out and are retraumatised.His concerns come in the 75th anniversary week as it was reported that the Home Office unit set up with responsibility for reforming the department in the wake of the scandal \u2013 which saw many lose homes, jobs and face the threat of deportation \u2013 is to be disbanded.Patrick Vernon, convenor of the Windrush 75 network, said he fears this is a pattern of behaviour from the Government and a narrative that is \u201cgaslighting\u201d those whose lives have been devastated by what he said is \u201cnot the Windrush scandal, it\u2019s a Home Office scandal\u201d.The Guardian reported that staff working in the transformation directorate of the Home Office were told in an online meeting that the unit would be closing at the end of this month.The department said it does not routinely comment on leaks and speculation but said there \u201chave been and will continue to be team changes as the Windrush response is delivered\u201d.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveA spokesperson for the department said:\u00a0 \u201cThe Government is honouring its Windrush commitments and providing support to those affected every day.\u201cOver \u00a372 million compensation has been paid or offered already and the scheme will stay open as long as needed. We will continue to keep our partners up to date.\u201dMr Vernon repeated calls to make the scheme independent of the Home Office, saying it is not appropriate to have the \u201cperpetrators\u201d of the scandal running the compensation scheme.He said he is concerned the Government will end the scheme after reaching a certain limit, but he accused them of not having provided enough support for people to navigate the process.\n\nThey (the Home Office) are creating this narrative which is gaslighting further the Windrush generationPatrick Vernon, Windrush campaignerHe told the PA news agency: \u201cWhat they\u2019ve not done is made the effort, they\u2019ve not provided proper legal aid support or systems helping people to complete the forms. A lot of people haven\u2019t come forward yet. Therefore they (the Home Office) are creating this narrative which is gaslighting further the Windrush generation.\u201dHe said the complication of the process has put people off, and that some of the most high-profile cases remain outstanding.He added: \u201cOf course some people have received compensation, some people have received decent compensation.\u201cBut the point I\u2019m trying to make is that people don\u2019t trust the Home Office. The Home Office is not the right department, they are the perpetrators, it should be independent.\u201dHe said he wants to be proved wrong, but currently fears the compensation scheme could be closed entirely within a year \u201cwhich means thousands of people will miss out completely and they will be further retraumatised by the lack of intent and commitment from the Government to resolve this.\u201dBlack Equity Organisation chief executive Dr Wanda Wyporska said: \u201cIf the reports are correct, the Home Office, under Secretary of State Suella Braverman, will be near to completing the process of totally abdicating itself from the responsibility to right the wrongs done to the Windrush generation, and protect future generations from its cruel and discredited \u2018hostile environment\u2019 strategy.\u201cThe Prime Minister must step in and ensure that the Windrush generation and future migrants to this country aren\u2019t left to be preyed upon by a Home Office that appears to care little for their service, struggle or basic human rights. That would be a fitting tribute to the Windrush generation.\u201dThe 75th anniversary milestone is being marked with events across Britain, including the Windrush flag being raised in locations including the Houses of Parliament and the Home Office, and a national commemoration service at Southwark Cathedral on Thursday.RecommendedMother of family found dead in west London believed to have been murderedTracey Emin draws 45 portraits of women for National Portrait Gallery doorsPre-historic long-necked reptiles were decapitated by their predators \u2013 studyThe scandal, which erupted in 2018, saw many British citizens, mostly from the Caribbean, denied access to healthcare and benefits and threatened with deportation despite having the right to live in the UK.The HMT Empire Windrush first docked in England on June 22 1948 at Tilbury Docks in Essex, bringing people from the Caribbean who answered Britain\u2019s call to help fill post-war labour shortages."}, {"_id": "64909b3051ac33155408cec1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mother-london-metropolitan-police-hounslow-b2360303.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mother of family found dead in west London believed to have been murdered", "lead": "Detective are not yet sure when the family died.", "author": "Margaret Davis", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:05:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:12.818488", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T15:05:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/16/38d5375eade1bd7c4ee70400bff6fd36Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjcyMDc4-2.72643880.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

constitution for the country to rule out Scotland being a home for nuclear weapons.With a final constitution only being developed after Scotland has voted for independence \u2013 and not coming into force until after people have backed it in a referendum \u2013 the First Minister and SNP leader conceded he could not\u00a0say for certain what would be in such a document.He said: \u201cBy helping enhance and protect important rights, it will make a genuine and significant difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nIn the context of the Westminster system, these proposals do sound radicalFirst Minister Humza YousafRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHe spoke as he launched a new paper on plans for a written constitution, which is part of a series of papers from the Scottish Government as it seeks to make a fresh case for independence.The Tories, however, branded the new paper as being the \u201cheight of self-indulgence from Humza Yousaf\u201d, hitting out at the SNP leader for spending \u201ctaxpayers\u2019 money publishing yet another paper in relation to independence and trying to waste parliamentary time on it next week\u201d.Mr Yousaf said: \u201cA written constitution that protects, for example, an adequate standard of living, it is not abstract, I think it is fundamental to people\u2019s lives right now.\u201dHe told how having a written constitution would \u201cembody a set of longer-term, more fundamental values about what a country is for\u201d and set out a \u201ccommon understanding of a nation\u2019s priorities\u201d, as well creating a \u201cstandard below which no government should ever fall\u201d.He added: \u201cIn the context of the Westminster system, these proposals do sound radical.\u201dWith the UK not having a written constitution in place \u2013 something Mr Yousaf said made the country a \u201cglobal outlier\u201d \u2013 he claimed Westminster could abolish the Scottish Parliament, which has been in place since 1999.Speaking in Glasgow, the First Minister: \u201cThat\u2019s not an abstract concept \u2013 it is worth remembering the UK Government is already seriously considering the repeal of the Human Rights Act, one of the most significant achievements of any UK Parliament in the last 30 years.\u201cIn future, Westminster sovereignty could even allow the UK Parliament to repeal devolution through nothing other than a simple majority vote.\u201dA vote for independence would see the Scottish Parliament develop an interim constitution, which would then come into force when Scotland leaves the UK.After independence, a constitutional convention would be established to develop a permanent constitution, with this to be considered by Holyrood and also put to the people in a referendum.Mr Yousaf said such a document could \u201cprotect the right to take industrial action\u201d for workers and could also set out \u201cprovisions on the right to adequate housing, the right of communities to own land, or our right as citizens to access healthcare which is free at the point of need\u201d.He went on to state: \u201cIn the Scottish Government\u2019s view, it should also include provisions stating very clearly and explicitly that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons.\u201dThe First Minister insisted the \u201cvision\u201d in the Scottish Government paper \u201ccontrasts quite starkly\u201d with Westminster, where he said \u201crights are being systematically eroded\u201d.Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said: \u201cThe SNP are so obsessed with their push for independence that they are now pressing for not just one divisive referendum but two to take place if they ever get their way.\u201dThe Tory MSP said the First Minister \u201cknows that the obsession with breaking up the United Kingdom is the only issue that can keep the warring factions in his party together\u201d.Mr Cameron continued: \u201cHumza Yousaf has a total brass neck saying the cost of living is the number one issue for him, when he is happy to spend taxpayers\u2019 money publishing yet another paper in relation to independence and trying to waste parliamentary time on it next week.\u201cThe paper itself is full of holes and talks up completely misguided plans to ban nuclear weapons in an independent Scotland.\u201cUsing public money to campaign for independence is completely the wrong priority for Scotland.\u201cPeople want the SNP-Green government to be focused on their real priorities right now such as rising bills, fixing our NHS and strengthening our economy.\u201dScottish Labour constitution spokesperson Neil Bibby\u00a0said Mr Yousaf had been \u201cindulging in the same old constitutional pipe-dreams\u201d at the same time Sir Keir Starmer had been in Scotland to unveil Labour plans to \u201ctransform Scotland\u2019s economy and lead the way in the transition to clean energy\u201d.Mr Bibby added: \u201cHumza Yousaf may say that he wants to enshrine the NHS in the constitution, but under his watch our NHS is on its knees.\u201cHumza

But he didn\u2019t, he waved it through.\u201cAnd whether that can now be reversed I think is an open matter.\u201cBut certainly, anyone looking at that video \u2013 it is only the latest videos or evidence of wrongdoing at Downing Street or Tory Party headquarters \u2013 most people looking at that would say it is simply inappropriate for two of the people in that video to be getting honours.\u201dRecommended\u2018No running commentary\u2019 on efforts to restore Stormont \u2013 NI SecretaryCulture at health board \u2018nothing but transparent\u2019, hospitals inquiry hearsChurch of England clergy demand pay rise for first time in historyMr Johnson went on to resign as an MP only hours after his resignation honours were made public earlier this month, quitting after learning a cross-party Commons committee had concluded he lied to Parliament when he made assurances that Covid rules had been followed in No 10.There has been an ongoing row between Mr Johnson\u2019s allies and Mr Sunak\u2019s administration after a number of Tory MPs put forward for a place in the House of Lords did not appear on the final resignation list."}, {"_id": "64909b3251ac33155408cec9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mortgage-interest-rates-calculator-b2360033.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunak rules out mortgage support as he urges banks to help struggling homeowners", "lead": "<p>PM wants banks to offer \u2018bespoke support\u2019 \u2013 as average two-year fixed-rate mortgage hits 6% and lenders pull deals</p>", "author": "Adam Forrest and Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:20:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:14.438904", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T14:20:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/17/GettyImages-684134518.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I would much rather have had a pro-active approach (to communicating with families).\u201dMr Redfern was also asked about concerns families had about a lack of transparency at the time and there were concerns about the approach to communication.A statement prepared for the media in September 2018 showed information about patients\u2019 treatment but this did not appear in the same briefing for patients.Mr Duncan asked: \u201cThat was not being said in the handout, at least the one that we looked at, at that time. We are wondering against that background, whether you have any thoughts or regards whether concerns about transparency might be understood?\u201dMr Redfern insisted the culture within the organisation was \u201cnothing but transparent\u201d while the issue was ongoing.He said: \u201cRight through the whole process of every incident management team, as part of this public inquiry into the children\u2019s hospital, I never ever felt that there was a lack of transparency.\u201cI would never ever have allowed that to happen.\u201cPersonally, from myself, I always felt that everybody spoke truthfully, honestly and articulately as much as they possibly could on the circumstances at that specific time.\u201dMr Redfern acknowledged there was \u201cunhappiness\u201d at the circumstances families found themselves in.The inquiry was launched in the wake of deaths linked to infections at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, including that of 10-year-old Milly Main.It is also examining problems that led to the delay in the opening of the new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh.RecommendedChurch of England clergy demand pay rise for first time in historyWindrush campaigner fears Home Office could wind up compensation schemeSunak set to avoid Johnson vote as critics accuse PM of \u2018running scared\u2019The children\u2019s hospital in Glasgow opened in 2015 and formed part of the \u00a3840 million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus, replacing a facility at Yorkhill.The inquiry, before Lord Brodie, continues."}, {"_id": "64909b3451ac33155408ced1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/families-old-bailey-london-smith-beckenham-b2360215.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Speeding Croydon tram disaster driver cleared of health and safety breach", "lead": "Alfred Dorris was doing three times the speed limit when his tram derailed in November 2016, killing seven people and injuring 21 others.", "author": "Emily Pennink", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:46:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:16.019452", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T13:46:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/13/c8c51de68f36b781246764b2ee5251d9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTE1NTE5-2.67364441.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA driver has been cleared over the Croydon tram disaster in which seven passengers were killed and 21 others were seriously injured.Alfred Dorris, 49, appeared visibly shaken when a jury at the Old Bailey acquitted him of failing to take \u201creasonable care\u201d of the health and safety of himself and his 69 passengers on Tram 2551 in November 2016.The jury deliberated for less than two hours on Monday to reach its unanimous verdict following the prosecution brought by the Office of Road and Rail (ORR).Transport for London (TfL) and Tram Operations Limited (ToL) have previously admitted health and safety offences relating to significant failings ahead of the catastrophic derailment and will be sentenced at a later date.Families of the victims had sat in Court One of the Old Bailey or attended the trial by video-link from Croydon.The people who died were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, Robert Huxley, 63, and Philip Logan, 52, all from New Addington, and Donald Collett, 62, and Mark Smith, 35, both from Croydon.The court had heard that Dorris, of Beckenham, south-east London, was doing three times the speed he should have been going when his tram derailed on a sharp corner at Sandilands in south London on the morning of November 9 2016.Dorris denied he had a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d and said he became disorientated in the tunnel on approach to the curve, believing he was heading the other way.He blamed his confusion on a combination of external factors including poor lighting and signage in the Sandilands tunnel complex, darkness and bad weather.By the time he realised the fatal mistake the tram was already tipping over and he was thrown from his seat, causing him to hit his head and pass out, he said.\n\nI\u2019m a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control ofAlfred DorrisSpeaking publicly about the crash for the first time, the driver apologised to the victims\u2019 families and survivors during his tearful evidence at the Old Bailey.He told them: \u201cI\u2019m a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control of.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I became disorientated. I\u2019m sorry I was not able to do anything to stop myself from becoming disorientated.\u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply sorry I was not able to do anything to reorientate myself and stop the tram from turning over. I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201dThe court heard that it had been a wet, wintry morning when Tram 2551 embarked on its route from New Addington to Wimbledon via East Croydon.At a sharp left turn on the approach to Sandilands, drivers are instructed to reduce speed to 12mph (20kph) to safely negotiate the curve, with a sign on the bend confirming it.Dorris was travelling in excess of 43mph (70kph), causing the inner wheels to come off the track and the tram to tip over.Survivors described being \u201cflung\u201d about as if in a washing machine or a pinball machine, then a moment of silence before people began to scream and shout.Dorris was found in his cabin with his eyes shut and one passenger called for him to \u201cwake up\u201d.When he came to, he said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys. Is everyone all right? I saw something in front of the tram.\u201dDorris broke down in court as he recalled the moments before the tragedy, saying: \u201cIt was like I went into shock. I could not do anything. I wanted to reach for the brake but at that stage the tram was already going over and I was thrown out of the chair and I could not do anything.\u201cI can remember being thrown from the chair to the side of the cabin and my shoulder took the impact and I hit the side of my head on the side of the cabin.\u201cI can remember lying on the floor and then it goes black; I passed out, because I cannot remember the tram sliding or becoming stationary.\u201cThe next thing, I remember hearing voices and people kicking trying to open the cabin door.\u201dProsecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman KC said it was an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d.He told jurors: \u201cWhether by virtue of a micro-sleep, or by virtue of becoming disorientated in some other way, or a combination of the two, Mr Dorris failed to attend to the most basic of requirements of a driver of a passenger vehicle, namely remaining alert and attentive at the controls.\u201dDorris was described as having an \u201cimpeccable\u201d past record and was seen as one of the better drivers.The court heard of an alleged \u201cnear-miss\u201d 10 days before the derailment in an identical location at a similar time involving another driver.Defence barrister Miles Bennett said a passenger had \u201cgenuinely feared for their safety\u201d.But Sarah Claypole, who was a senior manager at the time, told jurors she was unaware of the alleged incident or of drivers failing to report errors.\n\nThe trial of Alfred Dorris concluded today; we note the decision reached and will consider this appropriatelyOffice of Road and RailIt was also suggested that other \u201cenvironmental and external factors outside his control\u201d relating to the infrastructure around the Sandilands area combined to cause the defendant to become disorientated.The Old Bailey jurors were not told that an inquest in 2021 concluded that the victims died as a result of an accident and were not unlawfully killed.At the time, several members of the victims\u2019 families walked out of the room at Croydon Town Hall in tears and there were demands for a new inquest with more witnesses called to give evidence about alleged safety failings.Dorris had been excused from attending the inquest because he was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.The ORR said in a statement: \u201cWe conducted an extensive, detailed and thorough investigation and took\u202fthe decision to prosecute\u202fTransport for London (TfL),\u202fTram Operations Limited (ToL) and driver Alfred Dorris\u202ffor what we believed to be serious health and safety failings relating to the Croydon tram derailment.\u201cThe trial of Alfred Dorris concluded today; we note the decision reached and will consider this appropriately.\u201cTransport for London (TfL) and Tram Operations Limited (ToL) entered guilty pleas in 2022 and will be sentenced at a later date.\u201cOur thoughts remain with those affected by the tragedy.\u201dJoe Collett, whose brother Donald died in the derailment, said there were \u201cno winners at all\u201d and felt the system had let him down.He told reporters outside the Old Bailey he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d because \u201cthe only one who knows what happened and the truth is Mr Dorris\u201d.He said: \u201cHe had done the journey several thousand times and this day (he) said he had a bad day \u2013 but seven people had a worst day.\u201cHe knows what he\u2019s done. He knows the truth. He was the driver.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve got no real feelings against him because he didn\u2019t intend to do what happened.\u201dVictim Mark Smith\u2019s mother Jean said she was \u201cspeechless\u201d and \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at the verdict.She said: \u201cAt the end of the day he may have been found not guilty, but he was driving that tram and nobody else was.\u201dMrs Smith said she felt failed by the judicial system \u201cbig time\u201d.She added: \u201cWe\u2019re not the first family to have gone through something like this and we certainly won\u2019t be the last.\u201cSo it needs a radical shake-up. I think it\u2019s geared to defend the wrong people and so people like us just don\u2019t get no justice. But hey ho.\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the ORR, it was only through them we had the last crack of the whip. This is the end of the trial for us.\u201cWe\u2019ll get over this like we get over everything else and we\u2019ll just carry on our lives. Unfortunately it\u2019s a lot emptier without our Mark. And there\u2019s going to be a little eight-year-old boy who\u2019s going to wonder why nobody\u2019s responsible for what happened to his daddy.\u201d\n\nIt's something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life. And I would just like to end by saying there are no winners in this caseAlfred DorrisFather Colin Smith said \u201cIt\u2019s just a burden of shame basically at the end of the day. Whoever was responsible for it is beside the point now it\u2019s been proven the other way.\u201cSo if I was driving a car it would be a different outcome. I would be responsible and that\u2019s the way I see it.\u201dSister Stacey added: \u201cIt simply defies logic that you have 12 embankment lights on Sandilands exit, and somehow someone who was allegedly awake, alert and concentrating missed all of those in addition to 20kph speed limits.\u201dIn a statement outside court, Mr Dorris thanked his legal teams and family for their support over the past seven \u201cdifficult\u201d years.He said: \u201cI woke up that morning and turned up for work as a professional tram driver.\u201cI had every intention to carry out my duties as a professional, and that included to take reasonable care of my passengers and myself.\u201cUnfortunately, that morning went horribly wrong. And that was because of something I wasn\u2019t in control of.\u201cBut I am deeply and sincerely sorry I wasn\u2019t able to do anything to stop that tram from turning over.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that some of you have lost someone. Some of you have had life-changing injuries, and all of you have suffered and endured the mental trauma since the accident.\u201cI\u2019m truly and deeply sorry. It\u2019s something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life.

You are not a criminal for this \u2013 we have seen far worse \u2013 but it was dangerous.\u201cIt seems a shame that you are not going to fly your drone again.

It\u2019s important the Government doesn\u2019t get involved in that because it is a matter for Parliament and members as individuals, not as members (of) Government.\u201dLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the programme the Prime Minister should participate if there is a Commons vote, saying: \u201cHe should show leadership \u2013 come along, get in the lobby, and show us where he stands on this.\u201dLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cRefusing to back this motion would be an insult to bereaved families who grieved alone while Johnson lied and partied.\u201cThe buck stops at the very top of Government \u2013 if Rishi Sunak really wanted to govern with integrity he shouldn\u2019t be running scared of this vote.\u201dIn a statement on Monday, the Metropolitan Police said they are assessing fresh evidence about potential Covid lockdown breaches.It comes after the Sunday Mirror publisheda video appearing to show Tory staff dancing and joking about coronavirus restrictions during a so-called \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d Christmas party at Conservative HQ in central London.The footage of the event, which happened in December 2020 when indoor socialising was banned and people across the country were separated from family and friends, poses a further setback to Mr Sunak\u2019s efforts to move on from his predecessor-but-one\u2019s legacy.Scotland Yard confirmed that the video, which was \u201cnot previously provided to officers\u201d, is among the new evidence it is considering.Both former London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey and Tory aide Ben Mallet \u2013 who were handed a peerage and an OBE respectively in Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation honours \u2013 attended the gathering.RecommendedRaids on suspected people-smuggling gang who brought convicted rapist back to UKLabour cannot be trusted on clean energy, First Minister saysNext sales jump on back of hotter weather and higher payThe Met said investigators are also reviewing material referred by the Cabinet Office to the force and Thames Valley Police regarding potential breaches of the regulations between June 2020 and May 2021 at Downing Street and Chequers.Thirdly, they are looking into a report from Thursday June 15 regarding media reporting of alleged breaches in Parliament."}, {"_id": "64909b3551ac33155408ced9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/dover-rishi-sunak-channel-government-nhs-b2360155.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "More than 1,100 arrivals on small boats in past three days", "lead": "Nearly 2,900 people are reported to have arrived between June 10 and 18.", "author": "Ian Jones", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:57:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:17.429602", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T12:57:43+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/11/31559e68cf7917bdeb1b0266f08e98a8Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjU2NzYz-2.72242204.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He said: \u201cI think it was the right economic policy.\u201dAnd Mr Cameron added: \u201cThe real problem was time spent quizzing the experts on what potential pandemics were coming and preparing for those in the right way.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) said Mr Cameron is \u201cin denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies\u201d. \u201cThe evidence is clear that the cuts he imposed massively damaged the readiness and resilience of our public services,\u201d said general secretary Paul Nowak.

And I\u2019m sure this public inquiry is going to spend a lot of time on that.\u201dHe was questioned on his own warning back in 2015 that the Ebola outbreak was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the emergence of a \u201cmore aggressive and more difficult to contain\u201d virus.He said that his government did look at pandemics other than flu, such as Mers and Sars.\u201cSo I think that wasn\u2019t a failing, I think the failing was not to ask more questions about asymptomatic transmission, highly infectious\u2026 what turned out to be the pandemic we had,\u201d he added.He questioned whether there had been \u201cadequate follow-up to some of the work\u201d.The inquiry heard the witness statement from Sir Oliver Letwin, who was a Cabinet Office minister from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of resilience under Mr Cameron.Sir Oliver said that \u201cin retrospect\u201d it may \u201cseem surprising\u201d that his reviews did not cover the response to pandemic flu in the UK.\u201cI now believe, however, that it might have been helpful if I had delved into the pandemic influenza risks myself,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is not because I believe such a review would have been likely to lead to any significant improvements in our preparedness for a pandemic flu itself, but rather because it might have led me to question whether we were adequately prepared to deal with the risks of forms of respiratory disease other than pandemic influenza.\u201dMr Cameron was being questioned by barrister Kate Blackwell KC rather than the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel Hugo Keith, who has said he knows the former prime minister.The first phase of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry is examining whether the UK was sufficiently prepared for the pandemic.The British Medical Association representing doctors has accused Mr Cameron and his ministers of allowing the NHS to get into a \u201cparlous state\u201d.Ahead of the hearing, council chair Professor Philip Banfield wrote: \u201cI have seen first-hand the damage wrought by years of austerity and a failure to prioritise the nation\u2019s health.\u201cThe UK was severely on the back foot when Covid took hold, and this proved disastrous \u2013 for the doctors I represent and the millions who suffered at the hands of the virus.\u201dRecommendedKing attends first Order of the Garter service of his reignBoris Johnson could avoid \u2018early retirement\u2019 with pub work, Labour MP jokes\u2018Significant number\u2019 of Durham students face delays in receiving degree resultsOn Tuesday, Mr Cameron\u2019s chancellor, George Osborne, will give evidence, as well as Sir Oliver.Current chancellor and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is due on Wednesday, as is deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden."}, {"_id": "64909b3651ac33155408cede", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/covid-inquiry-uk-pandemic-news-latest-b2360026.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Covid inquiry \u2013 live: David Cameron says it was a \u2018mistake\u2019 not to look at other types of diseases", "lead": "<p>Former prime minister is first politician to appear at inquiry under oath </p>", "author": "Martha McHardy", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:01:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:18.287061", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T12:01:01+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/05/11/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseDavid Cameron tells Covid Inquiry his government spent more time \u2018on pandemic flu\u2019\nGet the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Asked who is in charge of keeping the country safe, Mr Cameron said: \u201cThe Prime Minister is always in charge of keeping the country safe and under reforms the Prime Minister was much more actively involved because he was chairing the National Security Council, The National Security Adviser was appointed by him and reported to him, and in my case, I\u2019d set up a specific subcommittee on threats, hazards and resilience that looked exactly at this area with a highly capable minister in.\u201cI\u2019m sure there are further improvements we can make and the government has announced some, which seemed to me sensible with the proviso that I made, but at the pinnacle of it must be the Prime Minister because from all my experience of chairing Cobras (meetings), whether it was during terrorist problems, or Fukushima nuclear disasters, or Ebola or anything else, the system works extremely well, but the system works better when the Prime Minister is in the chair, asking questions driving changes, and making sure decisions are made. So my answer is it\u2019s the Prime Minister.\u201dMartha Mchardy19 June 2023 12:451687175105Cameron \u2018desperately sorry\u2019 about loss of life during pandemicFormer prime minister David Cameron said he is \u201cdesperately sorry\u201d for the loss of life during the pandemic.\u201cI\u2019m desperately sorry about the loss of life,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people have lost people that are close to them.\u201cAnd there\u2019s been a lot of heartbreak and obviously that continues, and people often suffered in all sorts of ways through the pandemic and that\u2019s why this inquiry is, is so important.\u201dHe added: \u201cI tried to be as frank as I can and as open as I can about the things my government did that helped put in place the right architecture for looking at these threats.\u201dMartha Mchardy19 June 2023 12:451687175058Cameron: \u2018I would have granted funding for 3 months of PPE supplies for every hosiptal if I\u2019d been asked\u2019David Cameron said he would have granted funding for three months of personal protective equipment (PPE) for every hospital if he had been asked.The former prime minister told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry \u201ca lot of things would have followed\u201d if the assumptions on pandemic planning had been challenged.\u201cIn Jeremy Hunt\u2019s evidence hospitals in Hong Kong had to have three months of PPE supplies,\u201d he said.\u201cI was never asked, \u2018Can we have funding for three months of PPE supplies for every hospital?\u2019\u201cBut had I been asked we would\u2019ve granted it, that\u2019s not expensive, that\u2019s not a huge commitment.\u201cThat comes out of planning for the right sort of pandemic, so all these questions about economic policy, we can have an argument about was it the right economic policy or the wrong...

I\u2019ve thought a lot about this because, having been back through all the paperwork and everything, I haven\u2019t found any moment when I was asked or the Treasury was asked to approve sort of surge capacity for PPE supplies or anything like that.\u201cI think that\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t enough attention on the sort of pandemic that we ultimately experienced, but... these are, as you say, are quite clear, and I think that the Treasury... money was tight and we made difficult decisions about public spending, when we did need to spend money on important priorities, when we had to spend money on ebola, we did and we would.\u201dThe inquiry heard that exercise Alice made recommendations on needing a plan for scaling up testing capacity, for isolation and self-isolation options, for asymptomatic transmission and issues with the provision of PPE.Mr Cameron was asked whether these matters were addressed during his time in office, to which he replied: \u201cWhat I know is that there was capacity for isolation, when we had the ebola outbreak in Africa, and obviously there were some cases in the UK.\u201cBut you know, I would say that the problem with Alice was that it was a Mers outbreak with a very high degree of mortality - 35% mortality - but a very low caseload.\u201cAnd so, again, that wasn\u2019t anywhere close to the sort of pandemic we then actually experienced.\u201dMartha Mchardy19 June 2023 12:22\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a04Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64909b3651ac33155408cedf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-partygate-video-b2359779.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tories face outrage over Covid lockdown party video", "lead": "<p>Relatives of those who died during the pandemic vent their fury at video \u2013 a legacy of Johnson\u2019s chaotic tenure</p>", "author": "Archie Mitchell", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:57:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:18.462723", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T11:57:30+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/18/14/MIRROR%20tory%20hq%20party%20grab.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The video shows attendees drinking, dancing and appearing to joke about Covid restrictions at a time when indoor socialising was banned.Two of those at the party, held in the basement of Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) in London in December 2020, were in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. The Metropolitan Police said on Sunday that the force was \u201caware of the footage\u201d \u2013 published by The Mirror \u2013 and are \u201cconsidering it\u201d.Ruth Carney, whose father died alone in hospital in May 2020, said it was insulting that Tory staff could be drinking and dancing after she had not been able to be with her father at the end. \u201cThen ... they\u2019re having a party and dancing. I\u2019m fuming, I\u2019m extremely angry, I absolutely cannot believe this \u2013 it\u2019s like some kind of joke,\u201d she said of the video.Ms Carney, a TV and theatre director, waited with him in hospital in April where it took nine hours for him to get a bed, describing scenes there similar to a \u201cwarzone\u201d, with NHS staff desperately \u201cscrambling\u201d to save lives. Ms Carney later caught Covid and then a secondary infection, so she was isolating in their garden annexe when she received a call from the hospital, telling her he had died.\u201cI wasn\u2019t even able to touch or hug my mum when my dad died,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to tell her through a door.

He does not feature in the video but has previously apologised for attending. Ben Mallet, a former aide to the ex-prime minister who was awarded an OBE last week, is shown chatting to guests in the latest footage.Ruth Carney with her father Peter, who died in hospital in May 2020  (Ruth Carney)Ms Carney said that the detail about the honours \u201cis really rubbing salt in the wound\u201d. She aded: \u201cHow dare he be allowed to do that? I\u2019m sure there are people on there who are worthy and should be honoured but do they really want to be honoured on his list? It\u2019s tainted with blood.\u201dMichael Gove, the housing secretary, apologised for the party on Sunday, callling it \u201cindefensible\u201d. He told the BBC the footage was \u201cterrible\u201d and would leave people feeling \u201cextremely angry\u201d.However, when asked whether Mr Bailey and Mr Mallet should have their peerage and OBE respectively blocked, he said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that.\u201dMr Gove said: \u201cThe decision to confer honours on people was one that was made by Boris Johnson as an outgoing prime minister.\u201cOutgoing prime ministers have that right. Whether or not they should is a matter of legitimate public debate, but they do at the moment.\u201dMPs will vote on Monday whether to accept the findings of a highly critical report that found Boris Johnson repeateadly lied to parliament over Partygate  (PA Wire)The footage came amid a growing crisis for Mr Sunak\u2019s government as it faces the ongoing row about Mr Johnson\u2019s honours \u2013 as well as four crunch by-elections and as the PM is expected to dodge a Commons vote on Monday on whether to endorse a highly critical report into Mr Johnson that found he lied and deliberately misled parliament over the Partygate scandal. Mr Gove refused to say whether he believed the prime minister should back the report, saying how they would vote is a matter for \u201ceach individual\u201d MP. But former Conservative minister Justine Greening urged MPs to \u201cget behind\u201d the committee\u2019s work and recognise that political leaders cannot be \u201callowed to get away with\u201d misleading the Commons.Senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood called on the prime minister to take stock of the tumult around the party and to overhaul his cabinet. \u201cThis mini crisis should be turned into a major opportunity,\u201d he told The Independent. Mr Ellwood said: \u201cThe prime minister should begin with an overhaul of his cabinet with bold policy announcements on the economy, Brexit [and] Ukraine.\u201dHe called for Mr Sunak to be \u201cless fearful of right wing backlash\u201d and address issues that would \u201csecure wider national support\u201d. Mr Ellwood also urged the PM to distance the Conservatives \u201cfrom the populist, divisive approach of the recent past\u201d.Mr Sunak has also faced calls to scrap the list with such honours \u201cspitting in the faces\u201d of those like the family of Ms Carney who suffered through lockdowns.Rishi Sunak is struggling to shake the scandals of his predecessor  (PA Wire)Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant, chairman of parliament\u2019s committee on standards and privileges, said Mr Johnson\u2019s honours list was \u201cdiscredited\u201d and should be scrapped. He told The Independent: \u201cGoing ahead with Mr Bailey\u2019s peerage will be like spitting in the face of the many millions who stuck by the rules to their cost. It\u2019s a discredited list from a disgraced politician and Mr Sunak should cancel it.\u201d Meanwhile Tory MP Sir Robert Buckland said those implicated in the video should consider declining the honours by saying \u201cthank you, but no thank you\u201d. \u201cThe option of declining the honour is very much one that would seem to be a sensible course of action to take,\u201d he told Times Radio. And Labour MP Karl Turner said Mr Johnson is a \u201cproven liar\u201d and called for the prime minister to \u201cgrow a backbone\u201d and block his honours list. \u201cThere are people on that list receiving honours that were literally boozing it up when the country was locked down unable to visit loved ones as they were laid dying. Sunak is effectively approving the honours of liar Johnson\u2019s list of cronies,\u201d he said.The video itself, said to have been taken on 14 December, 2020, showed for the first time staff joking about \u201cbending the rules\u201d at their Christmas party. At least 24 guests were reportedly at the gathering.Last year, the Met Police decided to take no action over the gathering, saying that a much-published photograph showing Mr Bailey and a number of revellers was not enough evidence to \u201cdisprove the version of events provided by attendees\u201d.RecommendedBoris Johnson\u2019s latest resignation honours scandal is another reminder of Carrie\u2019s influenceMr Bailey quit as chair of the London Assembly\u2019s police and crime committee when the photograph emerged.A Conservative Party spokesperson said: \u201cSenior CCHQ staff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of Matthew Parker Street organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of 14 December 2020.

For the first time, crossings are down by 20 per cent.\u201dBut Border Force sources told The Independent crossings had been suppressed by weeks of rough seas in the Channel, and experts said much of the reduction had resulted from a drop in Albanian migrants rather than an overall change.Numbers swiftly rocketed following the arrival of calm weather and more than 2,800 people have arrived on dinghies since 10 June.The total number since the start of this year now stands at 10,472, compared to around 11,600 at the point of 2022.RecommendedGovernment could be forced to pay millions to police asylum barges and military basesGovernment quietly awards travel firm \u00a31.6bn contract for asylum barges and accommodationSunak\u2019s pledge to clear asylum backlog on course to fail as system cost rockets to \u00a33.6bnIt means the year-on-year fall celebrated by the prime minister has been slashed to 9 per cent, and is likely to continue falling while the sea conditions remain favourable for crossings.Yvette Cooper, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThese figures show the dismal failure of all the prime minister's boasts of progress on small boats, and follow a week of damning official reports on the surging backlog, spiralling hotel costs and failing border security.\u201cRishi Sunak\u2019s small boats plan is disintegrating before the public\u2019s eyes, and he has no idea of how to turn it around.\u201dAfghans are now the most common nationality arriving in small boats, following the collapse in the number of refugees resettled directly from the country.During his speech two weeks ago, Mr Sunak admitted that the issue \u201cwon\u2019t be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer\u201d.In the same address, he announced the procurement of two further barges to house asylum seekers and said: \u201cThe first will arrive in Portland in the next fortnight.\u201dBut The Independent understands the Bibby Stockholm is still undergoing refitting and checks in Falmouth, and will not make the journey to Dorset for weeks.It may have to undergo further checks after arriving in Portland, meaning the first asylum seekers cannot be housed there until late July at the earliest.The prime minister\u2019s pledge to clear a backlog of \u201clegacy\u201d asylum decisions by the end of this year is also on course to fail, according to a watchdog report released last week.Mr Sunak is backing the new Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to allow the government to detain and deport all small boat migrants without considering asylum or modern slavery claims, as a means of \u201cstopping the boats\u201d.The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge is being refitted to increase its capacity from 222 to 506 occupants in Falmouth docks in Cornwall (PA) (PA Wire)But experts have questioned ministers\u2019 continued adherence to the idea of \u201cdeterrence\u201d, which has underpinned several years of increasingly punitive laws as numbers have continued to rise, and called for them instead to reduce demand for Channel crossings with alternative safe and legal routes.An inquiry by the cross-party Joint Committee on Human Rights found the bill could lead to asylum seekers taking \u201cmore dangerous routes\u201d to the UK, benefit people smugglers and worsen trafficking.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersIts report said the government had not provided any evidence backing claims the bill would deter Channel crossings, and that many of its provisions were unlawful.Last week, Home Office representatives told the Court of Appeal it was still \u201cworking on estimates of up to another 56,000 people arriving on small boats this year\u201d, which would be a new record and a rise of over a fifth on 2022."}, {"_id": "64909b3651ac33155408cee1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/willesden-magistrates-court-warwickshire-london-wembley-stadium-united-b2360156.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man chuckles in court after receiving football ban for wearing offensive shirt -

The committee concluded that those assurances were misleading and that Johnson failed to correct the record when asked to do so.It said Johnson \u201cmisled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public, and did so repeatedly.\u201dThe panel \u2014 made up of four Conservatives and three opposition legislators \u2014 said Johnson compounded the offense with his attacks on the committee, which he called a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d engaged in a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIt concluded that Johnson\u2019s actions were such a flagrant violation of the rules that they warranted a 90-day suspension from Parliament, one of the longest ever imposed. A suspension of 10 days or more would have allowed his constituents to remove him from his seat in the House of Commons.Johnson escaped that sanction by resigning \u2014 \u201cat least for now,\u201d he said, hinting at a potential comeback. That could prove difficult. He faces being stripped of the lifetime pass to Parliament's buildings customarily given to former lawmakers.While some Conservatives still laud Johnson as the charismatic populist who led the party to a landslide victory in 2019, others recall how his government became so consumed by scandals that he was forced out by his own party less than three years later.His legacy is a headache for Sunak, a fellow Conservative who took office in October with a promise to restore professionalism and integrity to government.RecommendedBoris Johnson still more popular than Sunak among 2019 Tory voters, poll showsBoris Johnson punishment is \u2018overly harsh\u2019, Liz Truss saysWarburton formally quits as MP over cocaine use and harassment allegationsThe Conservatives, who have been in power since 2010, trail the main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls, with an election due by the end of 2024.The party faces electoral tests before that in four special elections for seats vacated by Johnson, two of his allies and a fourth Tory lawmaker who quit over sex and drugs allegations."}, {"_id": "64909b3851ac33155408ceea", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/northern-ireland-met-office-england-north-east-north-west-b2360123.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Heavy rain and thunderstorms forecast but temperature could hit 30C at weekend", "lead": "A yellow thunderstorm warning has been issued for Northern Ireland on Monday between 1pm and 8pm.", "author": "Jordan Reynolds", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:10:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:20.496937", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T10:10:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/11/0008baa5624a534496f485f5ac6089e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjU0NzU2-2.72664835.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We need a plan to transform our communities, not just tinker around the edges.\u201dOn average, Government funding fell in real term since 2015/16 across all types of councils, with reductions slowing since 2019-20.Funding began to increase in 2020-21 but councils\u2019 growing reliance on council tax and other revenue to cover costs means there is significant variation in the overall spending power of individual local authorities.Councils in more deprived areas, which have lower council tax bases generating less revenue, stress their higher levels of Government funding per person based on needs is not enough to address the inequality in resources available.Sigoma is campaigning for a new funding settlement for local authorities which enables long-term planning.Sigoma chairman Sir Stephen Houghton, who is Labour leader of Barnsley council, said single-year settlements create unnecessary uncertainty.He added: \u201cIn our manifesto released last month, we laid out how multi-year funding settlements would go some way to helping reduce this uncertainty and give councils confidence and the funding capabilities to address inflationary pressures by taking long-term investment decisions that are best for supporting their communities.\u201dThe survey found 45% of member councils had delayed capital projects and 35% said they had axed schemes they could no longer afford to finance this year.Sir Stephen added: \u201cCouncils are important drivers of local economic growth with big capital projects a vital part of the levelling up agenda.\u201cInflationary pressures are significantly impacting construction costs, and many of our members are having to scale back projects or cancel them outright due to funding uncertainty.\u201cInstead of spreading relatively small pots of funding across the whole country, as has been the case with levelling up funding, the Government needs to provide targeted funding to ensure these vital projects can go ahead as originally planned, as well as deliver wider reforms to the process, including reducing the number of bidding contests and focusing on supporting the areas that are most in need of regeneration funding over the long term.\u201dA Government spokesperson said: \u201cCouncils in England will benefit from almost \u00a360 billion to deliver vital frontline services with an average funding increase of 9.4% over this financial year.\u201cThe final settlement for local government ensures the most relatively deprived areas of England receive 17% more funding per household than the least deprived.\u201cLevelling up is a long-term programme of reform that is breathing life into overlooked communities, whether it is record investment in town centres and high streets or devolving more money and power to the regions.\u201dRecommendedLargest hybrid and double-ended ferry in world starts English Channel crossingsWarburton formally quits as MP over cocaine use and harassment allegationsSNP Westminster leader supports keeping \u2018incredibly talented\u2019 Sturgeon in partyRecent research by LG Improve based on the accounts of 109 councils showed cash reserves available to councils as a percentage of net revenue expenditure \u2013 a key indicator of financial resilience \u2013 fell by an average of 11% in 2022/23 compared to the previous year.Unitary councils and metropolitan boroughs saw annual average reductions in reserves of between 13% and 18%."}, {"_id": "64909b3951ac33155408cef0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/suella-braverman-police-stop-and-search-b2359804.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Suella Braverman urges police to \u2018ramp up\u2019 use of controversial stop and search", "lead": "<p>Campaigners slam home secretary\u2019s \u2018deeply irresponsible\u2019 comments as they warn it will target Black and ethnic minority communities </p>", "author": "Martha McHardy", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 09:06:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:21.584798", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T09:06:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/12/ce821784c850501d358665299b9fbdaeY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODI3Mzk1-2.72300858.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The organisation told The Independent that increasing its use \u201cwill worsen existing divisions between police and communities at a time when public trust and confidence in the police is at a serious low\u201d.The campaign group added that the practice is \u201cineffective\u201d at reducing knife crime and said powers should be rolled back by the government.The Home Office says it is putting \u201csafeguards\u201d in place on stop and search powers, including a requirement for police to \u201ccommunicate with the local community\u201d when a Section 60 order is being introduced, unless this would hinder a sensitive operation.Section 60 powers give officers the right to search people without reasonable grounds in an area when they expect serious violence, and to look for weapons before they can be used, or those used in a recent attack. The safeguards also include a requirement for data to be collected on every stop and search interaction.In her letter, Ms Braverman said: \u201cCarrying weapons is a scourge on our society, and anyone doing so is risking their own lives as well as the lives of those around them.\u201cThis dangerous culture must be brought to a stop.\u201cMy first priority is to keep the public safe, and people who insist on carrying a weapon must know that there will be consequences.\u201cThe police have my full support to ramp up the use of stop and search, wherever necessary, to prevent violence and save more lives.\u201dBlack people are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than their white peers  (PA)She added that she backs the police in tackling knife crime among young Black males.\u201cEvery death from knife crime is a tragedy,\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I also back the police in tackling this blight in communities which are disproportionately affected, such as among young Black males. We need to do everything in our power to crack down on this violence.\u201dMs Cooper said Ms Braverman said: \u201cKnife crime has shot up after 13 years of the Tories, with the biggest increases in the suburbs and counties, destroying lives and devastating families.\u201cThe decimation of neighbourhood policing, cuts to youth prevention work, lack of a proper serious violence strategy and lack of action on organised crime under the Tories has allowed knife crime to go up across all communities,\u201d she added.Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: \u201cThe home secretary\u2019s call for ramped-up use of these ineffective and discriminatory powers is deeply irresponsible. It will worsen existing divisions between police and communities at a time when public trust and confidence in the police is at a serious low.\u201cInstead of encouraging greater use, the government should be rolling back police powers like stop and search. \u201cAnd we need to roll back the powers of the police so no one faces harsh and traumatising treatment at the hands of police.\u201dRecommendedChild refugees detained by UK at risk of PTSD, health bodies warnSuella Braverman lays flowers in tribute to Nottingham victimsMother of Nottingham victim urges city to \u2018hold no hate\u2019 at emotional vigilA report last year by His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that the Metropolitan Police were failing to record stop and search grounds adequately.Meanwhile, the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), said in January last year that police chiefs must overhaul their use of stop and search to address its \u201ctraumatic\u201d and disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups."}, {"_id": "64909b3951ac33155408cef1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nicola-sturgeon-humza-yousaf-police-scotland-scottish-first-minister-b2360089.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "SNP Westminster leader supports keeping \u2018incredibly talented\u2019 Sturgeon in party", "lead": "Stephen Flynn hailed the former Scottish first minister as an \u2018incredibly talented politician\u2019.", "author": "Katrine Bussey", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:55:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:21.767483", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T08:55:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/10/19093106-743ea289-1053-4caf-b801-7a3eb22684a1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Chesil Cliff House in Croyde, Devon, divides opinion locally to this day. It is certainly a spectacular creation \u2013 a clean-lined art deco affair, all white and glass, with a four-storey tower that recalls the lighthouse originally on the site.Edward Short is still paying off some of the money he borrowed for the ambitious building project (Tom Wren SWNS)Sitting right on the cliff edge, it has triple-glazed floor-to-ceiling windows that give panoramic sea views and an infinity pool.In 2019, it was featured on Channel 4\u2019s Grand Designs, dubbed by viewers the \u201csaddest ever\u201d episode, as it showed the family borrowing \u00a3500,000 from a hedge fund, then another \u00a32.5m from private investors. This was for a smaller house built first, next to the main development, so that he could secure a larger loan.

Not only is Chesil Cliff House, which has never been lived in, up for sale for a second time after a first planned deal failed to go ahead but the build cost the couple their 20-year marriage.The rooms in the tower have panoramic views (Knight Frank)Amid rocketing costs, crippling debts, and sleepless nights, Mr Short was put under increasing pressure that he said ultimately contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Hazel.While he caveated the build was not the sole reason the couple\u2019s marriage ended, he told The Sun last July he regrets the stress his \u201cmessed-up dreams\u201d put on his wife and two daughters, Nicole and Lauren.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt what I put Hazel through was horrendous,\u201d said the former music industry sales executive. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guilt about that. But there was no way out, once we started. If we didn\u2019t finish we\u2019d have been in big trouble.\u201cIt was awful for the family because I pulled the stability rug from under them, without being able to give answers of how we were going to get out of it, other than that I had to carry on.\u201dThe house is pile-driven to save it from falling into the sea when the cliffs erode (Knight Frank)The ambitious scheme was hugely expensive and as the cost of the work spiralled over the years, Mr Short was reportedly \u00a37m in debt at one point.There was also scepticism about it locally. When the Shorts first knocked down the 1950s house on the site and the diggers and lorries descended, there was much muttering about the disruption.Mr Short brushed off concerns about coastal erosion leaving the house at risk of falling into the sea, saying if it hung over the cliff edge, it would be dramatic.But during the application for planning permission, local objections included that lights shining through the windows would dazzle drivers on the main road above, as well as loss of uninterrupted views of the cliffs.And then there was the huge cost, which managed to put some local noses out of joint. Walls of windows are designed to let light in and give an airy feel (Knight Frank)Any potential buyer would need to fork out an estimated \u00a310m in all for the property \u2013 \u00a37.5m for the main house, and a sum to be negotiated, but thought to be around \u00a32.5m \u2013 for the three-bedroom annexe next door. \u201cIt\u2019s over the top,\u201d said Braunton parish councillor Derrick Spear of the design. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s avant-garde \u2013 or, more likely, it doesn\u2019t blend in with its surroundings, in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\u201cHere we are trying to get affordable homes \u2013 which there\u2019s a great need for around here \u2013 but this is obviously a home for a very wealthy person,\u201d added Mr Spear, who said he was horrified by the estimated price tag.The house is at Saunton on the coast (Google Maps)But the television show brought a turnaround in local attitudes, as people saw the human story that unfolded behind the years of building.\u201cAfter the documentary came out, there was a huge lots of sympathy for Ed,\u201d says one north Devon resident. \u201cHe used to be a parish councillor and I knew him a bit. I can\u2019t speak for the people of Croyde, but before the programme people were concerned over the cranes for a long time, the size. For neighbours any building site is difficult.\u201cBut what he\u2019s done is great. The actual building now is fantastic. It just took a long time.\u201dThe infinity pool with views of the sea  (Knight Frank)Even after all these years, the house itself is still not quite ready to live in, with the kitchen still needing work. According to agent Knight Frank, it \u201chas been finished as an exciting blank canvas, giving the new owner the opportunity to design their own interior fit-out\u201d. The agent\u2019s brochure describes Chesil Cliff House as \u201cthe perfect property to enjoy watching the sunsets, the dramatic storms and the surfers on Down End Point\u201d. And privacy at \u201cone of the UK\u2019s most spectacular newly built coastal homes\u201d is paramount, it says.To this day, opinions in the area are still divided. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d wrote one user on Facebook when the episode was aired again. \u201cThe rotunda looks great,\u201d wrote another.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen Edward and Hazel Short put their life savings into building their fantasy home on the coast, they hoped it would change their lives for the better and give their two children a fabulous childhood.Instead, more than 10 years on the luxury house is up for sale, the couple\u2019s marriage is over and millionaire Mr Short is still paying off some of the money he borrowed for the ambitious building project. Chesil Cliff House in Croyde, Devon, divides opinion locally to this day. It is certainly a spectacular creation \u2013 a clean-lined art deco affair, all white and glass, with a four-storey tower that recalls the lighthouse originally on the site.Edward Short is still paying off some of the money he borrowed for the ambitious building project (Tom Wren SWNS)Sitting right on the cliff edge, it has triple-glazed floor-to-ceiling windows that give panoramic sea views and an infinity pool.In 2019, it was featured on Channel 4\u2019s Grand Designs, dubbed by viewers the \u201csaddest ever\u201d episode, as it showed the family borrowing \u00a3500,000 from a hedge fund, then another \u00a32.5m from private investors. This was for a smaller house built first, next to the main development, so that he could secure a larger loan. RecommendedKevin McCloud\u2019s clever tips for adding value to your homeThe best Airbnbs in Devon for a summer staycationTV review, Grand Designs: House of the Year (Channel 4): When minimalism is just too muchThe Shorts\u2019 daughters said they were even holding car boot sales to raise money to put towards their parents\u2019 dream luxury build.However, as presenter Kevin McCloud said in the introduction to the episode: \u201cIf a lighthouse has a single message that it shouts out, it is this: \u2018Stay away \u2013 or risk destruction\u2019.\u201dHis warning carried perhaps even more portent than he realised. Not only is Chesil Cliff House, which has never been lived in, up for sale for a second time after a first planned deal failed to go ahead but the build cost the couple their 20-year marriage.The rooms in the tower have panoramic views (Knight Frank)Amid rocketing costs, crippling debts, and sleepless nights, Mr Short was put under increasing pressure that he said ultimately contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Hazel.While he caveated the build was not the sole reason the couple\u2019s marriage ended, he told The Sun last July he regrets the stress his \u201cmessed-up dreams\u201d put on his wife and two daughters, Nicole and Lauren.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt what I put Hazel through was horrendous,\u201d said the former music industry sales executive. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guilt about that. But there was no way out, once we started. If we didn\u2019t finish we\u2019d have been in big trouble.\u201cIt was awful for the family because I pulled the stability rug from under them, without being able to give answers of how we were going to get out of it, other than that I had to carry on.\u201dThe house is pile-driven to save it from falling into the sea when the cliffs erode (Knight Frank)The ambitious scheme was hugely expensive and as the cost of the work spiralled over the years, Mr Short was reportedly \u00a37m in debt at one point.There was also scepticism about it locally. When the Shorts first knocked down the 1950s house on the site and the diggers and lorries descended, there was much muttering about the disruption.Mr Short brushed off concerns about coastal erosion leaving the house at risk of falling into the sea, saying if it hung over the cliff edge, it would be dramatic.But during the application for planning permission, local objections included that lights shining through the windows would dazzle drivers on the main road above, as well as loss of uninterrupted views of the cliffs.And then there was the huge cost, which managed to put some local noses out of joint. Walls of windows are designed to let light in and give an airy feel (Knight Frank)Any potential buyer would need to fork out an estimated \u00a310m in all for the property \u2013 \u00a37.5m for the main house, and a sum to be negotiated, but thought to be around \u00a32.5m \u2013 for the three-bedroom annexe next door. \u201cIt\u2019s over the top,\u201d said Braunton parish councillor Derrick Spear of the design. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s avant-garde \u2013 or, more likely, it doesn\u2019t blend in with its surroundings, in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\u201cHere we are trying to get affordable homes \u2013 which there\u2019s a great need for around here \u2013 but this is obviously a home for a very wealthy person,\u201d added Mr Spear, who said he was horrified by the estimated price tag.The house is at Saunton on the coast (Google Maps)But the television show brought a turnaround in local attitudes, as people saw the human story that unfolded behind the years of building.\u201cAfter the documentary came out, there was a huge lots of sympathy for Ed,\u201d says one north Devon resident. \u201cHe used to be a parish councillor and I knew him a bit. I can\u2019t speak for the people of Croyde, but before the programme people were concerned over the cranes for a long time, the size. For neighbours any building site is difficult.\u201cBut what he\u2019s done is great. The actual building now is fantastic. It just took a long time.\u201dThe infinity pool with views of the sea  (Knight Frank)Even after all these years, the house itself is still not quite ready to live in, with the kitchen still needing work. According to agent Knight Frank, it \u201chas been finished as an exciting blank canvas, giving the new owner the opportunity to design their own interior fit-out\u201d. The agent\u2019s brochure describes Chesil Cliff House as \u201cthe perfect property to enjoy watching the sunsets, the dramatic storms and the surfers on Down End Point\u201d. And privacy at \u201cone of the UK\u2019s most spectacular newly built coastal homes\u201d is paramount, it says.To this day, opinions in the area are still divided. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d wrote one user on Facebook when the episode was aired again. \u201cThe rotunda looks great,\u201d wrote another. Others branded it an \u201ceyesore\u201d and wondered how permission was ever granted. \u201cToo close to the water\u2019s edge for my liking,\u201d was one comment.The sea appears to come right up to the house (Knight Frank )The local MP, Selaine Saxby, said she was frustrated by the high number of empty properties in the area, including holiday homes, but she had not had complaints about Chesil Cliff House. \u201cEveryone recognises the difficulties behind it and wants to see finished,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad when they\u2019re sitting empty \u2013 properties need life breathed into them.\u201dA decade on, Mr Short himself is upbeat - about his life and the property.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere has been further gloom for homeowners and renters this week as the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for a thirteenth consecutive time on Thursday. Rishi Sunak has ruled out Treasury support for mortgage holders, insisting instead that the government will \u201cstick to the plan\u201d in briging inflation down.Banks recently reacted to signs of stubborn inflation by pulling mortgage deals and raising rates, while polling suggested nearly half of borrowers fear they will struggle with their housing re-payments within 12 months.With markets betting on interest rates hitting nearly 6 per cent within months and government borrowing costs surpassing even the peak seen during Liz Truss\u2019s mini-Budget meltdown, ministers urged banks this week to act to protect mortgage-holders struggling with repayments.One expert told The Independent that the chaos was \u201cgoing to sting a lot of people\u201d and warned that renters will ultimately feel the greatest impact, despite predicting that banks \u201cwill fall over themselves to come up with ways not to repossess\u201d people\u2019s homes.How much have mortgage rates risen by?RecommendedWe\u2019re being softened up for more interest rate risesStudent sentenced for raping \u2018intoxicated\u2019 woman in his Cardiff residenceDavid Cameron accused of \u2018appalling failure\u2019 on Covid preparedness - liveHomeowners have already faced stark rises in their bills, with recent Labour analysis claiming that typical interest repayments have risen by \u00a3150 per week \u2013 or \u00a37,000 a year \u2013 since last September\u2019s mini-Budget spooked markets.With the Bank of England now expected to hike rates even more steeply than anticipated after inflation failed to fall as predicted last month, the Centre for Economics and Business Research think-tank (CEBR) now expects the the two-year 75 per cent loan-to-value mortgage rate to hit an average of 5.1 per cent in 2023.Rates for fixed-rate home loans have surged by 0.5 per cent in the past few weeks alone, according to the analytics firm MoneyFacts.

Hopefully inflation will ease quickly and [Bank of England base rate] won\u2019t have to go as high as the market is currently suggesting.\u201dAccording to broker London Money, mortgage repayments for borrowers whose existing deals have come to an end are about 26 per cent a month higher on average, The Times reported.Mr Stuart of HSBC said there was \u201cno doubt that people are really having to rethink their personal finances\u201d, adding: \u201cIf you've got an old rate as many will have of say 1.5 per cent and you're going to come off that rate and go onto something like 5 per cent, that is a big impact on your monthly budget.\u201dHow could lenders react to rising rates?With many homeowners confronting \u201cthe ice-cold reality of 2023 rates\u201d, how banks react will be crucial. Buying agent and property expert Henry Pryor told The Independent that he believes lenders \u201cwant to be seen to be helping\u201d their customers to avoid being seen as \u201cvillians\u201d following the financial crisis.The Bank of Engand is expected to raise interest rates even further next week  (PA)Mr Pryor said: \u201cClearly existing mortgage holders \u2013 in particular those on fixed rate products \u2013 will experience a Wim Hof moment when the ice-cold reality of 2023 rates lands on their door mat or inbox. \u201cWhen they took out their two or five-year fixed mortgage they will have been stress-tested to check that they could afford rates up to 7 per cent even if they didn\u2019t expect it to ever happen.\u201cI think most will cut back and economise to ensure that they continue to meet the higher payments, very few will want to experience repossession. For those who can\u2019t lenders will fall over themselves to come up with ways not to repossess. \u201cThey will extend 25 year mortgages to 30 or 35 years. They will move borrowers over to interest only payments for say 5 years \u2013 anything to avoid once again becoming the villains of the piece as they were in 2009 after the global financial crash. \u201cBanks have only just been welcomed back into polite society having been bailed out of their mess. This time they want to be seen to be helping where necessary even if they will still make a profit on their assistance.\u201dHow will this affect renters?Renters are also expected to bear the brunt of rising rates, with concerns that dwindling profits could see a mass departure of landlords and properties from the market \u2013 many of whom have already pushed up rents to cover their costs.\u201cTenants will find their landlords looking pale if they have a mortgage as many buy-to-let investors do,\u201d Mr Pryor said. \u201cMost will try and charge more rent but it seems unlikely that tenants will be able to afford much more. Some will then sell up giving their tenant notice. \u201cThis will add to the current demand for rental properties and push rents up further. Tenants can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t borrow to pay their rent and some are going to find it harder than mortgage borrowers who can at least sell up and downsize.\u201dWarning that \u201cthis is going to sting a lot of people\u201d, Mr Pryor predicted that many of those with a mortgage \u2013 amounting to around a third of households \u2013 \u201cwill see a drop back in their standard of living as they cut back to afford\u201d it.However, \u201cwe will doubtless see the biggest impact\u201d in the private rental sector, including homelessness for some of the roughly four million people who rent their homes, Mr Pryor warned.Will the government intervene?With concerns having grown in recent days, speculation has increased over whether the government could step in to help homeowners.New Statesman senior editor George Eaton said he \u201cwould not be surprised if the government ends up subsidising mortgages\u201d, while the Daily Telegraph\u2019s money advice editor Sam Brodbeck suggested it \u201cfeels like the [government] will be intervening sooner rather than later\u201d.While the strongest remarks from Downing Street were merely to say that it expected mortgage lenders to protect homeowners struggling with rate rises, housing minister Rachel Maclean appeared to claim on a BBC panel show that \u201ca mortgage support scheme\u201d is in the pipeline \u2013 but failed to provide any details.What can people do to stay on top of payments?RecommendedMore mortgage pain for homeowners as rates rise to highest since Truss mini-Budget disasterSNP: Tories and Labour \u2018in denial\u2019 over Brexit link to cost-of-living crisisPolling by YouGov for The Times this week found that 30 per cent of borrowers already find it \u201cdifficult\u201d to pay their mortgage, with 46 per cent expecting that to be the case in 12 months\u2019 time.There are a number of steps that people may be able to take to ease their mortgage repayments, such as: switching to interest-only deals, which means your capital balance will remain unpaid; seeking to extend their mortgage term if possible; seeking a \u2018consent to let\u2019 agreement from their lender to rent out their property; or seeking to use an offset mortgage to reduce interest payments.

Tenants can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t borrow to pay their rent and some are going to find it harder than mortgage borrowers who can at least sell up and downsize.\u201dWarning that \u201cthis is going to sting a lot of people\u201d, Mr Pryor predicted that many of those with a mortgage \u2013 amounting to around a third of households \u2013 \u201cwill see a drop back in their standard of living as they cut back to afford\u201d it.However, \u201cwe will doubtless see the biggest impact\u201d in the private rental sector, including homelessness for some of the roughly four million people who rent their homes, Mr Pryor warned.Will the government intervene?With concerns having grown in recent days, speculation has increased over whether the government could step in to help homeowners.New Statesman senior editor George Eaton said he \u201cwould not be surprised if the government ends up subsidising mortgages\u201d, while the Daily Telegraph\u2019s money advice editor Sam Brodbeck suggested it \u201cfeels like the [government] will be intervening sooner rather than later\u201d.While the strongest remarks from Downing Street were merely to say that it expected mortgage lenders to protect homeowners struggling with rate rises, housing minister Rachel Maclean appeared to claim on a BBC panel show that \u201ca mortgage support scheme\u201d is in the pipeline \u2013 but failed to provide any details.What can people do to stay on top of payments?RecommendedMore mortgage pain for homeowners as rates rise to highest since Truss mini-Budget disasterSNP: Tories and Labour \u2018in denial\u2019 over Brexit link to cost-of-living crisisPolling by YouGov for The Times this week found that 30 per cent of borrowers already find it \u201cdifficult\u201d to pay their mortgage, with 46 per cent expecting that to be the case in 12 months\u2019 time.There are a number of steps that people may be able to take to ease their mortgage repayments, such as: switching to interest-only deals, which means your capital balance will remain unpaid; seeking to extend their mortgage term if possible; seeking a \u2018consent to let\u2019 agreement from their lender to rent out their property; or seeking to use an offset mortgage to reduce interest payments.

I\u2019m not going to accept a situation where our planning system means it takes 13 years to build an offshore wind farm.\u201dIn his speech, Sir Keir is expected to make promises on planning reform, procurement and long-term finance.He will say: \u201cA new plan for a new settlement. A clear direction across all four nations. Pulling together for a simple, unifying priority: British power for British jobs.\u201cThis is the race of our lifetime \u2013 and the prize is real.\u201dThe party will hope the latest announcement builds confidence in its commitment to green energy initiatives after recently drawing criticism from environmental campaigners for retreating from its \u00a328bn-a-year green prosperity plan spending pledge.Labour had promised in 2021 to invest \u00a328bn a year until 2030 in\u00a0green\u00a0projects if it came to power.The figure will now be a target to work towards in the second half of a first parliament, the party has said, citing the changed economic backdrop of the last two years.Mr Sarwar said he wants Scotland and the UK to \u201clead the world in the green revolution\u201d as he spoke ahead of the party announcing more details about its plans.He told the BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show: \u201cWe want to use the strength of the UK treasury to legitimately deliver a green revolution in our country and our plans are rooted in four key principles, the first is more jobs not less jobs, second, lower bills not higher bills, third, greater energy security and less reliance on imports from despotic regimes like Russia, and fourth is climate leadership.\u201dThe Scottish Labour leader insisted there would be \u201cno cliff edge\u201d caused by the party\u2019s policy to ban new oil and gas extraction licences in the North Sea, which the Conservatives have said will lead to job losses, because all existing ones will be \u201chonoured\u201d.Environmental campaigners welcomed the plans, but warned they must be matched with adequate investment in order to succeed.Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWith plans for communities to benefit from local clean power projects and a commitment to lift the ban on onshore wind, Labour is saying many of the right things on energy policy.\u201cBut to have a credible climate plan in place, there can be no backsliding on pledges to stop new oil and gas extraction and invest in green growth.\u201cThe climate crisis is the greatest threat the world faces. Sir Keir Starmer needs to make it clear that the fossil fuels era is over, and the only viable future is a zero-carbon economy. This means urgently investing in a street-by-street insulation programme and cheap, homegrown renewables to cut emissions, boost the economy, create new jobs, increase energy security and help bring down our energy bills for good.\u201dMeanwhile, the Conservatives claimed the plan would appease \u201ceco-zealots\u201d and sought to draw links between Labour and Just Stop Oil, with which it has shared a donor.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveA party spokesman said: \u201cLabour\u2019s Energy Surrender Plan, written by Just Stop Oil, appeases their eco-zealot paymasters but does nothing for Britain\u2019s long-term energy security.\u201cYou cannot trust Labour to take tough decisions on Britain\u2019s energy security because Keir Starmer is a hostage to extremists in his party and his Just Stop Oil funders.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRishi Sunak is reportedly set to skip a debate of the damning report that found Boris Johnson lied over partygate, amid reignited anger over the scandal following a newly published video.The motion on the privileges committee\u2019s findings comes as Scotland Yard is \u201cconsidering\u201d the footage from a 2020 Christmas gathering at Conservative Party headquarters.Levelling up secretary Michael Gove, who has apologised for the video showing Tory staff dancing and joking about Covid restrictions, will also abstain from a vote.He said it was a matter for each individual MP to decide their own course of action over the committee findings \u2013 leaving the door open for other Conservatives to follow suit and potentially avoid casting a ballot.Whether or not a vote on the report takes place on Monday \u2013 which is incidentally the former prime minister\u2019s birthday \u2013 depends in part on how many Johnson loyalists decide to oppose the report.RecommendedThere is no escaping the mess the Conservatives are in \u2013 but the country must not suffer for itGove \u2018disagrees\u2019 with Privileges Committee conclusion and will abstain from voteBoris Johnson\u2019s latest resignation honours scandal is another reminder of Carrie\u2019s influenceThe former prime minister was urging his allies not to oppose it, arguing the sanctions have no practical effect, although critics argue the level of support shown for him would have been low anyway.Tory MPs will be given a free vote, but allies of Mr Johnson warned they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.Senior backbencher Bill Cash, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, said he would turn up to vote against the findings, citing the former prime minister\u2019s \u201chistoric achievements\u201d.But with at least three potentially damaging by-elections looming following the resignations of Mr Johnson, Nigel Adams and David Warburton, many could decide instead to spend Monday hitting the campaign trail.No 10 has\u00a0declined to say whether the prime minister will turn up to back the report, but he will be hosting a foreign leader in Downing Street on Monday which could give him an excuse not to take part.The Times and The Telegraph newspapers report he is expected to not to cast a vote on the committee\u2019s findings.In a scathing 108-page report, the cross-party group of MPs recommended a 90-day suspension for Mr Johnson\u2019s \u201crepeated contempts\u201d of Parliament had he not pre-emptively resigned.\u00a0 It also says he should be denied the parliamentary pass usually given to former MPs.The former Conservative leader has dismissed the findings of the committee, which he likened to a \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d as smacking of \u201cbias\u201d \u2013 attacks which led it to recommend a harsher sanction against him.If the report is not opposed then it could just be nodded through the Commons.The sanctions proposed by the Tory-majority committee are expected to pass regardless, with only a relatively small group of Johnson loyalists expected to oppose the report\u2019s findings.The debate comes after the Sunday Mirror obtained a video appearing to show Conservative staff dancing and joking about Covid restrictions at the height of the pandemic.The footage of the event, which happened when indoor socialising was banned and people across the country were separated from family and friends, poses a further setback to Mr Sunak\u2019s efforts to move on from his predecessor-but-one\u2019s legacy.It has also renewed accusations from opposition parties that the Prime Minister is \u201cweak\u201d for not intervening over Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation honours.Both former London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey and Tory aide Ben Mallet \u2013 who were handed a peerage and an OBE, respectively \u2013 attended the gathering.Mr Gove told the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the pair should not be stripped of their honours because rules allow outgoing prime ministers to make such appointments.The Metropolitan Police, which previously investigated the gathering and claimed there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to disprove the version of events provided by attendees,\u201d has said it is looking at the video.A spokesperson for the force said: \u201cWe are aware of the footage and are considering it.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east -

Conduct Authority study putting the total number of those up against it as high as 10 million.While inflation did finally drop down from 10.1 per cent to 8.7 per cent in May, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high as domestic finances continue to be stretched following a long winter of sky-high energy bills.The most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows food prices increasing at their fastest rate in almost 45 years for the year to April, with around 44 per cent of adults saying they have responded by spending less on the groceries

noticed an increase in their cost of living within the past month and 97 per cent say they have been impacted by rising grocery costs.Below, we look at what support is available to households this July.RecommendedJune dates for DWP cost of living payments, benefits and pensionsBanks should increase returns on savings amid interest rate rises, says top ToryAsda freezes prices on more than 500 products until end of AugustHomeowners warned to expect more mortgage pain after wage growth shoots upExtra \u00a31,350 of support being paid outDespite the expiration of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Energy Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013

be going out as normal in July, with no bank holidays scheduled to confuse delivery dates.Anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP can expect their money on the usual date this month.Universal creditState pensionPension creditDisability living allowancePersonal independence paymentAttendance allowanceCarer\u2019s allowanceEmployment support allowanceIncome

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "64909b3c51ac33155408cf02", "url":

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "64909b3d51ac33155408cf03", "url":

Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from countries like Australia, New Zealand, the US, South Africa, Chile, Costa Rica and France to assist the exhausted Canadian crews.As The Independent has previously reported, misinformation spreads quickly on TikTok during ongoing disasters, thanks in part to public distrust of government officials and an increasingly anti-science bent in US politics.\u201cSocial media can be helpful.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritish wild card Ryan Peniston sprung another surprise at the cinch Championships \u2013 and gave Andy Murray a Wimbledon boost \u2013 with a straight-sets win over Ugo Humbert.Essex lad Peniston, currently ranked a lowly 265, shocked top seed and world number five Casper Ruud at Queen\u2019s Club last year on his way to the quarter-finals.The 27-year-old found the grass of west London to his liking again as he secured a place in the second round, and a potential meeting with second-seed Holger Rune, with an impressive 6-4 6-2 victory.\u201cI loved playing here last year, so to come back, it feels pretty comfortable to be on the court. It\u2019s just amazing,\u201d said Peniston.\u201cI was nervous \u2013 I was more nervous last year.

He said, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do it\u2019. It was pretty simple,\u201d said Norrie.\u201cI\u2019m just going to enjoy it and get another match on the grass and hopefully just pick his brains on a few things. Obviously he\u2019s got a lot of confidence at the moment, a good guy to play with.\u201dThere was first-round disappointment for British number two Dan Evans, who lost 6-4 7-5 to American Sebastian Korda.It was a seventh defeat in eight matches for Evans and the 33-year-old was not exactly upbeat about his chances at Wimbledon.\u201cI have to compete harder than I did today and be better mentally. But it\u2019s becoming difficult to do that with the amount of losses,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and also a little bit embarrassing. So there\u2019s a lot of emotion in that.

Wayne Rooney did but Bryan Robson didn\u2019t. Marcus Rashford, along with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw, is likely to join a select group of Manchester United players, those who have represented England at Old Trafford. Face North Macedonia on Monday and for Rashford, like Gary Neville before him, it could be a still more special occasion, for a Mancunian and a United fan.It feels a fitting place for Rashford\u2019s season of renaissance to end. His revival gathered pace at the World Cup when, after going 16 months without representing England, he scored 49 seconds after coming on against Iran and scored three goals in only 137 minutes. Twenty of his career-best total of 30 club goals came at Old Trafford. England\u2019s first game on his home turf for 16 years feels well-timed for the recent recipient of United\u2019s Sir Matt Busby award as their player of the year.And yet Rashford\u2019s relationship with his country feels more complicated. He has an unwanted reputation for pulling out of squads for friendlies and went on holiday to New York in March when injured; Gareth Southgate had no problem with that and does not question his commitment. \u201cHe does love playing for England, he\u2019s very proud to play for England and I\u2019m sure an England game at Old Trafford will be a special moment for him,\u201d he said.Marcus Rashford\u2019s complicated England relationship could be at turning pointGareth Southgate admits the Man Utd forward isn\u2019t the easiest person to read but a breakthrough may be coming Mike Jones19 June 2023 18:201687194931England vs North Macedonia predictionEngland to take another step towards the finals in Germany next summer with a straight-forward victory by at least a couple of goals.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGareth Southgate will likely rotate his England squad when they take on North Macedonia in a Euro 2024 qualifier at Old Trafford tonight. England romped to a 4-0 win against Malta on Friday to keep up their 100% winning run in qualifying. They sit top of Group C ahead of North Macedonia\u2019s visit. The Three Lions can now claim a fourth successive win in Euro 2024 qualifying having already beaten Italy and Ukraine too.Questions remain over Bukayo Saka\u2019s fitness, after he left the field at half-time against Malta, and there are a number of squad players hoping to start this evening\u2019s game. Marcus Rashford is one, but he faces competition from Jack Grealish and James Maddison, while Gareth Southgate must decide whether to utilise Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield once again after his superb performance in Malta last time out.

The Three Lions have won eleven of their 17 games at the home of Manchester United, although haven\u2019t won either of their last two (D1 L1), one of which was against North Macedonia in October 2006.Mike Jones19 June 2023 19:101687197931England vs North MacedoniaEngland have lost just one of their last 60 qualifying matches for the World Cup/European Championship (W48 D11), losing 2-1 at Czech Republic in October 2019. At home, the Three Lions are unbeaten in 34 such matches (W30 D4) since a 3-2 loss to Croatia in November 2007.Mike Jones19 June 2023 19:051687197631Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment means England may have found their \u2018quarterback\u2019If ever there was a night to try things, it was this, and so it was for Trent Alexander-Arnold. Playing in a role that was more quarterback than that associated with the No 10 on his shirt, the Liverpool star decorated an otherwise drab 4-0 win over Malta with a series of sublime balls. One of those was a brilliant strike to make it 2-0, as Alexander-Arnold at least gave Gareth Southgate something to think about from a game almost everyone else will instantly forget.There is of course a danger in reading too much into a game as utterly routine as this, but you might say it\u2019s a start. That\u2019s actually been rare enough with Alexander-Arnold for England, since this was remarkably only his 19th appearance.If these sort of matches have always provoked debate about whether they should even be taking place, such is the extent of the mismatch, the one element of tension is how long it will take the superior side to score. Southgate had direct knowledge of that given it was his last match in this stadium that was one of his most dismal nights with England. A goalless first half led to away fans booing and cries that the team were \u201csh*t\u201d.Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment means England may have found their \u2018quarterback\u2019Malta 0-4 England: Alexander-Arnold impressed in a midfield role on a night where England cruised to an expected winMike Jones19 June 2023 19:001687197331England vs North MacedoniaEngland have won their last eleven home European Championship qualifiers by an aggregate score of 40-4.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UFC is home to some of the best mixed martial artists on the planet, so it is no surprise that fans often debate how the elite fighters compare to one another.Alongside its weekly-updated rankings for each weight class, the UFC has its own pound-for-pound rankings, containing 15 names \u2013 as with each list for every division.Here, The Independent has constructed its own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s UFC fighters, to be updated throughout the year. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.Before diving into the top 10, here are a couple of honourable mentions:RecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearBest seat in the house: UFC\u2019s commentary team on what it\u2019s like to be cageside for the biggest fights in the world\u2018The only rules? No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornColby Covington (17-3, welterweight)The former interim welterweight champion is one of the best 170lbers on the planet. While the American, 35, has lost both of his shots at undisputed gold, he pushed then-champion Kamaru Usman to the brink in both fights. Covington, a wrestling specialist, responded to his second defeat by Usman with a dominant points win over friend-turned-rival Jorge Masvidal in March 2022. He has not fought since.Stipe Miocic (20-4, heavyweight)The consensus heavyweight GOAT, the part-time firefighter holds the record for most successful title defences in the division \u2013 the hardest weight class at which to put together a sustained run. The American surrendered the belt to Francis Ngannou and the French-Cameroonian\u2019s freakish knockout power in March 2021, but prior to that achieved back-to-back wins against one of the greatest ever in Daniel Cormier. The veteran, 40, also holds a decision victory over Ngannou, plus wins against more UFC champions in Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Werdum and Andrei Arlovski. However, he has dropped out of our top 10 due to two years of inactivity. Miocic is expected to return in July, to challenge current heavyweight champion Jon Jones.Brandon Moreno (20-6-2, flyweight champion)Mexico\u2019s first ever UFC champion has just one loss in the last five years, though he has also competed in two competitive draws in that period \u2013 the most recent kickstarting the most entertaining run of his career. There was no winner when Moreno challenged Deiveson Figueiredo in 2020, but the \u201cAssassin Baby\u201d submitted the Brazilian in their 2021 rematch to win the gold. Figueiredo wrestled the belt back in a close trilogy bout last year, but Moreno claimed the interim title by stopping Kai Kara-France and went on to stop Figueiredo again this January. In doing so, he became a two-time undisputed champion.Top 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally.9. Robert Whittaker (24-6, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just twice in the last eight years. Both of those losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but each has come against a former world champion, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around). An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (25-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski is riding a 22-fight winning streak  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro loss came against a welterweight champion, until this February. Seven of the Australian\u2019s last eight fights have pitted him against \u2018elite\u2019 fighters, and in 2022 Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that title \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as Chad Mendes and Brian Ortega.RecommendedHow Ciryl Gane\u2019s Jon Jones dream turned into a nightmareJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "64909b4051ac33155408cf15", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/next-ufc-fight-event-june-schedule-2023-b2360142.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Next UFC Fight Night: Event start time, card and how to watch", "lead": "<p>All you need to know about the MMA promotion\u2019s upcoming fights</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:46:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:28.739544", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:46:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/19/23/8645f6e4df4978f3841fa564059b776aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ3ODE3Nzgx-2.65946822.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe heavyweight division is a bad pantomime now with Tyson Fury, Oleksandr Usyk, a chorus of fighters, a few promoters and some hefty backers all trying to work out what part of the dancing horse they are. Moving away from the ugly sisters, there is every chance that the gap between the last championship fight and the next will be the longest in over 50 years. This break is not common, ignore people telling you that. Fury defended his WBC title last December against his old, old friend, Derek Chisora, and Usyk beat Anthony Joshua for the second time last August in Saudi Arabia to retain his IBF, WBA and WBO titles. Fury has no date, just social media plans, and Usyk is due to defend in Poland in late August against Daniel Dubois. It is hard to find a solitary reason for the break and even more difficult to put the blame on just one single person. There are a lot of people on the stage, and they all have a role to play. And to be honest, during the last six months they have all said too much. Sure, greed, rivalries, stupidity, lies and ego are at the very core of the problem, but boxing at the highest level has always had the same flaws, the same fluid obstacles. The standard excuses are there to overcome - that is how boxing works. RecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesWhy has Saudi Arabia become big player in world sport and what does future hold?Fury and Usyk for all the tarnished marbles was meant to have been signed and sealed last September. It was scheduled for April and is now a plan for December. Both boxers have insulted the other, and the theme of their mutual abuse is simple: greed. Obviously, both deny they are the greedy, money-grabbing party in the sad affair. Actually, the righteous outrage from both sides is comedy gold at times. Fury\u2019s father, the unstoppable \u201cGypsy John\u201d Fury, has demanded that Usyk apologise for his criticism. He has warned that if there is no apology, there might be a straightener in a field somewhere, man-to-man. There is honour at stake. It is endless mirth, it really is. Fury (right) beat Derek Chisora in December to stay unbeaten and retain the WBC heavyweight title (Zac Goodwin/PA) (PA Wire)c. Some of boxing\u2019s wisest, richest and smartest brains have been involved in this ongoing lunacy. The men and women in the Fury camp blame Usyk, and the men and women in the Usyk camp blame Fury. The two main players in the Fury business, Bob Arum and Frank Warren, have a combined total of 98 years of promotion; they are both battling this madness. There is, according to some insiders, a one-off offer on the table from the government of Saudi Arabia for Fury and Usyk to fight there at the end of the year. Usyk has signed his deal. This offer is non-negotiable, and we know this because the media flown out to Saudi by the Saudi government have reported it as fact. As a guide to the way boxing works, there are seldom any facts involved when deals are being made, broken and made again. The real insiders are furious that Usyk and Fury, the biggest fight in boxing, is not yet across the line. The sanctioning bodies, who get paid a fee for fights, have promised to get tough with their heavyweight champions, but have not said a word or done a thing; everyone is holding out for a slice of the Saudi cash pie. \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a business,\u2019 they will say, but that little claim is wearing very thin. Usyk (right) last fought in August, outpointing Anthony Joshua for the second fight in a row  (Getty Images)Fury, meanwhile, has mentioned 10 possible opponents in his social media rants in the last few weeks, including a plan to fight two UFC icons in one night. Usyk and Dubois went to purse bids, which is one of boxing\u2019s ancient rituals, and Usyk\u2019s team won. The fight is scheduled for August. Looking in from the side of the crowded stage is Joshua. His fight with Fury was announced by Fury on 10 June, 2020; it would have been a fight for the ages, for all the belts and all the bragging rights. It never happened and it has come close a couple of times since then. Joshua, meanwhile, will fight in August and it might be Dillian Whyte. There is a rumour that Whyte wants too much for the fight; the flip side of that rumour is that Whyte was offered too little. In America, Deontay Wilder, twice beaten in classics by Fury, has not fought since last October. There is a plan, under the Saudi deal, for Wilder to fight Joshua in Saudi Arabia on the same night as Usyk and Fury fight. There is, so the paid publicists insist, a total purse of $400million on the table for the four boxers to split. It must be a strong table.

Prior to that defeat, however, Emmett was on a fine win streak, and the American might even re-enter the title picture with an impressive win on Saturday.He faces a tough test in Topuria, though, with the 26-year-old entering Las Vegas this weekend with a 13-0 professional record, including 12 stoppage wins. Most recently, the Georgian overcame Bryce Mitchell in December, stunning the submission specialist by forcing him to tap out. With that win, Topuria entered the top 10 at featherweight, and he can take another step forwards this weekend.An undisputed champion will be crowned in July, when Rodriguez challenges official champion Alexander Volkanovski, and the winner of Saturday\u2019s main event may even mark themselves out as the next contender for the gold.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cOne month before the fight, we were so happy; it was a dream,\u201d Ciryl Gane reminisces. Then comes a laugh. \u201cOne minute after the fight, it was a nightmare.\u201dIt is easy to forget, but the hype around Gane\u2019s title fight with Jon Jones in March was not based on the latter\u2019s long-awaited return alone. There was genuine anticipation for what could have been an intriguing contest between a light-heavyweight great, in Jones, and a heavyweight contender who moves like a welterweight, in Gane. Once the fight started, however, that intrigue was extinguished within moments. Gane, failing to do himself justice \u2013 as he would tell you \u2013 was taken down early and submitted as the clock ticked past the two-minute mark. \u201cMy coach told me every day, every time, every training [session]: \u2018Don\u2019t throw the backhand,\u2019\u201d Gane tells The Independent. \u201c\u2018If you want, [throw] the jab \u2013 maybe the uppercut \u2013 but not the backhand.\u2019 I threw the backhand, he caught me.\u201dRecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett live stream: How to watch UFC Fight Night online and on TV this weekendIndeed, Jones dipped his head off the centre line as Gane overcommitted to a left cross, then engulfed the 33-year-old, hauling him to the canvas \u2013 weighing down on Gane with every ounce of his new, 248lbs heavyweight frame. Once Gane had been forced to the fence, there was no escape. Jones locked in a guillotine choke, and before the fans in Las Vegas had time to comprehend what had happened, the American had forced his opponent to tap. The vacant heavyweight title was vacant no longer.To many onlookers, Jones\u2019s status as the greatest ever was confirmed within those 124 seconds. And what of Gane, the former interim champion who was sitting with his back against the cage, staring up at his victorious opponent, and coming to terms with a second loss in an undisputed-title fight? The Frenchman was, suddenly, no longer an example of the \u2018modern\u2019 heavyweight, and instead a kickboxer with a gaping hole in his game\u00a0\u2013 a gap that Jones had exploited mercilessly.Jones controls Gane before submitting the Frenchman to win the vacant UFC heavyweight title  (Getty Images)\u201cI was confident in this position [on the mat],\u201d Gane insists, \u201cbut I did [something] wrong. When we went back to the gym after the fight, we did only wrestling and grappling, every day. I was already confident, but I know it\u2019s really normal to be more confident and have better reflexes when you do something every day. This is gonna help me for sure.\u201dTechnical faults can be addressed, of course, but fighters sometimes suffer from intangible issues in bouts of this magnitude \u2013 in moments of this magnitude \u2013 that can define results and careers, and that are less easily expelled. \u201cIt was really difficult to explain,\u201d Gane says. \u201cPeople asked me if I felt a lot of pressure during the fight, during the press conference, the waiting... Did you see me afraid? No, I was really happy to be there! I wanted to fight against the GOAT and prove that I\u2019m a good fighter. In the cage, in front of the opponent, everybody saw me really confident. But when we started, and during the fight, something switched \u2013 I don\u2019t know exactly why. I couldn\u2019t manage the distance, I was not there. I think when you have a bad feeling, it\u2019s harder to be good technically.\u201cI was not \u2018here\u2019,\u201d Gane stresses again. \u201cIt was not me, it just was not me \u2013 everybody knows that. That\u2019s why today, when everybody asks me if I want revenge: Yes, I want revenge, just because I want to prove that I\u2019m better than that and can put Jon Jones through more adversity.\u201dPrior to his loss to Jones, Gane knocked out Tai Tuivasa in Paris last September  (AFP via Getty Images)It is unclear whether Jones will still be around by the time Gane earns a prospective third shot at the UFC heavyweight title. The American, 35, was absent from the Octagon for three years before returning to fight Gane, and his plan to face heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Stipe Miocic before the end of the year looks fragile. Jones has also continually exchanged verbal barbs with Francis Ngannou \u2013 his predecessor as UFC heavyweight champion, and a former teammate and opponent of Gane.But while Jones\u2019s next step is ambiguous, Gane\u2019s is clear. The Frenchman, a year on from headlining the UFC\u2019s first-ever French card, will once again fight in a main event in Paris this September. Sergey Spivak, the Moldovan heavyweight with three stoppage wins in his last three fights, will be the tormented tourist at the Accor Arena.\u201cThis is my mindset: Every time people ask who I want to fight next, it doesn\u2019t matter who,\u201d Gane says. \u201cI just want to fight, do my job, my mission. I\u2019m a competitor, so any opponent you put in front of me is going to be my mission. Spivak is well rounded \u2013 good ground game, good wrestler \u2013 so yes, it\u2019s gonna be a test. I\u2019m really happy about that. We\u2019re gonna work on [what we need to work on], and I\u2019m gonna do my best.\u201dRecommendedHow to watch The Ultimate Fighter in the UKThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound UFC rankingsWhen is the next UFC event?In undisputed-title fights, Gane has struggled to do his best; in every other bout, his best has been more than enough.

He was not beaten far in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury when he tried to bite Modern Games and William Buick as they passed him Jockey Pat Dobbs felt he was in front too soon that day so this straight mile is perfect for him. He can pull off a bit of a surprise in the first race at Royal Ascot.\u201d15:05 \u2013 Army Ethos - 14/1 (each-way)\u201cTrainer Archie Watson won this last year with Bradsell for the same connections. He sent Army Ethos up to Ayr to win his maiden and he made no mistake. It was the manner of the victory that impressed and he has to be a player in this contest. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s River Tiber is the likely market leader and as long as there is cut in the ground, he will take some pegging back. His price reflects that.\u201d15:40 \u2013 Coolangatta - 7/2\u201cThe Australian sprinters are normally a fair way ahead of the home team, so I\u2019ll side with Coolangatta. She has the services of Royal Ascot regular James McDonald, which is a plus. Highfield Princess is an unbelievable story and it would be remarkable were she to win but the Aussie raider can repel her.\u201d16:20 \u2013 Paddington - 9/4\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to go much of a gallop in the early part of the Irish 2,000 Guineas but Paddington quickened up very smartly to put the race to bed at the business end. The St James\u2019 Palace Stales is run on the round course and the best horse doesn\u2019t always win. However, Paddington has plenty of speed which will stand him in good stead and help the Ballydoyle runner edge it over Chaldean.\u201d17:00 \u2013 Calling the Wind - 9/1\u201cRichard Hughes was no stranger to the winner\u2019s enclosure as a jockey at Royal Ascot and it would mean the world to him to have a winner as a trainer. Billy \u2018the kid\u2019 Loughnane rides Calling the Wind who is at the foot of the weights and conditions are perfect for him. Bring On The Night hasn\u2019t run since finishing second to Ascot Gold Cup favourite Coltrane. Top jumps trainer Willie Mullins has booked Ryan Moore again and connections have obviously been protecting his mark since that run 12 months ago\u201d17:35 \u2013 Buckaroo - 11/2\u201cOisin Murphy has wasted no time getting among the winners this season since his return from a ban and he\u2019s riding better than ever. He is the retained rider for Qatar Racing and Buckaroo got beaten in a Derby Trial last year at Leopardstown.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s commitment to high-risk, high-impact cricket hurried the first Ashes Test towards a gripping conclusion, setting Australia 281 to win on day four at Edgbaston.Resuming on 28 for two, England put their foot to the floor as they moved to 273 all out at the end of an elongated afternoon session.The hosts would have loved one of their middle-order batters to kick on to a substantial score, but saw Joe Root (46), Harry Brook (46) and Ben Stokes (43) dismissed one by one just as they were dragging control away from the Australians.There were important runs too from from the tail, Ollie Robinson making 27 as the last two wickets put on 44.Despite delivering emphatically on their promise to entertain, even those who roared their approval from the stands may reflect that England over-reached against Nathan Lyon at times.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveRoot was stumped for the first time in 131 Tests when he ran down the pitch and swiped fresh air and Brook cut short a highly promising stay when he dragged to midwicket trying to force a boundary.Former captain Root set the tone for a colourful day with an audacious start, attempting his trademark reverse ramp off Pat Cummins\u2019 first delivery of the morning.Root has become a master of that audacious stroke but, even by his own standards, attempting it so early \u2013 with a crucial Test match balanced on a knife-edge \u2013 showed remarkable chutzpah.Undeterred, he went back to the well twice in the next over, launching Scott Boland over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head for six and then flicking four more beyond the slip cordon. It was a faintly surreal, but utterly exhilarating opening salvo.England continued to go after Boland, who shipped 31 off his first three overs as his reputation for economy took its second battering in four days.By contrast, Cummins was working up a head of steam at the Pavilion End and he produced a picture-perfect inswinging yorker to see off Ollie Pope (16), thudding the base of off stump as the batter groped for contact. He finished with four for 63 \u2013 an outstanding effort by any measure.That left England 84 ahead and three down, but the arrival of Brook ensured the tempo did not slow.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAndy Murray returns to the Queens Championship for the first time since 2021, aiming to secure a potential seeding at this year\u2019s Wimbledon.Murray, who withdrew from Queens in 2022, returns to the tournament as the club\u2019s most successful champion. The grass-loving Murray captured a total of five Queen\u2019s singles titles, including four out of six between 2011 and 2016.The 38th-ranked Murray has attained his highest ranking since April 2018, following two consecutive titles in Grass court challengers - the Surbiton trophy and the Rothesay Open Nottingham.Murray enters Queen\u2019s on a 10-match winning streak, but he will find a step-up in competition in his first-round match on Tuesday against the speedy Australian Alex De Minaur. De Minaur is the tournament\u2019s seventh seed and is currently ranked 18th in the world.To achieve seeding at Wimbledon the ever-determined 36-year-old Murray will need to advance to at least the quarter-finals, while reaching the semi-finals would guarantee a top-32 seeding at this year\u2019s tournament.RecommendedDefending champion Matteo Berrettini withdraws from Queen\u2019s due to injuryKatie Boulter wins battle of the Britons with Jodie Burrage in Nottingham finalAndy Murray feeling \u2018really positive\u2019 over fitness as winning run continuesMurray is fully aware of the importance of obtaining seeding at this year\u2019s Wimbledon and the wins needed at Queens to achieve this. Murray stated after his challenger victory at Nottingham,\u00a0 \u201cI pretty much know what I have to do and if I make semis I will definitely make seeding. Quarters may be enough.\u201dIf Murray manages to overcome the speedy De Minaur, where he enters as a slight underdog, he will be welcomed in the round of 16 by the winner of Diego Schwartzman vs Mackenzie Mcdonald.McDonald, currently ranked 67th in the world, is the likely winner over the struggling Argentinian Schwartzmann.\u00a0 This likely match-up versus McDonald in the round of 16 would provide Murray with a relatively fortunate draw, as he would likely enter the match as a favorite.This route to the quarter-finals, which would likely involve facing De Minaur and McDonald, might be sufficient to secure a seeding for Murray. However, a spot in the semi-finals would guarantee the Scot his first Wimbledon seeding since 2017 when he held the tournament\u2019s No. 1 seed and eventually lost to American Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals.If Murray manages to win his first two matches, he would likely face American Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals, with a spot in the semi-finals on the line. Fritz, a skilled grass player, won the ATP 250 Rothesay International at Eastbourne in 2022 and reached the quarter-finals at last year\u2019s Wimbledon.While success at Queen\u2019s is clearly important for form heading into Wimbledon, Murray\u2019s ability to achieve seeding at Wimbledon appears the main priority.So why is this special top 32 club at Wimbledon so important?Being a seed at Wimbledon means that one avoids playing another top 32 ranked player for each of the first two rounds, resulting in most likely a considerably easier draw. Having the opportunity to face lower-ranked players early on is precisely what Murray needs to potentially avoid prolonged matches in the early rounds of Grand Slams, a persistent issue that has significantly affected him in recent years.With a generally weak cast of players headed to Wimbledon where there isn\u2019t really a formidable No 2 on grass behind Djokovic; Murray is presented with a massive opportunity to get back to his first fourth round at a major since 2017.RecommendedRyan Peniston springs another Queen\u2019s surprise with win over Ugo HumbertAndy Murray\u2019s road back as he reaches top 40 with hope of Wimbledon seedingIn-form Andy Murray looking to secure Wimbledon seeding at Queen\u2019s this weekMurray, even with his relative lack of success at grand slams recently, is the 10th favorite to win Wimbledon this year, with a price of 35/1 available at Betfair.The 36-year-old Murray continues to defy expectations since his horrid 2018 and 2019 hip surgeries and will once again be a crowd favourite at both Queen\u2019s and Wimbledon.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf Mauricio Pochettino is the great lost Manchester United manager, forever tipped for the top job at Old Trafford, always seemingly suitable for it, never actually getting it, maybe Harry Kane will go down as their great lost centre-forward. There is time yet for England\u2019s record scorer to become United\u2019s main striker, perhaps when his Tottenham contract expires in 2024, but a move north seems unlikely this summer. United would argue they have not pulled out of the race for Kane: because they were never in it.Which doesn\u2019t mean he is short of admirers at Old Trafford. \u201cA great player, a great personality as well,\u201d said Erik ten Hag in April. The Dutchman has a belief United ought to be interested in high-class footballers; he stated last month they needed \u201cbetter players\u201d to reach the next level.In particular, there is a glaring need for a superior No 9; it is his major priority. The argument for Anthony Martial, which Ten Hag made eloquently for much of the campaign, felt damaged by the end of it: the Frenchman only scored two goals in his last 12 games, did not start a game in February or March and then missed the FA Cup final with injury. United cannot rely on him. Marcus Rashford had a career-best season, but he needed to: United\u2019s three, and very different, No 9s scored just seven league goals between them. Martial got six, the departed Cristiano Ronaldo one, the loanee Wout Weghorst none.There seemed two obvious upgrades, before Kylian Mbappe informed Paris Saint-Germain he will not sign a new contract there. And yet at least two of the three \u2013 Mbappe, Kane and Victor Osimhen \u2013 can probably be discounted: partly on grounds of cost. There is a reluctance to spend all summer negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who does not want to sell to a Premier League rival, risking ending up empty-handed and after other strikers have already moved. There is a consciousness that Napoli could be similarly obdurate about Osimhen, who could command a nine-figure fee, though his talent is undeniable and recognised at Old Trafford.RecommendedLuke Shaw turns agent in bid to woo England teammates to Manchester UnitedEngland stars must ignore transfer talk, says Gareth SouthgateEngland\u2019s future is about to be defined \u2013 and it\u2019s out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s controlBut it leaves a vacancy and amid a troubled backdrop. The ongoing delays about a takeover make it far less likely funds will be available from a new owner to bolster Ten Hag\u2019s budget; the manager is frustrated by the delays. In any case, Financial Fair Play limits United\u2019s leeway. As it is, they overspent last summer, some of the cost of Antony coming from the 2023 pot. The impasse about David de Gea\u2019s contract and the chances he leaves on a free transfer could make it more urgent some of the money is redirected towards a new goalkeeper. And then there is the Mason Greenwood situation, with the forward still suspended amid an ongoing investigation. If United hope for a silver bullet to resolve their dilemma, one appears unlikely: they may still be weighing up whether the footballing case to keep him outweighs the moral case to dismiss him, along with implications involving lawyers, sponsors and supporters.The Mason Greenwood situation has left Manchester United with a dilemma  (Getty Images)Assume Greenwood is out of the picture and the reinforcements can only come from the transfer market. That poses problems: the supply-and-demand equation for strikers counts against buyers, the resurgence of the No 9 after a period of false nines, No 10s, wingers and attacking midfielders meaning there are relatively few players who want to lead the line. Ivan Toney might have been the best candidate in the Premier League but is banned until 2024; Ollie Watkins may instead be the finest available English option.Elsewhere, sizeable sums could be paid for potential, not proven performance. Rasmus Hojlund only scored nine Serie A goals for Atalanta last season, though the 20-year-old Dane is expected to become more prolific. Randal Kolo Muani is another on the rise, though Bayern Munich may be in pole position to secure the Eintracht Frankfurt forward. Goncalo Ramos has only been potent at club level for one season, though that was long enough for the Benfica attacker to displace Ronaldo during the World Cup.None has a track record to compare with Kane\u2019s. Maybe United only need to buy themselves time, to find someone who can do a job for a season if they are confident of getting Kane in 2024, when Levy would not be a factor. Yet Weghorst both did and did not prove a short-term option, helping United to third but ending with a miserable return of two goals in 31 games in all competitions.There is a destructive striker in Manchester who United allegedly could have had for \u00a34m; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed last month he recommended Erling Haaland in 2018 and said United did not listen to him. If that was damning, it may suggest Solskjaer, Haaland\u2019s manager for Molde, was not particularly persuasive. But while United were interested in some strikers, including Darwin Nunez, last summer and prioritised other positions, now their most pressing need is clear. The far more difficult part, with three of the best appearing distinctly unlikely, is who they can get."}, {"_id": "64909b4551ac33155408cf2c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-saudi-arabia-pif-clearlake-capital-b2360204.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Saudi Arabia can help Chelsea solve headache \u2014 but talks raise more questions than answers", "lead": "<p>The Blues could sell a number of unwanted players to Saudi clubs to boost FFP concerns and help one of the most ambitious plans in football</p>", "author": "Miguel Delaney", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:30:49", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:33.124360", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T13:30:49+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/14/GettyImages-1252573718.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere is suddenly a little bit of tension about one of the most ambitious plans in football. High-placed sources say this week brings a lot of discussion between Saudi Arabian representatives and those of top players in order to try and convince them to join the planet\u2019s most disruptive competition. Some involved see it as a key period for the Saudi Pro League in terms of keeping the momentum going by getting truly big players.Interest in Neymar and David De Gea is now well known, but representatives are also looking at Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva, and there are offers for a series of Chelsea players. Among them are N\u2019Golo Kante, Edouard Mendy, Romelu Lukaku, Kalidou Koulibaly, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Hakim Ziyech.It would represent quite the analgesic for what had been a real headache at Stamford Bridge. Throughout the last few months, the major question at Stamford Bridge, beyond the manager, was who was going to buy the players they needed to sell to trim the squad and meet Financial Fair Play requirements. Everyone \u201cknew they were coming\u201d, to use the industry phrase. Clubs were going to go in low and well under the asking price, as Manchester United have attempted with Mason Mount.Now, a solution has suddenly presented itself. Chelsea could clear a lot of players for big money, allowing Mauricio Pochettino a much cleaner slate to start working with.It has raised a lot of chatter within the game as well as outside. Football officials have privately pointed to the strong relationship between Chelsea majority owners Clearlake and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund [PIF], who have billions of pounds worth of assets managed by the American firm.RecommendedFirst golf, now football? Saudi Arabia\u2019s grand plan and the 72 hours that changed everythingSportswashing is about to change football beyond anything you can imagineThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverMany within the game are now asking about Saudi influence on Chelsea but it has long been stressed there was no involvement in Clearlake\u2019s 2022 purchase, and consequently no concern about potential conflicts of interest given the ownership of Newcastle United. The Owners and Directors test would also require that any influence be declared. It is being insisted now at Stamford Bridge that the only discussions taking place are \u201ctransactional conversations about players they\u2019re interested in\u201d.Chelsea and the Premier League have been approached for comment.The London club look to have just benefitted from good timing, although the biggest question now is how many players will actually be convinced to move, and \u201cwhat actually gets done\u201d. Lukaku is already reluctant. Manchester City\u2019s Bernardo Silva would be unlikely to even consider a proposal if it arrives.The very fact such discussions are being had does raise two wider issues for the game.Chelsea\u2019s owners could sell unwanted players to Saudi Arabia  (Getty Images)One, in the abstract, is the growing influence of private equity in football. Part of the reason such questions are being asked is that it\u2019s unclear what money funds private equity in such takeovers. The Premier League, for example, doesn\u2019t have to know.There are an increasing number of people in football who see private equity\u2019s influence - going right up to possible deals with Serie A and La Liga - as just as problematic as state ownership, especially with how the potential is there for the two to overlap.There is then the big story of the summer, which revolves around one of the most ambitious and biggest of those states. Offers from the Saudi Pro League are expected to escalate in the next few weeks, as this is viewed as a key stage of the project. Bringing Ruben Neves from Wolves was a coup but they want bigger than that.It is also why there was some disappointment about the \u201ccomplacency\u201d of Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin about the extent the Saudi Pro League\u2019s growth could distort the game.The Slovenian official gave an interview in the Netherlands on the eve of the Nations League final, in which he said the European game should not be concerned about any player exodus.\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 I think that it's mainly a mistake for Saudi Arabian football. Why is that a problem for them? Because they should invest in academies, they should bring coaches, and they should develop their own players.\"Kalidou Koulibaly struggled during his debut season for Chelsea after joining for approximately \u00a334m from Napoli (Getty Images)\u201cThe system of buying the players that almost ended their career is not the system that develops football. It was a similar mistake in China when they all brought players who are at the end of their career.\u201d\u201cTell me one player who is top, top age and who starts his career and went to play in Saudi Arabia? But it's not about money only. Players want to win top competitions. And top competition is in Europe.\u201dRecommendedCarabao Cup 2023/24 fixture dates and schedule revealedChelsea fixtures released for Premier League 2023/24 seasonManchester, Merseyside and north London derby dates revealed for 2023/24That question is something currently being tested, but a growing view is that Ceferin is wrong to make the comparison to China. Saudi Arabia has a much more developed football culture, with a good level of quality, and part of this project is improving that. There is then the wider issue of the football authorities' general lack of regulation and foresight on the influence of states and private equity groups.

A separate England A side, meanwhile, racked up 562 in 115.1 overs against a full-strength Australia side at Grace Road.Ahead of the one-off Test in the series which also features three T20s and three ODIs, Beaumont said: \u201cAustralia have led the way for the last five or six years, everyone is playing catch up.\u201cBut the way that we are playing and the way we want to play can certainly challenge them and compete with them.\u201cOnce you put good teams under pressure, you never know how they\u2019re going to react and you never know what can happen.\u201dBeaumont could face the opening ball of the series if England bat first, an occasion she has encountered in the past and one she likens to one of the most nerve-wracking of her career.She added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably second only to facing the first ball of a World Cup final.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s commitment to high-risk cricket kept all results in play as the first Ashes Test moved forward at pace on the fourth morning at Edgbaston.The hosts hit 127 runs in the opening session as they came out at a gallop, but also lost the wickets of Ollie Pope, Joe Root and Harry Brook to allow Australia some serious inroads.At lunch England were 162 ahead on 155 for five, with captain Ben Stokes for once providing a calming presence and Jonny Bairstow new to the crease.Despite easily delivering on their promise to entertain, England were probably guilty of over-reaching against Nathan Lyon, with Root stumped as he charged down the pitch and Brook dragging to mid-wicket in search of a boundary. Both fell for 46 with big scores seemingly in the offing.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveRoot set the tone with an audacious start to the day\u2019s play, attempting his trademark reverse ramp off Pat Cummins\u2019 first delivery of the morning.Root has become a master of that high-risk stroke but, even by his own standards, reaching for it so early with a crucial Test match balanced on a knife-edge was remarkable. Undeterred, he went back to the well twice in the next over, launching Scott Boland over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head for six and then flicking four more beyond the slip cordon. It was a faintly surreal, but utterly exhilarating opening salvo.England continued to go after Boland, with Root and Pope racking up 31 off his first three overs. For a bowler who has built a reputation for giving nothing, boasting an economy rate of 2.31 prior to this week, it was brand new territory.By contrast, Cummins was working up a head of steam at the Pavilion End and he produced a picture perfect inswinging yorker to see off Pope (16), thudding the base of off stump as the batter groped for contact.That left England 84 ahead and three down, but the arrival of Brook ensured the tempo did not slow. He took just three balls to register his first four, punching Cameron Green down the ground and quickly dialling up the aggression.He helped himself to 13 off Lyon\u2019s first over, not the kind of reception the spinner would have anticipated on a wearing fourth day pitch, and later launched him over extra-cover with a clean swing of the bat.Lyon got his rewards for sticking at it, Root overly giddy as he ran down the pitch and left Alex Carey a simple stumping \u2013 Root\u2019s first such dismissal in 131 Tests.Stokes unexpectedly cooled things down, playing safely as he realised the importance of slowing Australia\u2019s role, but Brook lost his patience as Lyon dried up the scoring options.RecommendedAndy Murray\u2019s road back as he reaches top 40 with hope of Wimbledon seedingIn-form Andy Murray looking to secure Wimbledon seeding at Queen\u2019s this weekMan City chairman vows to give \u2018very blunt views\u2019 on FFP charges once concludedWithin one shot of a first Ashes fifty he swiped at the spinner and was well caught by the diving Marnus Labuschagne at mid-wicket.Another wicket would have put England in big trouble and there were huge roars in the stands when Bairstow successfully overturned an lbw decision in Boland\u2019s favour in the final over before the break."}, {"_id": "64909b4551ac33155408cf30", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/wyndham-clark-rory-mcilroy-us-open-b2360170.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wyndham Clark believes he deserves place among golf elite after US Open triumph", "lead": "<p>The 29-year-old American held his nerve in a tense final round to finish top of the leaderboard on 10 under par</p>", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:39:29", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:33.976442", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T12:39:29+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/12/19-d3d813bf9c3a4f28a232e973ff718307.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNewly-crowned US Open champion Wyndham Clark believes he deserves his place among the game\u2019s elite after claiming his maiden major title in impressive fashion.Despite winning his first PGA Tour title six weeks ago, Clark was an 120/1 outsider at Los Angeles Country Club, having made just two cuts in six previous majors with a best finish of 75th in the 2021 US PGA.Yet it was the 29-year-old American who held his nerve in a tense final round to finish top of the leaderboard on 10 under par, with major champions Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler and Cameron Smith filling the minor places.Clark\u2019s victory will take him from 32nd to a career-high 13th in the world rankings and also up to second in the qualifying race for the US Ryder Cup team.\u201cI feel like I belong on this stage and even two, three years ago when people didn\u2019t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world,\u201d Clark said.RecommendedMcIlroy reacts to missing out on US Open victory by a single strokeWyndham Clark knows he made late mother \u2018proud\u2019 with US Open winThe sporting weekend in pictures\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve shown that this year. I\u2019ve come up close (to winning) and obviously everyone sees the person that hoists the trophy, but I\u2019ve been trending in the right direction for a long time now.\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of cuts. I\u2019ve had a handful of top 10s and top 20s and I feel like I\u2019ve been on a great trajectory to get to this place.\u201cObviously it\u2019s gone faster than I thought as far as just starting to do some stuff mentally that I\u2019ve never done before, but I feel like I\u2019m one of the best players in the world.\u201cObviously this just shows what I believe can happen.\u201cBut at the same time I\u2019m a pretty humble, calm guy and I don\u2019t try to get too high or too low on things. I\u2019m obviously going to celebrate this, but I like to compete.\u201cI\u2019m so competitive. I want to beat everybody but also be friends with everybody. So I try to have a good mix of that.\u201dClark\u2019s victory came on Father\u2019s Day but it was no surprise that his thoughts immediately turned to his late mother Lise, who was a huge influence on his career before her death from breast cancer in 2013.Lise\u2019s death hit Clark hard and he seriously considered quitting the sport as he battled bouts of depression and frustration throughout his college career and early years in the professional ranks.\u201cI didn\u2019t show any emotion off the course, but when I was on the golf course, I couldn\u2019t have been angrier,\u201d Clark recalled.\u201cI was breaking clubs when I didn\u2019t even hit that bad of a shot. I was walking off golf courses. When I transferred from Oklahoma State to Oregon was another low point and I think that was a lot of carryover from my mom passing.\u201cSo when I went to Oregon and Casey Martin then took over as my head coach, he instilled that I was one of the best players in the world and he goes, \u2018you\u2019re good enough to play on this stage but also in college and win\u2019.\u201cThen I had my best year ever. I got out here (on Tour) pretty quick, but even those first few years, I felt like I under-performed.\u201cI\u2019ve had many times where I\u2019ve gone home and was yelling in my car and punching things and just so mad that I\u2019m like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I do what my peers are doing that I know I can play with and against and beat?\u2019Recommended\u2018Mom was watching over me\u2019 says US Open champion Wyndham ClarkRory McIlroy suffers more major heartbreak as Wyndham Clark shockingly wins US OpenUS Open 2023 LIVE: Leaderboard, result & reaction as Wyndham Clark beats Rory McIlroy\u201cI\u2019ve probably had three to four really defining moments in my career since college, but I\u2019m really glad that I stuck it through.\u201cBeing here now, I just feel so blessed.

Cannonier landed 249 significant strikes against Vettori across five rounds, with the record previously standing at 186.Cannonier, 39, and Vettori, 29, are both former title challengers in the UFC, with both having been outpointed by incumbent champion Israel Adesanya during the Nigerian-New Zealander\u2019s first title reign.

After dipping back as low as 70 in February, he has now spent five straight weeks in the top 50 since the May 8 update.Tournament winsMurray\u2019s only tournament win on the main ATP Tour since his surgeries came at the 2019 European Open in Antwerp.That came via an impressive win over fellow three-time grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka in the final, while his semi-final opponent Ugo Humbert would go on to win the event the following year.He reached further finals in Sydney and Stuttgart last year and Doha this February, where he lost to Daniil Medvedev.His grass-court wins in Surbiton and Nottingham made it three titles for him on this year\u2019s ATP Challenger Tour, having also won on the clay of Aix-en-Provence in May.Queen\u2019s recordMurray now takes his form to the biggest grass-court tournament outside of Wimbledon, knowing a deep run in the cinch Championships at The Queen\u2019s Club could earn him a spot among the 32 seeds at SW19.His past record there offers plenty of encouragement, with a record five titles to his name.He won the event ahead of his two Wimbledon triumphs in 2013 and 2016 as well as in 2009, 2011 and 2015 to stand alone as Queen\u2019s Club\u2019s most successful player.RecommendedWyndham Clark believes he deserves place among golf elite after US Open triumphIn-form Andy Murray looking to secure Wimbledon seeding at Queen\u2019s this weekMan City chairman vows to give \u2018very blunt views\u2019 on FFP charges once concludedHe will need to reach at least the quarter-finals this year to have a chance of being seeded at Wimbledon and the less-encouraging omen is his somewhat boom-and-bust record \u2013 outside of his five wins he has reached just one other quarter-final, which he lost to Andy Roddick in 2008.Murray has lost in the last 16 four times \u2013 most recently two years ago against Matteo Berrettini \u2013 and the last 32 three times with a solitary last-64 exit back in 2006."}, {"_id": "64909b4651ac33155408cf35", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/drs-ashes-england-australia-umpires-b2359430.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What is DRS and how does it work?", "lead": "<p>DRS was first introduced in 2008 and could have a key role to play in the Ashes</p>", "author": "Harry Latham-Coyle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:41:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:34.803052", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T11:41:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/13/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCricket has long embraced the use of technology to aid officiating, with the Decision Review System (DRS) a by-now familiar feature of international and some domestic The system was introduced in a bid to help the on-field umpires make fewer obvious errors, granting power to batters and bowlers to challenge decisions that they feel have been made incorrectly. In time, the use of the third umpire has become more and more prevalent, with even marginal calls now often reviewed, but the system can prove pivotal if employed shrewdly. Indeed, two of the most thrilling Ashes series in recent memory might have ended differently had the system been available or better utilised: in 2005, before DRS was in place, Australia may well have squeaked home at Edgbaston and gone on to win the series had Michael Kasprowicz been able to review a caught-behind decision; in 2019, Australia\u2019s misuse of the system at Headingley proved costly as they found themselves out of reviews after Ben Stokes survived a late LBW appeal on his way to an extraordinary match-winning innings.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the system:RecommendedMoeen Ali could not turn down Ashes series under Ben Stokes\u2019 captaincyWomen\u2019s Ashes points system explainedWhat is Bazball? How England revolutionised Test cricketWhat is DRS and what does it stand for?DRS stands for Decision Review System, and was first brought in to Test cricket in 2008. It enables players to challenge decisions made by the on-field umpires - a bowling side can challenge a \u201cnot out\u201d decision, while a batter can ask to review after being given out.How does it work?After a decision is made by the on-field umpires, or the ball otherwise becomes dead, the players have up to 15 seconds to decide if they wish to review it. An intention to review is signalled by either the batter on strike or the fielding captain making a \u2018T\u2019 sign, at which point the umpires refer their decision to the third umpire, who has the benefit of replays.The third umpire then takes as long as required to either stay with or overturn the on-field decision, using a range of technologies at his disposal and all available television camera angles to make their final ruling, before returning to the on-field standing umpire to make a signal.Each team has three unsuccessful reviews per Test innings - this was upped from two during Covid to compensate for the pandemic-enforced use of non-neutral umpires, and has remained since.What technology can the third umpire use?Beyond pure footage, there are three technologies utilised during the DRS process. Ultra-Edge or Real Time Snicko (RTS)Ultra-Edge, also known as Real Time Snicko (RTS), uses a sensitive microphone placed near the stumps to generate a waveform displaying the soundwave of a connected oscilloscope. This waveform is then automatically synchronised with television footage to show sounds as they happened, with clear spikes on the waveform showing contact with the bat or pad. The one drawback of the technology is that it cannot distinguish what was struck, relying on the third umpire to interpret whether the ball has hit bat or pad when the two are close together - though this is reasonably rare.Hot SpotHot Sport is an infrared imaging system also used to determine if the ball has made contact with the bat. It requires two infrared cameras on either side of the ground that continuously record footage, which is then made available to the third umpire. Contact with the bat, or the batter\u2019s body, is typically evidenced by a bright, white spot where friction has elevated the temperature of the contacted area. While once preferred to RTS, improvements in the accuracy of the Ultra-Edge technology means that it is now generally used as the primary form of determining if a batter has edged the ball.Ball trackingGenerally using the computer vision system Hawk-Eye, also employed in tennis, ball tracking is used to assess leg before wicket (LBW) decisions. After a batter is struck on the pad or body, the ball tracking technology plots the trajectory the delivery would have continued on if not interrupted, predicting whether or not it would have hit the stumps. The technology can also assess whether the ball pitched or struck the batter in line with the stumps.What is umpire\u2019s call?Umpire\u2019s call will be commonly sighted when the third umpire asks for ball tracking. Put simply, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the on-field umpire\u2019s decision when no clear error has been made. RecommendedOllie Robinson defends Ashes send-off for Usman Khawaja after criticismEngland vs Australia LIVE: Ashes scorecard and first Test updatesThe sporting weekend in picturesWhile the ball tracking technology is good, there is a small margin for error. For this reason, both the point at which the batter was struck and whether the ball would go on to hit the stumps can be assessed as umpire\u2019s call, sticking with the on-field decision. If the centre of the ball was outside what is called the \u201cImpact Zone\u201d as it struck the batter, an umpire\u2019s call is returned; similarly, if less than half of the ball is projected to go on to hit the stumps, the on-field call will also be upheld.If an LBW decision is upheld on umpire\u2019s call, the team that took the review does not lose it.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoxing matches tend to be organised as one of three types: professional, amateur or exhibition. But what is the difference between them?Generally speaking, most \u2018major\u2019 fights \u2013 including title fights \u2013 are professional bouts, while exhibition contests are those staged with more of a focus on the audience and entertainment. Most professional fighters have an amateur career before turning pro, and Olympic fights count as amateur bouts.For example, Anthony Joshua\u2019s Olympic gold-medal win in 2012 was part of his amateur career. Meanwhile, his heavyweight title fights with Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 and 2022 were professional bouts. Elsewhere, Floyd Mayweather\u2019s recent matches against YouTubers Logan Paul and Deji were exhibitions.All fights \u2013 professional, amateur and exhibition \u2013 must be licensed by a commission (e.g. fights in Las Vegas are regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission), but exhibition bouts do not need to be sanctioned by a governing body. In contrast, the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioned Tyson Fury\u2019s three fights with Deontay Wilder, as the WBC heavyweight title was on the line.Professional fights do not need to be title bouts, but they tend to have an effect on the rankings in the weight class in which they take place, as seeded by the governing body sanctioning the fight. I.e. Andy Ruiz Jr is the World Boxing Organization (WBO)\u2019s No 1-ranked fighter below its champions, while Wilder is ranked sixth. If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings.RecommendedFloyd Mayweather vs John Gotti III fight ends with mass brawl in ringThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound boxing rankingsBehind the scenes, laughter is turning to anger in the Fury vs Usyk sagaFurthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men\u2019s boxing \u2013 a professional bout \u2013 will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women\u2019s world title fight will always be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples).Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter\u2019s record \u2013 and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared.Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib. Readers might expect such fights to be exhibitions, but they have in fact been organised as professional bouts, meaning Paul has a 6-0 record (4 KOs).

Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1.

It is unclear how long this process will take with some suggestions proceedings could run for several more years.Speaking in his annual end-of-season interview with the club\u2019s media channels, Khaldoon said: \u201cSo obviously I can\u2019t talk about them (the charges), unfortunately, for legal reasons.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cWhat I would typically always do is comment after, so I think we\u2019re going to go through the legal process.\u201cThese are proceedings that take whatever time they take and when we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll have a conversation.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeReal Madrid have completed the loan signing of veteran Spanish striker Joselu, a week after Karim Benzema\u2019s equally surprising departure.Formerly a youngster in the Real Madrid B team who played just twice for the senior side over a decade ago under Jose Mourinho, the Stuttgart-born 33-year-old has since gone on to play for the likes of Hoffenheim and Alaves, while also spending three years in England.Joselu signed for Stoke City in 2015 but played just one season there before a loan back in Spain, thereafter signing for Newcastle in 2017 and spending two seasons in the north east. A return to Spain saw him show his most consistent form as he approached 30 years of age, however, with three seasons at Alaves returning a double-figures goal tally each season.That all led to a career-best season last year after signing for Espanyol. Joselu finished as LaLiga\u2019s third-highest goalscorer with 16 to his name, culminating in winning four caps for the Spanish national team - scoring three times - including an appearance in Sunday\u2019s Uefa Nations League shootout triumph over Croatia where he netted his nation\u2019s first penalty.Despite his efforts in front of goal, Espanyol were relegated from the top flight - but Joselu will be staying put, after now sealing a season-long loan to the Santiago Bernabeu club, who finished second.RecommendedOn this day in 2003: Man Utd accept \u00a325m bid from Real Madrid for David BeckhamTransfer rumours: Tottenham make \u00a350m double bid for Leicester pairReal Madrid star Vinicius Jr chosen to lead new Fifa anti-racism committeeReal also have a reported option to buy him at the end of the season, with Joselu\u2019s contract at Espanyol running until 2025.Los Blancos had been linked with a move for PSG star Kylian Mbappe, who has informed his club he will not sign a contract extension.But Real club president Florentino Perez was recorded signing autographs for supporters over the weekend when one asked about Joselu\u2019s arrival and any more potential signings, with Perez suggesting there would be no further incomings across the summer.That follows the big-money signing of Jude Bellingham last week, bolstering Real\u2019s midfield for the immediate- and long-term.In related news, Carlo Ancelotti is expected to take over as Brazil\u2019s national team manager when his contract expires next month, with multiple reports claiming he\u2019ll sign a contract to do so once he enters the final six months of his Real Madrid deal, per Fifa rules."}, {"_id": "64909b4851ac33155408cf3f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league-coventry-english-football-league-luton-english-b2360097.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Matty Jones hails determination of Joe Taylor to rise to Premier League", "lead": "The 20-year-old converted a penalty in the Hatters\u2019 Championship play-off final win over Coventry.", "author": "Phil Blanche", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 09:12:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:36.733081", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T09:12:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/10/59c5458740bd2722e2c480061dbeee7dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjUwODA2-2.72386024.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Just to be part of it and experience the day was his main goal.\u201cOne thing he\u2019s got is fight and determination, not to prove people wrong but to prove to himself that he\u2019s good enough.\u201cIt could have gone either way for him at Peterborough, in terms of not getting a huge amount of game time and dropping into the 21s.\u201cHe showed frustration at times for that, but then his move to Luton came out of the blue.\u201dTaylor made only one start and four substitute appearances before making the Hatters\u2019 bench at Wembley.Just moments before his sweetly-struck penalty in the shoot-out, Taylor thought he had scored an extra-time winner only for his effort to be ruled out by VAR for a handball in the build-up.\u201cTo come off the bench and score the winner would have been a dream come true,\u201d Jones said.\u201cBut we couldn\u2019t be happier to see Joe score a penalty which was pivotal to Luton\u2019s success.\u201cThose experiences for lads are gold dust. The pressure he was under with that penalty will only bode well for us.\u201cHe will get similar scenarios for his country, how to manage his emotions under extreme pressure.\u201dRecommendedEngland expect Ollie Lawrence and Jack Walker to be fit for World Cup selectionOn this day in 2016: Andy Murray wins record fifth Queen\u2019s Club titleThe sporting weekend in picturesKing\u2019s Lynn-born Taylor, who qualifies for the Dragons through his Welsh grandmother, made his U21 debut in September.Jones said: \u201cJoe\u2019s had a great journey \u2013 it\u2019s such a positive story \u2013 and he\u2019s come into camp now with both performance and physical momentum.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64909b4851ac33155408cf40", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/man-city-charges-khaldoon-al-mubarak-b2360079.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man City chairman promises \u2018very strong, blunt views\u2019 on financial charges deflecting praise from treble", "lead": "<p>Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup successes could yet be stripped if breaches of financial regulations are proved against Man City </p>", "author": "Richard Jolly", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 09:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:36.901347", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T09:00:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/09/newFile-4.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Al Mubarak called the City Football Group the top brand in the sport and said it is valued at more than $6 billion (\u00a34.7bn).But in February, the Premier League charged City with more than 100 breaches of financial regulations \u2013 opening them up to potential punishments including fines, points deductions or being stripped of past titles \u2013 in a case that may not be heard for years.Al Mubarak said he had strong opinions on the issue and promised to reveal them but said he is unable to while the case is ongoing.He said: \u201cI can\u2019t talk about them unfortunately for legal reasons. We\u2019re going through the legal process. These are proceedings that take whatever time they take and when we\u2019re done, I\u2019ll give you my very blunt views, I promise you that.

The treble is incredible. I hope people focus and judge them for their football and what they\u2019re achieving on the pitch and what they\u2019re achieving in every competition they\u2019re in. That\u2019s the reality. The club as a whole is very well run. Today, the value of this group is over $6bn.\u201cWe\u2019ve created so much value \u2013 we\u2019ve brought in world class investors. Why? Because we have a commercial machine here that is one of the best in the world. Our executives are being targeted by the best teams in the world \u2013 always. we\u2019re producing some of the best executives in the world, some of the best scouts in the world, some of the best sporting staff in the world.

And at the pinnacle, the final of the Champions League, to be here, to be able to attend it. He has so much love for this club and working with him over the last 15 years as part of City Football Group, he deserves this. He really does. And I\u2019m so happy he was there.\u201dCity captain Ilkay Gundogan is out of contract this summer and could leave on a free transfer but Al Mubarak said he hoped the German would stay.\u201cHe will go down in the folklore of Manchester City forever,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been the first signing of Pep [Guardiola] to Manchester City. He\u2019s a representation of this club in terms of hard work, commitment always, humbleness, winning mentality. And when you need him in the big games, he\u2019s always there.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDavid Beckham did it but Bobby Charlton never did. Wayne Rooney did but Bryan Robson didn\u2019t. Marcus Rashford, along with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw, is likely to join a select group of Manchester United players, those who have represented England at Old Trafford. Face North Macedonia on Monday and for Rashford, like Gary Neville before him, it could be a still more special occasion, for a Mancunian and a United fan.It feels a fitting place for Rashford\u2019s season of renaissance to end. His revival gathered pace at the World Cup when, after going 16 months without representing England, he scored 49 seconds after coming on against Iran and scored three goals in only 137 minutes. Twenty of his career-best total of 30 club goals came at Old Trafford. England\u2019s first game on his home turf for 16 years feels well-timed for the recent recipient of United\u2019s Sir Matt Busby award as their player of the year.And yet Rashford\u2019s relationship with his country feels more complicated. He has an unwanted reputation for pulling out of squads for friendlies and went on holiday to New York in March when injured; Gareth Southgate had no problem with that and does not question his commitment. \u201cHe does love playing for England, he\u2019s very proud to play for England and I\u2019m sure an England game at Old Trafford will be a special moment for him,\u201d he said.As Southgate noted, Rashford had reported for an England camp before Euro 2020 when injured, as Jude Bellingham has now. His own history with Rashford is a long one. It dates back seven years. Rashford\u2019s sole hat-trick in his country\u2019s colours was for Southgate, but in his old job. After his meteoric rise, the teenager had gone to Euro 2016. When Sam Allardyce named what proved his only England squad, Rashford was a notable omission. He instead dropped down to the Under-21s, then managed by Southgate, and scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 thrashing of Norway in Colchester.RecommendedTrent Alexander-Arnold experiment means England may have found their \u2018quarterback\u2019England stars must ignore transfer talk, says Gareth SouthgateMidfield role my best shot of becoming England regular \u2013 Trent Alexander-Arnold\u201cI\u2019ve had him since he was in the Under 21s really,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe had been up with Roy [Hodgson] and then had one game back with us. We\u2019ve always had good communication. I know him as well as anybody is going to know him. He\u2019s not always easy to read.\u201d It was a quietly revealing comment: Rashford is not an open book.Marcus Rashford and Gareth Southgate have a long history  (PA Wire)Nor is his England career a straightforward tale. He has spent a spell out of Southgate\u2019s squad, a time as a substitute. Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane long felt the two automatic choices for spots in his forward line. Rashford has only actually featured 14 times since the start of 2020 and 10 of those were as a substitute. Injuries are a factor, and not merely those that necessitated his absence: Rashford was at Euro 2020 but below full fitness, his tournament reaching an unfortunate ending when Southgate brought him on as an auxiliary right-back and specialist penalty taker in the final against Italy and his spot-kick struck the inside of the post.His international exile followed, partly due to injury, partly because Rashford had the worst season of his career, scoring a mere five goals. Yet he returned in Qatar and Southgate said: \u201cHe had the World Cup with us and we were constantly talking through that period.\u201dPerhaps Southgate erred by only giving Rashford five minutes in the quarter-final exit to France. It was the last time he drew a blank for a while: he scored in his next seven games for United, starting a run of 16 in 17. Southgate enjoyed the transformation, the sight of Rashford becoming more clinical and the impact Erik ten Hag made.\u201cThe obvious thing is the goals,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when he has had chances this season, you expect him to score as the season has gone on. Maybe in previous seasons that was a little bit less of a certainty. I think, in working with Erik, he has had to work a bit differently without the ball.\u201dMarcus Rashford\u2019s performances for Man Utd this season have delighted Gareth Southgate  (PA Wire)It raises questions about where he can feature for England. If Kane were ever to be injured, Rashford could be a compelling alternative. \u201cAt the moment I still think he\u2019s better from the left than as a No. 9 but he\u2019s definitely made progress as a 9 this year and had a bigger impact,\u201d Southgate said. RecommendedMarcus Rashford couldn\u2019t stomach Man City celebrations but England remain unitedMarcus Rashford discusses pain that is \u2018relighting the flame\u2019 inside himRashford underlines commitment to England after missing recent gamesOften, however, has been held in reserve: 30 of his 52 caps have come as a replacement, but 11 of his 14 goals have been as a starter. \u201cI always think he\u2019s a good player as a sub, his mentality is always good when he comes on as a sub but nobody wants to be seen as a good sub, you want to start the games,\u201d Southgate reflected.Rashford has the misfortune to operate in an area where England have most competition for places. But if Sterling\u2019s regression may afford an opening, with him and Mason Mount out of the current squad, Bukayo Saka, James Maddison, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden still offer alternative options on the flanks. Grealish is a treble winner, Rashford the man who has shown greater potency. Join Rooney and Beckham in the group of United players to score for England at Old Trafford and, after a breakthrough for club, he may be nearer one for country, too."}, {"_id": "64909b4b51ac33155408cf48", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/thomas-partey-jordan-pickford-manchester-united-the-sun-arsenal-b2360019.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football rumours: Thomas Partey faces exit in Arsenal reshuffle", "lead": "Manchester United target Jordan Pickford as they increase chase for Mason Mount.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 06:18:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:39.059657", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T06:18:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/07/b7565cd00d12729dcba0aaa534749ee0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MjE4MjYy-2.65416240.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He was three strokes clear after 14 holes and appeared to be cruising to glory, before bogeys at 15 and 16 gave the chasing McIlroy a sniff. However, the Northern Irishman was simply unable to make a putt all day as a lone birdie on the 1st was cancelled out by a bogey at 14 for an uninspired round of 70, which meant pars at 17 and 18 were enough for 29-year-old Clark to add his name to the long list of US Open winners.McIlroy\u2019s major drought now stands at nine years and his quiet Sunday with the putter was reminiscent of last year\u2019s Open at St Andrew\u2019s when he couldn\u2019t reel in a catchable Cameron Smith \u2013 who incidentally finished fourth in Los Angeles on -6 after an impressive final-day 67.

Well, the wait goes on. Just one birdie the whole day and that came at the first with a two-putt. It was a putting display reminiscent of St Andrews last summer - that short birdie effort on the eight, in particular, will be one that haunts him for the foreseeable.Perhaps the fatal mistake was the wedge into 14. To find the bunker with a wedge from the middle of the fairway will be one he\u2019ll rue as well.Wyndham Clark played his part and deserved his win but Rory will know that it was out there for him to win today and that perhaps is what makes it even worse.

a superb approach to the par-three fourth and converted the birdie putt from five feet, before picking up another shot on the short sixth.McIlroy missed from four feet for birdie on the par-five eighth, seemingly opening the door for Clark to extend his lead in the group behind.But Clark found a bad lie in the tall rough with his approach and needed two attempts to escape before getting up and down from the back of the green to drop just one shot.Another shot looked likely to go when Clark missed the ninth green and was faced with an awkward shot from the bank of a bunker, but he cleverly played beyond the flag and utilised the contours of the green to draw the ball back to seven feet and save par.A flop shot Phil Mickelson would have been proud of ensured Clark also saved par on the 11th and he increased his lead when McIlroy\u2019s run of 12 pars ended with a bogey on the 14th.Wyndham Clark held his nerve all day to triumph  (AP)McIlroy was perhaps fortunate to get a free drop when his approach became embedded in the face of a greenside bunker, but he was unable to get up and down for par.Clark then struck a brilliant approach on to the green from 282 yards and two-putted for birdie from 20 feet to extend his lead to three.That cushion was short-lived as Clark bogeyed the par-three 15th and then found sand off the tee on the next as McIlroy crucially holed from seven feet for par up ahead.With no chance of reaching the green, Clark laid up into the fairway before hitting a superb third to seven feet, only to miss the par putt.But with McIlroy unable to find a birdie to increase the pressure, Clark bravely parred the last two holes to seal the win.World No 1 Scottie Scheffler finished two shots behind McIlroy in third, with Open champion Cameron Smith fourth and Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Min Woo Lee sharing fifth.Fleetwood had earlier come agonisingly close to making major championship history after carding a stunning closing 63, the Ryder Cup star missing from five feet for birdie on the 18th.That would have seen Fleetwood shoot the first 62 in the final round of a major, the record having been set by Branden Grace in the third

The returning off-spinner started his morning by being fined 25 per cent of his match fee for using an unauthorised drying spray on his hands during the previous evening\u2019s play, then shipped three sixes in a loose four-over spell.More worryingly, Moeen appeared to be struggling with an open blister on his right index finger and there are some concerns over how he will pull up ahead of what should be a central role in the fourth innings. He has already bowled 33 overs, seven more than he managed in the entirety of the recent Indian Premier League season. With the pitch beginning to take turn, England will need plenty more out of him to justify their decision to cajole the all-rounder out of retirement.Big numberJonny Bairstow made a dashing run-a-ball 78 at a crucial time in the England innings, but that was also the exact number of runs his three missed chances behind the stumps cost his side in the field.

The gesture drew a warm cheer from his tormentors, who warmed to him.On the first day of the Test, Head put a target of his back with some sloppy fielding efforts that saw him drop Harry Brook and then fumble a boundary soon after. Head played along when the crowd mockingly cheered him for a straightforward stop a few moments later and raised his hand in acknowledgement, drawing a further cheer from the crowd.Recommended\u2018Mom was watching over me\u2019 says US Open champion Wyndham ClarkLuke Donald hits out at the USGA after Gordon Sargent\u2019s putt bounces out of holeIreland boss Stephen Kenny insists he has not sought assurances over his futureEngland\u2019s fielding adjustmentsThe ultra-attacking fields set by Ben Stokes have become a key tenet of his captaincy over the past year.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s desire to take the draw out of the equation may be about to face one of its toughest challenges yet after a rain-affected day with just 32.4 overs bowled on day three at Edgbaston.The rain fell earlier than anticipated at 2.15pm, with England 26-0 after taking the final five wickets of the day before lunch.England started the innings seven runs ahead, but in the briefest window between rain showers, Australia struck twice, putting the home side on the back foot.Both openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett fell, as two wickets were lost for just two runs in 22 deliveries, to leave England 28 for two at the close of play.RecommendedMoeen Ali fined by ICC for using unauthorised drying spray on his bowling handEngland earn slender lead in Ashes opener as Ollie Robinson shines with the ballUsman Khawaja\u2019s first ton in England \u2018a bit more emotional\u2019 after crowd tauntsBrendon McCullum and Ben Stokes have said that there may be times when England have to absorb pressure, and before they had to return to the dressing room, it looked like that time had come.It will be up to England, and the captain, to determine their approach for what has set up to be a critical fourth day, with a lead of just 35 runs and diminished time available to try and force a result.While Stokes is likely to be subject to some questions over his decision to declare late on the first day, the fingers would be better pointed to England\u2019s mistakes in the field.Scott Boland celebrates the wicket of Zak Crawley as England\u2019s openers were both dismissed during rain breaks  (PA)In the morning session on the second day, Ben Stokes\u2019s side were firmly in control. Australia had been reduced to 67 for three, and both the key wickets of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne had fallen.While nothing can be taken away from Usman Khawaja\u2019s masterful 141 from 321 deliveries, England may be forced to address their missed opportunities to make inroads into the Australian batting line up.Jonny Bairstow missed a clear stumping chance to remove Cameron Green after just two balls in the afternoon of the second day, and made another costly error on the fourth ball of day three.Alex Carey, who was on 52, was handed a reprieve when the England wicketkeeper spilled the ball after diving low, with Australia 312 for five. He survived again, when Stokes dropped what would have been a stunning catch at cover when on 53.It wasn\u2019t until Australia had 338 that James Anderson finally claimed the wicket of Carey, with a ball that nipped back through the gap between bat and pad and into the stumps.James Anderson clean bowled Alex Carey after he was dropped by Jonny Bairstow on 52 (PA)Despite the breakthrough, England did not maintain the level of pressure, with Pat Cummins hitting Moeen Ali for successive sixes as they piled on the runs throughout the first hour and a half of play.RecommendedThe sporting weekend in picturesOllie Robinson \u2018doesn\u2019t care\u2019 about negative reception for his Usman Khawaja send-offEngland vs Australia LIVE: Ashes scorecard and first Test updatesKhawaja eventually fell into a cleverly planned trap.

I\u2019m disappointed about the Greek game, I\u2019m disappointed we didn\u2019t get the result that we needed.

You come away to these places and you really have to dig in, which we did. We got ourselves to half-time and then to concede so soon after was frustrating.\u201cBut we bounced back well from that and I thought we caused them problems. There are a lot of young lads in this team and I think the entire experience will have been good for them.\u201dFriday\u2019s frustration can serve as its own motivation for Monday as Northern Ireland look to deliver a win in front of their home fans.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be difficult to lift everyone after Friday night,\u201d McNair said. \u201cThe performance was good, obviously it was disappointing but there were a lot of positives to take from it.

He was three strokes clear after 14 holes and appeared to be cruising to glory, before bogeys at 15 and 16 gave the chasing McIlroy a sniff. However, the Northern Irishman was simply unable to make a putt all day as a lone birdie on the 1st was cancelled out by a bogey at 14 for an uninspired round of 70, which meant pars at 17 and 18 were enough for 29-year-old Clark to add his name to the long list of US Open winners.McIlroy\u2019s major drought now stands at nine years and his quiet Sunday with the putter was reminiscent of last year\u2019s Open at St Andrew\u2019s when he couldn\u2019t reel in a catchable Cameron Smith \u2013 who incidentally finished fourth in Los Angeles on -6 after an impressive final-day 67.

To find the bunker with a wedge from the middle of the fairway will be one he\u2019ll rue as well.Wyndham Clark played his part and deserved his win but Rory will know that it was out there for him to win today and that perhaps is what makes it even worse.

He survived again, when Stokes dropped what would have been a stunning catch at cover when on 53.It wasn\u2019t until Australia had 338 that James Anderson finally claimed the wicket of Carey, with a ball that nipped back through the gap between bat and pad and into the stumps.James Anderson clean bowled Alex Carey after he was dropped by Jonny Bairstow on 52 (PA)Despite the breakthrough, England did not maintain the level of pressure, with Pat Cummins hitting Moeen Ali for successive sixes as they piled on the runs throughout the first hour and a half of play.RecommendedThe sporting weekend in picturesOllie Robinson \u2018doesn\u2019t care\u2019 about negative reception for his Usman Khawaja send-offEngland vs Australia LIVE: Ashes scorecard and first Test updatesKhawaja eventually fell into a cleverly planned trap.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA festival on the Tuscan coast sounds like a dream. The idyllic town of Camaiore, just a 30-minute drive from Pisa, provides a lush backdrop for La Prima Estate, a festival still very much in its infancy. (The first-ever edition took place last year). The sandy coast of Versilia stretches for miles to the west of Camaiore, while the Apuan Alps hug the city towards the east. It\u2019s hot, dry and salty; the glittering sea beckons.It\u2019s the right place for a festival that bills itself as \u201cmore than a music festival\u2026 a holiday experience\u201d. Last year, La Prima Estate took place over six consecutive days, bringing in big names including The National, Bonobo, Duran Duran, Anderson Paak, and Jamie xx. This year, the organisers have split the festival over two weekends in an attempt to draw more long-weekenders. Nas and Bon Iver headline the first weekend, with Alt-J, Jamiroquai and Metro Boomin fronting the second. Other artists on the line-up include Japanese Breakfast, Kings of Convenience, Chet Faker, and Bicep, as well as a smattering of Italian bands and DJs.The stage is set in the Bussola Domani park, an expansive green space that had been a cornerstone for live music in the Seventies and Eighties. Given the organisers\u2019 experience with the month-long Lucca Summer Festival, one of the most anticipated events in Italy, the excellent sound quality and staging is hardly surprising. The music on offer is faultless, from Nas\u2019 fiery 90-minute performance to Bon Iver\u2019s emotional rendition of \u201cSkinny Love\u201d, which prompted tears from some of the audience. Norwegian indie darlings Kings of Convenience put on a standout show, taking the crowd from twee acoustic singalongs to a mass dance party with their fan favourite \u201cI\u2019d Rather Dance With You\u201d.RecommendedGlastonbury has abandoned its roots, and it desperately needs them backPrimavera Sound 2023 Porto, review: The star power of Blur, Kendrick and Rosalia trumps a weekend of dreadful weatherThe 11 best music festivals in the UK for 2023But there is something missing. La Prima Estate hopes to differentiate itself by offering experiences beyond the music (the site advertises day activities from \u201cart to sport, to food and wine\u201d) but in reality, these are few and far between. Sure, festival-goers can book into a 9am yoga class or a 10am surf lesson, but these aren\u2019t particularly special or interesting activities \u2013 particularly given it\u2019s a calm sea with no waves in sight to actually surf. One activity that did stand out was a three-hour cycle around the Versilia hinterland with Italian professional cyclist Manuel Quinziato. Be warned, though: this specific offering only appeals to those in tip-top physical shape. Bon Iver plays La Prima Estate 2023 in Lido di Camaiore (La Prima Estate)Where are the cooking lessons? Where are the wine and craft beer tastings? Even an excursion into the mountains would have gone down a treat, or simply a guided walking tour around the historic sites of Camaiore. These are activities that would have helped La Prima Estate fulfill the \u201choliday\u201d part of their \u201cfestival-holiday hybrid\u201d promise. There are some special moments \u2013 the fact that attendees can book a special lunch at a partner restaurant is a nice touch, as is the opportunity to speak with leading figures in the music industry \u2013 but most of the incredible experiences and activities La Prima Estate had advertised turn out to be non-existent. The festival leans heavily on its musical attractions \u2013\u00a0which makes sense given how the experiential elements of the event are in need of some refining. La Prima Estate 2023 showcases the festival\u2019s ability to attract brilliant artists and put on some seriously stellar shows but if it wants to be seen on the same level as say, the UK\u2019s Wilderness festival, then the organisers have a long way to go. The vibes of Camaiore are immaculate, and La Prima Estate would do well to make full use of its incredible location if it wants to, as it says, show the world that it\u2019s \u201cone of the big boys\u201d on the festival circuit.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe smell of BBQ and leather hangs in the air. All around, you hear the strum of banjos, the swoop of fiddles, and the occassional thud of an axe splintering wood. A mustachioed man with a microphone announces that a chili-eating contest is about to begin on the Live Fire stage. This is Black Deer Festival, the UK\u2019s annual celebration of country and Americana music.Far from your bogstandard tailgate party, Black Deer is a decidedly genteel affair that begins with a stroll through a flower-filled meadow in Eridge Park (the oldest deer park in Britain) and down to the main festival site. Dust kicks up underfoot as punters amble across the sun-beaten grass, hauling those cursed fold-out chairs (one of the few blights on an otherwise perfect weekend) and their kids in four-wheeled carts. It\u2019s Stetsons as far as the eye can see, along with neckerchiefs, cowboy boots and denim cut-offs.You don\u2019t have to throw on a fringed leather jacket to get into the mood, though. That\u2019s what the music is for. And the festival\u2019s curators have outdone themselves this year. Kelly Jones of Stereophonics fame sounds right at home with Far From Saints, his folk/Americana project with Ohio-based singer Patty Lynn and musician Dwight Baker. Meanwhile, US singer-songwriter Kurt Vile and his band kick back with some hazy stoner rock. After the sun goes down, Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats raise merry hell with their full-throated, foot-stomping blues.A smattering of rain on Saturday fails to dampen spirits. Thunderstorms have been threatening all weekend, but the drizzle stops right in time for recent Grammy-winner Bonnie Raitt, who takes command of the stage like the seasoned pro she is. Perhaps it\u2019s unusual to follow up with a rock band as your headliner, but no one seems to mind when The Pretenders get everyone dancing to \u201cDon\u2019t Get Me Wrong\u201d and \u201cBack on the Chain Gang\u201d.The last day of Black Deer opens to blazing sunshine, brunch and a stirring gospel choir belting out Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cOne Love\u201d. The afternoon, however, is a different story. Ominous storm clouds gather overhead; the firepit in the VIP bar is swiftly extinguished. Suddenly, the field seems empty compared to the buzzing crowds of yesterday.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFor Andrew Barth Feldman, a 21-year-old musical theatre actor making his major-movie debut, saying yes to the ribald Jennifer Lawrence comedy No Hard Feelings was a no-brainer\u2026 once he got used to knowing absolutely everyone would see him in his birthday suit.\u201cWhen you first become an actor, in your head you can\u2019t help but wonder, like, \u2018Would I ever get naked for a movie?\u2019,\u201d he whispers, as if letting me in on an industry secret. \u201cLike if I ever get asked to\u2026 would I be comfortable doing that?\u201d To cut a long story short, he was. That is indeed him clinging to the top of a speeding vehicle as naked as the day he was born. Still, he had the last-minute jitters. \u201cWe had intimacy coordinators, it was a closed set, and it was truly as safe as it could be but just as a bodily thing, it was so, so weird. It\u2019s like your whole body exists for the movie.\u201d He was just relieved his nudity was meant to be ridiculous. \u201cOh god, if the whole world had to swoon over me, I\u2019d be like, you definitely should have found somebody else.\u201dIn No Hard Feelings, Lawrence\u2019s character Maddie is paid by a pair of affluent Long Islanders to seduce their awkward 19-year-old son Percy before he goes off to college. Pull him out of his shell, be his girlfriend for a few weeks, then send him on his way. Deflowering sweet, romantic Percy, however, is more of a challenge than she first envisages.Today, Feldman is sharply dressed in a studded jacket in a central London hotel; his hair swoops up. Giggling throughout our conversation, he has a toothy smile, energetic eyebrows and the uncanny ability to make everyone in the room feel ancient. When I tell Feldman that Hollywood doesn\u2019t make many big, glossy comedies for cinemas anymore, he admits that he can\u2019t remember a time when they weren\u2019t a rarity otherwise confined to streaming \u2013 he only remembers seeing Anchorman 2 in cinemas when he was 11. As I turn to dust in front of him, Feldman elaborates: \u201cOn set there was always this sense of \u2018everyone needs to laugh more\u2019. And you saw that when the first trailer came out. There was this wave of people saying, \u2018Oh god, I can\u2019t wait to feel this again in a movie theatre\u2019.\u201dThere was another wave of people, though, who became armchair critics. By nature of its premise, No Hard Feelings has also been trailed by a degree of hand-wringing. \u201cIsn\u2019t this creepy?\u201d has become a common refrain. Along with: \u201cThis is a horror movie,\u201d or \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have been made if the genders were reversed,\u201d or \u201cIs Jennifer Lawrence grooming that poor boy?\u201d Which\u2026 sure. But it\u2019s also incredibly funny seeing her repeatedly fail at it.RecommendedAlexandra Burke on motherhood, method acting and her film debut: \u2018I did an hour on my spin bike to celebrate getting the part\u2019Emile Hirsch on remorse, wanderlust and child stardom: \u2018I was wary of the dark underbelly of Hollywood\u2019Josh Hartnett on Black Mirror, Oppenheimer and saying no to celebrity: \u2018I was on a different path\u2019\u201cI think we all had a sense that this is a controversial premise,\u201d Feldman admits. \u201cBut the film never condones the things that Jennifer\u2019s character does or that my character\u2019s parents do. This is a movie about flawed people and it\u2019s a cringe comedy. You\u2019re meant to cringe! You\u2019re meant to sit with those uncomfortable feelings.\u201d He\u2019s thought a lot about the simmering backlash. \u201cI do fear that we\u2019re getting \u2013 or have gotten \u2013 to a place where societally we don\u2019t like to sit with those feelings [through] movies, and especially in comedy. Obviously, on social media, we\u2019re rewarded in numbers by having the most inflammatory take on something before we even know what it\u2019s actually like. But I think if there was ever a real sense of panic about [the premise], we wouldn\u2019t have made the movie.\u201d\n\nAs much as we\u2019ve evolved socially, there\u2019s still this inherent pressure for young men to be sexualPlus, he adds, No Hard Feelings does have an important message to it \u2013 specifically that too many young men are asked to emulate outmoded ideas about masculinity. \u201cAs much as we\u2019ve evolved socially, there\u2019s still this inherent pressure for young men to be sexual,\u201d he says. \u201cOr at the very least to meet a certain expectation of having sex by a certain age, or to be sexual by a certain age \u2013 if they even want to be sexual at all. I think we have much more vocabulary now to talk about our emotions than we did in years past, but that pressure still exists. If this movie normalises anything, I hope it\u2019s wanting to find love and connection, because that\u2019s really what we all want. And I think men, especially, get asked to shut that down and not prioritise it.\u201dFeldman and Lawrence bonded instantly during their first chemistry read. It\u2019s replicated on screen, the two sourcing a lightly chaotic comic rhythm of seduction met by discomfort. \u201cWe quickly realised that we\u2019re both most comfortable once we\u2019ve overshared,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSo day one of shooting, we were telling each other our deepest, darkest secrets.\u201d He adores her. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that she\u2019s become this very special person in my life, who I think is gonna be in my life now for a very long time.\u201d He adds that it\u2019s only on the film\u2019s press tour that he\u2019s realised that there are two distinct versions of his co-star: his buddy Jen, and screaming-fans-outside-the-hotel-we\u2019re-currently-in JENNIFER LAWRENCE. \u201cShe\u2019s still one of my closest friends, but when we\u2019re on camera together doing interviews, I\u2019m very aware that people are gonna be watching us and saying, that\u2019s Jennifer Lawrence and this\u2026\u201d He stammers for the right word. \u201cMuppet!\u201dOdd couple: Andrew Barth Feldman and Jennifer Lawrence in \u2018No Hard Feelings\u2019  (Macall Polay/Columbia Pictures)Before No Hard Feelings, Feldman\u2019s biggest claim to fame was being \u2013 aged just 16 \u2013 the youngest actor to assume the starring role in the acclaimed musical Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway. Originated by Ben Platt \u2013 who reprised the role in an ill-fated 2021 film adaptation \u2013 Evan is a high-school outcast who fakes a correspondence with a recently deceased classmate. Feldman caught the eye of the show\u2019s casting directors after winning a Jimmy Award \u2013 basically the Tonys for school musicals across the USA \u2013 for his Long Island high school\u2019s production of Catch Me If You Can, and says he only stood out in the room because he basically was Evan Hansen.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7-daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

I was this kid who didn\u2019t know yet what was going on with him, playing this kid who didn\u2019t know yet what was going on with him. I think part of the phenomenon of seeing me in the show was that I wasn\u2019t ready for it. You weren\u2019t seeing an actor try to recall what it was like when they were a teenager, you were seeing an actor in real time trying to figure himself out.\u201dTransformative: Feldman during a performance of Broadway\u2019s \u2018Dear Evan Hansen\u2019 in 2019 (Broadway World/Shutterstock)Between leaving the show in 2020 and filming No Hard Feelings, he\u2019s had other roles \u2013 notably a recurring gig as a French foreign exchange student on Disney\u2019s High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and as anxious chef Alfredo Linguini in the instantly viral, very unauthorised Disney/Pixar spoof Ratatouille the Musical. But it was Evan Hansen that left the biggest mark. Not only was it professionally transformative, but it was also an experience marked by tragedy: seven months into Feldman\u2019s year-long run, his mother died following a sudden illness.\u201cIt\u2019s not something I don\u2019t like talking about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually wonderful to talk about, because she was so amazing. She was not a stage mom, or somebody really pushing me into the light or anything. She was actually very fearful of it, that I wouldn\u2019t be stable and all of these things.\u201d She ended up coming to every Dear Evan Hansen show for the whole first month of his run.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHolidaymakers are being warned after nearly 50 beaches in Spain were given the substandard \u201cBlack Flag\u201d rating, with dog poo, pollution and poor urban development being blamed.In the annually released ratings, the environmental group Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n (Ecologists in Action) slammed areas that, in its view, fail to meet environmental and sustainability standards.Following this year\u2019s inspection of more than 8,000km (4,970 miles) of Spanish coastline, 48 Black Flags have been issued, according to the Banderas Negras (Black Flags) 2023 report. This is the same as the number listed last year.Many of the beaches, including spots in Alicante, Barcelona and the Canary Islands, are popular with international tourists. In one particularly damning assessment, Calzoa beach in Pontevedra, Galicia, was dubbed the worst dog beach in Spain, with the Black Flag report stating that the country is facing problems with \u201cthe proliferation of designated dog beaches without a prior environmental impact assessment.\u201dOther affected areas include the Basque Country, Andalusia (such as beaches in Malaga and Almeria), and Valencia.RecommendedThe best Malaysia holiday destinations: Where to stay and when to travelBest beaches in Northern Ireland to visit this summerThe best islands in Thailand to visit for holidays for couples, families and moreThe Balearic Islands received a Black Flag due to the proliferation of jet skis, as well as for pollution from parties around Colonia de Sant Jordi, a resort town in south-east coast of Mallorca.More than 10 of the Black Flags issued were due to chemical spills, faulty sanitation and purification problems, while other issues included chemical, noise and light pollution, the accumulation of marine litter, and the urbanisation of the coast, \u201csometimes even invading the maritime-terrestrial public domain\u201d.Ana Aldarias, a spokesperson for Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n, said: \u201cWe have to emphasise that ecological attacks will continue to occur as long as economic growth prevails over any other criteria and respect for the environment is conspicuous by its absence.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOne of my favourite Mexico City hangouts is La Opera, a historic restaurant famous for its sopa de tortilla, red velvet booths and frescoed ceilings pockmarked with bullets fired by Pancho Villa in 1914. The Mexican revolutionary was apparently offended by the opulence of the venue, with its hand-carved walnut bar shipped from New Orleans, and fired off a few rounds to express his displeasure.I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019d be more supportive of the latest trend shaping Mexico City\u2019s food scene \u2013 a determination to showcase homegrown produce in new, innovative ways. Davide Preziuso, Andaz Mexico City Condesa\u2019s executive chef, is particularly excited about the current passion for sustainable seafood. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show people that it\u2019s not just about salmon and sea bass,\u201d says Davide during a chat on the hotel\u2019s rooftop, with its colourful food truck. \u201cPersonally, I love Mexico\u2019s octopus \u2013 you can fish it without having a massive impact.\u201d This approach has allowed Mexico to showcase its offerings to new audiences. \u201cThe Japanese have started buying our octopus and red tuna,\u201d says Davide. Granted, Japan ordering plane-loads of seafood doesn\u2019t scream sustainability, but it\u2019s a reminder that much of Mexico\u2019s bounty remains untapped.Joe Gelato boasts some seriously niche flavours (Tamara Hinson)Davide believes the Juarez neighbourhood could soon steal Condesa\u2019s crown when it comes to culinary coolness. Until recently, Juarez was the place to buy (mostly stolen) car parts. Shady types who came for pre-loved pistons made it a no-go zone, but a recent influx of entrepreneurs lured by cheap rent kick-started its transformation.

His mezcal gelato is legendary, although agave-based gelato is now standard fare here. Flavours like olive oil, worm salt and sea urchin, all made using fresh ingredients, put him on the map. Sea urchin, apparently, is perfectly suited to Mexico\u2019s stifling summers. \u201cIt\u2019s really refreshing, with hints of seawater,\u201d he says. Other hits include mole gelato \u2013 a tribute to the cocoa-based marinade known as Mexicans\u2019 mother sauce \u2013 and a lollipop sprinkled with chicatanas, protein-rich Mexican flying ants. \u201cIt\u2019s got a wonderful, coffee-like smokiness,\u201d says Jos\u00e9, producing a dead ringer for a Magnum, albeit sprinkled with ants, not almonds. It\u2019s absolutely delicious.Rosetta chef Elena Reygadas (Ana Hop)Another fan of Mexico\u2019s ants is chef Elena\u00a0Reygadas, recently named Latin America\u2019s Best Female by the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants organisation. She\u2019s the owner of Rosetta, a restaurant in the Roma neighbourhood. It\u2019s a fitting setting for someone who doesn\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 Roma\u2019s famous for its Art Deco buildings, which contrast sharply with the Baroque architecture dominating the city centre.Like a growing number of Mexican chefs, Elena, whose restaurant is inside a beautifully restored Beaux Arts mansion, returned here after stints abroad \u2013 including one at London\u2019s Locanda Locatelli. Her USP is her passion for highlighting connections between food and the environment, and her Rosetta Notebooks \u2013 musings on subjects such as food security, which diners can purchase for a few pesos \u2013 have become collectables.Rosetta\u2019s most popular items include sourdough topped with a butter made from chicatanas, and beignet-style pastries made with mamey, a cacao pod-shaped fruit. But Elena honed in on a seldom-used part. \u201cMamey pits have an almond flavour, and we use them to make a cream for our pastries.\u201d Other bestsellers include sourdough versions of Mexico\u2019s traditional pan\u00a0dulce pastries. \n\nMexican gastronomy has so many historic influences and they\u2019re still presentElena\u00a0Reygadas, chef\u201cMexican gastronomy has so many historic influences and they\u2019re still present,\u201d says Elena. \u201cYou can still see ancient pre-Hispanic ingredients and techniques, but you\u2019ll also see ingredients which arrived through migration \u2013 with the Lebanese who migrated here, for example. But we\u2019ve definitely become more proud of our roots.\u201dThe drinks scene has experienced a makeover, too. While bars worldwide clamour to stock the latest mezcal brands, at Polanco\u2019s Ticuchi, beverage director Javier Gomez champions lesser-known Mexican spirits. The Not Pimm\u2019s Cup cocktail, for example, is made with pepino (a melon-like fruit) and Liquor de Chile Ancho (a poblano pepper-based spirit), while the CDMX is made with Xtabent\u00fan, an anise-based liquor from Mexico\u2019s Yucatan region.Javier\u2019s favourite brands are ones you\u2019re unlikely to find outside of Mexico, and Ticuchi\u2019s dimly lit, bat cave-like vibe is a nod to an often-overlooked hero of the agave spirits industry. \u201cIn the Zapotec language, ticuchi means bat, which is an important pollinator in the agave industry,\u201d says Javier, who claims Ticuchi\u2019s popularity relies heavily on his army of so-called agave nerds sniffing out lesser-known spirits producers motivated by passion, not pesos.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA British Airways flight from Singapore to London Heathrow hit such severe turbulence over the Bay of Bengal that the plane had to return to its starting point where possible damage was checked. Several BA cabin crew were injured in the incident in the early hours of 16 June.One newspaper report was headlined: \u201cWe were in freefall for 1,000ft.\u201d That did not happen.But just how dangerous is turbulence \u2013 and is it getting worse? These are the key questions and answers.What happened in this incident?British Airways flight BA12 was flying normally from Singapore to London Heathrow on Friday 16 June across the Bay of Bengal, midway between Sri Lanka and Thailand and about two hours into what was expected to be a 13-hour flight. About 260 passengers were on board.RecommendedLondon-Sydney direct flights a step closer as Qantas reveals \u2018anti-jet lag\u2019 measuresWhy does flight cancellation misery always hit BA at Heathrow and easyJet at Gatwick?British Airways cancels 60 more flights as storm disruption continuesThe Boeing 777-300ER was cruising at a ground speed of 598mph at an altitude of 30,000ft when it encountered severe clear-air turbulence (CAT). While the seat belt signs were on, meaning passengers should all have been strapped in, cabin crew were active.Several members of cabin crew were injured. The captain decided to return to Singapore, which it did at an altitude of 29,000ft; this may account for some of the reports that the aircraft \u201cfell\u201d 1,000 feet, even though it will have been a controlled descent.The plane landed safely just after 3am local time and was checked for structural damage, while medical care was arranged for the injured. The aircraft later positioned (flew without passengers) to its base at London Heathrow. What does British Airways say?\u201cSafety is always our priority and we\u2019re looking after our crew after one of our flights experienced a rare episode of severe turbulence. Our highly trained team on board reassured customers and the aircraft returned to Singapore as a precaution.\u201cWe\u2019ve apologised to customers for the delay to their flight and provided them with hotel accommodation and information on their consumer rights. We\u2019re rebooking customers onto the next available flights with us and other airlines.\u201dThere and back: Flightpath of British Airways flight BA12 from Singapore, which turned back after severe turbulence (Flightradar24)What is clear-air turbulence?The US National Weather Service says: \u201cTurbulence is caused by abrupt, irregular movements of air that create sharp, quick updrafts/downdrafts. These updrafts and downdrafts occur in combinations and move aircraft unexpectedly.\u201dThe Federal Aviation Administration defines clear-air turbulence as \u201csudden severe turbulence occurring in cloudless regions that causes violent buffeting of aircraft \u2026 CAT is especially troublesome because it is often encountered unexpectedly and frequently without visual clues to warn pilots of the hazard.\u201dHow much danger was the aircraft in?The experience was doubtless highly alarming and uncomfortable for passengers, but turbulence at high altitude does not bring down modern commercial jet aircraft.Planes are designed and tested to withstand severe forces, and weather radar is good at avoiding the worst visible turbulence. But injuries on board an aircraft are alarming \u2013 with cabin crew particularly vulnerable.Writing for the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), former pilot and flight safety specialist Steve Landells says: \u201cThe injuries we see tend to occur when people aren\u2019t strapped in. This may be because the turbulence is encountered without warning but we also see quite a lot of people hurt because they don\u2019t obey the \u2018fasten seat belt\u2019 instructions.How often does this sort of incident happen?One study suggests aircraft encounter severe clear air turbulence at least 790 times a year, which works out at once every 11 hours. But climate researchers say the incidence at a typical point over the North Atlantic increased by 55 per cent between 1979 and 2020.According to Paul Williams, professor of Atmospheric Science in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere would increase the average amount of severe clear air turbulence at 36,000 feet over the North Atlantic by 149 per cent. As a result, hazardous turbulence on commercial flights could increase to five serious cases a day on average.Environmentalists will say that airline passengers are causing the very problems that they are alarmed about \u2013 since aviation contributes to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.Should passengers worry if they\u2019re planning a flight?No. You would be extremely unlucky be one of those 790 annual cases; severe turbulence affects only one departure in 50,000. If the science is correct, the numbers will increase \u2013 but only slowly. Passengers should already be taking precautions about the risk of hitting turbulence \u2013 the most basic of which is keeping your seatbelt at least loosely fastened whenever seated. (In any event that is good practice because it means the crew don\u2019t have to wake you up if the seatbelt sign goes on).Steve Landells of Balpa says: \u201cDon\u2019t be tempted to get up when the captain has told you to strap in; we are always talking to the pilots of aircraft ahead of us and, even if it is smooth when we put the signs on, we may know it is going to get bumpy soon.\u201dIn my experience, if the pilot instructs the cabin crew to strap in, you know you\u2019re in for a particularly lively ride.What\u2019s the worst turbulence you have encountered?Both while flying over south-east Europe: a small Airbus flying from Vienna to Cairo, and a very large Airbus flying from London Heathrow to Singapore. On both occasions it was very uncomfortable. I\u2019d liken it to a theme-park ride in which you keep going round and round without a chance to get off.It was made all the most disconcerting because the pilots did not fully explain what was happening and why, and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 they were doing about it. (Neither flight was on British Airways \u2013 the carriers were Austrian Airlines and Singapore Airlines respectively).There have been a lot of storms lately \u2013 what happens if a plane is struck by lightning?Aircraft should be in no danger. Steve Landells of Balpa says: \u201cWhen an aircraft is struck by lightning, the energy within the lightning is kept on the outside of the fuselage either by the metal that the aircraft is made of or, in the case of modern composite materials, by a metal mesh that is built into the skin.\u201cThis allows the lightning to track around the aircraft to a point where it can be discharged into the atmosphere.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has sparked a debate after she refused to be a bridesmaid in her soon-to-be sister-in-law\u2019s wedding.In a recent post in the popular \u201cAm I the A**hole?\u201d Reddit forum, Reddit user u/notyourbridesmaid, asked if she was in the wrong for saying no to being in the bride\u2019s wedding party. After praising the bride Kim\u2019s relationship with Tom, who is the original poster\u2019s older brother, the woman also confessed that she isn\u2019t close friends with this bride-to-be.\u201cI\u2019ve always found Kim a little excitable for my taste, but I\u2019m well aware my taste is irrelevant, and I don\u2019t see Kim that often, as I\u2019m a mom to a young child and I live abroad half the year,\u201d she wrote.She noted that when she got home, she was surprised to see a package from Kim, in which the bride asked the Reddit user to be one of her bridesmaids. The women then explained why she wanted to say no to this request. \u201cI planned to give her a call within a couple of days to let her know I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, citing a busy schedule and the demands of a toddler,\u201d she wrote, before adding that her husband had a medical emergency on the day that she was going to contact Kim. \u201cIt slipped my mind until I was on my way to Tom and Kim\u2019s engagement cocktail party at my parents\u2019 house.\u201dRecommendedBride praised for kicking bridesmaid out of wedding after disagreement over dress colourAirline saves the day after bridesmaid forgets her dressWhy the \u2018anti-bride wedding\u2019 trend is the biggest thing sweeping this yearThe woman explained that while she didn\u2019t plan on saying anything at the engagement party, Kim still pulled her aside and introduced her to the other bridesmaids. Following this introduction, which she claimed \u201ccemented [her] decision\u201d about not being in the wedding, she noted that she told Kim about her choice privately. According to the original poster, the bride-to-be was upset about the news and started \u201cto argue\u201d.\u201cShe snapped, asking why, at which point I calmly told her that while I don\u2019t have to explain myself and didn\u2019t appreciate her not respecting my answer, I didn\u2019t have time to take part in the activities or dedicate any time to planning or helping her,\u201d she continued.She added: \u201cKim tried to argue it with me, which drew the attention of some of her friends, so they were now listening in, and I again explained to her that I couldn\u2019t do it. Kim then snapped that that\u2019s just an excuse.\u201dShe also claimed that Kim told her that she \u201ccan make time for things\u201d that she wanted to do, referring to how the OP planned and hosted a wedding for her husband\u2019s employee last year.From there, the woman said that she told Kim that they were \u201cnot friends\u201d, causing Kim to start \u201cbawling\u201d. She alleged that Kim\u2019s \u201cintoxicated friends started swearing\u201d at her. While she noted that her peers have had mixed reactions to this incident, the woman also expressed that her brother still wants her to be in the wedding.

She further explained how she was looking after her husband during that week.\u201cI got home on Sunday night, received the package. Monday morning, my husband was taken to hospital,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI forgot everything that happened before that moment for the next five days, including being asked to be a bridesmaid.\u201dShe noted that when she made her way to the engagement party on Saturday that\u2019s when she remembered the box, adding that she \u201cdidn\u2019t deliberately wait until the party to tell Kim\u201d.The Reddit post has quickly gone viral, with more than 5,700 upvotes.

The bride explained that while her wedding was \u201coceaned-themed\u201d, Anna\u2019s mother, who passed away a year ago, always loved the colour purple, so the bridesmaid asked if she could wear a purple dress to the wedding instead.RecommendedBride applauded for response to bridesmaid who refused to wear chosen colourOffice furniture company ridiculed over 3D model of remote worker in the futureKing Charles tickles Princess Charlotte in sweet Trooping the Colour momentThe bride noted that while she understood what Anna was going through, she kindly told her to stay \u201con theme\u201d.\u00a0 However, Anna arrived at the wedding wearing a purple dress, prompting the bride to tell her that she either had to change her outfit or leave the wedding entirely.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA 3D model created by a furniture company that allegedly depicts how remote workers will look in 70 years has sparked widespread amusement on social media.Last week, the DailyMail published an article about a \u201cgrotesque\u201d 3D model dubbed \u201cAnna\u201d, which purportedly shows the impacts of working from home on the body.According to the outlet, the model, which was created by office furniture company Furniture At Work, \u201crevealed what home-workers could look like by the year 2100\u201d, with the graphic showing a woman with a hunchback, dark eye bags and wrinkled features, and \u201cclaw-like hands\u201d from years spent working remotely.\u201cAnna displays many physical effects because of consistent use of technology, screen exposure and poor posture, as well as highlighting potential mental health issues,\u201d Furniture at Work said of the model, which was dressed in a pink workout set and which could be seen holding its elbows at a right-degree angle and its hands in a tense, clawed position.In the article, the outlet noted that the furniture company created Anna following \u201cresearch from the University of Leeds, which found that a third of UK home-workers have no dedicated workspace at home\u201d. According to the furniture company, in addition to \u201cscientific research\u201d, it \u201cworked with healthcare experts to reveal what the remote worker of the future could look like\u201d.RecommendedWhat will work look like in 2030?Why Gen Z could be the answer to your workforce woesWoman shocks viewers after revealing she is commuting by plane to internship each weekAs for why Anna\u2019s hands are depicted in the claw-like position, the company said it was meant to show the impact of hours spent with one\u2019s hands curled around a mouse, while Anna\u2019s hunched back is due to time spent working bent over in bed.However, on social media, the exaggerated depiction has largely been met with amusement from viewers, with many suggesting the model is \u201ccorporate propaganda\u201d intended to encourage workers to return to the office.\u201cThis return-to-office propaganda is getting wild,\u201d one person tweeted in response to the article, while another said: \u201cThey are doing anything and everything to get us back into the office.\u201dSomeone else sarcastically claimed that the model was proof the only way to avoid turning into a \u201cmisshapen goblin\u201d was to return to in-office work. \u201cAvoid turning into a misshapen goblin by sitting in a car for an hour to come sit at a desk for eight hours every day. It\u2019s much healthier,\u201d they wrote.Others joked about the differences between in-office workers and remote workers, with one person suggesting that, unlike Anna, those who have returned to the office will \u201cdevelop long, gorgeous, prehensile tails that can easily pluck slightly-expired luna bars from the office kitchen\u201d.The article also inspired various memes, with someone else tweeting: \u201cThis is what remote workers will look like in 2100,\u201d along with a photo of a crab illustration, while another person tweeted a photo of a skeleton along with the caption: \u201cWhat I, a remote worker, will look like by 2100.\u201d\u201cJokes on you, I already look like that,\u201d one person jokingly tweeted, while another said: \u201cAh yes, because using a computer at home is way worse for you than using a computer at the office!!\u201dAccording to someone else, the \u201cmost unrealistic thing about the prediction is that there will still be a recognisable human civilisation in 2100\u201d.The DailyMail\u2019s recent article also prompted many to point out that this isn\u2019t the first time the outlet has published a story about the impacts of work on the body, as it previously published an article about the negative ways in-office work will affect the body. The 2019 article showed a \u201cgrotesque model of how office workers could look in 20 years\u2019 time thanks to hours at their desk\u201d.\u201cLol this is just rehashing this from...Oct 2019. Note the spin\u2026\u201d one person tweeted alongside a screenshot of the article, which included a model named \u201cEmma\u201d.The furniture company\u2019s model also prompted many to defend the idea of remote work, with one person revealing that they are \u201cmore productive\u201d and now enjoy a better work-life balance as a result of working from home.\u201cHmm I\u2019ve lost 20lbs, do yoga daily, am more productive, and my work life balance is 70,000 per cent better since starting remote working,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMust be doing something wrong? Or, ya know, this is some incredible bulls**t propaganda. TBD.\u201dOn Twitter, where the DailyMail\u2019s link to the article has been viewed more than 16.7m times, users have attached a context section to the tweet that reads: \u201cNobody has predicted that this is what home workers will look like by 2100.\u201cThese images were created by an office furniture company \u2018to visualise the effects of not having a proper place to work at home\u2019 and \u2018to reveal what the remote worker of the future could look like\u2019\u201d.The article and the 3D model have since been added to the KnowYourMeme website, a database that defines meme-worthy moments on the internet. \u201cMany commenters chalked \u2018Anna\u2019 up to fearmongering sensationalism on the part of the DailyMail and Furniture at Work, and were much more apt to crack jokes and make memes about the paper\u2019s bleak prognostication than fear for the future of humanity,\u201d the outlet notes.As of 19 June, Furniture at Work\u2019s blog post about \u201cAnna\u201d appears to have been taken down.RecommendedMartha Stewart says America will \u2018go down the drain\u2019 if employees work remotelyWoman sparks debate for refusing to be a bridesmaid in future sister-in-law\u2019s weddingKing Charles tickles Princess Charlotte in sweet Trooping the Colour momentAccording to data from the US Census Bureau, between 2019 and 2021, the number of people primarily working from home tripled from 5.7 per cent (roughly nine million people) to 17.9 per cent (27.6 million people).The Independent has contacted the DailyMail and Furniture at Work for comment."}, {"_id": "64909b5a51ac33155408cf97", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/king-charles-trooping-the-colour-princess-charlotte-b2360358.html", "primaryCategory": "Royal Family", "subCategories": "test", "title": "King Charles tickles Princess Charlotte in sweet Trooping the Colour moment: \u2018Just being grandad\u2019", "lead": "<p>King Charles III and Princess Charlotte shared sweet interaction on Buckingham Palace balcony at Trooping the Colour  </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:22:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:54.920981", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T16:22:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/17/charles%20tickles%20charlotte.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But a report by The Wall Street Journal claimed that the couple did not meet \u201cthe productivity benchmarks required to receive the full payout from the deal\u201d, with the duchess releasing only 12 episodes of Archetypes since the partnership began.RecommendedRoyal family members wish Prince Harry a happy 37th birthdayPrince Harry is second least popular royal behind Andrew, poll showsPrince Harry and Jill Biden celebrate veterans at Warrior Games eventA leading Spotify executive, Bill Simmons, branded the Sussexes a pair of \u201cf***ing grifters\u201d in his own podcast, The Ringer.The Independent has contacted Harry and Meghan\u2019s representative for comment."}, {"_id": "64909b5c51ac33155408cf9d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/dior-sussex-stephen-jones-french-jennifer-lawrence-b2360216.html", "primaryCategory": "Fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Meghan \u2018set to sign\u2019 Dior deal: 4 times she\u2019s worn the brand", "lead": "It\u2019s no secret the Duchess of Sussex is fond of Dior \u2013 here are some examples of when she\u2019s worn the luxury brand.", "author": "Yolanthe Fawehinmi", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:27:54", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:15:56.387405", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-19T12:27:54+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/13/19125850-d87e79a2-3078-4699-a579-0eebf6e4d456.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritish strawberry season has finally arrived, albeit a month later than last year\u2019s first harvests due to the unsettled spring weather. A cooler than average April and May means the nation can expect to enjoy bigger, juicier and sweeter strawberries this year due to a slower ripening period. But it\u2019s the iconic summer occasions that mark peak popularity for the British strawberry. The slightly later season this year means British strawberries will be in their prime for Wimbledon, Royal Ascot, the Lord\u2019s Test Match and Henley Royal Regatta.Nick Marston, chairman of British Berry Growers, the industry body that represents 95 per cent of berries supplied to UK supermarkets says: \u201cOur strawberry crop has arrived a little later this year \u2013 but the good news is that they are well worth the wait. Cooler spring weather means that strawberries have ripened a little more slowly which allows them to grow particularly large \u2013 and the recent bright weather has boosted their sugar content ensuring they\u2019re incredibly sweet tasting too.\u201cAdvanced growing techniques now mean we now produce fresh British strawberries from May right through to October. That\u2019s great news for UK shoppers and it means big business for the UK economy too.\u201dRecommendedCan you whip up the perfect burger in just five minutes?These are the viral TikTok recipes you have to make this Father\u2019s DayEddie Huang: \u2018I\u2019ll never eat at BAO London \u2013 I know mine\u2019s better\u2019Despite the UK spending a whopping \u00a3778m on strawberries in the past 12 months, most of us (two-thirds) are storing them all wrong, according to a survey by the group. Marston says: \u201cWhen it comes to storing berries, wash them and pop them in the fridge to keep them fresher for longer. However, remember to take them out a couple of hours before eating so they can warm up to room temperature to release their wonderful natural flavours and sugars.\u201cStoring berries in glass mason jars or airtight containers can also help them last longer. Whilst laying berries on a paper towel to absorb moisture can also help maintain freshness\u201d.They\u2019re not just for covering in chocolate or dipping in cream either. From a superfood salad to a cooling punch, these strawberry recipes make the most of the cream of the British summer fruit crop. Superfood strawberry and pine nut saladUp your salad game with this superfood-packed winner  (British Berry Growers)Serves: 2Ingredients:100g strawberries1 large avocado100g kale150g cooked wild rice50g pine nuts2 tbsp olive oil2 tsp apple cider vinegar1 tsp mustardSaltPepperMethod:Toast the pine nuts in a small pan for a few minutes until golden then leave to the side to cool.Thinly slice the kale leaves into strips.Whisk the olive oil, vinegar and mustard together with a pinch of salt and pepper. Massage the kale with this dressing for 5 minutes until the kale wilts down.Cut the strawberries into quarters and the avocado into chunks and mix this with the kale salad. Stir in the wild rice, a pinch of salt and toasted pine nuts and serve.Cheat: add black Thai rice instead or buy a pouch of ready cooked brown basmati and wild rice.Strawberry and raspberry ripple Eton MessThe perfect picnic pud  (British Berry Growers)Make up the strawberry swirled meringues and fruit puree the day before, then just layer with whipped cream and extra fruit in recycled jam jars and screw on the lids, take out to the garden in a basket or pack into a cool box for a picnic pud.Serves: 6Prep time: 35 minutes | Cooking time: 1\u00bc-1\u00bd hoursIngredients:225g (8oz) strawberries, hulled100g (4oz) raspberriesFor the meringues:2 egg whites100g (4oz) caster sugarTo finish:300ml (\u00bd pint) double cream200g (7oz) 0.1% fat fromage frais225g (8oz) strawberries, hulled, roughly chopped50g (2oz) raspberriesMethod:1. Preheat the oven to 110C (225F)/gas mark \u00bc. Line a large baking sheet with non-stick baking paper.2. Puree the strawberries and raspberries in a liquidiser or food processor then press through a sieve.3. Whisk the egg whites in a large clean dry bowl until they form stiff moist looking peaks and you feel confident that if the bowl was turned upside down the egg whites wouldn\u2019t fall out! Gradually whisk in the sugar a teaspoonful at a time then continue whisking for a minute or two until really thick and glossy.4. Add 2 tablespoons of the berry puree then very briefly mix until marbled. Spoon into a large piping bag fitted with a 1.5cm (\u00be inch) plain piping tube, pipe small rounds on to the lined baking sheet. Bake for 1\u00bc-1\u00bd hours or until the meringues may be easily lifted off the paper. Leave to cool.5. To serve, lightly whip the cream until it forms soft swirls then fold in the fromage frais. Crumble the meringues then layer in jam jars or plastic containers with the remaining berry puree and diced strawberries. Decorate with the raspberries. Add the lids and keep in the fridge until ready to serve or transport to a picnic in a cool bag with a frozen ice block to keep them cold. Serve within 1\u00bd hours or the meringues tend to lose their crunch.Strawberry basil \u00e9clairsA favourite... with a twist  (British Berry Growers)Strawberries and cream get the French treatment, what\u2019s not to love!Makes: 16Prep time: 30 minutes | Cook time: 20 minutesIngredients:50g (2oz) butter, plus a little extra for greasing150ml (\u00bc pint) water65g (2\u00bdoz) plain flour, sifted2 medium eggs\u00bd tsp vanilla extractTo finish:400g (14oz) strawberries, hulled, chopped2 tbsp icing sugar, plus extra sifted icing sugar to decorate3 tbsp fresh chopped basil leaves300ml (\u00bd pint) double creamMethod:1. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas mark 6. Lightly butter 2 baking sheets and set aside.2. Add the measured butter to a saucepan with the water, heat gently until the butter has melted then bring to the boil. Take off the heat add the flour and stir together then put the pan back on the heat and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously until the mixture forms a smooth glossy ball that leaves the sides of the pan clean. Cool for 15 minutes.3. Gradually beat in the eggs and vanilla, beating well after each addition until all the eggs have been added and you have a smooth thick paste. If you have a food processor or electric mixer you might like to use this to save time.4. Spoon the choux pastry into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm (\u00bd inch) wide plain piping tube. Pipe 7.5cm (3 inch) long \u00e9clairs, leaving space between them to rise in the oven.5. Bake for 20 minutes until well risen and golden, pierce each \u00e9clair with a small knife so that the steam can escape then transfer to a wire rack to cool.6. Meanwhile mix the strawberries, 2 tablespoons icing sugar and basil together, cover the dish and leave at room temperature.7. About 1 hour before you are ready to serve the \u00e9clairs, slit open the sides with a serrated knife. Whisk the cream until it forms soft peaks then fold in any strawberry juices. Spoon into the \u00e9clairs and top with the strawberries and basil.8.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFestival season is in full swing, and thousands of music lovers will soon be flocking to Glastonbury, ready to revel and soak up the sounds.But can all those loud songs and thumping sound effects be detrimental to our hearing?\u201cAttending a concert may give you more than you bargained for,\u201d says Dr Deborah Lee, from Dr Fox Online Pharmacy.\u201cA recent 2022 BMJ study showed one billion people around the world aged 12-34 are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss. With 24% of young people found to have unsafe listening practices with personal music devices.\u201dShe adds that 48% were attending noisy venues, such as nightclubs and concerts, at least once a month without noise protection.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveDr Adam Hill, associate professor of electroacoustics, University of Derby, says: \u201cWhile festivals are, for many, one of the most enjoyable features of the summer, care must be taken to avoid over-exposing yourself to high sound levels, as this could result in long-term negative social and health impacts. You need to \u2018enjoy responsibly\u2019,\u201d Hill adds.How does noise exposure damage hearing?Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.Our hearing depends on the function of tiny hairs inside the cochlea \u2013 a snail-shaped organ in your middle ear, explains Dr Lee: \u201cSound waves cause the fluid in the cochlea to reverberate, resulting in the movement of these very fine hairs. This generates electrical impulses, which lead to the perception of sound in the brain.\u201dShe says there are around 15,000 of these specialised hair cells in each cochlea. Once they have been damaged, they cannot regenerate.\u201cWe are all exposed to noise every day, but it\u2019s loud noises above 85 dB that are likely to cause hearing loss,\u201d notes Lee. \u201cThis could be a sudden explosion, or continuous exposure to loud noise, such as attending a concert, working in a noisy factory or listening to a personal music device at high volumes.\u201dWhat are the signs you\u2019ve been exposed to too much noise?\u00a0There are a few tell-tale signs you\u2019ve been exposed to too much noise at a festival.One of them is tinnitus. \u201cIf you have ringing in your ears after attending a festival. This could persist for one or two days after the event \u2013 and may become permanent after repeated exposures over many years,\u201d says Dr Hill.Decreased sensitivity to sound is another thing you might notice. \u201cThings sound quieter/muffled,\u201d says Hill. \u201cThis usually takes one to two days to return to normal, but may become permanent after repeated exposure over many years.\u201dHe says you may also have difficulty understanding what someone is saying to you, especially in a noisy environment, and difficulty telling different sounds apart, like identifying multiple instruments when a band is playing.What can you do to protect your hearing at festivals?\u201cUse earplugs. Ideally custom-made earplugs, which is what musicians use,\u201d says Lee. \u201cCotton wool or foam rubber earplugs are ineffective. High-fidelity earplugs are a good option. These filter the sound without reducing the quality and provide ear protection.\u201dThis is especially important for babies and children at festivals \u2013 ear defenders are available to help protect their sensitive ears.Lee adds: \u201cTake regular breaks away from the noise. For every 3 dB above 80 dB, the time you can spend exposed to the noise without it damaging your hearing is halved.\u201cIt\u2019s safe to listen to noise at 80 dB for up to eight hours, so at 83 dB this time frame is reduced to four hours. If you do the maths, at the average concert, hearing damage could set in after just five minutes!\u201dShe suggests taking breaks such as going to the loo, getting a drink, or taking a walk away from the main body of the noise at regular intervals. And lastly: \u201cDon\u2019t stand within three metres of a loudspeaker.\u201dWhat can you do if you\u2019re already concerned?Regular festival goers may already have hearing concerns on their radar. \u201cThe best thing you can do is to go get your hearing tested,\u201d advises Dr Hill. \u201cThis will give you an indication of whether you have any issues already.\u201dRecommendedPrincess of Wales praises children\u2019s hospices as \u2018shining light\u2019 to familiesPrince William says his children will \u2018definitely be exposed\u2019 to homelessnessAdam Kay says he recently \u2018welcomed two young babies\u2019 via surrogateIf you enjoy going to festivals and other live music events on a regular basis, he says it would be wise to invest in some suitable reusable earplugs: \u201cHigh quality earplugs will reduce the effect of the musical content equally, so it sounds the same but at a lower level.\u201dIf you are involved in the music industry in any way (even if you are a student), Hill suggests making use of the Musicians\u2019 Hearing Health Scheme.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA bride has been praised for her response to a bridesmaid, after she refused to wear the chosen dress colour for her friend\u2019s big day.This week, Reddit user u/snipperrs went viral when she asked in the popular forum r/AmITheA**hole if she was in the wrong for kicking her bridesmaid out of her wedding because she arrived wearing a purple dress, rather than the approved bridesmaid dress colour.The 31-year-old bride explained that the bridesmaid, whom she refers to as \u201cAnna\u201d in the viral Reddit post, wanted to wear a purple dress to the wedding because it was her late mother\u2019s favourite colour. \u201cAnna\u2019s mother sadly passed away in January this year,\u201d the original poster (OP) wrote.For the wedding day, the bride decided to have an \u201cocean-themed wedding\u201d because she \u201cgrew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean\u201d. In line with the theme, the bride gave her bridesmaids the option to wear dresses that are blue, a coral pink, or a pastel green colour.However, because Anna\u2019s mother always loved the colour purple, Anna asked if she could wear a purple dress to the wedding instead. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my family\u2019s tradition \u2013 and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a gorgeous pastel blue dress with purple and gold accents \u2013 me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she\u2019s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme,\u201d the bride explained. \u201cTo this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected.\u201dRecommendedWoman asks if it\u2019s \u2018tacky\u2019 to sue family members for not coming to her weddingWoman praised for telling guests not to eat the food at her sister\u2019s weddingBride surprises father with sweet tribute before walking down the aisle: \u2018This made me cry\u2019Nearly four weeks had passed since she had heard from Anna, until one day when Anna texted the bride several photos of purple dresses and asked for her opinion. The woman \u201ckindly reminded Anna that she wouldn\u2019t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding,\u201d which had \u201cenraged\u201d Anna and led her to block the bride\u2019s text messages.Two days later, Anna unblocked the bride and apologised for the way she had acted. But when she arrived at the wedding wearing a purple dress, the bride told Anna that she either had to change her outfit or leave the wedding entirely. \u201cTo this, she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful,\u201d the bride wrote. \u201cAnna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family \u2018insensitive, selfish bastards.\u2019 She was escorted out the door screaming.\u201d\u201cOnce the wedding had ended I received messages from Anna\u2019s family, friends and even Anna,\u201d she added. \u201cThey were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an a**hole.\u201dThe bride\u2019s post has since received 7,000 interactions and more than 1,000 comments from fellow Reddit users.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA bride has been praised for her response to a bridesmaid, after she refused to wear the chosen dress colour for her friend\u2019s big day.This week, Reddit user u/snipperrs went viral when she asked in the popular forum r/AmITheA**hole if she was in the wrong for kicking her bridesmaid out of her wedding because she arrived wearing a purple dress, rather than the approved bridesmaid dress colour.The 31-year-old bride explained that the bridesmaid, whom she refers to as \u201cAnna\u201d in the viral Reddit post, wanted to wear a purple dress to the wedding because it was her late mother\u2019s favourite colour. \u201cAnna\u2019s mother sadly passed away in January this year,\u201d the original poster (OP) wrote.For the wedding day, the bride decided to have an \u201cocean-themed wedding\u201d because she \u201cgrew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean\u201d. In line with the theme, the bride gave her bridesmaids the option to wear dresses that are blue, a coral pink, or a pastel green colour.However, because Anna\u2019s mother always loved the colour purple, Anna asked if she could wear a purple dress to the wedding instead. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my family\u2019s tradition \u2013 and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a gorgeous pastel blue dress with purple and gold accents \u2013 me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she\u2019s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme,\u201d the bride explained. \u201cTo this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected.\u201dRecommendedWoman asks if it\u2019s \u2018tacky\u2019 to sue family members for not coming to her weddingWoman praised for telling guests not to eat the food at her sister\u2019s weddingBride surprises father with sweet tribute before walking down the aisle: \u2018This made me cry\u2019Nearly four weeks had passed since she had heard from Anna, until one day when Anna texted the bride several photos of purple dresses and asked for her opinion. The woman \u201ckindly reminded Anna that she wouldn\u2019t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding,\u201d which had \u201cenraged\u201d Anna and led her to block the bride\u2019s text messages.Two days later, Anna unblocked the bride and apologised for the way she had acted. But when she arrived at the wedding wearing a purple dress, the bride told Anna that she either had to change her outfit or leave the wedding entirely. \u201cTo this, she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful,\u201d the bride wrote. \u201cAnna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family \u2018insensitive, selfish bastards.\u2019 She was escorted out the door screaming.\u201d\u201cOnce the wedding had ended I received messages from Anna\u2019s family, friends and even Anna,\u201d she added. \u201cThey were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an a**hole.\u201dThe bride\u2019s post has since received 7,000 interactions and more than 1,000 comments from fellow Reddit users.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the second episode of The Idol, the porny music industry hatewatch available now on Sky, we see Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s pop star Jocelyn and her seedy cult leader boyfriend Tedros (played by The Weeknd) have kinky, mortifying sex. The scene finds the pair engaging in some mind-numbingly overdone foreplay, with Jocelyn masturbating on a bed wearing a red blindfold while Tedros crouches behind a chair and barks sexual commands at her. These include references to his \u201cfat tongue\u201d and his eagerness to \u201csuffocate\u201d her with his appendage.Viewers spat out their tea. Tedros\u2019 dialogue was quickly meme-ified, while GQ dubbed his and Jocelyn\u2019s embarrassing moaning match the \u201cworst sex scene in history\u201d. The Weeknd\u2019s unemotive, deadpan delivery aside \u2013 uncertainty currently surrounds whether or not it\u2019s intentional \u2013 the scene\u2019s script has been ridiculed far and wide. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re watching a prestige US drama series. Rather it\u2019s like reading entry level sexts on a 16-year-old boy\u2019s phone.But while some viewers decried such dirty talk as immature, nasty or downright awful, others admitted that they\u2019ve been personally privy to similar one-liners in the bedroom. In fact, some on social media have held their hands up and confessed that lazy or cringeworthy vocabulary in the bedroom is the norm for them.So, why is dirty talk so hard to get right? Is it, as seen so severely in The Idol, because much of it is rooted in sexual clich\u00e9s rather than the feel of the moment itself? When Tedros heaps praise on Jocelyn\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d, \u201clittle\u201d vagina, it is based on the assumption that heterosexual sex is meant to be more pleasurable if the vagina is more narrow. But clinical sexologist Ness Cooper tells me that the dialogue is based on a myth. \u201cSex isn\u2019t reliant on the tightness of a vagina, but it\u2019s about sensations all over the body,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat sex scene is also forgetting that, for men, sex can be an all-over body experience and not just a penis-focused experience.\u201dAccording to a UK poll by condom brand Durex, only one in five sexually active women and one in four sexually active men find sexting comfortable, so it\u2019s unsurprising that people might fall back on tired phrases when they\u2019re lost for words. In a comedy sketch that recently went viral, stand-up comic Grace Campbell joked about the moment a man asked her to \u201ccome for me\u201d during sex. Her audience roared with laughter. \u201cWell I\u2019m not gonna do it now then, am I?\u201d she said in retort. Campbell had touched on something important: it can be unsexy to be put on the spot in the bedroom, or have sexual acts commanded of you by a partner.RecommendedThe Weeknd responds to backlash over The Idol\u2019s most controversial scene so farCan casual sex ever really be casual?No sex please, we\u2019re millennials: Celibacy has become all the rage among young peopleCooper says that it\u2019s best to ground dirty talk in genuine emotion, rather than making blunt demands\u2026 at least at first. \u201cStart with something that will make you feel happy, and add in the emotional element,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd then afterwards, don\u2019t put your partner on the spot, but ask them what they thought.\u201d\n\nEmphasis on the tone is sometimes more important than the wording of erotic talkNess CooperCertain words might need to be avoided, too. Remember the 2000 episode of Sex and the City in which Kristin Davis\u2019s Charlotte was left shocked by her new boyfriend\u2019s tendency to shout insults at her in the bedroom? \u201cThe sex was good, except\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can say it,\u201d Charlotte stammers over brunch with her friends the morning after. \u201cHe said \u2018You f****** b****! You fucking w****\u2019,\u201d she cringes. She\u2019s left confused by it, and why her lover jumped straight into offensive banter during their first sexual encounter.Instead of relying on \u201ctight p****\u201d spiel or derogatory one-liners, sex therapist Georgina Vass says that it\u2019s best to ask a partner what phrases, names, or potentially offensive terms may turn them off. \u201cAnd equally important [is to] identify what would turn them on,\u201d she adds. \u201cTry to avoid attributing too much meaning [to] what they\u2019re into, [or] unhelpful thinking styles like mind-reading, making assumptions, or catastrophising.\u201dAnd it might be time to entirely drop some words from the vocabulary of dirty talk, too. Cooper says that certain words like \u201ctight\u201d or \u201cmoist\u201d are becoming outdated in the vocabulary of dirty talk. \u201cMoist\u201d, in particular, has a bad reputation even outside the sheets. \u201cThe reason why \u2018moist\u2019 is so popular on the ick factor isn\u2019t because of the word [itself], it\u2019s because people have made a big deal about it in society as a cringeworthy word,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if a word has generational or societal shame [attached] to it, it usually becomes less popular.\u201dBut Cooper says that specific words have different connotations for different people, which is why it\u2019s advised to have a dirty talk pre-talk. \u201cSometimes aggressive language can be a bit tricky. I\u2019ve had some clients who\u2019ve found what other people class [as] very tame or soft words to be aggressive due to their upbringing \u2013 it\u2019s personal.\u201dKristin Davis\u2019s Charlotte was once left mortified by her boyfriend\u2019s dirty talk on \u2018Sex and the City\u2019  (Sky/HBO)It\u2019s not all in the language, either. If The Weeknd has taught us anything in The Idol, it\u2019s that delivery is extremely important. Cooper thinks that the tone and intent of the scene might have been a reason why audiences had such a visceral, chastity-belt-inducing reaction to it. \u201cEmphasis on the tone is sometimes more important than the wording of erotic talk,\u201d Cooper explains. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s confusion between abuse and sexual pleasure that is consensual, and it\u2019s about whether there is intent to cause harm, or [if you\u2019re saying] the same words with a pleasurable intent.\u201d So while the wording does play a part, if Tedros had delivered his come-ons romantically, or even emotively, maybe the scene would have landed in an entirely different way.It also has to be remembered that the sex talk in The Idol is a performance.
