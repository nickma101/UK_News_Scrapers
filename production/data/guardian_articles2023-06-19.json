If the weather forecast is correct, batting could be very tricky in the morning and easier in the afternoon. But then it might rain so much overnight that there\u2019s no play in the morning. In short, nobody knows anything. Not even WinViz. \u201cIan Copestake (24th over) properly made me laugh with that,\u201d writes Liz Rippin. \u201cI do wish people would stop griping - this is thrilling, knife-edge stuff. The Aussie in our WhatsApp group is loving it, but I don\u2019t think we Brits are as accustomed to excitement as they are.\u201d 30th over: Australia 107-3 (Khawaja 34, Boland 13) Boland is on strike for Broad, which Usman Khawaja will join the short list of players who have batted on all five days of a Test. He\u2019s doing an admirable job, and moves into double figures with an edge along the ground for four. The ball barely moved off the straight in the first 20 overs, but Broad has swung it dramatically in his second spell. Boland survives the rest of the over, and so ends another pulsasting day\u2019s play. Broad gets on his haunches, absolutely shattered, before being congratulated/thanked by his teammates. After an ominous Australian start, he has dragged England back into the game with another memorable spell of bowling. The consensus in the Sky commentary box is that England are slight (italicised, underlined) favourites. 29th over: Australia 103-3 (Khawaja 34, Boland 9) Moeen replaces Anderson, presumably in the hope there will be time for Broad to have one more over. Khawaja edges the penultimate delivery wide of slip and turns down a single; he has no interest in facing Broad tonight. Yep, there\u2019s time for Broad to have one more over. 28th over: Australia 103-3 (Khawaja 34, Boland 9) Yes, it seems play will finish at 7pm local time, so in about five minutes. Broad is sprinting back to his mark between deliveries. Khawaja flicks an inducker off the pads for four, then Boland does likewise, although his four runs came from two twos. They turned down a third run on each occasion because Boland is protecting Khawaja. \u201cCan we all thank Fran Collins for that email?\u201d says Marie Meyer. \u201cJust what the doctor ordered.\u201d 27th over: Australia 94-3 (Khawaja 29, Boland 5) There are 16 overs remaining, though only in theory. I was sure play was scheduled to finish at 7.30pm local time; if so, that\u2019s very early for a nightwatchman. Mind you, Boland has started confidently. He knocks four off the target with a muscular cut stroke off Anderson and defends the rest of the over without alarm. I\u2019d get Robinson back on at this end; Anderson is struggling for rhythm. 26th over: Australia 90-3 (Khawaja 29, Boland 1) Boland takes a single off the last ball to keep the strike, and get off the mark. When Stuart Broad dies, he should donate his competitive juices to the MCC Museum. He\u2019s been seizing initiatvies in big games for 14 years now, since the Oval 2009, and it\u2019s still utterly exhilarating to watch. Scott Boland has come in as nightwatchman. I thought there were 45 minutes of play remaining, but that can\u2019t be right because they wouldn\u2019t send him in for that long. Broad has got Steve Smith with a brilliant piece of bowling! He almost had him earlier in the over with a huge inswinger that shaved the outside edge, hit the pad in front of off stump and bounced just short of Bairstow. No matter: two balls later he produced another booming inswinger that found the edge as Smith lunged into the drive. Bairstow took a comfortable catch. That is just magnificent from Broad. Stuart Broad + Ashes cricket = theatre and majesty. 25th over: Australia 89-2 (Khawaja 29, Smith 6) Just one over for Joe Root, with Jimmy Anderson returning to the attack. He bowled a shoddy first spell by his standards (5-0-23-0), but all will be forgiven if I can pinch a wicket or two here. All will be forgiven anyway; he has nearly 700 credits in the bank. His first over is harmless, and he\u2019s not happy with the footholes. Anderson even bowls a no-ball, which hardly ever happens. He\u2019s got his grump on. \u201cAmazing to see how quickly people are jumping on Stokes - he may not have got the calls right this match, but how many times were people moaning and groaning about his predecessors\u2019 rote captaincy, timid declarations and passivity in the field,\u201d says Will Vignoles. \u201cWe did tried and tested and it got us extreme mediocrity. I\u2019d much rather a captain and team who don\u2019t look scared to win, even if that means they lose sometimes. Plus let\u2019s not forget that the Aussies are a champion team and are allowed to play good cricket too\u2026\u201d And they haven\u2019t even lost! I can understand the criticism, and I didn\u2019t like the declaration at all, but I still think he\u2019s touched by genius as a captain. 24th over: Australia 84-2 (Khawaja 27, Smith 4) Broad has kept the umbrella field for Khawaja, and puts his hands to his head when Khawaja inside-edges his first ball into the leg side. This is a tricky spell for Australia, more because of the mood than the pitch. Khawaja works a single into the off side, then Smith gets off the mark with a handsome pull for four. The fielder at deep backward square lost sight of the ball, though I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d have stopped it. Broad is England\u2019s leading wickettaker against Australia, and surely their greatest Ashes competitor since Lord Beefy. And not even Ian Botham was man of the match in three Ashes-clinching victories, as Broad was in 2009, 2013 and 2015. \u201cI wonder how many generations of Bazball would be necessary to instil positivity into England supporters!\u201d writes Ian Copestake. \u201cGrind the good Aussie players out then work on the long tail. Is a tad early to be calling it!\u201d 23rd over: Australia 79-2 (Khawaja 26, Smith 0) Well, Moeen is back on the field but he\u2019s been replaced by Joe Root. A quiet first over, which is to say I\u2019ve been looking up a Stuart Broad stat. 22nd over: Australia 78-2 (Khawaja 25, Smith 0) Broad whips up the crowd before his first delivery to Steve Smith. It\u2019s angled in from wide of the crease and Smith defends confidently. We\u2019ve just seen a few replays of Labuschagne\u2019s dismissal. Broad might be in his head because that was the kind of ball he ignores all the time. He was beaten earlier in the over and seemed unsure as to the whereabouts of his off stump. In this match Broad has bowled four balls to Labuschagne, conceded no runs and dismissed him twice. Stuart Broad does it again! Labuschagne feels tentatively for a full, widish delivery that he had no need to play, and Jonny Bairstow takes a comfortable catch. Broad doesn\u2019t go wild, instead celebrating as if it was all part of the plan. I suppose it was: he\u2019s been working on that outswinger with Labuschagne in mind. 21st over: Australia 77-1 (Khawaja 25, Labuschagne 13) Moeen starts with a low full toss that Labuschagne whacks straight into Pope at short leg. He\u2019s okay. But Moeen isn\u2019t: a horrible long hop is pulled almost apologetically for four by Labuschagne. Moeen is really struggling with his finger, and he leaves the field at the end of the over. The poor guy has had a difficult match: scores of 18 and 19 and match figures of 39-5-170-2. \u201cRob, you say the field for Labuschagne\u2019s first ball was pure funk,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cMay I disagree and say it\u2019s all about Stokes drawing attention to himself, it\u2019s not a field designed for anything other than for people to say \u2018Look how clever that Stokes captain is\u2019. He has already cost England probably up to 50 runs if not more, now, to use an Irish expression, he is acting the maggot with his field placements. For the good of England, or for his own ego?\u201d I take your point, and I do think there are times when he has got a bit carried away, but I don\u2019t see him as an egotist at all. And we can\u2019t ignore that a number of these funky fields have worked. Anyway, let\u2019s save the postmortems until it\u2019s 3-0 rather than 0-0. 20th over: Australia 72-1 (Khawaja 25, Labuschagne 8) Khawaja looks comfortable against Robinson, umbrella field or not, and gets two more with an open-faced steer. Australia are 201 runs away from a 1-0 lead. \u201cEngland have probably lost this,\u201d says Fran Collins. \u201cNeeded a couple of earlyish wickets at least. How\u2019s the weather tomorrow?\u201d Gloomy in the morning, so the lights may well be on if England bowl. As we saw yesterday, that would make life tricky for the batters. But after lunch it\u2019s supposed to be much brighter. Read Simon Burnton\u2019s Ashes diary: day four 19th over: Australia 70-1 (Khawaja 23, Labuschagne 8) Khawaja turns Moeen off the pads for a single; he\u2019s now scored 164 from 376 balls in this match. Labuschagne pushes awkwardly at his first ball from Moeen and is hit on the pad, though he\u2019s well outside the line. He addresses the next two deliveries more decisively, reverse-sweeping both for four. Fine batting. \u201cEveryone always focuses on the runs Bairstow scores in the Bairstow vs Foakes debate,\u201d says Oliver Smiddy. \u201cBut he\u2019s cost us an awful lot this game through missing some pretty regulation chances. Leftfield suggestion \u2013 ask Foakes to open and keep, if Jonny is too scared to bat above 7, and drop Duckett (if you want Crawley to be the swashbuckling opener)? It\u2019s sufficiently wacky to align with Bazball. He could be the new Alec Stewart! \u201cAny chance of a charity plug too? We\u2019re trying to raise \u00a3150,000 for seven charities by successfully conveying a bunch of colleagues up and down some mountains in the Chamonix valley. Any generous OBOers can donate here. If it makes any difference, I\u2019m going to run halfway up Mont Blanc first to make life a bit harder.\u201d I wondered about Foakes opening but I don\u2019t think he could do it. One point in defence of Bairstow is that this is one of his worst keeping performance for England. He\u2019s usually a lot more reliable than this, though not in Foakes\u2019s class, and he is coming back from a horrible injury. 18th over: Australia 61-1 (Khawaja 22, Labuschagne 0) The field for Labuschagne\u2019s first ball is 100 per cent pure funk: slip, gully, leg slip, short mid-on, leg gully and short leg. He defends solidly and a couple of those fielders scatter. \u201cIt\u2019s reached that time of day where my patient non-cricket-watching wife gets to have Pointless on TV, whilst I switch to the iPad in forlorn search of a wicket,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cInvited to name the Italian director of such films as \u20188 1/2\u2019 and \u2018La Dolce Vita\u2018 with initials \u2018FF\u2019, I\u2019m guessing that for all you post-neorealism cinema buffs the name \u2018Franz Ferdinand\u2019 didn\u2019t immediately spring to mind, he chuckled pompously.\u201d \u2018Yes, here it is: 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke. That would be in the \u2026 erotic drama section.\u2019 Drinks The new batter is Marnus Labuschagne, who is on a king pair. Goddim! That\u2019s a vital wicket for England. Robinson, slammed for four earlier in the over, found Warner\u2019s outside edge with a textbook wobble-seam delivery from round the wicket. Jonny Bairstow did the rest and Warner is on his way for a purposeful 36. 17th over: Australia 57-0 (Khawaja 22, Warner 32) Stokes positions himself right behind the bowler Moeen, two-thirds of the way back to the boundary. After a couple of balls he walks in maybe five yards. Khawaja resists the temptation, and it\u2019s another maiden. \u201cDrinking game suggestion,\u201d says Darren Hall. \u201cHave a gulp every time a commentator says \u2018finger\u2019.\u201d 16th over: Australia 57-0 (Khawaja 22, Warner 32) Moeen\u2019s pain is becoming more obvious as he gets into his spell. It\u2019s a problem for England, because the ball is doing very little for the seamers. A shortish delivery from Robinson is belted through midwicket for four by Warner, who then beats the cover ring with a cut stroke for two more. He\u2019s playing superbly. 15th over: Australia 50-0 (Khawaja 22, Warner 26) Khawaja skips down the track to crash Moeen down the ground for four. That\u2019s beautiful batting, both in execution and intent, and it brings up a fifty partnership that has quietened the crowd. It\u2019s nearly 6pm, and it\u2019s easy to forget that there are nearly two hours remaining tonight. Bowling conditions may well be friendly in the morning, but that won\u2019t be much good to England if Australia are 150 for none. \u201cIf we stick to tradition, Bairstow will play as a keeper in the next Test,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cShould he have another shocker (and continue to miss chances here), he might then be replaced by Foakes, but under B*zball, who knows?\u201d Injury aside, I can\u2019t see a way Foakes gets into the team this summer. Maybe if Harry Brook has a shocker and they go back to last summer\u2019s middle order. 14th over: Australia 45-0 (Khawaja 18, Warner 25) No umbrella field for Warner, who cuts Robinson witheringly for four. Khawaja then gets his first runs off Robinson in this innings, and his first boundary, with a classy square drive. Since we\u2019ve left an important part of our brain somewhere in a field in Hampshire in Edgbaston 2005, Australia were 47 for none after 12 overs when Andrew Flintoff came on to bowl the over of his life. \u201cGreetings from a parallel universe,\u201d writes my erstwhile Wisden.com colleague Tom Bowtell. \u201cAm listening on a train in Filey with dodgy reception and somehow switched to the TMS commentary replay from day 2 without knowing. Screamed with loud astonishment as history repeated with Warner playing on to Broad and Marnus going first ball. Sheepishly disappointed to discover the more mundane realty of the score. Fellow travellers, Yorkshirefolk all, eyeing me suspiciously.\u201d And most of them don\u2019t even know there\u2019s a game on, har har. 13th over: Australia 36-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 20) Nathan Lyon got a few to turn sharply, particularly to the left-handers, but then his spinning finger wasn\u2019t seeping. Moeen gets one to turn away from Khawaja, who bats it slightly cautiously into the leg side, and then beats him with a nicely flighted delivery. Khawaja, who has now gone 23 balls without scoring, tries to cut the last ball and is beaten the lack of bounce. That was a risky shot on both line and length. \u201cGreetings from a parallel universe,\u201d writes my erstwhile Wisden.com colleague Tom Bowtell. \u201cAm listening on a train in Filey with dodgy reception and somehow switched to the TMS commentary replay from day 2 without knowing. Screamed with loud astonishment as history repeated with Warner playing on to Broad and Marnus going first ball. Sheepishly disappointed to discover the more mundane realty of the score. Fellow travellers, Yorkshirefolk all, eyeing me suspiciously.\u201d 12th over: Australia 35-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 19) Robinson bowls another maiden to Khawaja, who is a little becalmed: 14 from his first 16 balls, 0 from the next 18. He looks secure, though, and that\u2019s Australia need him to be at this stage. Robinson is also bowling well, with a fullish length and a bit of movement into the left-hander, so there aren\u2019t many runs on offer. \u201cSpeaking of people jettisoned too soon, as a neutral, I am still bemused about what happened to Steve Finn,\u201d says Digvijay Yadav. \u201cHe was rampaging in 2015. Bowled well against Pakistan the following year, particularly at Edgbaston. And then got dumped.\u201d It\u2019s a complicated story, and I really hope he writes an autobiography because he talks so well about the mental challenges he faced, but I think it was a combination of injury and loss of confidence. The interesting thing, as you say, is that he bounced back thrillingly from Finn\u2019s Law and his Ashes horribilis; I\u2019ve rarely been more thrilled for an England cricketer than I was for him when he came back with a six-for in the 2015 Ashes. He also bowled beautifully when England won in South Africa that winter; I remember thinking that, at the age of 26, he had cracked it and would be an unplayable monster for the next few years. But then he had an inexplicably poor series against Sri Lanka at the start of 2016 \u2013 a cousin of Graeme Hick\u2019s unforseeable loss of form against India in 1996 \u2013 and that was pretty much it. 11th over: Australia 35-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 19) This is a big moment: Moeen Ali, blistered finger and all, is coming into the attack. Australia will surely go after him straight away. Actually, they don\u2019t. Warner is content to work a pair of twos and defend the rest. Moeen didn\u2019t seem in too much pain during that over, though he is looking at his finger as he walks back towards the boundary. \u201cPerhaps to help calm the sphinctal motions of the faithless,\u201d interjects Ian Copestake. \u201cEngland should take a leaf out of the baseball book and assign a designated hitter to play time and drop anchor.\u201d 10th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 15) Warner has seen off Broad, who is replaced by Robinson after a spell of 4-0-8-0. Robinson starts with his umbrella field to Khawaja: three short extra covers, a short midwicket and a shortish square leg. After two balls, Stokes adds another man at short mid-on. Somewhere in the next life, Keith Miller has a big smile on his face. Robinson pitches everything up to Khawaja, with a hint of shape back in. Khawaja\u2019s judgement of what to play and what to leave is immaculate, and it\u2019s a maiden. \u201cKhawaja,\u201d says Simon Gates, \u201cis in with a chance of batting on all five days.\u201d That\u2019s a great spot. It\u2019s a pretty short list, and I\u2019d completely forgotten that Rory Burns was on it. 9th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 15) A short ball from Anderson, who is going at five an over for the first time in years, is swivel-pulled sweetly for four by Warner. This has been a perfect start for Australia. 8th over: Australia 27-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 11) On Sky Sports, Nasser Hussain argues that England\u2019s bowling has been a bit too straight. The number of runs scored on the leg side \u2013 20 out of 25 off the bat - would support that argument. Warner is beaten on the inside by a beauty from Broad, and England plead desperately for a caught-behind decision. It\u2019s not forthcoming and they wisely decide against a review. It hit something, possibly Warner\u2019s elbow, but it wasn\u2019t the bat. \u201cI\u2019m a convert to the One True Faith of Bazball, with all the zeal that comes with such a status,\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cBut even I\u2019m having doubts about the declaration, some of the shot selections and the ultra-attacking fields. I guess I\u2019m asking myself, \u2018Is it cowardly to pray for brain?\u2019\u201d 7th over: Australia 26-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 10) Two more to Warner, worked behind square off Anderson, and he repeats the shot for a single off the penultimate ball. Warner knows, with the ball not moving, he has a real chance here. From England\u2019s perspective I think it\u2019s time for Ollie Robinson in place of Anderson, who isn\u2019t quite at his best. 6th over: Australia 23-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 7) Warner\u2019s resists a wobbling tempter from Broad. But he knows he\u2019s safe with anything on the pads, and another crisp clip through midwicket brings him three runs. This is good stuff, a rugged arm-wrestle between three 36-year-olds and a quadragenarian. Australia need another 258 to win. 5th over: Australia 20-0 (Khawaja 14, Warner 4) Khawaja is beaten, chasing a wide delivery bowled from round the wicket by Anderson. The next ball is fractionally short, no more, and Khawaja pulls for four with a flourish. He is ruthless with that shot. An eventful over concludes with another play and miss outside off stump. \u201cSkulking in a basement in southwestern Ontario, and remembering Belly at his cover-driving best,\u201d says Alex McGillivray. \u201cJettisoned at 33 - seems way too early for a batsman of his talents. Wonder why?\u201d I suspect that when they dropped him for the South Africa series in 2015-16, a fair enough decision on form, they expected him to be back the following summer. We all assumed Bell would score millions in county cricket, but it didn\u2019t happen \u2013 from memory he struggled - and the door never opened again. There was a vacancy in the team in 2016 because of the shock retirement of James Taylor. With Bell not scoring any runs for Warwickshire, they gave it another glorious cover-driver: James Vince. 4th over: Australia 16-0 (Khawaja 10, Warner 4) Stuart Broad is sticking two fingers to the data by bowling round the wicket to Khawaja as well as Warner. It\u2019s another purposeful, accurate, aggressive over from Broad, but it\u2019s met with secure defence from the Australian openers. There hasn\u2019t been much movement for England. 3rd over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 9, Warner 4) England have four men in the covers for Warner, but he has more joy on the leg side when Anderson drifts onto the pads. A crisp clip brings him two runs. Warner is looking good, busy and light on his feet. \u201cIf we\u2019re even in vague danger of going down that nail-chewing route again during Australia\u2019s fourth innings\u2026\u201d says Boris Starling, referring to the joyous torture of Edgbaston 2005. \u201cI can never think of that match without remembering my friend Tom, who on that final morning as the target came closer and closer sent me a series of staggeringly offensive and beautifully inventive texts raining down invective on Australians (for obvious reasons), England cricketers (for equally obvious reasons, plus having had the temerity to invent the sport which was causing us such conniptions), Welshmen (Simon Jones spilling the catch at third man which would have won the match), and so on. A few weeks later, he and I were in the crowd at Trafalgar Square to salute Our Ashes Heroes\u2122\ufe0f. \u201cTom died a few years ago, and when the Ashes come round I always think of him and his three non-negotiables for life: a cigarette, a glass of red, and laughter.\u201d 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Khawaja 9, Warner 2) Warner clatters Broad\u2019s first ball into the covers, where Pope does well to save four runs. It\u2019s also a no-ball from Broad. Australia have started with intent \u2013 but so has Broad, whose last ball kicks encouraingly Warner\u2019s off stump. \u201cEngland have scored 666 runs in the match,\u201d notes Christopher Phillips, \u201cbut is it enough to beast the Aussies.\u201d 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Khawaja 9, Warner 1) A chance straight away! The ball after pulling Anderson round the corner for four, Khawaja edges straight between Bairstow and Root at first slip. They left it to each other. It was a beautiful delivery from Anderson, and it cost him four runs. Replays show it was closer to Bairstow than Root; it was his catch. The poor guy is having a bad game with the gloves. \u201cThe downside of England scoring so quickly in the new exciting era is the pitch hasn\u2019t deteriorated as much as you\u2019d expect for a fourth innings,\u201d says Mark Hooper, \u201cso record run chases aren\u2019t that informative.\u201d Indeed. I think that applies generally over the last 20 years or so, not just to this England team. For reference, though, here are all Australia\u2019s successful runchases in England. Jimmy Anderson is happy with his new new ball, and he\u2019s going to open the bowling. England aren\u2019t happy with the new ball. Stuart Broad is peering at it quizzically, and a few of the players are in conversation with Marais Erasmus. Mike Atherton thinks that England chose a different ball to the one they\u2019ve been given. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s going to be changed. The commentators are discussing how dangerous one of the Australian openers could be tonight. It\u2019s not the man who scored 141 in the first innings; it\u2019s the guy who scored nine. Here come the players. Buckle up, buttercup. This will be an extended evening session, just under three hours. Not quite Melbourne 1998 but that\u2019s still a lot of cricket. There are 42 overs remaining; we should get at least 35 of them. \u201cThose extra runs from Robinson, Broad and Anderson might mean England get a second new ball tomorrow,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cI reckon those two partnerships have won England the game. Fancied Aus to chase anything up to about 250. 280 feels like a lot though.\u201d I suppose you can argue it both ways \u2013 the relative comfort with which they got the runs will make Australia\u2019s top order feel good about life. As is this from Mr Bazball This is a good point from Brendan Murphy \u201cEngland\u2019s frenetic pace means that they spend far more time on the field than Australia, with their more methodical approach,\u201d writes Brendan. \u201cAustralia batted 116 overs, England\u2019s two innings lasted 144 overs. Cummings, Hazlewood etc. will be getting more rest in this series than Anderson and Broad.\u201d Teatime reading Another good spot from Tim de Lisle \u201cJimmy Anderson\u2019s highest score in his past 35 Tests, since Pallekele, Nov 2018 (another 12).\u201d It\u2019s 2005 all over again. In that legendary Edgbaston Test, Australia needed 282 to win; today it\u2019s 281. Pat Cummins bowled beautifully in that innings, finishing with four for 63, and Nathan Lyon emerged from a predictable onslaught with admirable figures of 24-2-80-4. Pat Cummins ends the nonsense. He comes back into the attack and rams in a short ball that Anderson can only fence to the left of Carey, who dives to take a good two-handed catch. Australia need 281 to win. 66th over: England 273-9 (Broad 10, Anderson 12) Broad gets outside the line, negating an LBW appeal from Lyon. Two more singles add to Australia\u2019s burgeoning frustration; this partnership is worth 17. 65th over: England 271-9 (Broad 9, Anderson 11) My word: Anderson, on the charge, smashes a length ball from Boland to the cover boundary! Australia haven\u2019t chased this many to win an Ashes Test since the famous Headingley Test of 1948. Those fourth-innings stats feel pretty irrelevant these days, and we shouldn\u2019t forget there have been plenty of times when Australia\u2019s target to win an Ashes Test has been in double figures. Doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t have made 280-300. A bit of housekeeping. Tea will be delayed until the fall of the tenth wicket, although if these two are still batting at 4.40pm it will be taken then. 64th over: England 264-9 (Broad 7, Anderson 6) This is a nice little interlude before the serious business of Australia\u2019s runchase begins. Broad is well beaten by a ripper from Lyon that growls out of the footmarks. \u201cI see WinViz has been whirling like the proverbial dervish today,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cDoes it have any knowledge of the wretched state of Mo\u2019s finger, or access to the Met Office supercomputer? I\u2019m also suspecting it knows nothing of how badly the Australians want to ram B**B*** down the collective English gullet\u2026\u201d I think it takes into account the weather but not Mo\u2019s finger unless he officially withdraws from the game. You raise a good point, though. I wonder how WinViz might have reacted when Patrick Patterson walked into the Australian dressing-room on the fourth evening at Melbourne in 1988 and promised to kill them all the next day? I suppose West Indies\u2019 chances of victory would have increased from 99 per cent to 100. 63rd over: England 263-9 (Broad 6, Anderson 6) \u201cThat 2013 series still irks me,\u201d says Max Williams. \u201cIt deserves to be celebrated as the final hurrah of a truly great England side. Instead the ridiculous decision to play the Down Under series a few months later \u2013 can\u2019t even remember the reason now \u2013 means our 3-0 win has been buried beneath the subsequent whitewash. Poor Ian Bell.\u201d Yes, two points on that. Bell\u2019s batting in that series was possibly the finest I\u2019ve ever seen by an England batter across a whole series, because he made three totally different hundreds on three spicy pitches against a high-class seam attack. The other thing is that, while I agree with you, I vividly recall the negativity towards England during that series. And even before it, when they took their time to declare against New Zealand at Headingley. Actually, three points \u2013 the reason they brought the second series forward by a year was so that it wouldn\u2019t be in the same winter as the World Cup. 62nd over: England 260-9 (Broad 5, Anderson 4) Jimmy Anderson reverse sweeps his first ball nonchalantly for four! He walks down the wicket deadpan, looking like a gunslinger, to touch gloves with Broad. England lead by 267. Since you asked, Australia\u2019s target on this ground in the 2005 heartstopper was 282. \u201cBasically in old money we\u2019d have scraped to the same score then been blown away by the new ball,\u201d says Dan. \u201cBy attacking relentlessly it turns bowlers from attacking lines and lengths (two innings cricket) to inherently defensive and a one-day mindset. Could\u2019ve run more singles though!\u201d This is the thing \u2013 we\u2019ll never be able to quantify Bazball, partly because so much of it is psychological. I do know that the last year has been the most fun I\u2019ve had watching England since 2004-05. Ollie Robinson\u2019s fun is over. The ball after driving Lyon back over his head for two, he tried again and holed out to Cam Green at long-on. Canny stuff from Lyon, who has his fourth of the innings and his eighth of the match. 61st over: England 254-8 (Robinson 25, Broad 5) Scott Boland replaces Hazlewood, which should mean a ceasefire in the bouncer war. The upside of this irritating partnership for Australia is that two lower-order batters look relatively comfortable against the old ball. Robinson has plenty of time to glide Boland\u2019s last ball for a single. \u201cI\u2019m sitting on an Alicante veranda, sweating bullets in 31C,\u201d writes Joe Varley, \u201cbut am I correct to assume tomorrow\u2019s play will be more of a scorcher?\u201d Not necessarily \u2013 heavy rain is forecast in the morning, sunny intervals thereafter. 60th over: England 253-8 (Robinson 24, Broad 5) Robinson charges Lyon and chips a safe single to long on, one of two runs from the over. With 17 minutes to go until tea, England lead by 260. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Jon Salisbury. \u201cRobinson has superb temperament. Cheers.\u201d He does. I\u2019m still not 100 per cent sure what I think of him as a bloke \u2013 he came across well in this interview with Don McRae \u2013 but he\u2019s a fantastic cricketer. Weird that he was hiding in plain sight in county cricket for all those years. As long ago as 2018 he was taking 74 first-class wickets at an average of 19. 59th over: England 251-8 (Robinson 23, Broad 4) With Robinson backing away in anticipation of a short ball, Hazlewood slips in a surprise yorker. Robinson does well to adjust and dig it out. The next ball is short, and Robinson deftly uppercuts it to third man for four! Robinson makes room to cut the next ball for two more, with Lyon scrambling to save the boundary at deep point. Lyon hurt his right shoulder in the process but he\u2019s going to continue bowling. Those runs take England past 250. This is a valuable cameo from Robinson, 23 from 30 balls. \u201cI think Stokes is about to declare again,\u201d says Gervase Greene. \u201cThat\u2019ll mess with their heads\u2026\u201d That would be a dreadful idea, the moment Bazball jumped the shark. But, if we\u2019re looking to take the positives, it might just break Twitter once and for all. IN OTHER NEWS 58th over: England 243-8 (Robinson 16, Broad 3) Broad survives another LBW appeal after missing a lap at Lyon. I think it was missing off, though I wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it. Three from the over. Robinson, who has underachieved a touch with the bat in his short Test career, is playing pretty well and has 16 from 25 balls. \u201cI prefer my retreats without digital, ta,\u201d replies J.A. Hopkin, \u201cbut winning a Test match is not about scoring faster than the other team, it\u2019s about amassing an unassailable total. Stokes\u2019 blokes provide entertainment, alright, but I can\u2019t help feeling they\u2019re gonna traipse off the ground at some point tomorrow looking like dejected morris dancers.\u201d You might be right \u2013 I just fancy Australia at this point \u2013 but England\u2019s approach has brought them 11 victories in 13 games, and now they are competing with the world\u2019s best team. It\u2019s a yes from me. 57th over: England 240-8 (Robinson 15, Broad 2) It looks like England have decided to take on the short ball. Both Robinson and Broad miss big yahoos, then Carey saves four byes with a superb diving stop down the leg side. Robinson gets four of his own off the penultimate ball, making room to swat Hazlewood back over his head. Whatever you think of Robinson\u2019s mouth, he\u2019s got plenty of ticker. England lead by 247. \u201cThe Aussies have been outstanding since the first hour,\u201d says John Jones. \u201cThe commentators have been overly critical of their approach. Still in the game after losing the toss on a road and in with a real chance. What a Test match.\u201d The momentum shifts (and DRS drama) remind me a little of Trent Bridge in 2013, the forgotten classic of modern Ashes cricket. 56th over: England 232-8 (Robinson 8, Broad 1) \u201cWell this is extraordinary stuff isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI confess that I\u2019ve never wanted England to win a Test more than I do right now. Yes it\u2019s the Ashes, yes it\u2019s the first Test, but mainly it\u2019s to deny the millions lining up to say, \u2018I told you so\u2019. Nobody gets every decision right in sport - what matters is what you do with them.\u201d There\u2019s no way of knowing, but I really hope that\u2019s not the case. I thought it was one of the worst declarations in Test history; I\u2019m also desperate to have humble pie for tea tomorrow. Broad misses a reverse-sweep at Lyon and is given out LBW. That\u2019s plumb. Broad reviews, more in hope that expectation, and quite right too: replays show the ball brushed his glove on its way through. 55th over: England 229-8 (Robinson 6, Broad 0) Broad is dropped by Smith! He fenced another excellent short ball up in the air on the leg side. Smith charged after it, grimacing with determination, but couldn\u2019t hold on at full stretch. It would have been a great catch. One thing is abundantly clear: the lower order batters on both sides won\u2019t be getting many drive balls for the rest of the series, and I\u2019m tempted to delete the \u2018M\u2019 in \u2018many. But Moeen has gone! He tried to pull a leg-stump short ball from Hazlewood and gloved it through to Alex Carey. That\u2019s yet another timely wicket for Australia, who have almost taken them to order today. Every time England have threatened to get away, somebody has made the breakthrough for Australia. 54.3 overs: England 229-7 (Moeen 19, Robinson 6) Robinson fends a vicious short ball from the new bowler Hazlewood towards short leg, where Labuschagne swoops forward to take a brilliant one-handed catch. He throws the ball up but doesn\u2019t seem entirely sure that it\u2019s a clean catch. The umpires go upstairs, and replays show that, though Labuschagne took the ball cleanly, he then scraped the ball along the ground as his hand twisted. Robinson survives. 54th over: England 228-7 (Moeen 19, Robinson 5) Lyon has an LBW appeal against Robinson turned down by Marais Erasmus. That turned a long way, probably too much. Australia have no reviews left anyway. A single brings Moeen on strike, and he clouts a sweet slog-sweep over midwicket for six. Shot! Lyon responds with a jaffa that spits past the outside edge as Moeen props forward. Carey has the bails off in a trice \u2013 he\u2019s kept beautifully in this game, as he did in India \u2013 but Moeen\u2019s back foot was grounded. \u201cReally can\u2019t fathom why England is playing this like a one-dayer,\u201d writes J. A. Hopkin. \u201cIs it going to rain all day tomorrow? Three batsmen out in their 40s. Old Father Gooch must be distraught.\u201d Have you been at a digital retreat in the Kerguelen Islands for the last 12 months? This is England 2023. Blimey. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that Oman are on course for a stunning win over Ireland in the World Cup qualifiers. 53rd over: England 221-7 (Moeen 13, Robinson 4) Moeen chases a wide ball from Cummins and slices it down to third man for four. He isn\u2019t middling much but he\u2019s found his way into double figures. Every little helps. \u201cAssuming the bowlers manage a few,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cwould you care to estimate what would be a winning lead amid a rain-soaked Tuesday?\u201d I would not, largely because I have nary a clue. 52nd over: England 217-7 (Moeen 9, Robinson 4) There hasn\u2019t been any sign of verbal aggression towards Robinson, just a few zesty bumpers from Cummins. Moeen tries to slog-sweep Lyon and is beaten by a bit of extra bounce. Lovely bowling. It feels like a matter of time before he gets Moeen for the 11th time in Tests. Only one other bowler, Ravi Jadeja with seven, has dismissed Moeen more than five times. WinViz has Australia slight favourites: 50 per cent to England\u2019s 46, with four per cent chance of a draw. 51st over: England 215-7 (Moeen 8, Robinson 3) Cummins has bowled tremendously in this innings. He almost gets his fourth wicket with a beauty that vrooms off the seam to beat the driving Moeen through the gate. That could easily have bowled him. Drinks. England lead by 222. Australia review for caught behind against Robinson! And it\u2019s a stinker. Robinson avoided a bumper from Cummins, taking his eyes off the ball, but Alex Carey thought it might have clipped his glove on the way through. Cummins reviewed, a little reluctantly, and replays showed that it missed everything. Australia have no reviews left, a state of affairs that cost them dearly at Trent Bridge in 2013 and Headingley four years ago. 50th over: England 214-7 (Moeen 8, Robinson 2) Moeen tries to drive Lyon and edges the ball not far wide of Boland at backward point. Lyon has made himself at home in Moeen\u2019s subconscious ever since the start of the 2017-18 Ashes, and Moeen doesn\u2019t seem entirely sure whether he should run towards this particular danger \u2013 figuratively and literally. Four singles from the over. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. It looks like Ollie Robinson\u2019s use of the mouth has gone down about as well as Tony Greig\u2019s bouncers at Dennis Lillee in 1974-75. \u201cIt\u2019s like the song We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire,\u201d said Lillee, although he and Jeff Thomson did pour about 500 gallons of petrol in it. 49th over: England 210-7 (Moeen 6, Robinson 0) Spicier and spicier. The lead is 217. Australia are pretty bad at fourth-innings chases. Moeen could still clobber some. The Nighthawk is not called upon. Robinson gets promoted. Keeps out a Cummins yorker. Sees out the over. That\u2019s it from me! Need to catch my breath before working out what to write about for this evening. I have no idea yet, so much still could change. From here, the rest of the day is between you and Rob Smyth. The biggest blow is struck! Stokes goes, Cummins from around the wicket with another snorter, in with angle, further off the seam, beats the shot and pulverises the knee roll. Umpire\u2019s finger goes up. Stokes reviews, he has an orange light on contact at the stumps, but it\u2019s smashing the leg bail so it\u2019s not exactly a close one either. 48th over: England 209-6 (Stokes 43, Moeen 5) Stokes whacks a couple more, cutting in front of point. Lyon still has this field with two covers and a long off, so they do want him to play off side presumably. Slip waiting. Stokes finds the squarer cover, Khawaja. Then defends from the crease. Lyon bowls a rare bad ball, overpitches, and Stokes sweeps for four. Cuts two more. England\u2019s brand ambassador is doing his work. 47th over: England 201-6 (Stokes 35, Moeen 5) Luck for England! Cummins short and nasty at the body, Moeen gloves it just past a diving Carey for four. Whose day is it going to be? 46th over: England 197-6 (Stokes 35, Moeen 1) Nip and tuck, nip and tuck. Gosh this is a good Test match. Moeen Ali to join Stokes. The hometown lad, could make himself a hero here. Might even do it with an innings of 30. The lead is 204. Lyon does it again! His classic style, the straightening down the line, Bairstow goes down to sweep, reverse style, and misreads the bounce. Hit in front of middle and leg. Erasmus takes as long to give it as Raza did to get his finger up earlier, a long delay. But does. Bairstow reviews, but that ball is going on straight enough to be flush on leg stump, three reds. 45th over: England 196-5 (Stokes 35, Bairstow 20) Frustration growing for Cummins! First gets belted through point, square of a wrong-footed Green, then he gets Bairstow\u2019s nick off a flailing cut and sees it go just by slip. The Hollies Stand is in full voice. Bumper time, decides Cummins, bringing Smith from slip to midwicket. Labuschagne is at a striagther midwicket, Khawaja at mid on, Head at deep square leg. Plus Boland at fine leg. Bairstow evades the first one. Knocks away a single from the second. Stokes blocks. Another over goes for ten runs. This scoring rate is incredible. The lead is 203. 44th over: England 186-5 (Stokes 34, Bairstow 11) This pair still haven\u2019t gone at Lyon. Bairstow defending, back and across. Lyon around the wicket to the right-hander, wanting to turn down the line of the stumps. Reverse sweep, single to deep point. Then Stokes is caught \u2013 or so it seems, but it\u2019s a bump ball. Top edge, reverse sweep, looping to Boland at short third, who dives forward and comes up saying he held it cleanly. Which he did, but the umpires check the replay and find it hit ground just under the bat before looping up. 43rd over: England 184-5 (Stokes 33, Bairstow 10) Cummins replacing Boland, and after a couple of sighters, Stokes goes hard. Walks at him to whack one ball through mid on, waits back to flash a top-edged cut behind point. Eight runs. Long on is sent back, joining deep square, fine leg, and deep point. Stokes glances one. Bairstow another. Just the 10 off the over then. 42nd over: England 174-5 (Stokes 24, Bairstow 9) Lyon keeps working. The lead is 180. Australia need to break the partnership. England need at least another 70. Bairstow fiddles down the leg side and misses, but keeps his back foot down as Carey gets across to take. Only score is a Stokes single to start the over. 41st over: England 173-5 (Stokes 23, Bairstow 9) Delicate from Bairstow, reaching for Boland and guiding him just past Green at gully for four. The fates have not been with Boland today, in the way they have on other days. Twice Bairstow miscues badly, hard into the ground trying to wallop through cover. Third time he gets it, but the point sweeper fields. 40th over: England 167-5 (Stokes 22, Bairstow 4) Leading edge from Stokes to mid off, scampers a run. Bairstow seeps one. The singles off Lyon tick over. To answer Michael Keane\u2019s question, the session times were: 11 to 13:15 13:55 to 16:10 16:10 until presumably 19:10? Given we can add a rain half hour as well as the usual extra half hour. 39th over: England 163-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 2) Boland from the Pavilion End, getting Bairstow off balance with a ball spearing into the stumps. Keeps it out, just about. Slip and gully waiting. Bairstow thrashes a cut but the deep point saves three. And there is the first big Stokes shot! Doesn\u2019t get it cleanly, charging and thrashing at width, the ball bobbling over cover off the angled blade for two. But he does get the next one, advancing again, taking it on the up, hitting the gap straight of cover. Labuschagne moves over a little. Stokes plays a reverse sweep to the seamer, one run to deep backward point. 38th over: England 155-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) Lyon to begin from the City End. Steve Smith at slip for Stokes. Short third for the reverse, deep backward point for the cut, cover and extra cover, long off for the lofted shot, mid on, deep midwicket, short fine leg. A sweeper\u2019s field. And Stokes does play the reverse sweep, on the bounce straight to Boland at short third. No run. As per the old debate, wonder if you need the long off especially, before he\u2019s even tried a big shot. Stokes is anchored to the crease in this over, hit on the pad twice, defending the rest. Another maiden. We\u2019re back\u2026 what will the second session bring? Barnaby Jenkins. \u201cPutting my son to bed here in Sydney with the cricket on in the background. Quietly singing to myself as I go. Just before lights out, he asks me, \u2018Dad, what\u2019s a shit Moeen Ali?\u2019\u201d What a session of cricket. Joe Root started with his foot pressed flat to the floor, as though no time at all has passed since he finished batting on the first day. Pope was blown away early, but Brook went with Root strike for strike. Then Australia found their way back into the contest through Lyon, extracting first Root, then Brook, to go to 493 Test wickets. England have a lead, and have power in their batting, but have a lot of work to do between Stokes, Bairstow and Moeen. The match beautifully in the balance! Grab a snack. 37th over: England 155-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) So close, but Bairstow survives! In-ducker from Boland, seam movement, smashes the pad. Umpire Raza takes a long time, then slowly puts the finger up. Contact is high on the pad with some angle in. Looks like it might be clipping the leg bail if anything. And DRS gives Bairstow a green light by about one millimetre, at the top corner of the bail. Would have been an unlucky dismissal had a millimetre been hitting, it looked too high live. Next ball, pad again, appeal again, Raza keeps his finger holstered. Australia have one review left so they don\u2019t chance it. England reach lunch in safety! 36th over: England 155-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 1) Another quiet one from Lyon. A single to Bairstow to start his scoring day, two blocks from Stokes. 35th over: England 154-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 0) Boland comes back, having switched ends to have the pavilion at his back, and Stokes gives him the charge to deflect four to fine leg. Bairstow follows up by nearly getting run out, charging down and being sent back, beating the throw from point but he\u2019s injured his hand in the process. Did that throw clip his hand? Seems so. \u201cEnjoying the OBO,\u201d writes David Roche. \u201cAgree that we need specialist third umpires, and the decision on the LBW referral for Lyon to Stokes demonstrates why. If an umpire makes the right decision but for the wrong reason, it is still a bad decision.\u201d I should clarify, and I\u2019m pretty sure on this but not 100 percent, that the guidelines for DRS give the umpires no latitude. In the same way as there is a set order for looking at each piece of teach, it also says that any movement on the soundwave at the right time must be treated as an edge. Because otherwise the decision-making is too opaque, and the optics for spectators who don\u2019t understand the difference would be too difficult to explain. If so, it\u2019s not the right process, but it\u2019s a compulsory process. 34th over: England 150-5 (Brook 46, Stokes 9) So it\u2019s Bairstow and Stokes, the Headingley duo, the ones who got that chase moving in 2019. Bairstow defends his first two balls against Lyon to end the over. The lead is 157. Oh ho! Do your best Ravi Shastri voice and say, \u201cAgainst the run of play!\u201d Straightforward stuff really, Brook plays a pull shot at a short ball, doesn\u2019t get the placement or elevation, and although he hits it hard Labuschagne dives to his right at midwicket and takes a very good catch. Five down. 33rd over: England 150-4 (Brook 46, Stokes 9) A long delay for a change of ball halfway through the over. Hazlewood gets bounce with the new one, and after Stokes hits it to point he runs down the pitch shaking his hand, it must have jarred. Gets back on strike, then leaves a ball outside off stump. I was joking earlier about Stokes not playing shots, but it is a little odd by the time it\u2019s 9 off 26 balls. He could hit the hammer at any moment, of course. If you want our round-up of the county champs and the Blast results over the past week, here you go. 32nd over: England 146-4 (Brook 44, Stokes 7) England lead by 151 runs with this pair at the crease and big hitters to come in Bairstow and Moeen. Another hundred runs and they\u2019re in a good spot. Brook punches one run off Lyon to cover. Stokes defends! Then, gets his front leg out of the way and jams a single off leg stump while half falling over. 31st over: England 144-4 (Brook 43, Stokes 6) Yep, eventually we get ball-tracking showing that the Stokes appeal from Lyon was missing off stump. Still, if that had gone to hand off the pad, he would have been given out caught on that evidence. It\u2019s a clear flaw with the system. Brooks has another waltz at Hazlewood and skews three runs through cover. Stokes gets a couple more. 30th over: England 137-4 (Brook 39, Stokes 3) A couple of singles, then Stokes survives an lbw referral upstairs. The ball gets under the toe of the bat and hits pad. I thought just outside the line, maybe turning away. The DRS though, says he\u2019s hit it. Which he hasn\u2019t. The disturbance on the soundwave graph is long and low, which is a scrape sound, not an edge. But as so often, the inability to read the technology correctly means the wrong decision is made. Any noise is held to be an edge, even though a qualified sound engineer could tell you what kind of noise it was. Resume the argument for specialist third umpires. \u201cI\u2019ve just noticed that the forecast for tomorrow has improved, at least for the afternoon. Might England be being a bit more circumspect now that there\u2019s a chance of some play tomorrow after all?\u201d Right this minute, Richard O\u2019Hagan, they are. Not sure how long it will last. 29th over: England 135-4 (Brook 38, Stokes 2) Twelve balls for one run, Stokes, after blocking the last of the previous over. Hazlewood bowls to Brook, who takes four balls to put Stokes back on strike. England\u2019s captain covers his off stump and drops the ball to backward point, no run. Finally, he charges Hazlewood but gets nothing to hit, can only bunt a run to midwicket. 28th over: England 133-4 (Brook 37, Stokes 1) Hot stat alert: Carey is now one stumping away from a share of the record for an Ashes Test. Which is four. Those already there? Bert Oldfield, twice, what a man. From a stretcher-bearer in the First World War trenches to gloving everything that came his way. Affie Jarvis, the cheerful South Australian with the fine moustache. And Jack Blackham, the man who kept Jarvis out of the team for most of his career. Elevate Carey to that company, and it will be a grand day for lovers of history. You\u2019d like his chances of getting one more from this England team. Two leg byes and a single from the Lyon over. 27th over: England 130-4 (Brook 36, Stokes 1) What doing? What are we seeing? Josh Hazlewood has bowled a very respectable over tight on an off stump line, and, well, England\u2019s captain, he just, he blocked it out. I don\u2019t know how else to say it. He defended each ball, solidly, getting forward. Is this some new level of mind game? Get them expecting something and then keep changing? Ever twisting and turning? Twirling towards freedom? The whole ground sits in disbelief. 26th over: England 130-4 (Brook 36, Stokes 1) This is the real quiz. Stokes to the middle. Five balls to face. And he\u2026 defends four and then tucks a single? What\u2019s this? He falls! It has been a joyously entertaining morning\u2019s work, but noon has passed and Joe Root\u2019s pumpkin has arrived. He gallops out at Lyon, isn\u2019t to the pitch, faces serious turn, and Carey takes the ball well outside leg stump after it beats the inside edge, and knocks off the bails. Didn\u2019t have a stumping before he went to India earlier this year, Carey, but he has three in this match. 25th over: England 129-3 (Root 46, Brook 36) We had a later than usual drinks break there because of the extended session. At last, here\u2019s Hazlewood. Had some errors with our block order if you were confused there, sorry. Brook lays into him just as hard. Smokes him through the covers for four! 24th over: England 121-3 (Root 45, Brook 29) More from Lyon. This is statement batting. Picks off two through point, then clouts four over cover. No one gets an easy time here. 23rd over: England 113-3 (Root 44, Brook 22) Cummins bowling his seventh over of the spell. A Brook single. Root just keeps out a yorker, looked as good as the Pope one. Cummins goes around the wicket to the right-hander, looking for something different. Root guides a run to deep third. If you\u2019re interested, Joe Root today has also gone to 21st on the list of Ashes run-scorers, passing The Big Ship, Warwick Armstrong, and gone to 11th on England\u2019s list, passing Kevin Pietersen. 22nd over: England 111-3 (Root 43, Brook 21) Lyon on to bowl, and Brook takes to him immediately! A cut shot through point, a sweep behind square, four runs from each. Two more with another sweep, two with a clip, one more with a normal shot to midwicket. Just the 13 from the over. England have been ruthless this morning. 21st over: England 98-3 (Root 43, Brook 8) Serious seam movement inwards from Cummins as Brook leaves, the ball bouncing just over his off bail. Cummins drops to his haunches for a second in disbelief. Then fires one past the outside edge as Brook charges and wafts, before staying home and leaving another very close to the off stump. Impressive burst from the bowler. Searching, gets too straight and Brook picks off one run to deep midwicket. A rare quiet over on the scoreboard. Root has just gone past Richie Richardson into 17th spot for most Test runs against Australia. Currently 2177 at an average of 41. 20th over: England 97-3 (Root 43, Brook 7) First boundary for Brook, picking off a full straight ball from Green through midwicket. Four, then one. Root comes way across his stumps and nearly loses leg, trying to catch up with the ball and missing. Stays leg side of the next ball and glides one. \u201cLiked the Jonathan Liew piece, while it\u2019s not Father\u2019s Day in this hemisphere,\u201d writes Eamonn Maloney. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed so that cricket fans are usually made through their fathers, but often so also is the way they interact with the game. My brother noticed a comment I made on the OBO yesterday which led to a discussion about how dad used to call up the ABC radio\u2019s Grandstand coverage from the rotary phone in the hallway, in a bid to have his (strongish) opinions amplified. Required more patience and commitment in those days but there\u2019s a clear line from the dialing digits to the typing thumbs.\u201d 19th over: England 90-3 (Root 42, Brook 1) Cummins continues, no Hazlewood. Root takes him off the pads to deep midwicket, where Head gets razzed in front of the Hollies sliding across to keep it to two runs. Same dose next ball. Scoring so easily. Then Root tries the scoop again but there\u2019s too much pace from Cummins and the line is straighter, over middle stump. Misses. More luck with conventional play, picking off a full leg-stump error through deep backward for four. Matt Dony has been pondering Joe Root too. \u201cAs you eloquently explained yesterday, it\u2019s aa fool\u2019s errand dwelling on \u2018what ifs\u2019. If you change one thing, you change everything. But, I do wonder what could have happened had Root stepped down from the captaincy a bit earlier. He is a sensational batter, even more fluid and creative without the (cliche klaxon!) Burden Of Captaincy. My suspicion is that Stokes became captain at the perfect time for him, so any intervening period between an earlier Root abdication and now would have been played in a different style and with a different approach. But surely Root would have flourished whatever. Alas, we\u2019ll never know. We can simply enjoy the now. It\u2019s impossible to know whether it\u2019s the best timeline, but it\u2019s a million miles away from the darkest timeline.\u201d 18th over: England 82-3 (Root 34, Brook 1) Cameron Green is the man for all jobs now. He was at first slip in the previous over, Khawaja out from there. Now he\u2019s bowling ahead of Hazlewood. Is there a problem? Hazlewood was off the field briefly. He\u2019s back on now at fine leg. Seems to be warming up. Green from the City End. Root slices a single. Harry Brook does likewise. Deep third and deep backward point now for Root, along with a deep square leg and a fine leg. So Green has licence to bounce him? Slip, cover, mid off, mid on, midwicket. Runs anywhere square on the off side, and Root goes there, driving in front of point for two. Then a single square. 17th over: England 77-3 (Root 30) Finally one goes down! Australia get something back their way, last ball of the over. It starts with Cummins to Root, who is taking a few breaths between bursts of freneticism, defending a couple. Cover is open for him, point and mid off now stationed, and he takes a run to deep third. Nathan Lyon fields, then does some bowling warm-ups. He\u2019ll surely be on soon. He comes up to backward point for Pope, and that\u2019s a mistake because Pope cuts fine, right where Lyon had just been, for four. Cummins zeroes in on off stump and Pope stays behind it. But Pope isn\u2019t expecting the fullest pitch. That\u2019s the perfect yorker, right on the line, a sharp angle in at the stumps from wider on the crease, and it sneaks under the toe of the bat to flatten off stump. Brilliant fast bowling. 16th over: England 72-2 (Root 29, Pope 10) Interesting. Cummins is usually quick with a bowling change if someone is getting tonked. But perhaps he thinks that doing so with Boland now would be some sort of defeat. Boland gets another over, and tucks up Root with two really good balls, before erring in width and being slashes for four! Leaning away from the ball is Root to make more room, such a shot. Then plays a crisp straight drive but mid on is able to stop it. Glides another single. The sun is shining. He can do whatever he likes. It must feel so good to be Joe Root right now. 15th over: England 67-2 (Root 24, Pope 10) Cummins said before the match about that there would be times when England\u2019s approach had him under pressure as a captain, and said there was nowhere he would rather be. This is the moment. He bowls to Pope, who takes two more runs through square leg. Green back in the gully for Pope, the cordon applauding a decent ball. Making a point of keeping their own spirits up. A drive on the bounce to cover. Only two men out, deep square and fine leg. Sun shining strongly now. Pope strokes a drive for three, straight of Labuschagne again, who is lurking between cover and mid off trying to be both. Root pinches one more and keeps the strike. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for a day of excesses!\u201d emails Tony White. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear from the OBOers who failed their Bazball GSCE\u2019s trying to understand JR\u2019s rocking start to the day!\u201d 14th over: England 61-2 (Root 23, Pope 5) This was always the question: would Boland be susceptible to a Bazzing? He overpitches here and Root drives him perfectly through extra cover. Then opens the face and dabs so fine that it goes on the bounce to Smith at second slip. Green is back closer to the action now, backward point. Head is down at deep third. Labuschagne at cover. No mid off. Then a mid on, midwicket, forward square leg, long leg, so Boland can target the stumps. He doesn\u2019t, and Root gets the glide away for a run this time. Pope advances at Boland and hits that gap at mid off for four! His first runs of the innings. Boland responds with a better length and draws a rare defensive shot. Then a single to point. \u201cI see Root has done that thing where he unobtrusively races to 20 odd runs without doing anything flashy,\u201d writes Martin Lloyd. \u201cI imagine once he\u2019s in he\u2019ll start to play some shots...\u201d 13th over: England 51-2 (Root 18, Pope 0) Off strike with a leg bye goes Pope, so he still hasn\u2019t scored but gets Root back into the action. Root is happy with a single tucked off his leg stump. More leg byes for Pope, four of them to fine leg. Cummins hasn\u2019t got his line right. Australia, dare I say, rattled early. 12th over: England 45-2 (Root 17, Pope 0) Too straight for thee! Scott Boland strays onto the pads and Root whips him through midwicket with elan. Lovely. Then Boland gets his line right, and Root plays his reverse again for six. Gets plenty of that one, over the keeper who is up to the stumps. It soars away! He enjoys it so much that he plays it again, next ball. Doesn\u2019t get a full piece, skews the ball flatter, but just over slip and away for four. That takes Green out of the cordon, Australia putting their tallest man back on the rope at deep third. So Root taps the ball into the gap at point for two runs. Sensational batting. 11th over: England 29-2 (Root 1, Pope 0) Ummmm, ok? That\u2019s one way to start the day. Cummins bowls length, and Root tries the reverse scoop over deep third without having seen a delivery yet. Misses it by a mile, and it misses his stumps. Settles for a single to fine leg a couple of balls later. Only three balls in the over, finishing the one that was abandoned yesterday. Here we go. \u201cAppreciate the blog from Perth (Australia),\u201d writes the helpfully specific Brendan Crozier. \u201cAny reason why play has not started early today, given the time lost yesterday?\u201d They don\u2019t do that here, Brendan. The theory is that because the evenings are light, you can play late. But that only works if the sky is clear. There\u2019s also an old argument that it\u2019s not fair to start play early because people have planned their arrival time and would miss that part of play. But if the overs aren\u2019t bowled, they miss that part of play anyway. But, yes. There is never an early start in England, there is time added to the end of the day. And we\u2019ll have 15 minutes added to each of the first two sessions before the breaks, too. Now, here\u2019s the kind of email I can get behind. From Dennis Johns. \u201cMorning Geoff. Nice to see you here this morning, looking forward to the Aussie perspective on an absolute snorter of a Test match. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m writing. I was reading Dead Lions (spy novel, part of the Slow Horses series) by Mick Heron this morning and found a reference to the OBO in it! We\u2019re told that a character called Harper \u2018emails the Guardian\u2019s over-by-over cricket blog on a regular basis\u2019. It was published 2013 - did we know this? Does the OBO get a shout out in any other novels? Enjoy the day\u2019s play.\u201d Here\u2019s a call out to the OBO readership. Another question, do we have a collective name for such? What is the Beyhive of the OBO? Of course you can send me an email through the day, or get in touch with Twitter, for thoughts large and small. Have at it. I\u2019ve just settled on an executive decision for today though. Most of the emails already have been about Robinson and Khawaja and sledging, and I appreciate that people have views on it, but I\u2019d rather not sidetrack the coverage this morning into more back and forth on a well tilled field. It will be the same discussion we\u2019ve had time and again: some people are all for it, some say it\u2019s the understandable by-product of competition, and some find it diminishes their enjoyment of the game. Robinson has extensive form, and you would think that someone with his history might engage in more thought or tread more carefully. But he doesn\u2019t, and hasn\u2019t, so most likely won\u2019t. There\u2019s not much point hashing it all over. And last on our list of links, one of the great mysteries of the OBO. I am only its servant, so who am I to question? Behold, the Test Match Special overseas listening link. Lastly, we\u2019ve had a huge response overnight to this one from Jonathan Liew, who arrived yesterday with a pensive air on Father\u2019s Day. \u201cI\u2019m going to write about my dad,\u201d he said when it came time to discuss column topics. And, what a piece. This is a top piece from Barney Ronay, capturing the tension of old and new, and what can be impressively irritating about Bazball for anyone not on the inside of it. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes a podcast wrap while walking to the ground or making a sandwich, there\u2019s Day 3 on The Final Word with me and Adam Collins. Here. I wrote about the shifting moods of an English summer and an English Test match, which is still fitting given that we\u2019ve seen at least three of those moods in the last few hours. And here is Simon\u2019s Ashes Diary, throwing together the vignettes into some semi-coherent whole. Like making a quiche. Once that\u2019s done, check in with Ollie Robinson\u2019s press conference via Simon Burnton. Played a few shots last night, did Robinson. Let\u2019s play our favourite game: Read What We Wrote on The Guardian Yesterday! I suggest you start with Ali Martin\u2019s match report. Be informed. As ever for England, Joe Root is the key. Played like a dream on the first day, made his 30th career ton, and he will resume on 0 not out. So nearly could have been out three times yesterday, a couple of lbw shouts and a caught behind appeal that missed by a millimetre. It was a tough time to bat. This morning, not so much. England are already on the field, in a big circle at the southern end doing keepy-uppy warm-ups. Some Australian players are on the eastern side of the ground doing cricket warm-ups. Cricket? Nerds. Hello from Edgbaston! The sun is out, and the forecast is set fair, though there is still plenty of scattered cloud about and was the occasional cold blast of wind as we made our way into the ground. It should, overall, be a good batting day for England, but the forecast for tomorrow is awful. So, if this is the last reliable day, what does the new England philosophy demand? They\u2019re 28 for 2, leading by 35 runs. They have, in theory, 98.3 overs of play today. So do they go hell for leather for two sessions and then throw Australia in? We\u2019ll see just how Baz the Ball might be over the day."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ba", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jun/19/england-v-north-macedonia-european-championship-qualifying-group-c-live", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England v North Macedonia: Euro 2024 qualifier\u2013 live", "lead": "<strong>Minute-by-minute report:</strong> Will England maintain their perfect record or can North Macedonia spring a surprise?

The 2022-23 English football season has been going on so long, it could be Elton John\u2019s farewell tour. It began with the Charity Shield at Wembley on 30 July, way back when Man City were still capable of losing. It finally comes to an end tonight at Old Trafford, with England\u2019s tenth match of the season \u2013 although if you\u2019re a Scotland fan, or just an admirer of their ability to inflict defeat on Erling Haaland, there\u2019s still tomorrow\u2019s game against Georgia to look forward to. Like Scotland, England have a spotless record in these Euro qualifiers with three wins out of three. Facing North Macedonia at home, they are hot favourites to make it four, but history might say otherwise. North Macedonia, who went 2-0 up against Ukraine last week before conceding three times, have never lost in England. And while they\u2019ve never won either, their two draws \u2013 2-2 in 2002, 0-0 in 2006, both in qualifiers like this one \u2013 probably felt like wins. Will North Macedonia do it again? Or will England enjoy a cruise, as they did in Malta? Will Trent Alexander-Arnold stay in midfield, where he was the star player the other night? Will any of the City contingent come back into the starting XI, after incurring some mild distaste from Gareth Southgate by turning their treble celebrations into a stag weekend? All these questions will be answered from 7.45pm Manchester time (8.45 in Skopje). I\u2019ll be back shortly with the teams."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946bb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/19/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-keir-starmer-privileges-committee-report-tories-labour-uk-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson: MPs debate report that found former prime minister misled parliament \u2013 UK politics live", "lead": "Theresa May says parliament must punish MPs who break rules as Penny Mordaunt says Johnson \u2018undermined democratic process\u2019", "author": "Tom Ambrose (now) and Andrew Sparrow (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 18:07:17", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545472", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/200651cb53f8f48e318cb2ba26fead9af34b2601/0_23_2042_1225/500.jpg", "body": "Actor Sir Ian McKellen was present in the Commons for the debate on the Privileges Committee report. Sir Ian watched the proceedings from the MPs\u2019 guests gallery, occasionally using a pair of opera glasses. However, he declined to comment on leaving the house. Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine says that it is a time to \u201crecognise the significance of supporting this report\u201d. She says Johnson showed contempt for the public and undermined trust. \u201cOur constituents will be looking to us as to how we have stood up for them and protested the way they were let down by the incumbent of No 10,\u201d she says. The honour of this house and this democracy is at stake and we cannot risk it. Labour\u2019s Karl Turner commends the privileges committee for the job done compiling the report. He says that anybody who reads the report \u201cwould have to conclude the reality that Boris Johnson was a liar\u201d. Turner says: Very often you would be surprised that he could get away with the things he was saying but it\u2019s proven now that he was dishonest. He goes on to question why Johnson received taxpayers\u2019 money to fund his legal aid. The former prime minister should \u201cpay up himself\u201d, he says. Turner also raises the issue of honours being handed to \u201cpeople who were boozing it up in central Tory office\u201d. He adds that Rishi Sunak should be \u201cashamed of himself\u201d for not attending the debate. Here comes Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con), who was recently knighted in Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial resignation honours list. He says the fixed-penalty notice Boris Johnson received for attending the birthday gathering was not a \u201cconviction\u201d or \u201cadmission of guilt\u201d. The report \u201cdecides to impute a stain on his character\u201d, Rees-Mogg continues. He adds that the report \u201cdecides as if it were an Elon Musk particle to insert itself in the brain of Mr Johnson to work out what he must have thought in a particular moment\u201d. He infers that the committee \u201cwanted to come to a particular conclusion\u201d about the former prime minister. He says: They go from the vindictive to the ridiculous in not allowing him a parliamentary pass. Rees-Mogg goes on to question the 90-day sanction that Johnson would have received had he not resigned his seat last week. He compares the privileges committee to \u201ccommunist China\u201d\u2026 Dame Margaret Hodge (Lab) is now speaking. She says trust in Westminster \u201ccan only exist if we tell the truth\u201d. She goes on to say that the committee\u2019s conclusions are based entirely on incontrovertible evidence and says it is \u201cshameful\u201d to try to de-legitimatise the report\u2019s findings. Hodge says that reported attempts to \u201cbully or blackmail\u201d are shocking and that the integrity of parliament must come before all else. She says: Boris Johnson allowed this creeping culture of corruption and unchecked executive power to infect our democracy. John Baron (Con) says he will vote to approve the privileges committee\u2019s report if there is a vote. But he hopes there won\u2019t be one, he says. He says the Commons normally approves these reports without a vote. Ministers can only be held to account if they tell the truth at the dispatch box, he says. He says if MPs are saying the Commons cannot regulate itself, they are in effect calling for an outsider to do that job. That should be worrying, he says. Today parliament is putting right a wrong, he says. That is why this is a good day for parliament. That is all from me for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Bryant is now defending the privileges committee. He says the standards committee (whose MP members are mostly the same as the privileges committee\u2019s) concluded Boris Johnson had not broken rules about the registration of a holiday, even though the parliamentary commissioner for standards claimed he had. And he says Sir Ernest Ryder, the legal adviser to the privileges committee, would not have allowed it to operate an unfair system. Ryder used to run the tribunals service, he says. Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the Commons standards committee (and chair of the privileges committee until he stood aside for this inquiry, because of his previous comments about Boris Johnson), says people made sacrifices during the pandemic because they felt we were all in this together. That is why they feel so strongly about this, he says. He defends the committee\u2019s conclusion that Johnson would have deserved a 90-day suspension if he were still an MP. He says the closest precedent he could find was Sir Michael Grylls, a Tory involved in the cash for questions scandal in the 1990s. He says Grylls had stood down by the time the parliamentary inquiry into him was over. But the committee said that, if he were still an MP, he should be suspended for a substantial period, \u201caugmented to take account of his deceit\u201d. Sir Jake Berry, a former Tory chair and another supporter, intervenes on Lia Nici. He says Boris Johnson is being criticised for how people interpreted the assurances he gave to MPs, not for what he actually said. Nici agrees. She says the report was not written in an impartial way. She says there is no evidence in the report saying people told Johnson about parties taking place in the building. Johnson is not the caretaker of the building, she says. It was not his job to go around the building seeing what people were doing. She says No 10 is full of police officers. If rules were being broken, that would have been reported to him, she says. Jess Phillips (Lab) asks Nici if she has considered that Johnson might have lied to her. MPs laugh at that. Nici says she does not think that is the case. She is a good judge of character, she claims. She says the opposition to Johnson is being led by people who want \u201ca formidable opponent out of their way\u201d. In the Commons Lia Nici (Con) is speaking now. She is the first MP to defend Boris Johnson. She says she has read the whole report, and cannot see any evidence that Johnson misled MPs, recklessly or deliberately. She also says she used to be Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary. An SNP MP intervenes to gell Nici \u201cthere is none so blind as those who will not see\u201d. Nici says, when Johnson told MPs the rules were followed, he was repeating the advice he had been given. She says many of the people who gave that advice are still working in Westminster, but that we do not know how those people are because they are not well known. Dame Angela Eagle (Lab) is speaking now. She says the privileges committee discharged its duties with honour. MPs should support them. But \u201cthe Boris Johnson-worshipping print and TV media\u201d has traduced them, egged on by Johnson himself, she says. She says MPs who have condemned the committee as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d have committed a contempt of parliament. A reader asks: Can you give us an estimate of how full the chamber is? A colleague who has been watching from the press gallery (I\u2019m watching on TV) says the Labour benches are fairly full. There are fewer Tory MPs in the chamber (several dozen?), but still more than you might expect for business on a one-line whip. Dame Andrea Leadsom, the Tory former leader of the Commons, says she will be supporting the motion tonight. She urges all MPs to approve the motion without a division. Harman ended her speech by playing to tribute to the role of the media in this affair, and particulary to the work done by Pippa Crerar, the former Daily Mirror political editor who is now political editor at the Guardian, and ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. They were responsible for the most important Partygate revelations. Harriet Harman, the former Labour leader who chaired the privilges committee as it carried out the Boris Johnson inquiry, is speaking now. She says an inquiry by the privileges committee is the only means available to the Commons to protect itself against a minister who is not being honest. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Johnson supporter, asks Harman about the perception that the tweets she posted relating to Partygate undermined her inquiry. Harman says she will address that. She says she was appointed by the house as a whole, with the support of the government. After the reports came out (in the Daily Telegraph) highlighting tweets which suggested that Harman was sympathetic to the view that Johnson had lied over Partygate, she says she took action. After the tweets were brought to light, they were highlighted, because I am concerned about the perception of fairness of the committee and I agree that perception matters, I made it my business to find out whether or not it would mean that the government would not have confidence in me if I continued to chair the committee. I actually said I am more than happy to step aside because perception matters and I don\u2019t want to do this if the government doesn\u2019t have confidence in me, because I need the whole house of have confidence in the work that the committee has mandated. I was assured that I should continue the work that the house had mandated with the appointment that the house had put me into and so I did just that. This is the first time Harman has said that. In the chamber it served as a solid put-down. May says the public want to see MPs \u201ccoming to a conclusion\u201d. That seems to be a dig at Rishi Sunak, and all those other Tory MPs are are avoiding taking a position on the committee\u2019s report If they see MPs trying to defend the careers of friends clearly guilty of wrongdoing, their respect for politicians is damaged. MPs are leaders in their communities, she says. With that comes responsibility, she says. She says they all know that in political debate there is \u201cexaggeration, careful use of facts and sometimes misrepresentation\u201d. But when something is said that is wrong, MPs are under a duty not to repeat it, she says. May also says it is important for parliament to punish MPs who break the rules. In a reference to Boris Johnson\u2019s Vote Leave slogan, she says you could call that showing \u201cthe sovereignty of parliament\u201d. Back in the Commons, Theresa May, the former PM, is speaking. She says the report is a rigorous one and she accepts it. She wants to make a wider point, she says. It is not easy to judge colleagues. As PM, she had to take decisions based on the conduct of friends and colleagues. Friendship, working together, should not get in the way of doing what is right. She commends the privileges committee for their work, and for their dignity in the face of slurs. She particularly thanks Harriet Harman for chairing the committee. She says the committee\u2019s work matters because it strikes at the heart of the bond of trust that needs to exist between politicians and the public. Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has given a strong hint that the Met will take action against Tories involved in the lockdown party organised by Shaun Bailey\u2019s mayoral campaign team. In an interview with the News Agents podcast, asked about the video of the event leaked to the Mirror at the weekend, Rowley said: We\u2019re not routinely opening every minor historic allegation. So, if you phoned up about your neighbour from three years ago, we\u2019re not going to reopen that. But clearly cases that are particularly serious, particularly concerning, we will do. As people know, that case has been previously looked at based on a photo. It\u2019s very obvious a video tells a much richer, clearer story than a photo. And so, the team are looking at that with a view to whether that provides a basis for further investigation \u2026 I think we can all see the colourful nature of the video and how much it tells a story way beyond the original photo. I need to let a team work through that but I think we can all guess which way it will go. The Met did not take action about this event when it originally investigated Partygate. Penny Mordaunt is alone on the front bench, the Critic\u2019s Robert Hutton points out. Brock says paragraph 210 of the report is scathing. This is what it says. We have concluded above that in deliberately misleading the House Mr Johnson committed a serious contempt. The contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the Prime Minister, the most senior member of the government. There is no precedent for a Prime Minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House. He misled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public, and did so repeatedly. He declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the House was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the Committee in the presentation of his evidence Deidre Brock, the SNP spokesperson on Commons matters, says Ian Blackford, the former SNP leader at Westminster, once got thrown out of the Commons for calling Boris Johnson a liar. But at the same time \u201cthe liar himself was protected by procedure\u201d. Sir Peter Bottomley (Con), father of the house, is speaking now. He says Boris Johnson did many good things. He says he personally once got the words \u201cI made a mistake, I apologise\u201d into Hansard after something he did in the 1980s. He suggests Johnson should have done the same. Debbonaire accuses Rishi Sunak of refusing to defend the privileges committee system. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, intervenes, and disputes this. She says Sunak is on the record as defending the committee. (That is sort of true. See 8.47am.) Mordaunt also says Sunak has called out those MPs who have overstepped the mark by attacking the committee. Back in the Commons Bob Seely, the Conservative MP, intervenes on Debbonaire. He says he will vote for the motion. He says his party \u201cgot rid of Boris Johnson a year ago because we lost faith in him because he was probably not telling the truth\u201d. But, Seely says, he is also an Iraq veteran. Addressing Labour, he says Tony Blair \u201clied and lied and lied and you lot covered up for him\u201d. In reply, Debbonaire says only last week Rishi Sunak was too weak to stand up to Johnson over his honours list. Several readers have asked about MPs using the word \u201clie\u201d in the Commons today. This is from one of them. Why can they say \u201clied\u201d in the HOC today? I thought it was a taboo word. The main answer is because Boris Johnson is no longer an MP. It is also the case that, in certain circumstances, when MPs are debating a motion specifically about an MP or minister lying, the speaker will allow the word \u201cliar\u201d to be used. If Johnson were still an MP today, the speaker may have allowed the term on those grounds. Debbonaire says Johnson claimed the rules in No 10 were followed at all time. But the committee compared this against what happened, and what Johnson knew about what had happened. Johnson lied, she says. Debbonaire says there has been a \u201csustained, seemingly coordinated, attempt\u201d to undermine the work of the committee. She goes on: At no point that I can see did Johnson denounce this campaign. Debbonaire says Johnson claims the public don\u2019t care about this. But the public do care, she says. She says a Constitution Unit report found that being honest was the quality people want most from politicians. The privileges committee\u2019s inquiry was fair, she says. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, is speaking now. She says MPs who continue to defend Boris Johnson should think of the people who lost lives during the pandemic. By continuing to insist that birthdays and \u201cmorale-boosting parties\u201d were essential work events, those MPs are hurting relatives, she says. She says birthdays happen every year \u2013 it is Johnson\u2019s today, she points out \u2013 but funerals cannot. She says any MP defending Johnson should consider what they would say to relatives who lost loved ones. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says the privileges committee found Boris Johnson \u201clied\u201d. She asks if Mordaunt agrees that there should be a law obliging politicians to respect the truth. Mordaunt says the committee report has wider implications. It has asserted the right of MPs not to be misled. She thanks the committee for its work. This matters \u201cbecause the integrity of our institution matters\u201d, she says. She urges MPs to \u201cdo what they think is right\u201d, and says others should leave them alone to do so. Toby Perkins (Lab) intervenes to say, given the amount of work done by the committee, examining the evidence, people who have not done that work should not criticise it. Mordaunt says MPs should be grateful for the work of the committee. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, asks if Mordaunt will vote for her own motion, approving the report. Mordaunt confirms that, as the member for Portsmouth North (ie, as an individual, not in a government capacity), she will vote for it. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, is opening the debate. She says MPs have an obligation to defend the rights of parliament. She says the motion being debated today is amendable. But no amendments have been tabled. The committee found that Boris Johnson misled the Commons, and the committee, and that this amounted to contempt of parliament. It also found that \u201cbreached confidence, undermined the democratic process of this house and was complicit in a campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee\u201d, she says. MPs are now about to debate the privileges committee report on Boris Johnson. But before they start David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, raises a point of order. He mentions last week\u2019s Telegraph story saying Johnson\u2019s allies are threatening to try to deselect MPs who vote in favour of the report criticising Johnson. Davis says this threat is a contempt of parliament. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, acknowledges the point, and says the privileges committee is doing a further report addressing this. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has called on police to increase the use of stop and search powers \u201cto prevent violence and save more lives\u201d. Matthew Weaver has the story here. In a statement on this in the Commons, Braverman said a few minutes ago: It would be a tragic mistake to conclude that stop and search is too controversial to use extensively or that it cannot be used effectively with sensible safeguards. Suggestions that it is a means of victimising young black men have it precisely the wrong way around. The facts are that young black men are disproportionately more likely to be victims of violent crimes. They are the ones most in need of protection. This is about saving the lives of young black men \u2026 It\u2019s always bad policy to place unsubstantiated theories ahead of demonstrable fact. In this case, it would be lethal \u2026 I\u2019m struck by how often mothers of murdered young black men say that stop and search could have saved their sons\u2019 lives. We owe it to them to heed their call. The facts are on their side. Stop and search works and is a vital tool in the fight against serious violent crime. It\u2019s quite a day for former PMs. We have already heard from Liz Truss and David Cameron, Boris Johnson is about to be the first PM in history subject to a Commons debate in effect confirming he is a liar, and now my colleague Aubrey Allegretti says we may be hearing from Theresa May might be speaking in the debate. May reportedly thought Johnson was morally unfit to be PM when he replaced her in 2019. If she does speak, it may be along the lines of \u201cI told you so\u201d. A reader points out that there is a page on the government\u2019s website with details of the forfeiture process that allows honours to be taken away. It includes details of the kinds of behaviour that can lead to an honour being revoked (serious criminal offences predominantly) and information about how members of the public can propose the forfeiture of an honour. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM\u2019s spokesperson told journalists that it was up to the forfeiture committee to decide if people should lose an honour, when asked about the Tories who attended the party held by Shaun Bailey\u2019s mayoral campaign team. (See 1.19pm.) The spokesperson said: It is for the forfeiture committee to consider cases when put to it if there are claims about bringing the honour system into disrepute. It\u2019s not an investigatory body and it does not decide on whether people have committed specific acts, but it reflects on the findings of investigations or makes recommendations about whether the system has been brought into disrepute. It is for their committee to look at, if they wish to. Here is the text of Keir Starmer\u2019s speech in Edinburgh on Labour\u2019s clean energy policy. And here is the 18-page clean energy superpower mission document. The Scottish Conservatives claim the Labour proposal to stop issuing further oil and gas licences would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the north-east of Scotland. Liam Kerr MSP, the party\u2019s spokesperson for net zero, energy and transport, said: There was a reason Keir Starmer delivered this speech in Edinburgh, rather than Aberdeen \u2013 because this is an economically and environmentally illiterate policy that betrays north-east Scotland. Despite his desperate attempts at re-spinning it in recent days, the Labour leader is sticking stubbornly to his disastrously received and catastrophic position of banning all new oil and gas projects. That would cost tens of thousands of skilled jobs and destroy communities across the north-east. That\u2019s madness when we know that renewable sources don\u2019t yet cover our energy needs \u2013 because it would lead to costly foreign imports of fossil fuels, increasing our carbon footprint. Kerr also claimed the policy would \u201cgive Russia even more influence over UK and European energy markets\u201d. The TUC has said that David Cameron\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry (see 2.29pm) shows he is \u201cin denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies\u201d. In a statement, Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said: David Cameron is in denial about the huge damage caused by his austerity policies \u2013 both to public services and the UK economy. The evidence is clear that the cuts he imposed massively damaged the readiness and resilience of our public services. And they shredded our social security safety net \u2013 leaving millions vulnerable. We must learn the lesson that cuts have costs. And we must strengthen our public services and safety net so that we are never left exposed in the same way again. Here is a summary of the main points from David Cameron\u2019s evidence to the Covid inquiry this morning. Cameron defended his government\u2019s austerity policies, saying resilience required economic strength. He explained: Our whole economic strategy was about safeguarding and strengthening the economy and the nation\u2019s finances so we could cope with whatever crisis hit us next. And I think that\u2019s incredibly important because there\u2019s no resilience without economic resilience, without financial resilience, without fiscal resilience. He rejected claims austerity left the NHS unable to provide an adequate service. (See 12.09am.) He would not accept the conclusions of an expert report given to the committee saying health inequalities got worse while he was in power. Asked about the report by Prof Clare Bambra and Prof Sir Michael Marmot, he replied: [Marmot and Bambra\u2019s] conclusion is to look a lot at austerity, and what have you. I\u2019m not sure the figures back that out. We had some very difficult winters with very bad flu pandemics; I think that had an effect. We had the effect that the improvements in cardiovascular disease, the big benefits that already come through before that period, and that was tailing off. And then you\u2019ve got the evidence from other countries. I mean, Greece and Spain had far more austerity, brutal cuts, and yet their life expectancy went up. So I don\u2019t think it follows \u2026 They have got lots of important evidence and I have looked at it very carefully and will think about it very carefully, but I did find that they had leaped to a certain set of conclusions quite quickly, not all of which was backed up by the evidence. Cameron said that, when he was PM, the government did not plan enough for the risk of a non-flu pandemic. (See 11.43am.) He said more time should have been spent assessing the risk of a pandemic with asymptomatic transmission. \u201cWhen you think what would be different if more time had been spent on a highly infectious, asymptomatic pandemic, different recommendations would have been made about what was necessary to prepare for that,\u201d he said. Oliver Letwin, who as Cabinet Office minister in Cameron\u2019s government was responsible for resilience, now thinks he should have spent more time on pandemic planning, the inquiry heard. During his evidence, Cameron was asked about the witness statement from Letwin, who said that he had been told by officials that he did not need to look at pandemic influenza planning because the UK was already well prepared for it. In the statement Lewtwin went on: I now believe, however, that it might have been helpful if I had delved into the pandemic influenza risks myself \u2026 This is not because I believe such a review would have been likely to lead to any significant improvements in our preparedness for a pandemic flu itself, but rather because it might have led me to question whether we were adequately prepared to deal with the risks of forms of respiratory disease other than pandemic influenza. Cameron said there was a failure to learn from Exercise Alice, a \u201ctabletop exercise\u201d was conducted in 2016 to identify any potential threats from Mers [Middle East respiratory syndrome] coronavirus. He said: Having read through Alice \u2013 because ministers weren\u2019t involved \u2013 there\u2019s a sentence in Alice which is \u2018access to sufficient levels of PPE was also considered and pandemic stockpiles were suggested\u2019. That\u2019s a sentence in Alice, but it doesn\u2019t make it into the recommendations. So if you\u2019re asking: \u2018Does it look like there were failures to follow through from this?\u2019 I think the answer to that is yes. But he said he did not think his government had declined a request to surge PPE stockpiles. He said: I\u2019ve thought a lot about this because, having been back through all the paperwork and everything, I haven\u2019t found any moment when I was asked or the Treasury was asked to approve sort of surge capacity for PPE supplies or anything like that. He said that, if asked, his government would have bought three months\u2019 worth of PPE supplies for hospitals. He said: In Jeremy Hunt\u2019s evidence hospitals in Hong Kong had to have three months of PPE supplies. I was never asked: \u2018Can we have funding for three months of PPE supplies for every hospital?\u2019 But had I been asked we would\u2019ve granted it, that\u2019s not expensive, that\u2019s not a huge commitment. The Metropolitan police have confirmed that they are looking at three new sets of complaints about alleged lockdown rule-breaking by politicians \u2013 but it has stressed that full investigations will only be launched if that is deemed \u201cproportionate\u201d. In a statement, it says it is \u201cin the process of assessing\u201d material about three sets of events: gatherings at No 10 and Chequers uncovered by the Cabinet Office when it was looking at Boris Johnson\u2019s diaries as part of its Covid inquiry work; the alleged birthday drinks party attended by Sir Bernard Jenkin in Dame Eleanor Laing\u2019s office; and the party staged by Shaun Bailey\u2019s Tory London mayoral campaign team. The statement says: It would not be appropriate to prejudge the outcome of these assessments or to provide a running commentary on their progress. We will provide further updates at the appropriate time. But it also says, when considering retrospective breaches of Covid rules, the Met will only launch a full investigation \u201cwhen there is evidence of a serious and flagrant breach\u201d and where an investigation would be proportionate, where not investigating would \u201csignificantly undermine the legitimacy of the law\u201d and where there is \u201clittle ambiguity around the absence of a reasonable defence\u201d. No 10 has also said that Rishi Sunak currently is not planning to attend the Commons debate on Boris Johnson \u2013 but that attendance has not been ruled out. Speaking at the lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said Sunak had other engagements this afternoon and evening. He said: I don\u2019t think we know yet whether there will be a vote on this issue. The prime minister is hosting the prime minister of Sweden. He has a series of meetings [and] an evening commitment. Asked whether Sunak planned to attend the Commons if there was a vote, the spokesperson said: It depends on the timings of the day. He has commitments that he can\u2019t move, but obviously it will depend on how the timings in parliament play out. Asked if it was possible Sunak might attend, the spokesperson replied: Currently you\u2019ve got his schedule for today which doesn\u2019t include attending parliament, but obviously we will see how the timings play out. Downing Street has refused to back calls for two of the people who attended the Tory Partygate event featured in a video leaked to the Mirror to lose their honours. (See 9.32am.) At the morning lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said it was for \u201cindividuals to make their own decision\u201d if they wanted to relinquish their honour. Scottish Conservative MPs who fail to vote in favour of the privileges committee report condemning Boris Johnson will be betraying their voters, Humza Yousaf, the Scottish first minister, said. Speaking at his news conference this morning (see 10.32am), Yousaf said: I think those that choose to turn up to the vote and abstain, or indeed vote against the sanctions, any Scottish Tory MP who does that is betraying the people they represent. Boris Johnson, and indeed the Conservative party more generally, have shown flagrant disregard for rules that many of us, most of us, adhered. At the extreme end of that we saw people literally missing the funerals of loved ones, not being able to say goodbye, while they partied in Conservative headquarters. That is a betrayal of people\u2019s trust. Any Scottish Tory MP that is going to abstain or not vote to sanction Boris Johnson, they rightly will face the wrath of the Scottish people at the ballot box, I don\u2019t doubt that for a minute. Liz Truss was often accused of deliberately dressing like Margaret Thatcher as her career in government progressed on the way to becoming prime minister. But it was never intentional, she told a media conference in Dublin this morning. Truss, who was PM for just a few weeks last year, said that female politicians were often compared with one another because \u201cthere aren\u2019t that many of us\u201d. Speaking about the Thatcher comparison, she said: I just think, frankly, it\u2019s lazy thinking on people\u2019s part. It\u2019s not something I have ever consciously sought to do at all. Truss also complained about some media outlets treating politics as \u201ca branch of the entertainment industry\u201d and she described the Daily Star\u2019s decision last year to set up a livestream to see if her premiership would last longer than a lettuce (it didn\u2019t) was \u201cpuerile\u201d. A cross-party group of British MPs and peers has written to Rishi Sunak him to reconsider a decision to allow a visit this week by a senior Chinese government official accused of overseeing the forcible repatriation of hundreds of dissidents back to China, including some from the UK. Patrick Wintour has the story here. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti says the Boris Johnson debate could run for about four hours, judging by the number of MPs who have indicated they want to speak. That suggests a vote at about 8.30pm. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, will make a Commons statement on stop and search. There are no urgent questions, and this means that the Braverman statement will start at 3.30pm, and that the debate on Boris Johnson and the privileges committee report will start at about 4.30pm. Cameron says there are always pressures on the NHS. But he says that by the time he left office public satisfaction with the NHS was extremely high. The King\u2019s Fund described it as one of the most successful health systems in the world. He goes on: We\u2019d virtually abolished mixed-sex wards, we\u2019d got hospital infections down, we were carrying out 40% more diagnostic tests every week. There were successes in the NHS as well as pressures. Asked about expert reports criticising the state of the NHS, he said they tended to measure outputs (performance) by inputs (money spent on health). He says these experts did not recognise the role reform could play. Q: Do you accept health inequalities increased during your time in office? Cameron says after 2011, in many countries around the world life expectancy improved, but at a lower rate than before. Countries such as Greece and Spain had far more austerity, \u201cbrutal cuts\u201d. But life expectancy went up in those countries, he says. He says he has read the report by Prof Clare Bambra and Prof Sir Michael Marmot on health inequalities that was submitted to the inquiry. As an example, he says the report said child poverty increased during his term in office. He goes on: Well, actually, the number of children living in absolute poverty went down. The number of people living in absolute poverty went down. The number of pensioners living in absolute poverty went down very considerably. (Absolute poverty is a measure of poverty benchmarked to the relatively poverty figure in a particular year, normally when a government takes office. Over time it almost always goes down, because inflation means household incomes go up in cash terms for the poorest families, even if they do not go up in relative terms.) He says he thinks Bambra and Marmot in their report came to \u201ca certain set of conclusions quite quickly, not all of which was backed up by the evidence\u201d. In their report Bambra and Marmot say: The UK entered the pandemic with increasing health inequalities and health among the poorest people in a state of decline. We knew from previous pandemics and research into lower respiratory tract infections that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, people living in areas or regions with higher rates of deprivation, and people from minority ethnic groups and people with disabilities, are much more likely to be severely impacted by a respiratory pandemic. Kate Blackwell KC is now asking David Cameron about his government\u2019s austerity policies. She says she does not want to examine whether they were right in principle; she just wants to ask about their impact on health, inequality and societal resilience. Q: Do you accept that the health budgets passed by your government were inadequate, and let to a depletion in its ability to provide an adequate service? Cameron says he does not accept that. He says, if the government had lost control of the public finances, it would not have been able to protect the NHS. He says health spending went up. The number of doctors increased. But it was \u201cessential\u201d to get the public finances back to health. Q: In a witness statement, Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has talked about his concerns about capacity in the NHS. Cameron says he knows of Hunt\u2019s concerns. He was a very capable health secretary. He was always battling for the NHS. But financial decisions had to be taken collectively. Q: Hunt sets out in his statement matters that should have been addressed. Cameron says, without his government\u2019s action, government debt might have been \u00a31tn higher. There would have been a financial and fiscal crisis, as well as the pandemic. He says government needs to have a strong economy, and also to prepare for pandemics. It did not end up spending enough time on the sort of pandemic the UK experienced. Q: Do you accept you failed in putting in place \u201cwhole-system resilience\u201d? Cameron says he does not accept that. He says he put in place the national risk register, and the national security council. Q: Evidence heard by the inquiry last week included the question from witnesses: \u201cWho is in charge of keeping the country safe?\u201d Cameron says, as PM, he was in charge of keeping the country safe. He says he set up the national security council to help him to that. He says all his experience of dealing with matters such as Ebola showed that the system worked well, but that it worked best \u201cwhen the prime minister is in the chair, asking questions, driving changes, and making sure decisions are made\u201d. This may be a dig at Boris Johnson. Cameron is now being asked if he accepts that, by the time he left office, there had been no planning for the impact of a pandemic. For example, was there any school planning? In reply, Cameron says he thinks the possibility of school planning came up in the Operation Cygnet exercise. Kate Blackwell KC, who is questioning Cameron on behalf of the inquiry, says the Cygnet report said that work should be looked at. That does not mean it was done. Q: Was there any planning for restrictions? Cameron says his government was focused on safeguarding the country\u2019s finances. There is no resilience without economic resilience, he says. He says the national risk registers talked about how government might respond to various catastrophic events. But a plan is \u201conly as good as the economic and financial capacity of a country to deliver it\u201d, he says. David Cameron is giving evidence to the Covid inquiry since 11am. He was prime minister from 2010 until 2016, and he said that although pandemics were seen as a \u201ctier 1 risk\u201d, there was too much focus on the risk of a flu pandemic, and not enough on the risk of another type. He said he had been asking himself why that happened, and it was \u201cvery hard\u201d to give an answer. He said: This is the thing I keep coming back to, which is that pandemic was a \u2018tier 1 risk\u2019 \u2013 pandemics were looked at, but \u2026 much more time was spent on pandemic flu and the dangers of pandemic flu rather than on potential pandemics of other more respiratory diseases like Covid turned out to be. And, you know, I think this is so important because so many consequences follow from that. And I\u2019ve been sort of wrestling with \u2026 I think the architecture [to deal with large-scale emergencies] was good \u2013 the national security council, the national security adviser, the risk register, and also this new security risk assessment, which was perhaps a bit more dynamic. But that\u2019s where I keep coming back to \u2026 is, so much time was spent on a pandemic influenza and that was seen as the greatest danger \u2013 and we had very bad years for flu so it is a big danger. But why wasn\u2019t more time and more questions asked about what turned out to be the pandemic that we faced? It\u2019s very hard to answer why that\u2019s the case. And I\u2019m sure this public inquiry is going to spend a lot of time on that. These are from ITV\u2019s Anushka Asthana on Cameron\u2019s evidence. Q: Will the HQ of GB Energy be based in Aberdeen? [In his speech, Starmer announced it would be in Scotland.] Sarwar says it has not been decided where the HQ will go. But he says the energy plan will be good for Aberdeen. And that was the final question. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: At the weekend Panelbase said Labour is on course to win 26 seats in Scotland. Is that realistic? Starmer says he is very, very conscious of the fact that Scotland matters to Labour. Of course the party needs seats in Scotland to win. But he wants to be the prime minister \u201cnot just of the UK, but for the UK\u201d, he says. That is why having seats in Scotland matters to him. He says he wants his party to be able to say it has representation across the UK. His missions will be succeed unless they have support across the whole of the UK. Sarwar says he is not complacent \u201cfor a second\u201d. They have made significant progress, he says. They had had to demonstrate Labour is changing, build campaigning infrastructure, show they can be a credible opposition \u2013 but also show why they deserve to win. He says the announcement today is crucial in that respect. He says Labour has to win for the sake of the NHS. There are 750,000 Scots on a waiting list, he says. Q: How long can someone working in the oil and gas industry expect to have their job? Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, says that sector will pay a significant role for decades to come. The jobs will be protected, he says. Q: If you do not commit to rescinding the Rosebank licence, aren\u2019t you just letting the Tories do your dirty work? Starmer does not answer the question directly. Instead he says the trade unions support Labour\u2019s desire to promote jobs in the green energy sector. He says in Scotland there is resentment that they have offshore wind, but they have not got the jobs that went with it. He recalls visiting a windfarm where all the turbines were built outside the UK. The Tories let coalmining die and had no plan for the future. Labour won\u2019t allow the same thing to happen as the oil and gas industry winds down. Q: Would you back higher windfall taxes? Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, says energy companies are making record profits. He says it is right to have a windfall tax that puts that money back in people\u2019s pockets. Q: If you were PM today, would you give the go-ahead to the Rosebank oilfield? Starmer says his policy is to say no to new licences. But it would not rescind existing licences. He says it is important for investors to have certainty (ie for them to know that licences awarded under this government would be withdrawn). But he says the Rosebank licence is expected to be approved very soon. So that would count as an existing licence by the time Labour came into office, he says. Q: Can you confirm that you would no longer issue oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea, but would allow existing drilling to continue? Starmer says Labour has been clear about wanting to stop further exploration. But he says oil and gas will continue to be part of the energy mix for decades. Back in Edinburgh Keir Starmer has just finished his speech, and is now taking questions. Q: Hasn\u2019t the shift on your \u00a328bn green energy pledge shown that you cannot be trusted? Starmer says Labour has not abandoned this plan; it is doubling down on it. But he says the context for borrowing has changed since the party announced it. Q: Everything is going well for you. It is impossible for you to lose now? Starmer says there is a reason why the Tories at Westminster, and the SNP in Scotland, are failing. The question is, are people better off? And under both these governments, they are not. But he says Labour has to earn every vote. When Boris Johnson was prime minister, and facing a fresh blast of Partygate negative headlines, they often seemed to coincided with No 10 announcing that Johnson had just had a call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. We have a new prime minister, but some traditions (or coincidences \u2013 No 10 always denied that the calls were part of a distraction strategy) endure. Downing Street has just announced that Rishi Sunak spoke to Zelenskiy this morning. In a readout, No 10 said: The prime minister paid tribute to the bravery of the Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline of the counteroffensive and said it was clear they were making good progress. He told President Zelenskiy that the UK was firmly behind Ukraine as it continued to push back invading Russian forces. Small steps forward would bring success, the prime minister added. The prime minister updated on his recent visit to the US and his meeting with President Biden, and said it was clear the US and UK were in lockstep in their unwavering support for Ukraine. Both the prime minister and President Zelenskiy looked forward to speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, which is being hosted in London this week. Starmer develops the attack on the Conservative\u2019s approach to green energy, accusing them of just adopting a \u201csticking plaster\u201d approach. He says: I\u2019ll give an example: \u201cGreen crap.\u201d That\u2019s what they said \u2013 \u201ccut the green crap\u201d. And so they scrapped investment in home insulation, stalled nuclear energy, banned onshore wind. The result? When the crisis hit last year and when Russia invaded Ukraine, not only did the bills of businesses and working people go through the roof, we had to borrow \u00a340bn with no new infrastructure to show for it. That\u2019s not green crap, that\u2019s Tory crap! \u201cGreen crap\u2019\u201d was the phrase attributed to David Cameron, who reportedly used it to dismiss green policies. Starmer says that the UK can be a world leader on green energy, but the government has to be proactively supporting the industry. We have tremendous advantages here: our coast, our shallow waters, our universities, our creativity, the depth of our skills, the graft of our people, the superpower sciences, the technological edge, and yes \u2013 if you can believe it, even our weather. Financial strength here in Edinburgh and yes, in the City of London too, but nonetheless the world leader for green finance which is a massive advantage for all of us. Seriously \u2013 there are no grounds for the defeatism which says we can\u2019t lead the world on this. That our prospects will always be squeezed out by the US and the EU is declinist nonsense. But at the same time, we\u2019ve got to get moving. At the moment we\u2019re standing on the side-lines, wringing our hands and falling behind because our government talks about economic stability yet understands nothing of what this requires in times like ours. When the winds of change are blowing this fiercely, you need a government that gets involved and intervenes, on behalf of working people, to secure stability and growth. Drift equals chaos. This is about Tory ideology, of course it is. Their impulses are totally out of step with the challenges of the modern world. They still cleave to the set of ideas that came out of the 1980s: the dismissal of industrial strategy, the contempt for active government, and a complacency that says only the market decides which industries matter for working people and national security. Starmer says he understands the concern felt by people working in the oil and gas industry about the transition to a green energy future. But he says it would be a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d to delay. He says: I know the ghosts industrial change unearths. As a young lawyer, I worked with mining communities to challenge the Tories\u2019 pit closure programme but deep down, we all know this has to happen eventually and that the only question is when. So in all candour, the reality is this, the moment for decisive action is now. If we wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out, the opportunities this change can bring for Scotland and your community will pass us by, and that would be a historic mistake. An error, for the future of Scotland, as big as the Thatcher government closing the coal mines, while frittering away the opportunity of the North Sea. My offer, the Labour offer, is this; a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs. No cliff edges. At the Labour event Keir Starmer is now speaking. He starts with a jibe at the SNP, saying the tide is turning in Scotland. Turning to energy policy, he says Labour wants to promote security. People want to know if the UK is still a great nation, he says. Can we still achieve great things? Can we unite and move forward? Can we still change, can we grow, can we get things done, can we build things? New industries, new technologies, new jobs; will they come to our shores, or will the future pass us by? You can put it even more starkly. Around the world people want to know, are we still a great nation? If the question is about the British people, the answer is emphatically: yes. But if it\u2019s about British politics \u2013 I don\u2019t even need to answer that, do I? This is what we\u2019re taking on, the Labour offer at the next election: a new government and a new way of governing, a plan for change, a plan to use clean power to build a new Britain, a plan to get our future back and say, to those who doubt we can still be great: we are, we can, and we will. As the BBC\u2019s David Wallace Lockhart reports, Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has been holding a news conference marking the publication of a paper on the SNP\u2019s plans for a written constitution for an independent Scotland. There is a summary on the SNP\u2019s website. And here is the full 62-page paper. Yousaf said: Independence would give Scotland the ability to continue its progressive approach to human rights and equality, without the current restrictions of the devolution settlement and without the threat of Westminster overruling our decisions or unwinding our advances. This would ensure that our human rights and equality protections could cover all policy areas, including those currently reserved to the Westminster parliament. In Edinburgh there is a high-powered turnout for the Keir Starmer energy speech. Two members of the shadow cabinet, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, have already delivered warm-up speeches, and Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, is now doing his bit too. Starmer will be up soon. David Warburton has formally quit as an MP after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use, PA Media reports. PA says: The decision means Rishi Sunak faces another potentially difficult byelection in the Somerton and Frome seat vacated by the former Tory MP. Warburton\u2019s exit from the Commons was confirmed by the Treasury following his appointment as steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead \u2013 one of the procedural routes for an MP to quit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Warburton admitted to taking cocaine after drinking \u201ctons of incredibly potent\u201d Japanese whiskey, but denied claims he harassed a female political aide in his Westminster flat. When he announced his resignation on Saturday, Warburton hit out at the investigation conducted by parliament\u2019s independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS), claiming he had been denied a fair hearing. The BBC\u2019s Iain Watson posted Warburton\u2019s resignation letter on Twitter at the weekend. As the Financial Times\u2019s Stephen Bush has argued, the Liberal Democrats are in a very good position to win the seat, which Warburton won for the Tories in 2019 with a majority of 19,213. Keir Starmer is about to deliver his speech on Labour\u2019s green energy mission in Edinburgh. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. The contents of the speech have been trailed by the party in some detail overnight. Fiona Harvey and Severin Carrell have a summary here. Readers have been asking about the vote in the Commons later on the privileges committee reporter. Several people have raised this question, or versions of it. If the Conservatives are trying to push through the report with a nod, could of the opposition parties interject to cause a division and force reluctant MPs to vote? Is there any precedent for an opposition to a motion you support, just to force a vote to embarrass another party? Yes, they could, and yes, it happens quite often. There is more about this issue here. Another person asked: I wonder if you could write a few words on what is/are (if any) the downside(s) of the Partygate motion going through on the nod? I\u2019m sure I heard there are some, but can\u2019t recall what! The motion, \u201cThat this house approves the fifth report from the committee of privileges\u201d, can pass either on the nod, or as the result of a division. There would be no impact on the practical effects of the vote, which are very limited anyway (amounting to no more than Boris Johnson losing his ex-MP\u2019s pass to the Commons). A motion passed on the nod is arguable more authoritative. You cannot say it has been passed unanimously, because most MPs won\u2019t be in the chamber, and won\u2019t express a view when the speaker asks MPs to approve the motion by acclamation (\u201call those in favour say aye\u201d etc). But if no MP shouts no, you can say it has been passed without opposition. But if there is a division, people will be able to find out who voted in favour and who voted against. They won\u2019t, however, be able to find out who has deliberately chosen to abstain. The list of MPs who do not vote gets published when there is a division, but no distinction is made between people deliberately abstaining, and people who have another reason for missing the vote. Keir Starmer also told the Today programme that, as PM, he would be willing to block Rishi Sunak\u2019s resignation honours list if he thought it included questionable names. After Starmer told the programme that Sunak should have blocked Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours (see 9.32am), the presenter, Mishal Husain, put it to Starmer that, in rubber-stamping the list, Sunak was just following precedent. She asked Starmer if he would be willing to intervene if he had an issue with names on Sunak\u2019s resignation honours list. Starmer replied: Yes. I think that what Rishi Sunak did was wrong. Starmer also said, if he were PM, he would not have a resignation honours list himself. Asked about the prospect, he replied: There are other opportunities [to reward people] but Tony Blair didn\u2019t have a resignation list. It is very hard to justify. If it was reserved for people who had given incredible service \u2013 perhaps picking out people who had been involved in the development of the vaccine or some other real element of public service \u2013 but it is very hard to see how it is justified. There are other avenues for that and I think it is easier to be clean about this and say no, I wouldn\u2019t do it. Tony Blair didn\u2019t do it and I wouldn\u2019t do it. Keir Starmer argued this morning the release of a video showing Tory activists, including one given an OBE in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list, partying during lockdown was an example of why Rishi Sunak was wrong to approve it. Sunak has defended waving through the resignation honours, saying in not seeking to remove any names he was just following precedent. But Starmer told the Today programme this morning that Johnson\u2019s reputation was so tainted that Sunak would have been justified in blocking his list. He said: Everybody knew that the privileges committee was about to report on the behaviour of the former prime minister. Why on earth didn\u2019t Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, take the provisional list from Boris Johnson and say \u2018Thank you very much, I will put that on one side and I\u2019ll come to it and look at it when I know the findings of the privileges committee\u2019? Because whatever the previous conventions, we\u2019ve never had a situation like this where a previous prime minister has been found to have lied to parliament, not once but repeatedly. He has now pretty well been stripped of any involvement in parliament. That is unprecedented. Why on earth didn\u2019t Rishi Sunak say \u2018I\u2019ll put your list on one side, former prime minister. I will get to it but I am determined to see the findings of the privileges committee before I do so. Because if, for example, the privileges committee says you lied to parliament, then I\u2019m not going to put your list through\u2019. Ben Mallet, who got an OBE in the honours list, is featured in the video obtained by the Mirror. He was at a party also attended by Shaun Bailey, the Tory candidate for London mayor in 2020. Bailey was made a peer in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours, but he left the party before the video was recorded. Starmer made his point about why Sunak should have blocked the list after being asked if it was possible Mallet and Bailey could have their honours withdrawn. Starmer told Today that he was not sure that was possible. But Josiah Mortimer from Byline Times says that in fact it could be done. Rishi Sunak has ruled out extra help for homeowners struggling to pay soaring mortgage costs, as the average two-year fixed-rate loan rose above 6%, Alex Lawson reports. Good morning. This afternoon MPs will be debating a report saying that Boris Johnson lied to parliament about Partygate (\u201cdeliberately misled\u201d is the way the report puts it, but it means the same thing), and that by doing so, and by attacking the subsequent inquiry, he committed serious and multiple contempts of parliament. There is no precedent for a parliamentary inquiry saying this as about former prime minister, and so you might expect the current prime minister to have a view on a conclusion this momentous. But Rishi Sunak is not taking sides. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain broadcast this morning, he said that he respected the work done by the committee. This committee was established under the former prime minister. It commanded the confidence of the house at the time and I\u2019m sure that they have done their work thoroughly and I respect them for that. But he said he would not be saying whether he backed the privileges committee\u2019s report, and its recommendations, because this was a Commons matter, not a government matter, and he did not want to \u201cinfluence\u201d MPs. He said: This is a matter for the house rather than the government, that\u2019s an important distinction and that is why I wouldn\u2019t want to influence anyone in advance of that vote. It will be up to each and every individual MP to make a decision of what they want to do when the time comes, it\u2019s important the government doesn\u2019t get involved in that because it is a matter for parliament and members as individuals, not as members as government. Given that the whole point of becoming PM is to \u201cinfluence\u201d how MPs vote, this may be another constitutional first. But Sunak is clearly worried about antagonising Johnson\u2019s small but vocal and toxic band of supporters in the party, and their more powerful allies in the Tory media. Downing Street has not said whether Sunak will be in the Commons for the debate later. The Swedish government is reporting that Sunak is meeting Ulf Kristersson, the Swedish PM, in London later today, and so he may have a good excuse not to be there. MPs are expected to approve a motion saying they approve the privileges committee\u2019s report but, with Johnson urging his supporters not to vote against, it could well go through on the nod. This morning Keir Starmer said Sunak should \u201cshow leadership\u201d and back the report. Asked if he thought Sunak should vote in favour of it, Starmer told Good Morning Britain: Yes, I do. We need to know where Rishi Sunak stands on this. He should show leadership, come along, get in the lobby and show us where he stands on this. Starmer has been doing a series of interviews this morning, ahead of a speech later. I will post more from them shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Liz Truss, the former PM, speaks at the Xchange conference in Dublin. 10am: Keir Starmer gives a speech in Edinburgh on Labour\u2019s green energy mission. 10am: Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s first minister, holds a press conference. He is publishing a paper on the SNP\u2019s plans for an independent Scotland to have a written constitution. 11am: David Cameron, the former PM, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 3.30pm: MPs debate the privileges committee report saying Boris Johnson deliberately misled the Commons about Partygate. They are expected to approve a motion tabled by Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, saying \u201cthis house approves the fifth report from the committee of privileges\u201d. In theory the debate could run until 10pm, but it is expected to wrap early evening. If you want to contact me, do try the \u201csend us a message\u201d feature.

Republic of Ireland v Gibraltar England v North Macedonia Turkey v Wales Northern Ireland v Kazakhstan France v Greece Three games have been completed already this evening with Armenia proving their victory over Wales was no one hit wonder. They\u2019ve just edged Latvia 2-1 to move ahead of Croatia into second place in Group D. Poor old San Marino got stuffed 6-0 by Finland to leave them winless at the bottom of Group H having conceded 13 goals in four games. The Finns are top now with three wins from four. Elsewhere, Ukraine squeezed past Malta 1-0 in England\u2019s group. Armenia 2-1 Latvia Finland 6-0 San Marino Ukraine 1-0 Malta And here\u2019s Turkey: Gunok, Celik, Demiral, Ozcan, Kokcu, Akturkoglou, Kadioglu, Under, Bardakci, Calhanoglu, Yilmaz. Subs: Sengezer, Cakir, Akaydin, Kahveci, Nayir, Elmali, Kabak, Yuksek, Ucan, Karaman, Guler, Ozkacar Only the most cynical Wales fans would have predicted the 4-2 reverse to Armenia and now a statement is needed against a handy Turkish side. Kieffer Moore is absent after being sent off on Friday and Ben Davies has stayed at home for the birth of his first child. That means Neco Williams slots in at left back with Joe Morrell joining the starting XI. Wales: Ward, N. Williams, C. Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Ampadu, Morrell, Ramsey, Johnson, D. James, Wilson. Subs: Hennessey, A. Davies, Fox, Low, Brooks, Harris, Cooper, James, Cabango, Bradshaw, Cullen, Broadhead.

Hello folks and welcome to today\u2019s Clockwatch. We\u2019ve got a bunch of Euro qualifiers on the go with England, Wales and Northern Ireland all in action. My focus will be on Wales and Northern Ireland and both teams are in desperate need of a lift this evening. Wales were dismal against Albania on Friday, going down 4-2 after taking an early 1-0 lead against a team ranked 71 places below them. What\u2019s more, they ended the chaotic contest with 10 men after Kieffer Moore was shown his marching orders and their manager, Robert Page, will want a statement performance away to Turkey. So too will Northern Ireland boss, Michael O\u2019Niell, whose team succumbed to their second successive 1-0 reverse to a Scandinavian side when they went down to Denmark three nights ago. It doesn\u2019t get any easier as they host a Kazakhstan team that edged the Danes 3-2 last month. That all means that both teams are facing a stiff challenge to qualify for the continental showpiece in Germany next year. Wales are fourth in their group and Northern Ireland are fifth. Three points tonight is essential for both sides. My name is Daniel and I\u2019ll keep you company throughout.

Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s main news: Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said that Russia had concentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault troops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d. The British government announced plans to tighten its sanctions policy against Russia, including introducing legislation to keep assets frozen until Moscow has agreed to pay compensation to Ukraine. The new measures will require any individual who has been designated under the sanctions to disclose assets held in Britain. In a phone call on Monday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d, Downing Street said. Nato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, confirmed on Monday. The Kremlin reportedly said on Monday that Russia\u2019s decision to decline UN help in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by security concerns and \u201cother nuances\u201d. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee, which is supported by security experts, said the country\u2019s defence must adapt to focus on the threat posed by Russia, and that a military attack could not be ruled out. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has announced that the capture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia, brought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113 sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. France, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia and Hungary signed a letter of intent for the joint purchase of Mistral air defence systems, a source told Reuters. The source said the letter was signed at the start of a defence ministers\u2019 meeting in Paris aimed at coordinating European efforts to enhance air defence capabilities across the continent after Russia invaded Ukraine. Germany\u2019s armed forces only have about 20,000 high explosive artillery shells left, the magazine Der Spiegel reported on Monday, citing confidential defence ministry papers. Countries like Germany have rushed to send supplies of 155m artillery rounds used by howitzers to Ukraine after its invasion by Russia last February, running down stocks for their own defence. Germany\u2019s military needs to build up an inventory of 230,000 shells by 2031 to comply with Nato goals to have enough artillery to withstand 30 days of intensive combat, Reuters cited Der Spiegel as reporting. The ministry aims to present the budget committee with nine contracts for the accelerated purchase of artillery and tank ammunition in coming months, Der Spiegel wrote. Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, has told the Kyiv Independent that the EU and its partners want to bring all perpetrators of international crimes to justice. \u201cNot only war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but also the crime of aggression,\u201d he said, adding that his team was considering what an international trial against Russian crimes in Ukraine may look like. Russia has committed wide-ranging war crimes in Ukraine such as wilful killings and torture, a UN mandated investigative body said in March. The alleged crimes, including the deportation of children, were detailed in a report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which said some acts may amount to crimes against humanity. On Monday, Alexei Navalny\u2019s team announced the launch of a campaign to deter Russians from supporting the war in Ukraine, AFP reports. In a post online, Navalny\u2019s team said it was planning a \u201clong, stubborn and exhaustive but fundamentally important campaign where we will turn people against the war\u201d. \u201cAgainst the dead-end that Putin crazily and dumbly put us in on 24 February 2022,\u201d it said, referring to the day Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine. It said it planned to fundamentally change Russian public opinion within months. Russia has introduced strict laws banning criticism of its army\u2019s actions in Ukraine. Organisations and lawyers that have campaigned for Russians critical of the offensive have faced increasing pressure. On Monday, Russian state media reported that Agora, a leading human rights group that provides legal help in political cases, was labelled as \u201cundesirable\u201d. You can read the full story (which relates to the blog post at 16:40) here: An EU report will this week say that Ukraine has met two out of seven conditions to start membership negotiations, two EU sources said. In a highly symbolic move, the EU granted Ukraine formal membership candidate status a year ago \u2013 four months after Russia attacked the country amid its efforts to pursue integration with the west. But the EU set seven conditions \u2013 including on judicial reform and curbing endemic corruption \u2013 to launch accession negotiations. Ukraine has called for talks to start this year. The executive European Commission\u2019s report is a milestone in that process. Two senior EU officials who were briefed on the report, which has not been made public, have now said that Ukraine met two of the criteria, Reuters reports. One of the officials said these related to judicial reform and media law. Russian troops hit the Beryslav district in the southern Kherson region with artillery on Monday, injuring three civilians, the regional administration wrote on Telegram, according to the Kyiv Independent. At least five residential buildings, two private residences and an administrative building were said to have been damaged in the attack. These claims could not be immediately independently verified. Russian politician Alexei Navalny announced the start of a new mass campaign against Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine on Monday as he began his latest trial in prison, facing a potential sentence of several more decades behind bars. Reuters reports: Navalny, 47, is already serving sentences totalling 11\u00bd years, and is now facing an array of charges linked to alleged \u201cextremist\u201d activity. Acquittals of opposition figures are practically unheard of in Russia. Journalists who had travelled to the penal colony where Navalny is imprisoned in Melekhovo, about 145 miles east of Moscow, were barred from the courtroom but could initially follow proceedings by video from a room nearby, though the sound was barely audible. Navalny, looking thin with cropped hair and dressed in a black prison uniform, stood and spoke loudly for three minutes. He unsuccessfully demanded access to the courtroom for his elderly parents, and contested the authority of the judge from Moscow to try him in a prison far from the capital. But the feed was later cut, and a court spokesperson said further proceedings would take place behind closed doors \u2026 Navalny\u2019s supporters accuse Moscow of trying to break him in jail, where he has had long spells in solitary confinement, to silence his criticism of Putin. The Kremlin says his case is purely a judicial matter. \u201cWe are not following this trial,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. Ukraine is seeking up to $40bn (\u00a331.2bn) to fund the first part of a \u201cGreen Marshall plan\u201d to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry, a senior Ukrainian official said before an international summit. Politicians and financiers will discuss short-term funding issues and look at long-term reconstruction efforts at the two-day meeting, starting in London on Wednesday and co-hosted by Ukraine and Britain, Reuters reports. It is expected to launch a \u201cwar risk\u201d insurance scheme to cover companies that begin investing in Ukraine again. Russia has deployed more forces to Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontline in an effort to advance toward Lyman and Kupiansk and seize the initiative, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, was mentioned by the Kyiv Independent as reportedly saying. The UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. Rishi Sunak told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d when the two leaders spoke on Monday morning. Nato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, confirmed on Monday. The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia\u2019s decision to decline UN help in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by security concerns and \u201cother nuances\u201d, Reuters reported. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee has said the Nordic country\u2019s defence must focus on the threat posed by Russia, and that a military attack could not be ruled out. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has confirmed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just tweeted about his phone call with Ajay Banga, the president of the World Bank, on Monday. Ukraine\u2019s president said he thanked the World Bank for its \u201cunwavering support\u201d shown to his country since Russia invaded last February, noting its \u201crapid response\u201d to the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam. He added: I invited the World Bank to reopen its representative office in Ukraine and emphasised that we are interested in cooperation during the post-war transformation of Ukraine, in particular, in overcoming corruption and reducing the share of cash in the Ukrainian economy. Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister has said that even if a deal allowing shipments of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea ends, Russia\u2019s agreement with the UN to ease its own exports will stay in force, the Russian state news agency RIA reported on Monday. Moscow has repeatedly said it sees little chance of agreeing an extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 18 July, because it says western sanctions are thwarting its own UN-backed attempts to export grain and fertiliser. Reuters reports that when asked by RIA if the collapse of the grain deal would invalidate its memorandum with the UN, Alexander Grushko, the deputy foreign minister, said: \u201cNo, it will not.\u201d After invading Ukraine, a leading grain exporter, last year, Russia blockaded its Black Sea ports, contributing to a global surge in food prices. To help persuade Russia to allow grain ships safe passage under the Black Sea initiative last July, a separate three-year agreement was also struck in which the UN agreed to help Russia with its food and fertiliser exports. But Moscow has repeatedly complained that western sanctions imposed in response to the invasion continue to create financial, logistical and insurance obstacles to its shipments. Here are some of the latest pictures on the newswires from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. During a call with Rishi Sunak on Monday, Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission president, spoke about continuing financial support for Ukraine after 2023, among other topics. They also discussed efforts to galvanise international support for Ukraine and drive long-term public and private investment, Downing Street said. Kyiv has accused Hungary of barring access to eleven Ukrainian prisoners of war that Russia handed over to the EU country, AFP reports. The Russian Orthodox church said earlier this month that a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war of Hungarian origin had been transferred to Budapest. The prisoners are of Transcarpathian origin \u2013 a region in western Ukraine bordering Hungary \u2013 where about 100,000 ethnic Hungarians live. On Monday, Kyiv said Ukrainian officials had not been able to get access to the returned detainees. \u201cAll attempts by Ukrainian diplomats over the past few days to establish direct contact with Ukrainian citizens have not been successful,\u201d Oleg Nikolenko, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cEssentially they are being kept in isolation,\u201d he said. They communicated with relatives in the presence of third parties and were denied contact with the Ukrainian embassy, Nikolenko added. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister has described the situation in the east of the country as \u201cdifficult\u201d, saying that Russia has not given up its ambition to occupy the whole of the Donbas, and that is where it is concentrating its offensive forces. In a post on Telegram, Hanna Maliar wrote: The situation in the east is now difficult. The enemy has raised its forces and is conducting an active offensive in the Lyman and Kupyan directions, trying to seize the initiative from us. High activity of enemy shelling is recorded. Intense battles continue. The enemy does not abandon his plans to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Currently, this is the enemy\u2019s main offensive line. Therefore, it has concentrated a significant number of units in the east, in particular the airborne assault units. Our troops act courageously in the face of the enemy\u2019s superiority in forces and means, and do not allow the enemy to advance. In Moldova, which borders Ukraine, the pro-Russian Shor party that has led months of protests has been banned today by the constitutional court. The court declared the party led by Ilan Shor, who lives in Israel, unconstitutional. Its decision triggered an immediate ban and the justice ministry will set up a special commission to complete all legal procedures for the party\u2019s dissolution. At times, Moldova has accused Russian missiles destined for Ukraine of overflying its territory. Russia has troops stationed in the breakaway Transnistria region which is sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine. Rueters reports Shor did not immediately comment on the court\u2019s decision, under which lawmakers from the party will retain their parliamentary mandates as independents, without the right to join other factions in the assembly. The party\u2019s vice-chairman, Marina Tauber, had condemned the court proceedings before the ruling. Since last summer, the party has organised protests in the capital Chi\u015fin\u0103u at which demonstrators called for the resignation of the president, Maia Sandu, and her pro-western government. Sandu has accused Shor of attempting to destabilise Moldova. Shor has denied that the protests are part of a Russian threat. Ukraine will not be formally invited to join Nato at the forthcoming Vilnius summit [See 11.58 BST], but Sweden is hoping to be a full member by the time the 11-12 July gathering is held. Reuters reports that Sweden\u2019s defence minister has said his country is \u201cvery determined\u201d to be admitted to the alliance. P\u00e5l Jonson said: \u201cWe are very determined to become a full-fledged member of the alliance as soon as possible and by Vilnius at the latest. That\u2019s our objective.\u201d Objections from Turkey and Hungary have held up the process of Sweden becoming a member. The US defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin has said it stands ready to help Ukrainian pilots fly and maintain its F-16 fighter jets if Nato states agree to send them to help the country against Russian aggression, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Frank St John. \u201cWe are standing by, ready to not only backfill need as it arises with new F-16 builds but also any modifications to F-16s as well as training, equipment and systems,\u201d he said. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in Beijing that China had renewed promises not to send arms to Russia to fight in Ukraine, although he voiced concern at the actions of private Chinese firms, AFP reports. On Monday, Blinken told reporters: We \u2013 and other countries \u2013 have received assurances from China that it is not and will not provide lethal assistance to Russia for use in Ukraine. We have not seen any evidence that contradicts that. What we do have ongoing concerns about, though, are Chinese firms \u2013 companies \u2013 that may be providing technology that Russia can use to advance its aggression in Ukraine. \u201cWe have asked the Chinese government to be very vigilant about that,\u201d he added. Blinken said, after two days of talks, that China had offered assurances on Russia in \u201crecent weeks\u201d and not exclusively during his visit. The UK government is taking powers to maintain its sanctions on Russia until compensation is paid to Ukraine. The new legislation, announced by foreign secretary, James Cleverly, means that sovereign assets will remain immobilised until Russia pays for damage it has caused to Ukraine. The package of measures enables the government to keep sanctions in place by altering the purposes of the UK\u2019s sanctions on Russia. It will now say that sanctions can also be used for the specific purpose of promoting the payment of compensation by Russia. Cleverly said: As Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, the terrible impacts of Putin\u2019s war are clear. Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction needs are \u2013 and will be \u2013 immense. Through our new measures today, we\u2019re strengthening the UK\u2019s sanctions approach, affirming that the UK is prepared to use sanctions to ensure Russia pays to repair the country it has so recklessly attacked. Since the invasion of Ukraine last year, Britain has frozen more than \u00a318bn in assets and sanctioned over 1,550 Russian individuals including Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea Football Club. The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia would continue to talk to a group of African countries seeking to mediate in the conflict with Ukraine, and that some of their ideas were workable, Reuters reports. Vladimir Putin on Saturday gave the seven-country African delegation that had come to see him in St Petersburg a list of reasons why he believed many of their proposals were misguided, pouring cold water on a plan already largely dismissed by Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that talks with the delegation would, nonetheless, continue as some of its suggestions could in theory be implemented. He did not say which proposals he was referring to. With Kyiv and Moscow courting the global south, some African leaders have seen a chance to mediate in a war that has hit African countries by disrupting grain and other food supplies and aggravating price inflation. Nato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, confirmed on Monday. \u201cAt the Vilnius summit and in the preparations for the summit, we are not discussing to issue a formal invitation,\u201d he told reporters after meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, adding leaders would talk about how to move Ukraine closer to the alliance. At the same time, Stoltenberg warned against accepting a frozen conflict in Ukraine in return for an end to the war. All sides have long accepted that Ukraine cannot become a Nato member in the middle of a war but Kyiv, backed by Baltic states and Poland, would like a date or a timeline by which it could join once the conflict ends. Scholz, meanwhile, said that Germanywas prepared for the possibility that the war in Ukraine could still last for a while. \u201cWe are preparing for that and adjusting our policies based on that,\u201d he told the news conference, adding that Germany would continue to support Ukraine for as long as necessary. Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, as Kyiv celebrated the liberation of an eighth settlement in the south of the country, two weeks into its offensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 troops. The progress of Ukraine\u2019s forces in both the east and south of the country has been slow with much of the heavy western weaponry and new brigades yet to be committed to battle. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar announced that the capture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia, brought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113 sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. You can read more from my colleague Daniel Boffey on this story below: Rishi Sunak told Volodymyr Zelenskiy it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d when the two leaders spoke this morning on the phone, PA Media reports. Both men will speak at a conference in London this week on Ukraine\u2019s recovery. A Downing Street spokesman said Sunak \u201cpaid tribute to the bravery of the Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline\u201d. \u201cHe told President Zelenskiy that the UK was firmly behind Ukraine as it continued to push back invading Russian forces,\u201dhe added. The Ukrainian president tweeted to say that he had discussed steps to prepare for security guarantees for Ukraine during the phone conversation (See post at 10:24). Nearly 7,000 Ukrainians have been married in \u201cdistance\u201d ceremonies since the Russian invasion of their country, following a change to civil ceremony rules, the Kyiv Post reports. In 2022, rules were simplified to allow military personnel to be able to marry or register their partnership by distance, meaning one of the partners did not have to be physically present during the ceremony for it be valid. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee has said the country\u2019s defence must focus on the threat posed by Russia and a military attack could not be ruled out, Reuters reports. The Nordic nation has been scrambling to bolster its defences, having applied to join Nato last year as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, though Turkey and Hungary have so far held up Swedish entry into the Western alliance. The committee said the war in Ukraine could escalate into attacks on other countries or even the use of nuclear weapons. In the report, the all-party committee, which includes security experts, said: Russia\u2019s aggressive actions have led to a structural and greatly deteriorated security situation. Russia has further lowered its threshold for military use of force and exhibits a high risk propensity. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I\u2019ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. The UN has accused Moscow of continuing to block humanitarian aid deliveries to Russian-occupied areas in eastern Ukraine that have been affected by the recent Kakhovka dam rupture. \u201cWe urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. Aid cannot be denied to people who need it,\u201d the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement. Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to bring down the dam, according to exclusive drone photos and information obtained by the Associated Press newswire. Images taken from above the dam appeared to show an explosive-laden car atop the structure, and two officials said Russian troops were stationed in a crucial area inside the dam where the Ukrainians say the explosion that destroyed it was centred, AP reported. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has confirmed. The Russian military has \u201chighly likely\u201d started relocating troops from the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has reported that minor damage was sustained in the village of Balki after cross-border shelling from Ukraine. He reported no casualties. Russia\u2019s FSB security service said on Monday it had thwarted a series of Ukrainian \u201csabotage and terrorist plots\u201d targeting Russian-installed officials in Russian occupied territory in Ukraine, and had arrested one woman as part of its investigation. US secretary of state Antony Blinken met Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. It was the first time a US secretary of state has met the Chinese leader since 2018. All of the Patriot air and missile defence systems provided by the US to Ukraine in April are still working, contrary to claims by Russia, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. The Kremlin has responded to UN claims that Moscow was blocking aid being provided to flooded areas of Ukraine which Russia occupies in Kherson. Reuters reports it said the decision was motivated by security concerns for UN workers and \u201cother nuances\u201d. Tass quotes Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that from the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the Dnipro \u201cconstant shelling is going on, constant provocations, civilian objects are being shelled, people and the population are being shelled, people are dying, so it\u2019s all very difficult here \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to ensure their safety.\u201d Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence claims that overnight the air force shot down four Kalibr cruise missiles and four \u201cShahed\u201d drones. The claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that he has spoken to Rishi Sunak. Ukraine\u2019s prime minister posted to his social media channels to say that in a call to the British prime minister, they \u201cdiscussed the defence needs of Ukraine and our further cooperation to expand Ukraine\u2019s capabilities on the battlefield, in particular through long-range weapons.\u201d Zelenskiy went on to say: We have coordinated our positions on the eve of the Nato summit in Vilnius. It is important to provide Ukraine with concrete membership prospects. We also discussed steps to implement the peace formula and prepare security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia is ramping up production of missiles with western components. During the conversation, I emphasised the need to increase sanctions pressure. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Monday, Reuters reports. It will be the first time a US secretary of state has met the Chinese leader since 2018, and it could help to facilitate a summit between Xi and US President Joe Biden later in the year. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, citing the regional authority, reports that Kherson and four other settlements remain submerged on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro, and almost 850 houses are still under water. This is a video which purports to show Ukrainian forces in control of Piatykhatky, the eighth southeastern village that Kyiv says it has liberated in the last fortnight. \u201cToday, 18 June, the forces of 128 assault brigade chased out the Russians from the village of Piatykhatky. The Russians ran away leaving equipment and ammunition. Glory to Ukraine!\u201d an unidentified soldier says in the video, Reuters reports. The Guardian has not independently verified the location and time the video was made. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. The regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote: \u201cThe Valuisk municipal district is under attack from from Ukrainian forces. According to preliminary information, seven people were wounded, among them a child.\u201d Gladkov reported that minor damage was sustained in the village of Balki after cross-border shelling from Ukraine. He reported no casualties. These claims could not be immediately independently verified. Ukrainian officials and advisers have been sharing a video clip of the fire in Kherson after Russian shelling which has damaged buses and an emergency vehicle. Russia\u2019s FSB security service said on Monday it had thwarted a series of Ukrainian \u201csabotage and terrorist plots\u201d targeting Russian-installed officials in Russian occupied territory in Ukraine and had arrested one woman as part of its investigation. Reuters reports the FSB said in a statement that the attacks had targeted Russian law enforcement officials and Russian-installed government officials in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, one of four Ukrainian areas that Moscow has claimed to have annexed after staging what Ukraine termed \u201csham referenda\u201d last year. The FSB said it had opened criminal cases against an unnamed woman it described as \u201can accomplice\u201d on charges related to terrorism and the illegal possession of explosives. Reuters reports Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Monday its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to take the village of Novodonetske in the eastern Donetsk region. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne correspondents have reported they have heard explosions in Kherson. This is not an infrequent occurrence, as Russian forces on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro continue to shell Ukrainian held positions on the right bank, and vice versa. Here is a map outlining what we know of the Zaporizhzhia front. Deputy defence minister of Ukraine Hanna Maliar earlier confirmed that Ukraine had retaken the village of Piatykhatky on the western edge of it, the eighth settlement to return to Ukrainian hands in the past fortnight. Her statement confirmed claims about the village that were being reported yesteday by Russian military bloggers and Russian-installed officials in the region. She also said that the battle continues around Bakhmut, writing: In the east, the enemy made a lot of efforts to stop the advance of our troops in the direction of Bakhmut. The overall intensity of fighting in this direction decreased last week, but the fighting continued. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service has issued an image of firefighters battling a blaze in Kherson. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that \u201cAs a result of Russian shelling in Kherson, a gas tank at one of the city\u2019s gas stations and a company warehouse were on fire at night. Three units of equipment and 15 personnel of the state emergency service went to the scene of the fire.\u201d This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The Russian military has \u201chighly likely\u201d started relocating troops from the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. \u201cThe DGF [Dnipro Group of Forces] redeployment likely reflects Russia\u2019s perception that a major Ukrainian attack across the Dnipro is now less likely following the collapse of Kakhovka Dam and the resulting flooding,\u201d the MoD writes. All of the Patriot air and missile defence systems provided by the US to Ukraine in April are still working, contrary to claims by Russia, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. \u201cThey are still here, they are working, all of them are shooting down Russian missiles. As efficiently as possible. Not a single Patriot has been destroyed!\u201d Zelenskiy said. The comment appeared to be a response to remarks made by Russian president Vladimir Putin at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum last week in which he suggested Moscow had destroyed five Patriot systems near Kyiv. Zelenskiy also thanked \u201cour defenders of the sky\u201d, including Ukraine\u2019s pilots, saying they had launched \u201cmore than a hundred group air strikes on enemy positions and rear\u201d over the past week while almost three dozen missiles and about fifty attack drones had been destroyed. Eight settlements have been liberated over the past two weeks in Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive in the Berdyansk and Melitopol regions, including the village of Piatykhatky, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said in a Telegram post. A Russian blogger had reported the capture of the village on the western edge of the Zaporizhzhia front on Sunday after what he described as fierce fighting. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is set to go on trial on Monday on charges of \u201cextremism\u201d that could keep him behind bars for decades, AFP is reporting. The new case against the opposition leader comes as Moscow ramps up its crackdown, more than a year into its offensive in Ukraine, with most key opposition figures behind bars or in exile. Navalny, who used to mobilise massive anti-Kremlin protests, is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence on embezzlement charges that his supporters see as punishment for his political work. The 47-year-old was arrested in 2021 upon returning from Germany, where he recovered from a poison attack the previous year that he blamed on the Kremlin. He has suffered from major weight loss in prison, and now faces up to another 30 years behind bars. Navalny said that prosecutors provided him with 3,828 pages describing all the crimes he is alleged to have committed while in prison. \u201cAlthough it is clear from the size of the tomes that I am a sophisticated and persistent criminal, it is impossible to find out what exactly I am accused of,\u201d Navalny quipped. He has been charged with financing extremist activity, publicly inciting extremist activities and \u201crehabilitating the Nazi ideology\u201d, among other crimes. This will be the first formally political case against him, his team said. The trial will take place at the maximum security IK-6 penal colony at Melekhovo, about 250 kilometres (155 miles) east of Moscow, where Navalny is jailed. Wagner leader and regular Kremlin critic Yevgeny Prigozhin says 32,000 former prisoners have returned home after the end of their contracts with Wagner in Ukraine, AP has reported. According to Prigozhin, 83 crimes have been committed by those who had returned home, which he claimed was \u201c80 times less\u201d than the number committed by those released from prison over the same period without having served with Wagner. The early return of former prisoners to their communities has caused some controversy in Russia, as the Guardian\u2019s Pjotr Sauer reported in April, with at least two already accused of murder since their release: Ukrainian forces may be \u201ctemporarily pausing counteroffensive operations to reevaluate their tactics\u201d, the Institute for the Study of War says in its latest assessment of the conflict. It quoted the head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, Colonel Margo Grosberg, as saying on Friday that he believes \u201cwe won\u2019t see an offensive over the next seven days.\u201d The thinktank noted: \u201cOperational pauses are a common feature of major offensive undertakings, and this pause does not signify the end of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.\u201d It said Ukraine had \u201ccontinued counteroffensive actions on at least four sectors of the front\u201d on Sunday and \u201cmade limited territorial gains\u201d. Russia had the \u201cmeans, motive and opportunity\u201d to bring down the Kakhovka dam earlier this month, the Associated Press newswire has reported, citing access to exclusive photos and drone footage. It writes: In the days leading up to the single explosion, Ukrainian military drone videos showed dozens of Russian soldiers encamped on a bank of the Dnieper, relaxed as they walked back and forth to the dam with no cover \u2013 suggesting their confidence in their control of the area and especially the dam, which was strategically crucial. The photos, taken from Ukrainian drone footage, obtained by the AP and dated May 28, showed a car parked on the dam, its roof neatly cut open to reveal enormous barrels, one with what appears to be a land mine attached to the lid and a cable running toward the Russian-held side of the river. It\u2019s not clear how long the car remained. A Ukrainian special forces communications official, who also noted the car appeared to be rigged, said he believed the purpose of that was twofold: to stop any Ukrainian advance on the dam and to amplify the planned explosion originating in the machine room and destroy the top of the dam. The car bomb itself would not have been enough to bring down the dam. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve operational secrecy. The explosion detected at 2:54 a.m. local time [on 6 June] registered on Norwegian seismic monitors at nearly magnitude 2. By comparison, a catastrophic explosion at Beirut\u2019s port that killed scores of people and caused widespread destruction registered at a 3.3 on the seismic scale and involved at least 500 tons of explosives. \u201cThat means it\u2019s a significant explosion,\u201d said Anne Str\u00f8mmen Lycke, CEO of the Norwegian earthquake monitoring agency NORSAR. Within a few minutes, water from the Kakhovka reservoir began cascading through the shattered dam, submerging the river\u2019s sand bar islands and flooding much of southern Ukraine, including Russian-controlled territory. The UN has accused Russia of refusing to allow aid deliveries to Moscow-controlled areas affected by flooding following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam almost two weeks ago. \u201cThe government of the Russian Federation has so far declined our request to access the areas under its temporary military control,\u201d Denise Brown, the UN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement. \u201cThe UN will continue to engage to seek the necessary access. We urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. \u201cAid cannot be denied to people who need it.\u201d The statement comes as Ukrainian and Russian authorities said the death toll from the flooding had risen to 52. Russian officials said 35 people had died in Moscow-controlled areas and Ukraine\u2018s interior ministry said 17 had died and 31 were missing, Reuters reported. More than 11,000 have been evacuated on both sides. The collapse of the Moscow-controlled dam on 6 June unleashed floodwaters across southern Ukraine and Russia-occupied parts of the Kherson region, destroying homes and farmland, and cutting off supplies to residents. A team of international legal experts assisting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors in their investigation said it was \u201c highly likely\u201d the dam\u2019s collapse was caused by explosives planted by Russians. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. The UN has accused Moscow of continuing to block humanitarian aid deliveries to Russian-occupied areas in eastern Ukraine that have been affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam earlier this month. \u201cWe urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. Aid cannot be denied to people who need it,\u201d the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement. The death toll from flooding caused by the collapse of the dam has risen to 52, with authorities in Kyiv reporting 17 dead and 31 missing and Russian officials saying 35 people had died in Moscow-controlled areas. In other key developments: Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to bring down the dam, according to exclusive drone photos and information obtained by the Associated Press newswire. Images taken from above the dam appeared to show an explosive-laden car atop the structure, and two officials said Russian troops were stationed in a crucial area inside the dam where the Ukrainians say the explosion that destroyed it was centred, AP reported. The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the news agency. Ukraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, reports suggest. It would be the second gain in the area since Kyiv launched its counteroffensive earlier this month. A Russian-installed official said Ukrainian forces had taken the settlement and were entrenching themselves there while coming under fire from Russian artillery, Reuters reported. If confirmed, this is Ukraine\u2019s first village gain for nearly a week, and marks an apparent escalation of the offensive on the most direct route to Crimea. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed in its daily update its forces had repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks across three sections of the 1000-km-long frontline and made no mention of Piatykhatky, Reuters reports. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has praised Ukrainian forces for their \u201cvery effective\u201d repelling of enemy assaults near Avdiivka, one of the focal points of fighting in the east, in his nightly video address. The head of the military administration in Avdiivka, a mining town shattered by months of fighting, told national television that Ukrainian forces had advanced about one km (two-thirds of a mile) around the town over the past two weeks. The EU is speeding up arms deliveries to Ukraine to support the counteroffensive against Russian forces, the EU industry chief Thierry Breton told the French daily Le Parisien. He said the EU would be stepping up its efforts, pledging that 1m high-caliber weapons must be provided within the next year. The UK Ministry of Defence said heavy fighting continues to be focused in Zaporizhzhia oblast, western Donetsk oblast and around Bakhmut. It says both sides are taking high casualties, with Russian losses likely to be the highest since the peak of the battle for Bakhmut in March. It also noted that Russian defence operations had been \u201crelatively effective in the south\u201d. Ukrainian forces have destroyed an ammunition depot near the Russian-occupied port city of Henichesk, in the southern region of Kherson, a spokesperson for the Odesa military administration said on Sunday.

The RCN union\u2019s ballot on further industrial action in England will close on 23 June but its general secretary, Pat Cullen, has for the first time suggested an affirmative result is in doubt. Nurses have taken strike action three times since December but the RCN needs the support of its members at another ballot if it is continue to leverage further strikes in its pay negotiation. Under the 2016 trade union laws, at least 50% of union members must vote in a ballot for its result to stand \u2013 equivalent to more than 150,000 of the RCN\u2019s membership. Speaking to the Guardian during a visit to a hospital in Guildford, Surrey, Cullen said the union laws and the lack of online voting option could bring the nurses\u2019 strikes over pay and conditions to an end. She added: \u201cTalking to nurses today, it is clear that they are unhappy with how they\u2019re being treated and feel the NHS is on a precipice. After nurses said they needed better from government, they can vote again on whether to take more strike action until December. There are only a couple of days left to vote by post and it is starting to look like the government\u2019s rules on postal voting could get the better of us.\u201d Cullen, who is seeking a double-digit pay rise for nurses, said she believed the vote would indicate support for further strikes but the 50% voting threshold may not be reached. She said: \u201cNursing staff can still post their ballots back but unless 150,000 people get their votes sent back in the post then the strike has hit the end of the road. Secure online voting was used to select a new Conservative prime minister last year so it is clear they just want to make it harder for working people to have their voices heard. \u201cFor the rest of the week we\u2019ll be visiting hospitals and reminding people that if they want to keep the pressure on the government they have to think of the postbox like a ballot box.\u201d The first national strike in the history of the RCN took place in December, with the union arguing that the pay of some experienced nurses had fallen by 20% in real terms since the Conservative party came to power. The RCN had originally called for a 19% pay rise. Further strikes took place in January and February, and then again in April after the RCN membership rejected an improved offer of a 5% pay rise for 2023-24 and a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655. This was on top of the average 4.75% pay rise NHS staff had received in 2022-23. The offer was accepted by Unison, the GMB and Royal College of Midwives and others, leading the NHS staff council to accept it. The RCN and Unite, however, remain in dispute. Last week\u2019s three-day strike by junior doctors in England resulted in 108,602 outpatient appointments and operations being postponed, NHS England data revealed. That means a total of 651,232 procedures and consultations have been rescheduled as a result of stoppages by junior doctors, nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists since last December in pursuit of their campaigns for better pay. The number of junior doctors taking part in walkouts is falling, the figures also show. In their first strike in March a maximum of 29,243 joined in. However, in their second strike in April that number had fallen to 27,361. And during last week\u2019s stoppage that number had fallen again to 24,407. The British Medical Association\u2019s junior doctors committee has threatened to stage a three-day strike very month until they get the 35% pay rise they are seeking. It has started balloting members for a fresh legal mandate for another six months of strikes. In the latest RCN ballot the union is seeking a countrywide mandate, rather than at individual trust level. A vote in support would give the RCN a mandate to strike in every NHS trust or other NHS employer in England where members work. The next strikes would involve twice the number of nursing staff at twice as many locations. The results of the ballot are expected to be announced next week."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946bf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/partygate-met-police-assessing-footage-not-previously-provided", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Partygate: Met chief hints at new inquiry after \u2018jingle and mingle\u2019 video", "lead": "Sir Mark Rowley suggests force will investigate again after viewing video of party in December 2020", "author": "Vikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:52:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545553", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a3cbb0b5e567c7616fdd6b9483e81bb7133c9690/134_0_4776_2868/500.jpg", "body": "The Metropolitan police commissioner has effectively said that there will be a new inquiry into lockdown breaches in Westminster after a video from a Conservative Christmas party attracted the attention of detectives. Sir Mark Rowley was speaking after video emerged of a December 2020 party surfaced this weekend, sparking outrage. Britain\u2019s top officer, when asked if a new investigation would follow, told an interviewer: \u201cI think we can all guess which way it will go.\u201d The Metropolitan police believe the video counts as new material potentially relating to alleged breaches of Covid rules. The event was billed as a \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d party, and held in December 2020 for Shaun Bailey, then campaigning to be mayor of London, when indoor socialising was banned. Crucially the Met has said the footage was not discovered by an earlier investigation it held into that event, which uncovered a photo of the party. Rowley told the NewsAgents podcast: \u201cAs people know, that case has been previously looked at based on a photo. It\u2019s very obvious a video tells a much richer, clearer story than a photo. And so, the team are looking at that with a view to whether that provides a basis for further investigation.\u201d Rowley added: \u201cI think we can all see the colourful nature of the video and how much it tells a story way beyond the original photo. I need to let a team work through that but I think we can all guess which way it will go.\u201d During the \u201cjingle and mingle\u201d event, on video unearthed by the Mirror, one person can be heard saying that filming is all right \u201cas long as we don\u2019t stream that we\u2019re, like, bending the rules\u201d. The Met said on Monday it was \u201cassessing video footage that was not previously provided to officers when investigating an event in Matthew Parker Street on 14 December 2020\u201d. The Met is also looking at other material relating to further potential breaches involving the former prime minister Boris Johnson at Chequers, and was passed to police by the Cabinet Office as they prepared for the official inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of Covid. The Met said it was \u201cassessing material referred by the Cabinet Office to the Met and Thames Valley police regarding potential breaches of the regulations between June 2020 and May 2021 at Downing Street and Chequers\u201d. Responding to the allegations about potential Covid breaches at Chequers a spokesperson for Johnson said: \u201cThis was entirely lawful, and it was covered by relevant provisions in the Covid regulations. To suggest otherwise is totally untrue.\u201d The third event is alleged to involve Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who sat on the privileges committee inquiry that damned Johnson last week for misleading parliament about Downing Street lockdown parties. The Met said it was \u201cassessing a report to the Met on Thursday 15 June regarding media reporting of alleged breaches in parliament\u201d. An ally of Jenkin said it was a work event held by senior figures in the Women2Win network, which encourages more Tory women to stand for political office, and that he arrived to collect his wife. The force insisted its previous investigation into Westminster lockdown breaches was thorough, and as evidence of that said that it had issued 126 fixed-penalty notices against 83 individuals under Operation Hillman. It said any new investigation would need to be into \u201ca serious and flagrant breach, be proportionate and when those involved knew or ought to have known what they were doing was an offence\u201d. Other factors include where declining to investigate \u201cwould significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law\u201d and where \u201cthere was little ambiguity around the absence of a reasonable defence\u201d. The 14 December 2020 event was attended by Bailey, who was last week ennobled in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. The Conservatives say four people were disciplined over the event. A spokesperson for the Bailey campaign has said: \u201cThis is an old story. We repeatedly apologised for this event at the time. It was subject to a nearly year-long police investigation. The matter is closed.\u201d Last year the Met decided not to refer people at the party for fines after a photo emerged of it, believing it was not enough evidence to \u201cdisprove the version of events\u201d provided by attenders."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/dutch-study-reveals-extent-of-wealth-made-via-slavery-from-three-past-rulers-king-willem-alexander", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dutch study reveals extent of wealth made via slavery from three past rulers", "lead": "Report comes shortly before an expected apology from King Willem-Alexander in a speech in Amsterdam", "author": "Senay Boztas in Amsterdam", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:40:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545571", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e15bb74ff5e2a8ab7244fdbe6695dec67703eb09/818_1704_2944_1766/500.jpg", "body": "Inside the stables of Paleis Noordeinde in The Hague is a golden coach embellished with images of colonial offerings to Dutch rulers that many, including the current Dutch king, regard as a symbol of exploitation that according to a new study netted three Dutch rulers the equivalent of more than \u20ac545m (\u00a3465m). Historians have calculated the staggering value of colonial profit for Willem III (also king of England, Ireland and Scotland), Willem IV and Willem V in a report published at the request of the Dutch parliament last week before a widely expected apology over slavery from the Dutch king. The study, State and Slavery, is the first to quantify the financial value to the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau of colonial trade that included enslaving at least 600,000 African men, women and children and between 660,000 and 1 million people from Asia to be tortured, exploited and robbed of their freedom and their names. It is a legacy for which Willem-Alexander is expected to present a formal apology in Amsterdam\u2019s Oosterpark on 1 July, the festival of Keti Koti (breaking the chains), 150 years after Dutch slavery effectively ended. The \u20ac545m equivalent exceeded the money the rulers, known as Stadhouders, took as heads of the state and military. Between 1675 and 1770, William III netted 1,094,998 guilders between 1675 to 1701, in his share of profits from the Dutch East India company \u2013 the equivalent of \u20ac196m. Raymund Sch\u00fctz, researcher at the municipal archives in The Hague, discovered the figures about the Dutch Stadhouders, appointed regents, last year in a private archive of Gerard van Vredenburch. This important figure in the Dutch East India company was apparently hoarding and documenting secrets \u201clike poker cards\u201d, he said. \u201cIt was seen as something to be proud of,\u201d said Sch\u00fctz. \u201cIn some cases, they took enslaved people to the Netherlands to show off. It was a kind of conspicuous investment and consumption to show you were important, a kind of status symbol. These days, everybody is ashamed and it\u2019s hard to imagine how it was seen at the time. But the main thing was making money.\u201d Sch\u00fctz said that it is not yet known how much the Netherlands\u2019 rulers profited from slavery between 1621 and its abolition on July 1, 1863 (followed by 10 years of compulsory employment for the enslaved). The Dutch king has commissioned a three-year, independent study. Last year the UK\u2019s King Charles, then Prince of Wales, expressed \u201cthe depths of his personal sorrow\u201d about suffering caused by the British slave trade, and in 2021, Germany offered \u20ac1bn in recognition of colonial-era genocide in Namibia. Last December, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, apologised for the government\u2019s role and the \u201cappalling suffering\u201d to generations, announcing a \u20ac200m fund for awareness initiatives but no reparations or damages. A spokesperson for the Dutch royal household confirmed that King Willem-Alexander would make \u201ca speech\u201d at the Keti Koti celebrations in Amsterdam \u2013 something widely expected to be his own apology. Don Ceder, MP for the Christian Union and a lawyer, has played a major role in stimulating government recognition. \u201cI think that an apology from the king in his institutional role would [be of] enormous significance in the reconciliation process,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dutch royal family received a significant portion of her wealth through the slave trade \u2026 A sincere reflection upon that past could contribute to a shared future.\u201d Descendants of the enslaved believe that recognition of the profit and wrongs of the past are long overdue, according to Linda Nooitmeer, president of the National Institute of the Dutch Slavery Past and Legacy (NiNsee), whose surname means \u201cnever again\u201d. \u201cThe symbolic value of the king is so great that an apology is not just valued: it is self-evident,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2019, an investigation showed that 5% of Dutch GDP [in 1770] came from slavery. What the community thought, seems to be true.\u201d Roy Kaikusi Groenberg of the Honour and Recovery Foundation, a Dutch Afro-Surinamese organisation, was one among many that took the government to court last year to demand a careful apology. \u201cIt would mean that the king, in the name of the monarchy and the Dutch head of state, underlines a kind of recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a psychologist, but I think this apology will be the start of another era, that it will bring a kind of peace. The relatives of the victims of slavery are right now confronted with the consequences of that behaviour: racism, discrimination, being undervalued, Black Pete [a festive tradition in the Netherlands that sees people dressing up in blackface]. If people in the Netherlands truly realise what happened and what still needs to happen, I do not think they will lack the will.\u201d The golden coach may be retired until the Netherlands is a land of real equality, according to the king. But one way of achieving this is, in classic Dutch style, by sitting literally at a table. Across the country, organisations from the Rijksmuseum to police stations and town halls, have organised hundreds of \u201cKeti Koti Tafels\u201d where over a meal, different communities share personal stories about experiencing and tackling modern-day discrimination. \u201cThe aim is to bring people closer together,\u201d said a spokeswoman. \u201cWe want to increase awareness of the internal consequences of a slavery past, that sits in a collective archive of us all \u2026 black, white, and all colours in between, sharing personal experiences. We share a society, we are all people and we need to come together.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/darren-moore-leaves-sheffield-wednesday-manager-promotion", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Darren Moore leaves Sheffield Wednesday after winning promotion", "lead": "Darren Moore has left his job as manager of Sheffield Wednesday three weeks after winning promotion to the Championship in the playoff final", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:35:30", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545588", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0cd5a993f8e8636429c564125744d6a8ed0c9d88/0_80_3525_2115/500.jpg", "body": "Darren Moore has left his job as manager of Sheffield Wednesday three weeks after winning promotion to the Championship in the playoff final.

At Prada, the bellwether of where the fashion mood heads next, the co-designers Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons used the humble white shirt as a springboard for \u201ca reconsideration of simple things\u201d, said Prada after the show on Sunday. \u201cWe were aiming to have quite a refined silhouette as we know it in men\u2019s fashion \u2013 a 40s kind of construction that deals very much with the idealisation of the male body,\u201d said Simons.

Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Tod\u2019s, Giorgio Armani and Brioni all presented collections that eschewed the streetwear influences that had crept in of late. At the latter, the creative director, Norbert Stumpfl pointed to blazers that take months just for the fabric alone to be made. Despite its moniker, quiet luxury is designed to speak volumes. These are still clothes that can cost more than the average monthly payslip and they need to look it. \u201cIt\u2019s about extreme material integrity, and tailoring skills developed by true experts and products at a price point way above even mainstream luxury,\u201d said Lucie Greene, trend forecaster and founder of consultancy Light Years. \u201cIt\u2019s about the cashmere sweater that is just the right colour, with subtle detail, light-as-a-feather softness that no one except the wearer \u2013 or a stealth observer \u2013 would know and that costs several thousand pounds. It\u2019s the opposite of someone wearing a designer logo belt, or handbag.\u201d As well as Succession\u2019s influence, the roots of quiet fashion are linked to the consolidation of wealth in recent years, particularly during the pandemic where more money than ever has concentrated at the very top, says Greene. \u201cThis has seen a drive for ultra-high net worth groups to differentiate themselves from commodified obvious luxury by embracing quietness, discretion, privacy, and institutional wealth codes even more \u2013 the more if-you-know-you-know the better.\u201d It sets the scene, she continues, for brands to come up with ever more exclusive, but subtle ways to communicate wealth and takes care of unwanted optics. \u201cPart of it is tactical. In this climate of extreme inequality, being obviously outrageously wealthy has become distasteful and contentious in wider society, see the flood of \u2018eat-the-rich\u2019 narratives from The White Lotus to Triangle of Sadness.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/tory-mayor-resigns-after-apologising-for-attending-lgbtq-event", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tory mayor resigns after apologising for attending LGBTQ+ event", "lead": "Mohammed Nazam said the Pride event contradicted his \u2018personal religious beliefs\u2019 in Facebook group", "author": "Robyn Vinter North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:24:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545660", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4eaa9fa284630f263207ecd045d280aab4421cff/0_177_1310_786/500.jpg", "body": "A Conservative mayor has resigned after being labelled homophobic when he apologised for attending a council LGBTQ+ Pride event because it \u201ccontradicts\u201d his beliefs. Mohammed Nazam, the mayor of Keighley in West Yorkshire, faced anger after posting in a Facebook group that it was a \u201clapse of judgment\u201d to attend the raising of a progress flag on Friday as part of the town\u2019s Pride month celebrations. In the post, he said he \u201cwholeheartedly apologised\u201d for attending the ceremony as it \u201ccontradicts my personal religious beliefs\u201d. He added: \u201cI want to emphasise that I have also personally repented for this error and reflected deeply on the consequences of my actions.\u201d The post received a backlash from Keighley residents, who described the comments as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cunbelievable\u201d. On Monday, Nazam \u2013 who has been in the post less than a month \u2013 was suspended from the local Conservative party after a number of complaints, and resigned hours later. In a statement following his resignation, he said he had meant no harm to LGBTQ+ people but refused to back down, saying \u201call elected Muslim representatives\u201d would have needed to apologise to the Muslim community for attending such an event. He said: \u201cI attended the flag raising for LGBTQ community. This did not conform to my religious beliefs and hence I offered an apology to the Muslim community. All elected Muslim representatives would be in the same position. \u201cBy my apology I did not mean any harm to the LGBTQ community. My religion teaches respect and tolerance for all and the law of the land. \u201cHere in the UK we are proud to have our freedom of expression. People should have the freedom to express their beliefs and live their lives as they wish to. This should apply to all communities and religious beliefs.\u201d His initial comments were criticised as \u201cnot the most helpful action to heal the abuse\u201d that LGBTQ+ Muslims suffer. Ahead of his resignation, Helen Hallam, from Oakworth, a trustee of Out in the Valley LGBTQ+ group, said she was \u201cbewildered\u201d by the comments. She added: \u201cMr Mayor, we live in a secular society and have a diverse community. If this is not to your liking, why accept the honour of being town mayor? In my humble opinion you should resign forthwith. \u201cOur town has worked hard to achieve an integrated community. In Keighley we have a number of gay and lesbian people of Muslim heritage and the situation is never easy for them. The mayor\u2019s apology is not the most helpful action to heal the abuse they suffer.\u201d Some of the criticism came from within his own party. Robbie Moore, the Tory MP for Keighley, said he disagreed with the comments and had been \u201cexceptionally proud\u201d to take part in the flag-raising event. He said: \u201cI am proud we live in a country where people can be who they want to be and are free to choose who they love. \u201cThe role of the town mayor is to represent everyone within the community, and therefore it was deeply disheartening to read the mayor\u2019s statement.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/quite-weird-sea-temperature-rise-in-north-east-of-england-worrying-for-residents", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Quite weird\u2019: sea temperature rise in north-east of England worries residents ", "lead": "Mixed reactions greet dramatic fluctuation in sea temperatures in Tynemouth", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:15:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545678", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/851f0c38ebf4690e4fef4424ca30ad3903024a01/0_153_4582_2750/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cI\u2019ve never felt the sea this warm in June, it is quite weird,\u201d said retired nurse Val Hedley as she finished her regular paddle along the picture-postcard golden sands of Longsands beach in Tynemouth. \u201cOften here you will get a cold bit of the sea, then it gets warmer and then it gets cooler again. But today everything seems to be the same which is unusual \u2026 it\u2019s all evenly warm. \u201cIt is worrying but then other strange things are happening like seaweed accumulating in places it doesn\u2019t normally accumulate. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on \u2026 it must be climate change, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d Hedley, who lives in Wylam, Northumberland, was speaking on the day scientists revealed an \u201cunheard of\u201d marine heatwave which has pushed up sea temperatures in the North Sea and north Atlantic. The temperature rise for the north-east of England is particularly striking and it was concerning for swimmers and surfers out on the beach on Monday lunchtime. But most admitted they have yet to fully notice it. \u201cIt has felt as cold as normal, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d said 23-year-old Nathan Henderson, an instructor at Tynemouth surf company who has been surfing off the coast of north-east England since he was nine. \u201cThe sea here does gradually get warmer from April and the hottest month of the year, in the water, is September. That\u2019s just how it works round here. I\u2019ve not felt the sea getting warmer recently but it\u2019s a worry if it is.\u201d Most people braving the Tynemouth sea on Monday did not dip in above their knees. There was a lot of running in boldly and running out frantically. One fearless soul was Henry Harvey, a 19-year-old footballer for Blyth Town, who was in the sea with two friends. \u201cIt was really cold\u201d, he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s always cold. It\u2019s never warm \u2026 you jump headfirst in and it\u2019s a shock, but it\u2019s good for you.\u201d Barry Henderson has owned Longsands surf school for 12 years and is in the sea practically every day. \u201cWe surf all year and it\u2019s always the same. In winter you surf with boots, gloves and a hood on and as you come into the warmer weather you want to take your boots and gloves off as quick as you can because it\u2019s nicer to surf. \u201cMaybe this year a couple of the younger lads probably had their gloves off quite early but it still has felt bloody freezing. It hasn\u2019t felt massively different. \u201cSome days I\u2019ve gone in and thought the sea\u2019s warming up. I\u2019ve never gone in and thought, \u2018it\u2019s warm\u2019.\u201d That\u2019s not to say he hasn\u2019t noticed dramatic, apparently unexplainable, changes in temperature over the years. One August the temperature felt as high as 16 degrees, he said, and then suddenly it wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt never came back up to that temperature \u2026 it\u2019s strange how it can change like that.\u201d His surf school overlooks the abandoned wreck of Tynemouth outdoor pool, a place which was notoriously freezing in its heyday because it was filled up with sea water. Henderson has memories of badgering his mother to go in the pool when he was six. \u201cI think it was two pence and I dived straight in and it was just so cold, my breath just completely left me. It was so, so cold.\u201d For many years there has been a campaign to bring back Tynemouth outdoor pool, which opened in the 1920s and closed with the rise of package holidays in the 1970s. There is much goodwill behind the campaign with support for many predicated on one central part of the proposal: it will be heated."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/ashes-diary-englands-all-action-approach-keeps-fans-in-their-seats", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ashes diary: England\u2019s all-action approach keeps fans in their seats", "lead": "New hospitality area fails to appeal as Bazball takes preference, while Joe Root is still offering maximum entertainment", "author": "Simon Burnton at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:02:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545695", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a350b4c433c2ec329a036ce48c1bb29dc48cb530/0_96_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The price of Bazball As well as being the start of the match and indeed the series, Friday was opening day for Edgbaston\u2019s new hospitality area, the Skyline Terrace. This zone on the top of the South Stand is billed as \u201ca fun, interactive and modern cricketing hospitality experience \u2026 where there are not only exceptional pitch views, but where food is plentiful and space is fun and lively\u201d, and boasts \u201ca softer palette of materials and well-designed lighting along with informal buffet spaces within relaxed and varied seating zones\u201d. Ticket-holders are offered a premium street-food buffet, a complimentary bar and a live DJ, but for all its facilities on Monday it was completely empty \u2013 and Bazball was to blame. This kind of experience doesn\u2019t come cheap, and Skyline Terrace tickets for this Test cost \u00a3899 on the opening day, decreasing daily from there to an advertised \u00a3491 for day four on Monday. But this England side seems to play cricket on fast-forward and the result is that big-money tickets for the last couple of days, when there might be little or no play, have become very hard to shift. Edgbaston officials eventually decided not to risk displeasing their big-spending customers by charging high prices for potentially little action, while the facilities are considered too luxurious to open it up for general admission. Odd as it seems to have a completely empty section in a sold-out ground, that was the upshot. \u201cWe launched our new rooftop Skyline terrace shortly before the Ashes series to offer hospitality clients a fantastic new matchday experience,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe opened the terrace on days one to three of the Ashes. We sold around 1,000 covers in total and received great feedback from customers who entertained friends, family and business clients. We took the decision not to open on days four and five.\u201d Meanwhile anyone who considers those prices unacceptable for the simple pleasures of a day\u2019s cricket should sit themselves down, pour themselves a stiff drink and look up the brand new offering at Lord\u2019s for the second Test next week, the Ashes Lounge. You sixy thing Joe Root has already hit 13 sixes in Tests this year, having played only four games. That is one more six than he hit in the entirety of 2012 \u2013 the year of his debut \u2013 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 combined, when he played 83. Of Root\u2019s 131 Test appearances there have only been four in which he has hit at least one six in both innings of the game (3% of all his games). But there is something about these opponents and this venue that gets his synapses twitching: of Root\u2019s three Test appearances against Australia at Edgbaston he has now hit at least one six in both innings of the game twice. Sod steward Cricket fans are an appreciative bunch, and it is not just outstanding efforts in the classic parts of the game \u2013 bowling, batting, catching, running quite quickly, that kind of thing \u2013 that earn their approval. Mitchell Starc, not in Australia\u2019s team for this game but on the field temporarily as a substitute fielder, got a generous round of applause on Monday for doing nothing more than a spot of gardening. In the previous over Marnus Labuschagne, running back from mid-off, had slid to field a ball heading towards the boundary and dug up a significant divot in the rain-softened turf with his left knee. It was the last ball of the over and he promptly fled the scene of the crime with no attempt to make good the damage but Starc, arriving at what was then fine leg, picked up the stray sod, carefully returned it to its place and basked in the locals\u2019 appreciation. Reviewing the action At one point in England\u2019s second innings on day four it felt easy to lose count of the number of reviews and overturned decisions. So, for clarity, the Diary can confirm there were six reviews, two by Australia, both of which were incorrect and four by England. Only two resulted in an overturned decision, both in England\u2019s favour, saving Jonny Bairstow and Stuart Broad. The other reprieve for England came from a referral when Ben Stokes was adjudged out caught off Nathan Lyon, but replays checking the catch showed Stokes had hit it into the ground first."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/he-suffered-pakistani-relatives-mourn-sons-on-greek-shipwreck", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018He suffered\u2019: Pakistani relatives mourn sons on Greek shipwreck", "lead": "Poverty drove young men from small Kashmir town to board ill-fated fishing trawler, say families", "author": "Shah Meer Baloch in Khuiratta", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:02:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545713", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/78d328fb825f8cc984eb23af6c9f36babcf4699a/0_133_3984_2390/500.jpg", "body": "The last time Mohammed Yousaf talked to his son, Sajid Yousaf, on 8 June, the 28-year-old was waiting anxiously in Libya for smugglers to pack him and hundreds of others on to a boat bound for the other side of the Mediterranean. Six days later, the overcrowded fishing trawler sank off the coast of Greece. Sajid Yousaf, a shopkeeper and father-of-two from the small town of Khuiratta in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is among the hundreds missing, presumed dead. \u201cI never wanted him to go,\u201d Mohammed Yousaf said through tears. \u201cHis elder brother also advised him against this deadly sea journey. \u201cIt is like you are walking on fire and it can engulf you. We told him many times, stop it. We even asked him to come back from Libya.\u201d On Monday, as tracking data cast further doubts on the Greek coastguard\u2019s account of the shipwreck, an initial investigation by police in Pakistan estimated that about 800 people were on board. Witness accounts had placed that number at between 400 and 750 people. Greek authorities say 104 survivors and 78 bodies have been brought ashore. Yousaf was one of the 25 people from Khuiratta who boarded the boat in Libya. Only two are known to have survived. He planned to reach Italy, where his brother was living, having made a similarly treacherous boat journey 12 years ago. In a video which has since gone viral, he promised to bring a bicycle back home to his four-year-old son. The Guardian talked to almost a dozen families in Khuiratta whose sons and nephews were on the boat. All said their relatives had paid 2.2m Pakistan rupees to an agent who promised to take them to Greece. Many families took out hefty loans to cover the costs. Most of those who undertook the journey were hoping to eventually reach Italy, where about 500 people from the area had previously relocated. Yousaf\u2019s brother and cousins were also on board, including Touqeer Pervez, 29, who is still missing, leaving behind a pregnant wife. His father, Mohammed Pervez, a labourer in a brick factory, borrowed money from about 20 friends and relatives to pay the agent. Like most of the people from the village who boarded the ship, Perveez left for Libya via flight a from Pakistan. He had worked in Saudi Arabia for two years to help pay for the trip, and had left in May to begin his illegal journey to Europe. At 5am on 9 June he sent a final message to his family to say he was on the ship. \u201cWhen I tried to stop him from this risky voyage, he told me that our living standards will never improve by living in Pakistan,\u201d said Mohammad Pervez as he wept. \u201cHe was adamant to change our future and living standards. I don\u2019t know how to console his pregnant wife who has been crying for days.\u201d Abdul Jabbar, a 39-year-old baker with two children, had also hoped to reach Italy. He took a flight to Dubai on 5 June then another to Libya. His father, Mohammad Anwar, said his son called home in distress due to the conditions they were being kept in. That was the last time they heard from him. \u201cHe told his brother that if he had known the about the conditions in Libya he would never have left,\u201d said Anwar. \u201cThey were given just a little bread in 24 hours and he said they were dying of hunger. He wanted to turn back but he was helpless as he had already given the money.\u201d Rubina Kusar, a widow, said that her son Ahmed, 26, left for Libya six months ago and had been forced to endure terrible conditions at the hands of smugglers. Kusar said they deprived her son of food, beat him to try to extract more money from him and took his passport and other documents to stop him escaping. \u201cHe was put in a dark cell for four days as a punishment after he had a fight with the agent because he refused 19 offers to go on a small boat and told the agent he was promised that the journey would be on a big boat,\u201d said Kusar. In a phone call with his wife before the boat departed, Ahmed spoke of his happiness that he was finally making the journey on a large fishing trawler. \u201cMy son suffered a lot before his death,\u201d said Kusar. \u201cAt first at the hands of smugglers and then in the sea. He must have gone through excruciating pain. We need justice. The government has been in a deep slumber. Why did not our leaders wake up early? Don\u2019t they care about common people, common lives?\u201d People in Khuiratt said Pakistan\u2019s terrible economic situation and a lack of opportunities in their region were to blame for relatives making the journey. While many in Pakistan had previously taken a treacherous overland journey through Iran and Turkey to enter Europe, draconian policies by Turkey meant that more were opting to fly to Libya then get on a boat headed for Greece. According to locals, about 100 people from the area are still in Libya with plans to board boats, but have since become uncontactable after smugglers switched off their phones. \u201cIt is all poverty that pushed him to take this risky journey,\u201d said Mohammed Haneef, whose nephew Sameer, a tractor driver with six children, was among those who are feared to have drowned on the boat. \u201cThis poverty took his life. Poverty has engulfed the masses in Pakistan over the last few years. He saw people from his home town doing well in Italy, earning money to send home, and it pushed him to go.\u201d So far, only two from the village, Haseeb and Adnan Bashir, are known to have survived the sinking of the boat. Bashir had been frustrated with the lack of local employment opportunities and had tried to reach Europe twice before, going via Iran and Turkey, but he failed after he was caught by border guards. In order to afford this journey, he sold all his buffaloes \u2013 his only livelihood \u2013 and his wife\u2019s jewellery before leaving on 3 May. His father, Bashir Ahmed, a retired soldier, said he spoke to his son through a relative from the UK. According to his account, the ship had overturned after a rope was attached to it by the coastguard, which is an allegation rejected by Greek officials. \u201cAdnan said he jumped off the ship the moment it was going down. He said women and children were below in the deck, and they could not come out,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cI am lucky that my son survived.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946c9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/david-cameron-admits-failures-pandemic-preparations-austerity-covid-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "David Cameron admits series of failures in his government\u2019s pandemic preparations", "lead": "Ex-PM defends austerity programme that unions said meant the NHS \u2018didn\u2019t stand a fighting chance\u2019", "author": "Aletha Adu and Robert Booth", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 17:00:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545731", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/729ab4a87299047eacb06f56d0662030ec08277c/0_102_3062_1837/500.jpg", "body": "David Cameron has admitted failures in his government\u2019s preparations for a pandemic but defended the austerity drive that he and his chancellor, George Osborne, imposed, saying \u201cyour health system is only as strong as your economy\u201d. The former prime minister repeatedly told the Covid inquiry it was a mistake that \u201cmore time and more questions\u201d were not focused on tackling what turned out to be a \u201chighly infectious, asymptomatic\u201d pandemic. He suggested a review of the swine flu epidemic could have been a good time to assess the risks of a wide range of pandemics, claiming Dame Deirdre Hine\u2019s independent review on swine flu did not make the recommendations that would have been necessary to prepare for a pandemic like coronavirus. But he strongly defended his government\u2019s austerity programme, which unions have said \u201cground down and pulled apart public health systems\u201d with cuts that meant the health service \u201cdidn\u2019t stand a fighting chance\u201d. As he became the first politician to give evidence to the UK-wide public inquiry, the PM from 2010 to 2016 accepted that his government was repeatedly warned about the pressures facing the NHS, but he insisted Britain had the financial capacity to roll out schemes such as furlough during Covid because of his government\u2019s ability to \u201cget control of the finances and increase funding for the health service at the same time\u201d. Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the British Medical Association, has said there was \u201cno doubt that both staff and patients were put in harm\u2019s way\u201d because of underfunding in the decade running up to the arrival of Covid-19. The inquiry saw internal documents that revealed how in 2019, 16 separate pandemic preparation projects were \u201cstopped\u201d or reduced as a result of planning for a no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had to allocate 70 staff to no-deal planning, and projects dropped included a \u201cpandemic influenza strategy refresh\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to examine how countries in Asia, such as South Korea, had dealt with previous coronavirus pandemics \u2013 planning for a \u201chealthcare surge\u201d and benchmarking the NHS\u2019s preparedness internationally. As it entered its second week, the inquiry also heard that 14 of the 22 recommendations from the 2016 flu pandemic exercise Cygnus had not been completed by the time Covid hit. These included the need to \u201cdevelop plans for social care facilities to support clients who are discharged from hospital\u201d. An internal DHSC report after the first wave of Covid said the pandemic highlighted \u201cglaring omissions\u201d in preparedness, \u201cmeaning that the social care system was not able to respond to a major health emergency\u201d. Declassified documents, meanwhile, showed the government identified in 2019 that a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d outbreak of an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection in the UK was a reasonable worst-case scenario for a pandemic. But planners thought it would only kill 2,000 people on the basis that it would not spread. There was a \u201cflaw in the thinking\u201d, said Sir Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the DHSC, because they also knew that an emerging infection may \u201cdevelop the ability to transmit rapidly human to human\u201d. However, the plans were all about flu with the mantra \u201cready for flu, ready for anything\u201d, he said. Cameron said his government was \u201cvery concerned about potential pandemics \u2026 But it does still come back to this issue of why so much time spent on a flu pandemic and not so much on these others.\u201d He told the inquiry it was \u201cwrong to say we [were] preparing for the wrong pandemic\u201d. He said there \u201ccould still be pandemic flu, and it\u2019s good that we have been prepared for that but \u2026 a long time was spent preparing for a pandemic that didn\u2019t happen rather than the one that did happen\u201d. \u201cThe regret \u2026 is more questions weren\u2019t asked about the sort of pandemic that we faced,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cBut I think many other countries are in the same boat of not knowing what was coming.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary under Cameron who will also be cross-examined this week, has told the inquiry in a witness statement: \u201cOur preparations were affected by an element of groupthink. We knew that the spread of many distinct types of virus could create a pandemic, yet our shared belief was that the most likely scenario was a pandemic flu.\u201d The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ca", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/letter-roger-squires-rufus-obituary", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Letter: Roger Squires (Rufus) obituary", "lead": "<strong>David Wallace writes: </strong>Revisit the BBC production of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and watch the scene on the rugby field", "author": "David Wallace", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:51:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545757", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/35ebe568f4713473c015780ef1f5af6be59dce09/0_222_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Hugh Stephenson mentions Roger Squires\u2019s career as a TV actor, but without describing his greatest triumph as an extra.

A search and rescue mission was under way on Monday morning, according to the Boston coastguard. A spokesman for the coastguard confirmed to the Guardian that \u201ca small submarine with five persons onboard had gone missing in the vicinity of the Titanic wreck\u201d. The news was first reported by the BBC. The submersible is operated by OceanGate Expeditions, a company that offers visits to the wreck, which lies on the ocean floor in 12,500 feet of water about 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. People began offering up prayers for those missing on Monday. The Titanic, a British passenger liner which had been marketed as \u201cunsinkable\u201d, sank on its maiden voyage, from Britain to the US, in April 1912, on a route from Britain to the US after being holed by an iceberg. The disaster claimed the lives of 1,514 of the 2,224 passengers and crew and remains the most infamous of all civilian maritime disasters. The wreck of the luxury liner was not found until more than seven decades later. OceanGate started taking small crews of \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d in a five-person mini sub two years ago at a cost of $125,000 per person. The price of a trip is now understood to stand at $250,000. According to the company\u2019s website, Oceangate had a planned eight-day, seven-night expedition to the wreck planned for 12-20 June. A maximum of six visitors were scheduled to depart and return to St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada. A British businessman, Hamish Harding, a well-known aviator as well as an explorer and one of the tiny group of tourists who have already been to space, who is normally based in the United Arab Emirates, was booked on the current trip and is believed to be among those on board. Harding, 58, wrote on his various social media accounts about the trip, including on Instagram that: \u201cI am proud to finally announce that I joined @oceangateexped for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic.\u201d He further posted on Saturday that: \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow. We started steaming from St Johns, Newfoundland, Canada, yesterday and are planning to start dive operations around 4am tomorrow morning. Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThe team on the sub has a couple of legendary explorers, some of which have done over 30 dives to the RMS Titanic since the 1980s.\u201d A US Titanic enthusiast, William Oakes, wrote on Facebook that people should pray \u201cright now.\u201d \u201cPlease pray. I have friends and acquaintances that are a part of this mission,\u201d he posted. The company\u2019s website confirm on Monday that an expedition was under way and noted later on Monday morning that it was striving to bring the occupants back safely. \u201cOur entire focus is on the crew members in the submersible and their families. We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to re-establish contact with the submersible,\u201d a statement on the website said. The Oceangate website markets its dives to the public thus: \u201cFollow in Jacques Cousteau\u2019s footsteps and become an underwater explorer \u2013 beginning with a dive to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. This is your chance to step outside of everyday life and discover something truly extraordinary.\u201d \u201cBecome one of the few to see the Titanic with your own eyes,\u201d the site says, adding: \u201cYour dive will provide not only a thrilling and unique travel experience, but also help the scientific community learn more about the wreck and the deep ocean environment. Every dive also has a scientific objective and you can learn more about the research we support here.\u201d Included in the cost, the company said, was one submersible dive, private accommodations, all required training, expedition gear, all meals while on board. Since 2021, the Bahamas-based OceanGate Expeditions has ferried about 60 paying customers and 15-20 researchers to the site. \u201cWe started the business and it was this idea of researchers and wealthy people,\u201d OceanGate founder Stockton Rush told the Guardian earlier this year. \u201cIs there a way to match those people who wanted to have an adventure travel experience with researchers who need funding and a sub?\u201d Rush said the company envisioned a frontline role for the shipwreck in demystifying one of the planet\u2019s least-understood environments. \u201cWe spend 1,000 times as much exploring space as we do exploring the ocean in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cHow the ocean responds to climate change is going to dictate everything. We need to understand it.\u201d Over the course of the voyage, each guest is given at least one opportunity to spend a day exploring the wreck site from the sub, reported Frommers in 2020. Rush told the publication that about half his customers are Titanic obsessives, while others are deep-ocean enthusiasts. \u201cIn the vacuum of space,\u201d he told the publication, \u201cby definition there is nothing. But there\u2019s more undiscovered life in the ocean than we\u2019ve discovered on the surface of the planet.\u201d Customers are offered \u201crare, up-close views, through a round window and high-tech cameras, of the sunken ship, the hundreds of marine species that now live on the hull, and the debris field strewn with the Titanic\u2018s fixtures and its passengers\u2019 personal items,\u201d according to the report."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946cc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/jun/19/bad-drawing-club-drawing-for-everyone-with-millie-nice", "primaryCategory": "guardian-masterclasses", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bad drawing club: Drawing for everyone with Millie Nice", "lead": "Rediscover the joy of drawing with abandon and develop an artistic habit which will last long after the class", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:38:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545812", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c953e8e69825cae994bfd3a25c44a2ae97b80439/0_0_1000_600/500.jpg", "body": "Book now Calling all bad artists!

The best known Hopkins buildings \u2013 the Mound stand at Lord\u2019s cricket ground, Glyndebourne opera house, Westminster underground station, the 2012 Olympic velodrome \u2013 command not only respect but positive affection. Hopkins gave modern architecture a human face. At the start of his career, he seemed inextricably linked to the young turks of high tech, Richard Rogers and Norman Foster, designing steel-frame buildings of immaculate precision. From the late 1960s, Hopkins spent eight productive years in partnership with Foster. The Willis Faber and Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, Suffolk, was the peak of their collaboration. But his later architecture took a different and more original direction as he became more concerned with the history of building and the place of architecture in the landscape. This growing sense of context brought his buildings a new richness, a poetic modernity rooted in his understanding of the past. He could play the international game as well as anyone. There are fine Hopkins buildings in the US and Tokyo, India and Dubai. But Hopkins remained a quintessentially British architect. He liked to tell of how he once arrived for a job interview in Suffolk and realised he was still wearing his jeans. He went to a men\u2019s outfitters in Bury St Edmunds and bought himself some cavalry twill trousers, a check shirt and a tweed jacket. As an afterthought he added a tie. Also up for the job was Rogers, wearing his usual continental-style blouson. The board of directors making the decision easily identified a kindred spirit: Hopkins got the job. It is a good story, showing how easily Hopkins\u2019s clients managed to relate to him, often forming lasting friendships. He was a big ruminative man of strong affections who, as time went on, became more deeply rooted in the rural landscapes that he made his own. Michael was born in Poole, Dorset, the son of Barbara and Gerald Hopkins. His father ran his own contract building firm in Bournemouth. Michael was sent to Sherborne, a public school in a town dominated by a wonderful medieval abbey. He escaped from games and lessons to take bike rides through the countryside, absorbing the lie of the land and the detail of the buildings. Early on, there had been a family decision that Michael would become an architect. He was 23 when he arrived at the Architectural Association in London, a mature student in a black leather jacket with an Angry Young Man manner. He seemed to be super-confident, having already studied architecture at Bournemouth School of Art and worked professionally with both Frederick Gibberd, designer of Harlow New Town, and Basil Spence. The AA in the early 60s was a lively, inspiring place to be. The curriculum was set by Peter Smithson, a key figure in the postwar \u201cnew brutalism\u201d; Cedric Price, who developed the Fun Palace with the theatre director Joan Littlewood, was teaching there. Architectural history was high on the agenda and Hopkins was introduced to the Victorian functional tradition, the dramatic architecture of railway buildings, industrial warehouses and factories that was to be such an influence on him. At the AA, most importantly of all, he met Patricia Wainwright, a fellow student, who was to become both his wife (in 1962) and working partner in a lastingly successful creative collaboration, in which Michael\u2019s streak of professional cussedness was balanced by Patty\u2019s diplomacy and charm. Throughout his working life, Michael\u2019s professional and family lives were intertwined. While they were still students, he and Patty embarked on the restoration of a timber-frame house in Suffolk. In order to repair it Michael needed to know precisely how it had been put together in the first place, and unbolted the components like those of a 15th-century Meccano set. Suddenly, \u201clike a flash out of the blue\u201d, he understood the strong connection between the way that buildings were constructed and the way they eventually looked. Later on, in 1976, once Michael had left Foster and the Hopkins partnership had been established, he and Patty designed the rigorously beautiful steel and glass building that made them immediately famous. The Hopkins House on Downshire Hill in Hampstead, north London, was designed as both a family home and an architectural office, using factory-made industrial components in an urban, elegant and very English way. From the Hopkins House developed a whole progeny of structurally radical buildings: Greene King\u2019s draught beer cellars in Bury St Edmunds; the Schlumberger Research Centre in Cambridge; Solid State Logic headquarters at Begbroke in Oxfordshire. All these are emphatically modernist in concept, \u201ckits-of-parts\u201d buildings engineered with Michael\u2019s customary vigour. But one catches shadows of Paxton\u2019s Victorian Crystal Palace structures too. By the early 80s, Hopkins seemed well on track to be another of the British \u201csuperstarchitects\u201d. His office was expanding. The practice now included John Pringle and Chris Wilkinson, both destined to be leading British architects. But Hopkins was about to take a different direction: the Mound stand at Lord\u2019s became his turning point. This mid-80s commission for a new building involving the reconstruction of Frank Verity\u2019s original 1890s stand shows Hopkins no longer in assertively high tech architectural mode but engaging sensitively with context and atmosphere. One commentator saw the new stand as \u201cexpressing the sense of an English summer\u2019s day in brick, steel, glass and tensile fabric\u201d. Hopkins was at the start of inventing a new language for late 20th-century British modernism. Hopkins himself was later to express this as his personal \u201creconciliation with history\u201d. He was becoming more conscious of his links with the architecture of the past, with the great industrial buildings of the 19th century, and with natural materials such as stone, wood and brick. When he came to design a new cutlery factory in Derbyshire for my husband, David Mellor, on the site of a redundant village gasworks, it was Hopkins who suggested using the original circular foundation of the gas cylinder as a basis for the factory, a poetic but also wholly practical example of a new building arising from the old. Hopkins triumphed at this period with his design for the new opera house at Glyndebourne, a job for which he beat off competition from James Stirling. Hopkins needed to reconcile the bucolic appeal of the Christie family\u2019s neo-Elizabethan house and splendid gardens with the commercial and technical demands of a sophisticated modern opera house. Most people agree that the pitch pine interior of Hopkins\u2019s auditorium, as well as the wonderful acoustic, gives Glyndebourne a magic of its own. By the early 90s, Hopkins\u2019s success in relating historic context and new technology was gaining him admirers. He was appointed to the Royal Fine Art Commission. In 1992 he was elected a Royal Academician. In 1994 he and Patty were jointly awarded the Riba gold medal, a prize which recognised the interdependence of their skills. Michael was knighted in 1995. The Hopkins partnership was given a bumpy ride with its designs for Portcullis House. This complex building, containing committee rooms and offices for more than 200 MPs, was begun in 1989 and completed in 2000. An almost automatic resistance to the building arose from its bulky incursion on to one of the world\u2019s most sensitive sites, just off the Victoria Embankment, with Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament alongside. Objections receded once the building had weathered. There were no such reservations about Westminster underground station, the subterranean structure under Portcullis House. This is Hopkins high tech at its most dramatic, and a triumph of civil engineering. The sublime interior of the cavernous underground interchange has often been described as Piranesian. It was also a location for the 2007 film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The Hopkins family believed in pleasure, and some of the most endearing Hopkins buildings were public pleasure palaces: the Inn on the Park caf\u00e9 on the lakeside of St James\u2019s Park in London; the Garden Pavilion at Alnwick in Northumberland; the refectory building at Norwich Cathedral with its spectacular timber and steel roof structure. These are buildings that lift the spirit in the subtlety with which they relate to the history of place. Hopkins\u2019s trademark membrane structure canopies, as in the spectator stands at Goodwood racecourse in West Sussex, are faintly reminiscent of the splendour of the medieval tournament. Michael had many connections with the medical profession. His brother was a doctor, as were both of Patty\u2019s parents. And in the early years of the new century, the practice began working on its first large-scale hospital project, the Evelina children\u2019s hospital on the St Thomas\u2019 hospital site near Waterloo station. This sophisticated yet cheerful building has been much acclaimed. Hopkins\u2019s ambulatory cancer care centre for University College London is designed to provide a reassuring ambience for 125,000 outpatients a year. The Hopkins practice was now employing around 200 architects. They were carrying out important commissions in America, including university buildings for Yale and Princeton. A particular thrill was the designing of a huge cricket stadium in the wonderful landscape of the Deccan plateau, south-east of Mumbai. Hopkins was now operating internationally, and in 2004 opened an office in Dubai. Michael and Patty latterly began to share out responsibility, giving a group of senior partners shares in Hopkins Architects. In 1987 Michael and Patty had purchased a site on the hills above Borgo a Mozzano, north of Lucca. The 350-acre Catureglio estate centred round a traditional square stone building in traditional local style, with its own chapel and numerous abandoned outbuildings around. For Michael, Catureglio became a personal project as he restored the buildings, revived the vineyards and olive groves and cleared the forestry around. Eight years later, the Hopkinses took on another architectural challenge, Blackheath House near Aldeburgh, Suffolk, an internally ungainly Victorian house which had been re-clad in brick by the neo-Georgian architect Raymond Erith. The irresistible attraction for Michael, a keen sailor, was the vista across the Alde estuary towards Orford. This house too, set in 500 acres, was gradually given the Hopkins treatment. Both in Italy and Suffolk, he and Patty created not only two fine architectural landscapes but a whole way of living that embraced their many friends \u2013 architects and artists, writers and musicians \u2013 over several generations. They were endlessly hospitable and in Suffolk their ties to the Aldeburgh festival were strong. Michael is survived by Patty and their three children, Sarah, Abi and Joel, and 11 grandchildren. \u2022 Michael John Hopkins, architect, born 7 May 1935; died 17 June 2023 \u2022 Fiona MacCarthy died in 2020"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ce", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/greek-coast-boat-sank-tracking-data", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sunk boat had not moved for hours, data suggests, contradicting Greek officials", "lead": "Tracking data indicates two vessels stood by or circled around stationary refugee boat for several hours", "author": "Jon Henley Europe correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 16:27:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545859", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/67643248d0fec1a581fbbec9ccc656af5321532a/0_31_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "Tracking data suggests an overcrowded fishing boat that sank off the Greek coast last week with the feared loss of hundreds of lives had not moved for several hours before it capsized, contradicting accounts from the Hellenic coastguard. As Pakistani police said on Monday they believed up to 800 people were onboard, a Guardian analysis of ship movements supplied by the MariTrace service indicated two vessels \u2013 the Lucky Sailor and the Faithful Warrior \u2013 stood by or circled round the stationary trawler for at least four hours. The coastguard has said it was in contact with the boat throughout that period \u2013 from about 3pm to 7pm on Tuesday \u2013 by radio, satphone and helicopter and that the vessel was not in difficulty, but moving \u201cat a steady course and speed\u201d towards Italy. The trawler began rocking, then listed and sank in international waters off the west coast of Greece shortly after 2am on Wednesday. Authorities have said 104 people were rescued and 78 bodies recovered. A search and rescue operation continues. Citing survivors, suspects and bereaved families, an initial police investigation in Pakistan, where some of those onboard were from, found that 750 to 800 people had been on the vessel. Other witness accounts have put the number at between 400 and 750. The UN\u2019s human rights agency has said up to 500 people are still missing, making the sinking potentially the second deadliest refugee and migrant shipwreck after the April 2015 capsizing of another vessel on the Libya-Italy route that killed up to 1,100 people. The UN has called for an investigation into Greece\u2019s handling of the disaster amid claims the coastguard should have intervened earlier to prevent it. Greek authorities have rejected claims the boat sank after an attempt was made to tow it. Coastguard and government officials have defended the decision not to step in sooner to save the rusting steel trawler, which left eastern Libya on 9 June carrying men, women and children from Syria, Egypt, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. A full-scale rescue attempt was not possible, they said, because the people on the boat repeatedly refused assistance and were not in danger. Any kind of forcible intervention could have caused the badly overloaded boat to capsize, they said. The coastguard has said that the trawler was moving forward more or less steadily until minutes before it sank. Activists, however, say people onboard were clearly in danger and making frequent pleas for help more than 15 hours before the boat sank. International maritime law experts have said conditions on the trawler, some of whose passengers were reportedly ill and which was supplied with water and food by at least one passing merchant ship, meant the people onboard were clearly at risk. The state of the vessel and its passengers should have prompted an immediate rescue operation, regardless of what the people onboard may have said, legal experts argue. The captain of a Greek coastguard vessel that finally reached the trawler less than three hours before it sank has testified to investigating authorities that the passengers refused any help whatsoever, Greek media have reported. He said when the coastguard boat tied a rope to the trawler\u2019s bow after it stopped moving just before midnight on Tuesday, some passengers cried: \u201cNo help\u201d and \u201cGo Italy\u201d, untied the rope, and restarted the engine \u2013 which stopped again at 1.40am. The Guardian analysis substantiates a BBC report based on tracking data supplied by another maritime analytics platform, MarineTraffic, which also indicates the fishing trawler was stationary and clearly not advancing for up to seven hours. Nine survivors from the shipwreck, all Egyptian men aged between 20 and 40 and accused of people-smuggling and other offences, pleaded not guilty in court on Monday, with a lawyer for one of them saying his client had been a passenger. The court in Kalamata postponed the hearing until Tuesday to provide them and their lawyers with time to review the testimonies of the suspects, who were reportedly identified as members of a smuggling ring by some of the survivors. They face charges of participating in a criminal organisation, causing a shipwreck and endangering lives. In a separate incident on Monday, the coastguard said 68 people were rescued in the eastern Aegean after the yacht they were on sent a distress signal. The boat, believed to have set sail from Turkey, issued a distress call early on Monday. Its passengers were initially picked up by two Russian vessels before being transferred to a coastguard boat and taken to the nearby island of Leros.

Brian Meehan\u2019s colt was a ready winner of the Group Two Superlative Stakes at Newmarket last summer and made an impressive in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury in April. That form will be dismissed by some as Chaldean, the subsequent 2,000 Guineas winner, unseated Frankie Dettori shortly after the start but Isaac Shelby won in a strong time and his form at Longchamp next time up was franked when the winner, Marhaba Ya Sanafi, finished third in the French Derby. Chaldean has been winning on much softer ground than he is likely to encounter on Tuesday and Paddington arguably beat a sub-standard field at the Curragh, while the unbeaten Cicero\u2019s Gift still has plenty to find on his latest form to figure. That leaves Isaac Shelby (4.20), who will be ridden by William Buick for the first time, as the clear pick of the prices to give Qatar-based Wathnan Racing, which bought the colt privately last month, a first European winner at Group One level. Ascot 2.30 Modern Games is impressively consistent at Group One level but Inspiral\u2019s emphatic success first time up in the Coronation Stakes last year is arguably the best individual piece of form on offer here and she can get Frankie Dettori\u2019s final Royal meeting off to the best possible start. Ascot 3.05 The visual impression of Asadna\u2019s 12-length win at Ripon last month was backed up by a remarkable time for a juvenile on debut and he deserves to be joint-favourite, at least, with Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s River Tiber, so at around 3-1 or better he is definitely worth an interest. Ascot 3.40 Several interesting new rivals for Highfield Princess, including Australian-trained Coolnagatta and the three-year-old Dramatised, but John Quinn\u2019s hugely popular mare looked as good as ever under a penalty at York last month and will take all the beating with that race under her girth. Ascot 5.00 Runners from big jumping yards head the betting but Calling The Wind, with the excellent apprentice Billy Loughnane taking off 3lb, has also been dropped 1lb since running into traffic in the closing stages of the Chester Cup and has definite claims at around 10-1. Ascot 5.35 Cadillac looked back to his best when successful in a handicap at Epsom earlier this month and may have crept in unnoticed here at around 12-1.

Verstappen took the flag in Montreal with another dominant run from pole to secure his 41st career win, equalling Senna. He now has six wins from eight races this season and, with a 69-point lead over his teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez in the championship, is on course to seal his third title sooner rather than later. Horner believes those achievements have elevated his driver to stand among the very best the sport has produced. \u201cWhat we are witnessing with Max is the emergence of another mega talent,\u201d the Red Bull team principal said. \u201cYou can start talking about him in the same sentence as the greats now after he matched Ayrton Senna. \u201cMax just keeps delivering at such a high level. The race was fantastic but to take pole position in conditions that were continually changing, his ability to adapt to whatever grip level he had, was Max at his best.\u201d Verstappen, who is only 25 despite being in his eighth season in Formula One, is now the fifth most successful F1 driver in terms of wins, behind Alain Prost, Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton who heads the field with 103. Verstappen acknowledged the feat was \u201cincredible\u201d and Horner believed it was significant for the Dutchman. \u201cPart of him inside will be quite proud of that,\u201d Horner said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is one to show huge emotion. He is a very modest guy. He is very understated in many ways. But behind the scenes it will mean quite a lot to him.\u201d The win was also the 100th for Red Bull since the team\u2019s debut in 2005. With their car the class of the field this year, more are sure to follow as they look to close out another drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship double. They remain unbeaten this year with eight wins from eight meetings, still potentially able to complete a record clean sweep of victories. They are unlikely to be caught this season and Hamilton, who was third behind Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso in Canada, believes they enjoy such an advantage that they may have already shifted resources into developing next year\u2019s car. His Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, who was pleased with the steps his team have made with their new car concept, conceded that they remained around two-tenths of a lap off Red Bull and Hamilton acknowledged that bridging that gap was a tall order. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about their amazing performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that they will win every race, moving forwards, this year, unless the Astons and us put a lot more performance on the cars.\u201d Wolff, however, confirmed that Mercedes were pressing on with a very aggressive development programme, promising major upgrades for the British Grand Prix, which should suit their car\u2019s strengths. \u201cWe are bringing a large one to Silverstone and another one before the [summer] shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe learning has accelerated a lot since we changed some of the conceptual architecture, so there should be decent steps coming in the next four races.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946d3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/heavy-casualties-both-sides-ukraine-offensive-russia", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Heavy casualties on both sides as Ukraine offensive edges forward", "lead": "British intelligence report comes as Kyiv celebrates liberation of eighth settlement in south of country", "author": "Daniel Boffey in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:54:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545954", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3aab884aba135b7c1625dca939d10fe174a34ad9/0_398_5976_3586/500.jpg", "body": "Heavy casualties are being endured by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, British military intelligence has said, as Kyiv celebrated the liberation of an eighth settlement in the south of the country, two weeks into its offensive. The level of losses among Russian troops was said by British officials to be at its highest level since the peak of March\u2019s battle for Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Ukraine claiming to have killed or injured 4,600 soldiers. The progress of Ukraine\u2019s forces in both the east and south of the country has been slow, with much of the heavy western weaponry and new brigades yet to be committed to battle. The deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar announced that the capture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia, brought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113sq km of territory said to have been seized from the occupying forces. Ukraine\u2019s border guard service released images of several Ukrainian service personnel holding their national flag at Piatykhatky. \u201cToday, 18 June, the forces of 128 Assault Brigade chased out the Russians from the village of Piatykhatky. The Russians ran away, leaving equipment and ammunition. Glory to Ukraine,\u201d an unidentified soldier said in a video that could not be independently verified. Maliar said Ukrainian troops were coming up against fierce resistance in the east of the country, particularly around Bakhmut, the symbolically important town captured recently by Russia after months of close combat fighting and heavy casualties. \u201cThe Russians have transferred additional units there and increased the amount of shelling,\u201d she said. Maliar said the situation in the east of the country was \u201cdifficult\u201d after initial positive reports over advances around Bakhmut. She said: \u201cThe enemy has raised its forces and is conducting an active offensive in the Lyman and Kupyan directions, trying to seize the initiative from us. High activity of enemy shelling is recorded. Intense battles continue. \u201cThe enemy does not abandon his plans to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Currently, this is the enemy\u2019s main offensive line. Therefore, it has concentrated a significant number of units in the east, in particular the airborne assault units. Our troops act courageously in the face of the enemy\u2019s superiority in forces and means, and do not allow the enemy to advance.\u201d In a phone call on Monday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that it was clear the Ukrainian counteroffensive was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d, Downing Street said. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Monday that its forces had fought off a Ukrainian attempt to take the village of Novodonetske in the eastern Donetsk region, on the road to Mariupol, close to where Ukrainian forces have enjoyed recent success, according to Reuters. Russia was reported to have moved troops to the southern Donetsk front, including 20 attack helicopters, from the Kherson region, where the destruction of the Kakhovka dam has reduced the potential of Ukrainian forces to cross the enlarged Dnipro. In recent days, the 68th brigade, among others, had blazed a trail south from Velyka Novosilka, a small town 75 miles (120km) north of Mariupol, but they appear to have struggled to make further progress. The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based military observatory group, said in an analytical note on Monday that Ukraine\u2019s forces had probably taken back some territory from Russian forces over the weekend. \u201cUkrainian forces continued counteroffensive actions on at least four sectors of the front on 18 June and made limited territorial gains,\u201d it said. Russia\u2019s FSB security service claimed on Monday to have thwarted Ukrainian \u201csabotage and terrorist plots\u201d targeting Russian-installed officials in the occupied territory, arresting one woman as part of its investigation. Criminal cases were said to have been opened against the unnamed woman it described as \u201can accomplice\u201d on charges related to terrorism and the illegal possession of explosives. In Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to have been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region. The regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote: \u201cThe Valuisk municipal district is under attack from Ukrainian forces. According to preliminary information, seven people were wounded, among them a child.\u201d Strikes on the Kursk border region were also said to have hit two villages, causing damage but no casualties, the local governor, Roman Starovoit, said. \u201cUkrainian forces hit the Tyotkino and Popovo-Lezhachi villages this morning,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. In Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the governor, Sergei Aksyonov, said two drones were shot down overnight. During a press conference with Nato\u2019s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said his government was prepared for the possibility of a lengthy war in Ukraine. \u201cWe are preparing for that and adjusting our policies based on that,\u201d Scholz said, adding that Germany would continue to support Kyiv for as long as was necessary."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946d4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/info/live/2023/jun/19/product-and-engineering-away-day-2023-live", "primaryCategory": "info", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Product and Engineering away day 2023 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "All the news and updates from the 2023 Guardian Product and Engineering away day", "author": "Calvin Dickson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:39:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.545972", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8cec2954bd490ae3eb5f8e06d2c21126b2072739/0_208_6240_3744/500.jpg", "body": "Nichola is back on stage to wrap up the day.

This whole thing is being judged? Suddenly I\u2019m really invested. A dramatisation of a date between an inflatable saxophone and a picture frame. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I think someone might have spiked my coffee at lunch. Another Christmas presentation. There seems to be a theme emerging in this summer away day. Up next, a story about Elton John at Glastonbury. This performance definitely wins the award for the best costume so far. Now we have two reluctant presenters. They are up with the \u201c12 trash gifts of Christmas\u201d. Delivered with a real sense of distain, that was up there with my favourites. The next group are up with \u201cThe Wrong Show\u201d. A parody of the One Show with some real focus on staging. Great acting gets it a thumbs up from me. Next team are up to discuss \u201cBasecamp Studios\u201d, the new Guardian Hollywood film studio. They are performing \u201cPartygate: The Movie\u201d. Short, sweet and disturbingly accurate. Now up we have a team talking about \u201cLego Fridays\u201d. Four team members are now having their lego builds live judged by Nichola Johnson. It cannot be confirmed whether or not the winner will get a monetary prize. The next team have brought a first aid kit to the stage. A little bit ominous \u2026 The next team to take the stage have done so with an abundance of props and visual aids. Who\u2019s to say what\u2019s in store? Next to take the stage \u201cChocolate coins as a new currency\u201d. Sounds delicious, I\u2019m in! And now what we\u2019ve all been waiting for. The presentations! Up first, \u201cCloudy with a chance of beach balls\u201d. A story about plastic balls raining from the sky in a freak weather event. A great presentation, with some fantastic associated graphics. Kath is now taking questions from the floor. A variety of questions and some insight into her cultural influences (a lot of The Smiths). Some of the perks of the job? Kath has met seven UK prime ministers and three US presidents. Caspar asks, \u201cDoes the news ever get too upsetting?\u201d Kath responds that the proximity to the news may not give her the chance to have those feelings. She says that something that probably helps her is the fact that she feels as if she is trying to make a difference to the problems every day. Caspar then asks Kath about the value of print in the modern, digital-first climate. She explains the extend to which an important part of our identity and something that sets us apart from other publishers. Kath talks to the department about how her day to day job works. The day is split into journalism focused work in the morning and then more strategic and organisational work throughout the rest of the day and afternoon. She touches upon the dangers and opportunities of AI in the future and some of her favourite apps (aside from our own of course). And we\u2019re back! Kath Viner is here on stage with Caspar for a live Q&amp;A. 15 minutes to have a quick drink, after which I am hearing we will be joined by the editor, Kath Viner! The biggest name I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reporting on (sorry Caspar). I\u2019m getting nervous already. Things are really ramping up. It looks like there will be everything from duelling elves to a puppet show and everything in between. Emotions are at fever pitch as the teams scramble to tighten up their scripts, presentations and cheap costumes. There are rumours floating around that one of the presentations will be \u201ca mixed media show combining found footage and live improvised action\u201d. I may have undersold the amateur level of these dramatics. We could be seeing one of these performances debut at indie film festivals in the near future. It\u2019s looking like some of the teams are working on fully acted out scenarios. The anticipation is building here for the presentations. Who doesn\u2019t love hurried amateur dramatics? In keeping with tradition, Colin King has snapped a pic of me liveblogging while I was unaware. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking at here, but it looks like it is stressing me out. There is a creative hum around the space. People are donning strange outfits and giggling as they create their wacky and wonderful stories. I can simultaneously see someone throwing a beach ball, two people shaking cheerleader\u2019s pom-poms, a person playing an inflatable guitar and someone wearing reindeer antlers. People\u2019s names will be omitted for the sake of their own dignity. Shervin is giving everyone the lowdown on the next activity. Everyone is to split into teams and pick up a random set of items from the stage. There are hats, scarves, novelty glasses, decks of cards and all other manor of joke shop accoutrements. The teams are now groups of journalists after the big scoop. They are being given 40 minutes to create and report on a story related to the objects they have collected. At the end of the time, all of the teams will present their cutting edge journalism back to the room. This could be interesting. A wide array of sandwiches and confectionary was provided for lunch. I am well fed and back for some more this afternoon. What\u2019s next on the agenda? Something called \u201cMost entertaining story\u201d. This sounds very promising.

The first, Caspar is armed with a bunch of P&amp;E Away Day 2023 stickers. A must have accessory for any self-respecting member of the department. And second, it\u2019s lunch! See you back here in an hour. Alert. David Blishen has made a list. He has gathered thoughts from people around the room on what they are most scared of. From not being able to publish, to being locked out of the systems for six months and anything in between. I\u2019m sure it makes for terrifying reading for anyone and that he is keeping it in a safe place. First up, how would we rebuild the department from scratch. Group Product Manager Jess Lane shares some interesting details around restructure of teams and how this may impact speed of delivery. Then a bombshell \u2026 the group propose a change to the name of the department! The second session of the unconference time has come to a close. There will now be some time for feedback on the topics. Who will step up to share their thoughts? It\u2019s nearly time on session two. I\u2019m hearing there will be a brief summary of each discussion back to the room. Let\u2019s see what the future holds for us all. And that\u2019s time on session one. For session two we have eight more topics for people to join. I can see a big congregation of people for a chat on AI. Maybe ChatGPT will be writing this live blog next year? Philip McMahon takes to the stage and gives the 5-minute warning. The groups are being encouraged to wrap up their discussions. A calm has fallen over the great hall. There are pockets people in focused and collaborative discussion on various big topics. It is lovely to see. We are through the icebreakers now (mostly unscathed) and on to the real substance of the day. Next up, the \u201cunconference\u201d. The department have been asked to suggest topics for eight discussions that will happen in different groups around the room. Sabina Bejasa-Dimmock takes the mic to explain the rules. You are free to join and leave a discussion as you please and are invited to move around to different discussions as you see fit. Don\u2019t overstay your welcome if you feel you are not engaged or do not wish to contribute. There are such topics of discussion as: \u2022 The decline of mobile web \u2022 The need for green software practices \u2022 If we built the department from scratch, what would we do differently? These are some big themes, I\u2019m still trying to figure out the rules! It is our UX and service designer Abolade Akintunde\u2019s birthday! The entire hall breaks into a chorus of Happy Birthday led by our fantastic senior agile lead Shervin Sahraei. A surprisingly tuneful rendition as well. The first activity of the day is \u201cGetting to know you Bingo\u201d. The aim of the game, find someone in the room with every characteristic on your list. The floor is suddenly awash with people striding around trying to fill their Bingo sheets. Who loves Beyonc\u00e9? Who has never been on a plane? Who hates summer? All will be revealed. Wow, it\u2019s good to be back! Today we\u2019re at the wonderful Bishopsgate Institute. David Blishen (Group Product Manager) has informed me this is the venue of his finals exams, although he would not disclose the year. The day kicks off, as always, with an introduction from our Chief Product Officer Caspar Llewellyn Smith. There was something about a statue of a goat that I didn\u2019t quite catch\u2026 hope it wasn\u2019t important. Hello, and welcome to the 2023 Guardian Product and Engineering away day.

In a world where billions are connected, the stark reality of this absence looms large, leaving more than 3 billion people on the margins of the digital age. As life moves online, it only exacerbates existing inequalities, limiting access to education, healthcare, job opportunities and essential services. This takes us to Kerala in south India, home to about 34 million people. There, the communist-led state government is launching something called the Kerala Fibre Optical Network (KFON) \u2013 and it\u2019s a major milestone. (It is worth noting the irony that the communist government, which has a history of opposing the introduction of computers, is now at the forefront of this digital initiative.)

Despite facing various setbacks \u2013 such as the pandemic and a corruption allegation that led to the arrest of the senior bureaucrat who was previously in charge of KFON (he denies the allegation) \u2013 the project has finally been launched. It\u2019s a fibre-optic broadband network project, aiming to provide affordable and reliable internet connectivity to every household, government institution and business entity in the state. Marred by delays, the project is taking a cautious approach, starting with about 14,000 relatively poor households throughout the state that will be getting internet connectivity this month. The extensive KFON network has reached even the most remote areas, like tribal hamlets in faraway regions in Wayanad. The project aims to eventually provide free internet connections to 2 million economically disadvantaged households in the state \u2013 this is expected in the next 12 to 18 months. The other 6 million or so households Kerala will have the option of choosing from a range of affordable data packages, starting from just under 300 rupees (\u00a32.86) a month for a 20 Mbps connection. (For context, rural farm workers in Kerala make about 727 rupees a day.) All this \u2013 along with installing the infrastructure in schools and government buildings \u2013 is expected to have a multiplier effect within society, with significant benefits for healthcare, education, skill development and business opportunities, to name just a few. Alongside the expansion of the infrastructure, the government has initiated digital literacy campaigns at the grassroots level, working with local bodies to ensure that individuals from the marginalised communities have the skills necessary to use the internet; the aim is to empower every citizen with the ability to leverage the benefits of digital connectivity in their daily lives. In several low- and middle-income country settings, where service delivery is affected by infrastructure bottlenecks and gaps in human resources, digital interventions like this can offer a great leap forward for equity in access. For instance, the eSanjeevani project, a free telemedicine service initiated by the government of India, has achieved a remarkable milestone of 125m tele-consultations in just over three years of operation. It is currently the world\u2019s largest government-owned telemedicine platform, serving even the most remote regions of the country. As the Economist recently observed, India is touting its digital infrastructure on the global stage, hoping to lead the way for other countries. The pandemic years saw how the digital divide could amplify inequities. Current discussions within the G20 (India currently has the presidency) on digital public infrastructure (DPI) \u2013 which is about counterbalancing the power of a few tech corporations \u2013 would be even more relevant in societies where internet access is near universal. As we reflect on the shortcomings of the attempts by tech giants like Facebook to connect the unconnected, perhaps in the next year or so, Kerala\u2019s KFON project will show the world how political will and innovative thinking can transform the lives of millions.

Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital are under pressure to move players out of Chelsea and the ownership hopes to offload a number of expensive misfits to the big-spending Saudi Pro League. Although Romelu Lukaku has snubbed interest from Al-Hilal and hopes to return to Inter on loan, many of the Belgian striker\u2019s teammates are open to moving to the Middle East. Chelsea are in talks with Al-Nassr over a deal for the Morocco winger Ziyech, who wants to team up with Cristiano Ronaldo, and Koulibaly is likely to join Al-Hilal for about \u20ac30m (\u00a325.5m). Mendy, who lost his place in goal to Kepa Arrizabalaga last season, is likely to move to Al-Ahli. Chelsea, who are also set to lose N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 on a free transfer to Al-Ittihad, need to sell players after spending close to \u00a3600m since last summer. Their transfer activity has left them with a bloated squad and has led to speculation over them falling foul of Financial Fair Play regulations. Club insiders have insisted there are no concerns over FFP. Nonetheless the recent flurry of activity from Saudi Arabian clubs thanks to investment from the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund is a welcome development for Chelsea as they look to streamline Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s squad. Chelsea were willing to sell Ziyech in January and the former Ajax playmaker was left aggrieved after a loan move to Paris Saint-Germain broke down because of technical glitches on deadline day. Pochettino is not short of attacking midfielders and Ziyech, who joined Chelsea for \u00a337m in 2020, has been inconsistent during his time in west London. Koulibaly has also struggled since his \u00a333.8m move from Napoli last summer. The 31-year-old Senegal centre-back has not adapted to the pace of the Premier League but there were concerns that his high wages would make it difficult for Chelsea to shift him. Inter failed with a loan bid for Koulibaly last week. Al-Hilal, though, will have no problem matching Koulibaly\u2019s wages. There will be sadness over Mendy leaving. The Senegal goalkeeper was a smart signing from Rennes in 2020 and played a key role in Chelsea winning the Champions League two years ago but his form has deserted him during the past 18 months. Mendy struggled with injuries last season and has not agreed a new deal. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has been a major flop since joining Chelsea last year, also has interest from several Saudi clubs. Chelsea are expected to raise funds by selling Mason Mount to Manchester United, Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and Kai Havertz to Arsenal. They are set to step up their efforts to sign the Brighton midfielder Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, and the Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson. Well-placed sources believe they will bid for the Celta Vigo midfielder Gabri Veiga soon."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946d7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/liz-truss-lettuce-joke-puerile-media", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Liz Truss says lettuce joke was \u2018puerile\u2019 and media did not understand her ideas", "lead": "Former PM criticises Daily Star stunt at Dublin conference but says UK media\u2019s irreverence is a good thing overall", "author": "Peter Walker Deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:15:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546086", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/91a8fdb3255b1719192cda1c6722cd807065427b/0_371_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "Liz Truss has described as \u201cpuerile\u201d the newspaper stunt in which her tenure as prime minister was measured against the shelf life of a lettuce. Speaking at a broadcasting conference in Dublin, Truss also complained that the media did not properly understand her economic ideas. She said too much political coverage was \u201cfroth\u201d, while at the same time praising the overall irreverence of the UK. Interviewed at the News Xchange event by the RT\u00c9 journalist David McCullagh, Truss was reminded of the Daily Star\u2019s decision to livestream the decline of a lettuce in a blond wig, after an Economist article a fortnight before she was ousted, likening the then-PM\u2019s political longevity to that of the lettuce. Asked by McCullagh if she could see the funny side of the Star\u2019s decision, Truss, whose comments were reported by the Press Gazette, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I just think it\u2019s puerile.\u201d Truss also disputed the idea that the Economist\u2019s original parallel was a fair one to make, saying: \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the relevance of that? This is what I\u2019m talking about. To me it\u2019s not a very relevant question.\u201d More widely, Truss argued, the UK media were focused overly on trivialities, and did not properly understand economics \u2013 especially the sort of small-state, low-tax economics she espoused in her disastrous, sub-50-day period in No 10. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a criticism of the media, there\u2019s too much focus on the people and seeing it as a sort of entertaining story to follow \u2026 rather than discussions of the ideas. And I particularly find that true on economics,\u201d she said. \u201cDid I and my colleagues get everything perfect about communication? No, we didn\u2019t. But I think we\u2019re operating in an environment where the economic ideas that I believe in are not widely understood.\u201d Truss nonetheless praised the UK media for their irreverent and robust approach, saying: \u201cI think the British media are known around the world for being particularly vociferous \u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly deferential to politicians. \u201cCertainly, when I went to international summits I would get a lot of sympathy from politicians from other countries who were saying: \u2018My God, your press \u2013 what are those people like!\u2019 \u201cI think the irreverence of the media in Britain is a good thing on the whole.

The firefighters had to force open the train\u2019s doors to free passengers, some of whom were suffering from heat exhaustion after a lengthy holdup in the train in which the air conditioning failed. Footage showed passengers, including some in wheelchairs and children in prams, being brought to safety along a forest track by firefighters. Thermal cameras were flown over the forest to ensure that no passengers had been left behind while other train traffic in the area was brought to a standstill amid fears of passengers on the tracks. The incident was the latest in a series of reports of malfunctioning trains, cancelled and delayed services and faulty rail infrastructure. Deutsche Bahn puts the problems down to a chronic lack of investment and a personnel shortage, which has worsened since the pandemic. Germany\u2019s three-way coalition government, which includes the Greens, believes rail transport is key to efforts to reach net zero targets, but experts say the country\u2019s trains are in such a parlous state these goals will be almost impossible to reach. A groundbreaking plan to synchronise long-distance and regional transport so trains would run every half-hour in both rural and urban areas, was recently put back from 2030 to 2070. Calling it the \u201cproject of the century\u201d, Michael Theurer, of the pro-business FDP and government ombudsman responsible for overseeing rail transport, admitted the Deutschlandtakt or \u201cGermany Rhythm\u201d was more appropriately to be seen as a \u201cprogramme for the next 50 years\u201d. Marissa Reiserer, of Greenpeace, has said the government\u2019s failure amounts to a \u201cclimate crime\u201d that will do grave damage to its own goals to reduce CO2 emissions in the next seven years by 65% compared with 1990 levels. The railway system is in need of about \u20ac60bn of investment but even that figure is said to be an underestimate as costs rise with inflation. Michael Peterson, the chair of Deutsche Bahn\u2019s long-distance transport arm, admitted in a recent interview in Die Zeit that too little had been invested in the rail network over years. \u201cSince the 1970s, Germany has been investing far too little in rail. The Swiss invest five to six times more per resident, in Austria, it\u2019s three times more \u2026 Already 10 years ago, these investment deficits were publicly said to be up to \u20ac50bn,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone can see it for themselves that lack of investment has led to the current infrastructure now being at a tipping point, which is why we\u2019re drastically trying to turn things round.\u201d He said many works were taking place simultaneously, in which everything from overhead lines to tracks, signal boxes, stations and level crossings were being repaired and modernised, which was also having a detrimental effect on services. At the same time, Peterson said, train travel had become more popular than ever, prompting plans to double passenger capacity by 2030, with longer trains, double decker inter-city expresses and smaller inter-cities away from major destinations. \u201cGuaranteed, by 2029 the situation in the whole of Germany will have improved,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946d9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/19/arctic-monkeys-glastonbury-2023-headline-set-thrown-into-doubt-by-alex-turners-laryngitis", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arctic Monkeys: Glastonbury 2023 headline set thrown into doubt by Alex Turner\u2019s laryngitis ", "lead": "Band cancel open-air Dublin gig on Tuesday, leaving a nervous wait for fans looking forward to Friday\u2019s Glastonbury set", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:10:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546123", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de8fa9b04afa93ccf0c9dbac4e5256679f23a66f/0_43_5138_3082/500.jpg", "body": "Alex Turner, frontman with Arctic Monkeys, is suffering from \u201cacute laryngitis\u201d and the band have been forced to cancel an open-air concert in Dublin on Tuesday.

The company, which has about 500 stores and is considered a good barometer of consumer spending, said in a surprise update that there had been an \u201cover-performance\u201d in sales over the past seven weeks, sending its share price nearly 5% higher and making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. Next, which is helmed by its longstanding chief executive, Simon Wolfson, cited the warmer spell of weather \u2013 \u201cparticularly coming after a wet and cold April\u201d \u2013 that had prompted people to update their wardrobes with summer clothing. It said pay rises awarded to UK workers at the beginning of the financial year in April were also likely to have played a part. The retailer said: \u201cIn an inflationary environment, annual salary increases deliver a significant uplift in real household income at the time they are awarded. We do not think it is a coincidence that sales stepped forward so markedly at a time of year when many organisations make their annual pay awards.\u201d Annual inflation remains high, having fallen to 8.7% in April, a smaller-than-expected decline. However, April\u2019s monthly inflation figure, comparing prices with March, stood at 1.2%. That prompted Next to argue that a worker given a 5% pay rise that month would get a 3.8% increase in real income, temporarily putting more money in consumers\u2019 pockets. Next said full-price sales from the end of April until mid-June were 9.3% higher compared with a year earlier, enabling it to beat estimates for the period by \u00a393m. This compared with a 5% decline in sales predicted for the period in early May. As a result of better trading, the company upgraded its full-price sales guidance for the whole year by \u00a3137m and its annual profit forecast by \u00a340m to \u00a3835m. The \u201cmaterially better\u201d trading at Next comes just weeks after it warned the cold and damp weather during early spring and the cost of living crisis had knocked its sales, and predicted this would continue. Shares in other retailers including the Sports Direct owner, Frasers Group; Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods; and the electronics retailer Currys also gained in response. Emily Salter, lead analyst at GlobalData, said Next\u2019s trading update showed that consumers had \u201ccontinued to spend, whether supported by any remaining savings they built up during lockdowns or by the proliferation of buy now, pay later schemes\u201d and that Next had been a beneficiary of this. Next warned the impact of recent pay rises and the arrival of warmer weather would fade over time, as inflation remains elevated, eroding the effect of higher salaries. It said it did not expect its current performance to continue at the same level in the coming months. Analysts at the US investment bank Jefferies said Next\u2019s improved sales showed that \u201cthe combination of pent-up demand on seasonal items and the recovery of purchasing power through wage rises\u201d was proving \u201cmore powerful a driver\u201d for consumers than the impact of higher mortgage rates on homeowners, and the challenge of higher UK government borrowing costs. Recent UK wage data from the Office for National Statistics showed growth in average regular pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 7.2% in the three months to April \u2013 the highest level on record, excluding the Covid pandemic. The wage figures, combined with elevated levels of inflation, drove up yields on two-year UK government bonds \u2013 known as gilts \u2013 and reinforced expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again on Thursday. Next\u2019s trading update \u201ccould also signal more enduring pressure on the gilt front,\u201d Jefferies analysts said."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946db", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/eu-split-over-subsidies-for-coal-plants-as-poland-seeks-extension", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EU split over subsidies for coal plants as Poland seeks extension", "lead": "Luxembourg calls proposal by Sweden \u2018astonishing\u2019 as energy ministers gather to discuss overhaul", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll in Brussels", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:05:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546158", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/664ce1e4540c623f6a27336d456d5d65267e24d7/0_253_4346_2608/500.jpg", "body": "A group of EU countries are fighting attempts by Poland to extend subsidies for coal plants, with Luxembourg\u2019s energy minister describing the proposal as \u201castonishing\u201d.

Some countries consider this a measure to help Poland, which uses coal to produce about 70% of its energy. Poland is expected to soon surpass Germany as Europe\u2019s top power polluter due to aggressive planned reductions in fossil fuel use across Germany, creating assumptions that Poland will have no choice but to remain Europe\u2019s most coal-reliant nation for years to come. So far this year, Poland has defied expectations by cutting coal use and pollution to the lowest level since at least 2014, and by raising clean power output to record highs just as Germany cut its clean generation by shutting nuclear reactors. \u201cWe have a big bloc of countries that will reject the proposal of the Swedish presidency \u2026 so it\u2019s a clear no,\u201d Turmes said ahead of the summit on Monday. Spain\u2019s minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, said some thought had to be given to Poland, which is heavily reliant on coal, while the French energy minister, Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, said extending support to Poland was an \u201cambitious approach\u201d \u2013 a hint Paris was more open towards the move than other member states like Germany. \u201cWe need to take into account the reality of each country to ensure their capacity to provide energy to their people and to their industries,\u201d she said.

Tinne van der Straeten, the energy minister, said: \u201cIn Belgium we already have in our national legislation the obligation to become climate neutral and to have a steep decline in emission by 2030 and 2040.

Scientists have warned the planned massive expansion of hydraulic fracturing \u2013 or fracking \u2013 for gas in the Beetaloo basin will have an unacceptable impact on the climate. But on the ground there is another battle playing out. Beckett has spent more than two decades working in native title, including a period at the Northern Land Council (NLC). But he now believes the land council is not effectively doing its job as a representative for traditional owners in negotiations with gas companies. \u201cSo many of the people up there are opposed, are fearful, about contemporary fracking practices on their land and the scale of operations. That\u2019s very clear from the time I\u2019ve spent up there,\u201d he says. The NLC\u2019s role is to help Aboriginal people in the northern half of the Northern Territory acquire and manage their traditional lands and seas. It\u2019s a commonwealth-funded statutory authority that traces its roots back to the land rights movement of the 1970s and has been instrumental in traditional owners across the Top End winning back land. But dozens of traditional owners in the Beetaloo basin now say the NLC is no longer acting in their interests. A number of them have told Guardian Australia they felt under pressure by the land council to sign agreements with gas companies to frack on their country rather than risk the matter going to the native title tribunal. They say the NLC appears to them to be \u201cin the business of facilitating fracking\u201d. Johnny Wilson, a Gudanji-Wandaya man who is a jungai, or cultural lawman, for his family\u2019s country, said: \u201cThe NLC is supposed to be representing us. But we see them doing not anywhere near that.\u201d But a spokesperson for the NLC strongly rejected the claims, saying the land council had \u201ca proud history of fighting for land rights, against governments, miners and other vested interest groups [and] setting groundbreaking legal precedents\u201d. They say criticism should instead be directed at native title law, which doesn\u2019t give a right of veto over gas exploration or production, and noted there was a diversity of opinions among Territorians, including Aboriginal people, about fracking. Hundreds of fracking wells The Beetaloo basin is the name governments and industry have given to an area of about 28,000 sq km between Katherine and Tennant Creek. The name is drawn from a single pastoral station 40km off the Stuart Highway but the entire basin takes in communities including Daly Waters, Newcastle Waters, Larrimah and Elliott and, on its borders, places such as Mataranka, which is home to natural springs that feed into the Roper River. The basin was the focal point of the former Morrison government\u2019s proposed \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d from the Covid-19 pandemic and is central to the Northern Territory government\u2019s plans for a $40bn territory economy by 2030. Despite the International Energy Agency\u2019s warnings that no new coal or gas projects can proceed if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C, the expansion of the Beetaloo has the backing of both major parties. The main companies with active exploration in the basin are Tamboran Resources \u2013 which in 2022 bought Origin Energy\u2019s projects in the Beetaloo \u2013 and Empire Energy. One of Tamboran\u2019s exploration permits is a joint venture with Santos. If the basin reaches full production, hundreds or potentially thousands of wells could be drilled using fracking across the landscape. The 2018 Pepper inquiry into fracking in the territory found Aboriginal people from regional communities who made submissions to the panel \u201calmost universally expressed deep concern about, and strong opposition to, the development of any onshore shale gas industry on their country\u201d. A bid to take back control Wilson lives on an outstation on the Carpentaria Highway and says he can smell the gas well 20km from his home when there\u2019s a change in the weather. He\u2019s worried about how fracking might affect songlines, which connect one place with another, and the groundwater that people and ecosystems rely on. Ninety per cent of the territory\u2019s water supply comes from groundwater. \u201cIt\u2019s a tossing and turning situation at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this energy in your head, all these questions: why is it happening like this? \u201cIt hurts me really badly \u2026 Sometimes I pray at night for something to go right.\u201d Wilson is the chair of the Nurrdalinji Aboriginal Corporation, an organisation that is made up of more than 60 native title holders from 11 determination areas in the Beetaloo. There are hundreds of native title holders in the basin and at least 11 determination areas, depending on how you define its boundaries. In December 2020, he and a group of six other traditional owners, represented by Beckett, applied to the federal court to have Nurrdalinji recognised as the body that would represent the rights and interests of native title holders in nine of the determination areas, including in their dealings with governments and developers about gas exploration. In short, it proposed that Nurrdalinji take on a role performed by the NLC. Beckett says the land council\u2019s response was swift and aggressive. In a letter to the lawyer, seen by Guardian Australia, the NLC recommended his clients discontinue their proceedings because the application \u201chas no reasonable prospects of success\u201d. If they did not, it warned the land council would pursue an indemnity costs order for its full legal costs to be paid by the individual applicants and an Indigenous organisation by the name of Original Power, which was supporting the traditional owners. \u201cI think it was an attempt to scare off both the traditional owners and their supporters once and for all,\u201d Beckett says. \u201cWhile it hasn\u2019t scared people off or daunted their opposition, it was enough to kill off those proceedings.\u201d The application collapsed after one pivotal traditional owner withdrew. A spokesperson for the NLC said the land council was unable to support Nurrdalinji\u2019s bid \u201cbecause of significant deficiencies in the application\u201d and said its response was \u201centirely reasonable\u201d. \u2018We want more transparency\u2019 For years, traditional owners in the Beetaloo basin have queried the processes used to inform people and obtain agreements for gas exploration, some of which were signed in the early 2000s when little was understood about fracking. Those attempts are documented in letters and emails \u2013 seen by Guardian Australia \u2013 that were sent to the NLC and companies such as Origin Energy between 2018 and 2020. Traditional owners were supported in writing some of this correspondence by Original Power, an Indigenous organisation that \u201csupports the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to self-determine what happens on their country and waters\u201d, according to its executive director, Yorta Yorta woman Karrina Nolan. \u201cWe are writing because we feel the NLC are not listening to the people from the communities,\u201d says one letter from 2018, which was signed by 10 traditional owners from Beetaloo and neighbouring areas. \u201cWe want more transparency as to how the NLC operates especially with mining companies and whose interests are represented.\u201d A reply was not sent until six months later, in January 2019. In it, the NLC\u2019s interim chief executive, Rick Fletcher, said the NLC provided \u201cinformed explanations about mining and fracking and its impact on country \u2026 at all consultations\u201d. He offered to meet with traditional owners to discuss their concerns, but attempts to take up this offer were not successful amid a change of personnel at the land council. Original Power sent more letters and emails on behalf of native title holders in 2019, requesting a meeting to discuss concerns about the consultation process and the potential effects of fracking. Nolan says they received no response to these requests and no meeting was organised. By August 2020, senior NLC representatives were being invited to meet in Daly Waters with native title holders for 11 of the determination areas in the Beetaloo basin. This invitation was extended in multiple letters that stressed the group believed \u201ccoordination and cooperation with NLC will ensure the best and most durable outcomes for the native title holders\u201d. On 25 September 2020, Janet Gregory, a Jingili woman whose lands are affected by fracking, wrote to senior NLC representatives and said traditional owners were \u201cdisappointed and sorry, but not surprised, that we received no response and that no representative of NLC attended the meeting\u201d. \u201cWe need to take greater control over decisions being made on our country,\u201d she wrote, before requesting the NLC support the court application to formalise Nurrdalinji as the new representative body for native title holders. In a reply, the NLC representatives wrote they were concerned that \u201cafter stating that the reason for the change was so that \u2018we can take control of our native title and our country\u2019, you go on in the letter to use language which reflects your opposition to fracking\u201d. \u201cYou are absolutely entitled to have negative views about fracking. We respect those views and some of us may share them,\u201d it said. \u201cBut \u2026 our job is to properly represent wishes in particular of the senior decision makers from the estate groups whose country will be affected.\u201d In 2022, Nurrdalinji wrote that it had formed the view the \u201cNLC is primarily in the business of facilitating fracking, rather than enabling members to make their own decisions about fracking, in a free and informed way,\u201d in an unpublished submission to a current audit of the land council by the National Audit Office. No right to veto \u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster for people to understand,\u201d says Janet\u2019s sister Elaine Sandy, one of the directors of Nurrdalinji and a Jingili woman. Sandy and her siblings have felt the presence of the gas industry in the Beetaloo since some of the earliest exploration agreements were negotiated with companies in the early 2000s. Sandy says in those very early days there was little explanation about what fracking was or what its effects or potential scale could be. \u201cWe never knew what it was all about,\u201d she says. \u201cThere had been a promise of jobs and money. \u201cMy concern is water \u2026 the environment and our land. Once it\u2019s been contaminated that\u2019s going to be [a] great disaster for us,\u201d she says. \u201cNot just for us, our people, our country, our environment \u2013 but also our neighbours, the pastoralists.\u201d Most of the areas targeted by the gas industry in the Beetaloo are non-exclusive native title lands, meaning they are lands held under pastoral leases where traditional owners have coexisting rights. Native title holders don\u2019t have a right of veto over resources exploration, but have a right to negotiate an agreement with gas companies and the NT government for jobs, protection for the environment, and payments for exploration to ensure benefits flow to what are often desperately poor communities. These negotiations are time-limited and companies must negotiate in good faith. If after six months they have not secured an agreement, the legislation permits a company to go to the national native title tribunal and seek a determination to be granted tenure for its activities anyway. Consultation and division Elliott is a sliver of a town on the Stuart Highway where homes run on diesel paid for with power cards. Residents live in two town camps, one on either side of the petrol station, and in houses scattered between. There\u2019s a primary school, a sports and recreation park with a brightly painted basketball court, and an arts centre where people meet to chat under the din of industrial fans. Guardian Australia visited the town, which is one of the focal points of the NT\u2019s gas industry expansion, in mid March. People who live in Elliott talk about their connection to the region\u2019s ecosystems and waterways and the aquifer that runs under the Beetaloo, flowing north feeding the Mataranka hot springs that then discharge into the Roper River. Their deep ties to country are not only to what sits above the ground but what is below it. One of the biggest concerns traditional owners worried about fracking have raised is that its effects could be cumulative and felt region-wide but consultation has focused on the boundaries of single permits, which \u201csuits the gas companies \u2026 so their enormous combined impacts and the risks they present are not fully understood,\u201d as Nurrdalinji wrote in its submission to the audit. While in Elliott, Guardian Australia witnessed the way consultation about gas development can divide communities. A new company, Territory Gas, has applied for an exploration permit on the edge of the Beetaloo basin and a meeting was held with native title holders in March. If the application is approved, it would be the first new gas company to enter the territory for a number of years. Notices were delivered to homes in Elliott, inviting native title holders to a meeting where they would be provided with information about \u201cwhat is involved in petroleum exploration\u201d, would have the opportunity to ask the company questions and \u201cgive the NLC instructions about whether you want to make an agreement with Territory Gas\u201d. Near the top of the meeting notice, the NLC noted Territory Gas had made an application to the native title tribunal to decide if the permit could be granted. Guardian Australia did not witness the meeting. But after it, people raised concerns and some said they felt pressured to sign an agreement they did not support. That a tribunal application hung over the proceedings indicates how fraught these processes can be. \u201cThe NLC mob want us to say yes to the company,\u201d Jingili man Mark Raymond told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe mining company want to push ahead in the tribunal. \u201cThey said if we don\u2019t sign an agreement [Territory Gas] will push through the back door.\u201d A spokesperson for the NLC said its staff members were courteous professionals. \u201cNLC staff members are monitored throughout their interactions with constituents and notes are kept,\u201d they said. A spokesperson for Territory Gas said its involvement at meetings was limited to company presentations and corresponding questions and answers, and they had not been party to any of the discussions between the NLC and native title holders. \u201cThe company has complied with all the requests of the NLC including the provision of information and facilitation of multiple on country meetings with the native title holders,\u201d they said. In a statement to the ASX last week, the company said it had reached an agreement with native title holders. \u2018Treating land owners like children\u2019 There is another factor that is unique to the Northern Territory that is critical to understanding why a group of traditional owners tried to take back control from their own land council in court. In every other jurisdiction in Australia, when a determination of native title is made a corporation is set up that holds the native title in trust, usually with local traditional owners on its board. These corporations are generally referred to as prescribed body corporates (PBCs) and are meant to act as a forum for regional governance that manages interactions with governments and industry. In the Top End of the Northern Territory, this has not occurred. Instead, the Northern Land Council established a shell corporation called the Top End Default Prescribed Body Corporate (TED PBC) that is the PBC for more than 70 native title determinations in the territory\u2019s northern half over an area twice the size of Tasmania. The TED PBC\u2019s members and directors are also the executive of the NLC. \u201cThe NLC is neither separate from, nor independent from the TED PBC, and vice versa. Indeed, they are indistinguishable,\u201d Nurrdalinji wrote in its submission to the audit. The NLC has told parliamentary inquiries this was only meant to be an interim arrangement before native title holders transitioned to their own PBCs. But it has also said it was a useful model for the remote communities of the Top End because they were not the target of large-scale development and thus rarely had to engage with industry. The Beetaloo basin, as one of the largest proposed new fossil fuel developments in Australia, does not fit that description. Beckett thinks the TED PBC model is abhorrent and paternalistic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t put power back into the hands of the people who have been determined to be the native title holders,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is treating land owners like they\u2019re children.\u201d The spokesperson for the NLC said the TED PBC \u201cdelivers efficient and effective support for native title holders and avoids the dysfunction plaguing many parts of the PBC sector\u201d. James Fitzgerald, who has worked as a native title lawyer for 25 years and negotiated some of the largest and most lucrative mining deals with Aboriginal groups in Australia, believes the NLC\u2019s approach to native title holders in the Beetaloo with concerns about fracking \u201cseems to be fundamentally antagonistic\u201d. \u201cThe Beetaloo basin is one of the hottest industrial properties in Australia, yet when Beetaloo native title holders have attempted to opt out of the TED PBC arrangement they have met strong resistance from the NLC,\u201d he says. \u201cTaken together, the NLC\u2019s actions in the Beetaloo indicate an organisation that seems more interested in establishing and maintaining monopolistic control over native title representation than in serving the wishes of native title holders.\u201d Fitzgerald has also who worked as a strategist for Original Power. The spokesperson for the NLC said the land council sought to ensure development did not occur without the free, prior and informed consent of traditional owners. They said lands covered by the Native Title Act notoriously did not allow for a right of veto over either gas exploration or production and the NLC, along with other land councils around Australia, had advocated for law reform that would give First Nations people genuine rights to decide whether and how their country will be mined or drilled. \u201cIn the Beetaloo basin, much of the criticism that is currently levelled at the NLC would be more appropriately directed at the native title legislation under which the NLC is required to operate,\u201d the spokesperson said. Fitzgerald, however, said \u201cregardless of the shortcomings of the Native Title Act\u201d it was \u201cwithin the power of the NLC to use its substantial heft to advocate in favour of native title holders\u2019 wishes, including where a group or groups wants to resist fracking or other mining development on their land\u201d. \u201cThere are more tools available than just the Native Title Act,\u201d he said. \u201cNational and territory environmental laws, cultural heritage laws, the negotiations themselves and political and direct action can be used to genuinely minimise the risk of environmental or cultural heritage impacts including, where necessary, agreements not to frack.\u201d The spokesperson said the NLC\u2019s chief executive, Joe Martin-Jard, had told the Senate inquiry into the Beetaloo basin that \u201cif any determined group of native title holders in the Top End makes a decision to replace the [TED PBC] with a different corporation, the NLC will respect and support that decision\u201d. They said \u201cat most about 36 adult constituents\u201d were in attendance at the Daly Waters meeting in September 2020 who sought to represent the native title holders of the entire Beetaloo Basin. The council said at the time it was not \u201csatisfied that this appointment or this creation of Nurrdalinji and the purported appointment of it as a PBC were decisions that were authorised with the consent of all native title holders. On the contrary, it was quite clear to us that many groups and many senior native title holders either didn\u2019t know anything about this or were opposed to this particular action\u201d. \u201cWhen understood in context of the established facts, NLC\u2019s response to Nurrdalinji and Original Power\u2019s application in the federal court is entirely reasonable,\u201d the spokesperson said. But Beckett said the NLC\u2019s remarks were \u201can attempt to downplay the significance of the meeting\u201d. He said Original Power had made considerable effort to inform and consult with a steering committee to make sure the meeting was well notified and a sufficiently representative group was invited to attend. He said this was done without the assistance of the anthropology and other resources available to the land council. He said he was not aware of any other region-wide meeting that had been organised to discuss gas development in the Beetaloo and this was why people had requested one. \u201cIn my view the NLC should have supported this meeting and attended it. This was a meeting requested by and for the benefit of people who it claimed to be acting on behalf of,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it chose to keep its distance and then criticised and marginalised it after the event.\u201d \u2018I want the world to know\u2019 \u201cAt the moment we have a big fight, a big battle on our hands with companies that are entering the Northern Territory,\u201d says Samuel Sandy, a Jingili man and deputy chair of Nurrdalinji. Guardian Australia met with him in March, on the porch of his home in Katherine, while his great-grandson Henry played next to him in a Spider-Man suit. \u201cIf they continue doing this fracking, if they\u2019re going to drill all these wells and going to full production, there\u2019s going to be a lot of dangers to the land.\u201d In 2022, Nurrdalinji directors visited a fracking well on Tanumbirini station. Sandy says when he saw the site \u201cmy heart sank\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable on our beautiful country. The way it\u2019s going, they\u2019re going to destroy it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a storybook and someone has ripped the page out and burned it. \u201cI just want the whole world to know we desperately need help. The people in the Beetaloo basin need help.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946dd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/19/my-fiance-died-unexpectedly-last-year-could-communal-grieving-help-me-heal", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "My fiance died unexpectedly last year.

They start singing, beautifully, their voices layering indiscernibly with the slightly warped, recorded voices of the score. They stutter, crackle with static. The singers wail. Scream. The voices are embodied and disembodied; alive and perhaps dead. The ghostliness of the scene feels instantly recognisable. Grief, I think, is a lot like a haunting. I expect to see Jamie in the kitchen by his beloved coffee machine before work, or in his spot on the couch when I get home at night or lying next to me in bed in the morning. Every time he isn\u2019t there it feels like a jump scare. The rhythm of reaching for him every day, of longing for his touch, the routine of picking up my phone to call him when I leave the office is a memory that I can\u2019t seem to shake out of my muscles. It\u2019s hard to know where the real and the imagined ends a lot of the time. Community of Grieving changes suddenly. The singing stops, the music becomes hard and industrial. Discordant. The singers begin to spin and twirl. Their bodies break down, slowly twitching and contorting as the music glitches out. They bend, squat and then their knees buckle, perhaps under the weight of everything. They crawl and find each other in the darkness. Because we\u2019re sitting on the floor, I crane my neck but I can\u2019t really see anything. Everyone around me is doing the same. I give up on engaging with anything visual in the show and close my eyes. I think of Jamie and feel the weight that settles on my chest when I stop distracting myself. The weight, I\u2019ve learned, is everything I have felt and still feel for Jamie: the love I have for him, the desire and longing I have, the anger I have at him for leaving even though I know he wouldn\u2019t have left if he could have helped it. The guilt I have because he passed away on my watch and that maybe if I paid closer attention, there was something, anything, I could\u2019ve done to save him. And I don\u2019t know where to put all of that. I don\u2019t know if I ever will. The music stops. I open my eyes and the performers enter and bow. It\u2019s over. We clap. I get up from the ground, slowly, and stomp my feet to get the feeling back. I don\u2019t feel a lot of closure leaving Community of Grieving, or catharsis or even emotion. I feel mostly neutral, even though there were parts of the show that were exceptionally beautiful. I step out into the night and feel the shock of the icy Hobart air on my cheeks as I walk with my friends to a bar up the road. \u201cLet\u2019s get a drink, darl,\u201d I hear Jamie whisper. \u201cI need it after that.\u201d I wish Jamie was here.

A tourist flying over the Great Barrier Reef filmed what appears to be a white humpback whale swimming north, as thousands of humpbacks make their annual migration from Antartica to warmer waters to breed. But scientists are cautious not to get too excited that it is Migaloo. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the footage it\u2019s unmistakably a white whale, but there is always an element of doubt which is why we can\u2019t confirm until we\u2019re 100%,\u201d said Vanessa Pirotta, a whale expert at Macquarie University. \u201cIf it is him it would be incredible that this one iconic whale has avoided being seen for so long along one of the busiest coastlines in the world.\u201d Migaloo, the only known albino humpback whale in Australia\u2019s east coast population, was first spotted in 1991 at Byron Bay when he was estimated to be around two years old. He has been spotted occasionally in intervening years since, with the last sighting in 2020 off the coast of Port Macquarie. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In 2004, tissue samples collected from Migaloo, which is a First Nations word for \u201cwhite fella\u201d, confirmed its lack of pigmentation was due to albinism. Pirotta said other whales in the population that are predominately white or are swimming on their backs with their white belly pointed to the sun can sometimes be mistaken for Migaloo by observers. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the beautiful things about this population that have such variation in the way that they look,\u201d she said. \u201cMigaloo looks like an iceberg under the water.\u201d Dr Wally Franklin, director of the Oceania Project, said Migaloo has two telltale bumps on his back where his backbone protrudes and unique serrations on the outer side of his tail fluke. \u201cLast time we sighted him in Hervey Bay was in 1998 when he was around nine years old. He was singing and we recorded his song,\u201d said Franklyn. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a superb singer.\u201d Frankyln said there is a low probability that Migaloo will pass his albinism on to his offspring given both he and the female would need to carry the gene. Pirotta encouraged anyone else who thinks they spot Migaloo to send the information to the White Whale Research Centre. \u201cThe sighting is truly a great example of citizen science and people capturing information helps us learn more about one of the most famous whales in the world,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946df", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/19/fossils-long-necks-prehistoric-reptiles-targeted-predators", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fossils show long necks of prehistoric reptiles were targeted by predators", "lead": "Evidence suggests slender necks of some ancient marine creatures were a deadly weakness", "author": "Ian Sample Science editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:00:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546227", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/93376fc63278ddf8311307bfbf4a157d34472c65/756_0_4874_2926/500.jpg", "body": "For nearly two centuries, fossil hunters have mused that the improbably long necks of some ancient marine reptiles made them tempting targets for hungry predators.

Spiekman and his colleague Dr Eudald Mujal, an expert in prehistoric bite marks, made the gruesome discovery while examining a pair of 240m-year-old fossils of tanystropheus, a marine reptile recovered from Monte San Giorgio on the Swiss-Italian border. At the time, before the emergence of the dinosaurs, the mountain was home to a tropical lagoon. Fossils from the rocks preserve such a spectacular diversity of prehistoric fish, reptiles, crustaceans and other species that it was designated a Unesco world heritage site. The fossils studied belong to two different species of tanystropheus, one smaller animal about 1.5m long, and another much larger creature about 6m long. In both cases, only the small head and part of the long, slender neck remain. The bodies, ominously, are missing. Close inspection of the larger fossil revealed two tooth-shaped holes in the vertebrae at the precise point where the neck was cleanly broken. \u201cThe whole neck is broken in exactly one plane,\u201d said Spiekman. \u201cThe neck was broken in one go, and having the tooth marks there is pretty conclusive evidence that some animal bit its neck off.\u201d The smaller reptile seems to have suffered the same fate. Again, the neck and slender supporting neck ribs which run parallel along the vertebrae to provide stiffness, were broken at a single point. This time, a small tooth-shaped hole was found further up the neck, away from the fracture point. Scavenging looks highly unlikely, the scientists say,because bite marks look different in dead animals, and scavengers tend to cause far more damage when they tuck in to a carcass. The evidence suggests that while many marine reptiles reaped clear benefits from exceptionally long necks \u2013 the larger tanystropheus had a neck comfortably over 2m \u2013 the advantages came with a cost. As depicted in Henry De la B\u00e8che\u2019s 1830 watercolour, Duria Antiquior, a long neck was a great way to lose one\u2019s head. Based on the size of the teeth marks, Spiekman and Mujal suspect the beheadings were performed by other marine reptiles, perhaps a distant ancestor of the plesiosaur called a nothosaur, an early ichthyosaur, or the stocky helveticosaurus. Details are published in Current Biology. \u201cThese are some of the most macabre fossils I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a professor of vertebrate palaeontology at Edinburgh University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cYou can sense the violence of the reptile-eat-reptile world of the Mesozoic when you look at these fossils.\u201d \u201cIt seems like these long necks were a type of superpower, which allowed these reptiles to ambush their prey by darting their heads like a spearfisherman,\u201d he added. \u201cBut all superheroes have a weakness, and these long necks would have been kryptonite to these animals, as they left them vulnerable to attack from other reptiles. \u201cStill, long necks persisted in so many reptile groups, for so long, right up to the asteroid that knocked many of them out, alongside their dinosaur cousins. The value of a long neck must have generally outweighed the costs.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946e0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/im-transfixed-by-a-menial-ipad-game-in-an-age-of-saturation-its-an-embarrassing-comfort", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I\u2019m transfixed by a menial iPad game \u2013 in an age of saturation, it\u2019s an embarrassing comfort | Caitlin Cassidy", "lead": "Petting pups and cleaning up digital dog poo makes me happy.

The bark came with a tantalising notification: \u201cYour new rustic lantern is ready to decorate your sanctuary!\u201d My hands instinctively moved to swipe before I managed to contain myself. The lantern wasn\u2019t real. The lantern could wait. I have a job. For the past few months, I have developed an addiction to a free iPad game in which I assist ageing dogs to enjoy their twilight years in my home for elderly pets. I started with one dog. Now I have five. I have passed 22 levels and obtained several items of furniture by completing mediocre tasks. I pat my dogs when they want pats. I feed them treats when they are hungry. I give them a toy when they \u201cneed toy\u201d. I clean up leaves, poo and chewed-up balls by clicking on them when they appear. I win coins by completing said tasks. That is essentially the game. And yet I cannot stop. It is not infrequent that I will pick up my iPad to \u201ccheck on the dogs\u201d (that is the thought that goes through my head \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll just check on the dogs) and find myself hours later, sitting in the dark, frantically pressing on love hearts that appear above their cartoon heads so I can collect more coins and progress to new levels. It\u2019s like gambling, but the stakes are extremely low, and all I\u2019m losing is my precious time. I\u2019ve stopped reading books. I\u2019ve neglected my own dog to satisfy my fake ones (Mack, Bagel, Leo, Babs and Captain Ron). Each time I check in after a few hours to a flood of coins I get a rush like a shot of heroin. Is this bad? There is no anonymous group you can join to say you might have a problem with a pleasantly designed iPad game. If anything, it\u2019s just a bit embarrassing, like getting caught with your trousers undone when you leave the loo. And yet. When I was at the pub the other day, I chanced upon a couple of young girls playing on their iPads while their parents ate dinner. \u201cHow terrible!\u201d I thought. Nobody can just sit back and enjoy the moment these days. Looking closer, I realised with a sense of dread that the game they were playing was my coveted pleasure. With a simple Google search, I discovered the game on a string of websites recommending \u201cbest games for toddlers\u201d and \u201cbest apps for kids (of all ages)\u201c. I have reverted to the brain-space of a toddler with an iPad. This is my reality. What does it say about me, about my headspace, that I can take such comfort in something that requires the intellectual rigour of a collection of wooden blocks? My suspicions are that the state of the world is so objectively wrong right now, it makes sense \u2013 I am gaining a sense of serenity and pleasure from how well my old dog\u2019s sanctuary is coming along and the new lantern in my inventory to decoratively place in my garden. There\u2019s a reason we (adults, of which I am one) have turned to mindless TV like Emily in Paris and whatever reality show came out this week in droves, or why people get a weird kick out of menial games where you\u2019re simply completing day-to-day tasks. Sometimes, in an age of saturation, when you can be presented with 100 different ideas \u2013 from catastrophic climate change to Trump hiding classified documents in the loo \u2013 in one humble scroll of a social media feed, games like this are a comfort. All I have to do is give the dog a biscuit, and he\u2019s happy. And I\u2019m happy.

Graeme Samuel, the former competition watchdog head who chaired a 2020 review of Australia\u2019s environmental laws, says a campaign is needed to bring public awareness of biodiversity decline in line with the understanding of the climate crisis. The Biodiversity Council, which is a partnership between 11 Australian universities, surveyed people about their attitudes to nature. The online poll of about 4,050 people found although most (63%) understood how unique Australia\u2019s wildlife was and 83% rated looking after nature as important to them, many were not aware of the extent of biodiversity loss in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The research found that fewer than half (43%) were aware Australia had one of the highest rates of mammal extinction in the world and just more than half (54%) knew most of Australia\u2019s forests had been lost since colonisation. Awareness of climate change and how it affected nature was much higher, with 74% indicating they understood global heating was having a direct impact on wildlife and ecosystems. Winnifred Louis, professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and one of the report\u2019s authors, said there were many psychological biases that could lead to a gulf between the state of the environment and how people perceived it. Louis said when changes in the environment were gradual it could be difficult for people to notice. \u201cPeople\u2019s opinions can be influenced by a few key species, so if they see whales they feel the oceans must be doing OK, even if many other species are missing and if whales are in much smaller numbers than in past decades,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout specialist training, people may not recognise the difference between environments that are green and full of diverse native plants, and environments that are green and full of weed species.\u201d Louis said much reporting and discussion on the state of nature was focused on \u201cbig ticket\u201d species, such as bilbies or koalas, rather than things people could relate to in their local area. Samuel\u2019s 2020 review of national laws found Australia\u2019s environment was in unsustainable decline and successive Australian governments had failed to protect the country\u2019s unique species and habitats. He said the public\u2019s understanding of the nature crisis was years behind the level of awareness of the climate crisis. He called for a shift in focus from individual charismatic species \u2013 such as the koala \u2013 to flora and fauna generally and what they mean for people. \u201cI think we need a major awareness campaign to bring people up to the same level of awareness and sensitivity to biodiversity as they have for climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to do to raise awareness. It is so important.\u201d The Biodiversity Council\u2019s survey found the majority of respondents were concerned for Australia\u2019s biodiversity, with at least two-thirds very or extremely concerned about waste and pollution, land-clearing, extinction of species and the loss of pollinator species and natural places. About three-quarters (72%) said more money should be spent on the environment. Scientists have estimated about $2bn is needed annually to recover Australia\u2019s full list of almost 2,000 threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. Brendan Wintle, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Melbourne and lead councillor at the Biodiversity Council, said about half of Australia\u2019s economy relied on natural systems. He said the loss of biodiversity would have serious consequences for clean air, food and water, human health, Indigenous culture and national identity. \u201cMany people would be shocked if they realised the actual state of Australia\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Wintle said."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946e2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/20/victoria-to-consider-rent-caps-and-taxes-on-airbnb-owners-to-ease-rental-crisis", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Victoria to consider rent caps and taxes on Airbnb owners to ease rental crisis", "lead": "Exclusive: Greens will support Labor\u2019s state budget in exchange for measures as Yarra council creates emergency fund to help with cost of living ", "author": "Benita Kolovos", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 15:00:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546282", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/228cf7afaf63783003400e758fcdc7cdb5affbd5/0_0_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "The Victorian government will consider introducing rent caps and new taxes on owners of Airbnbs and vacant properties to help ease pressure on renters, under a deal struck with the Greens in exchange for their support for the state budget. Ahead of the last sitting of state parliament before the winter break, the Greens will announce their support for the budget, which includes tax increases for big business, property investors and private schools to pay off the state\u2019s Covid-19 borrowings. In exchange, a taskforce led by deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, which is currently examining measures to boost housing supply, will consider renter safeguards the Greens have been campaigning for. This includes \u201crent caps or other forms of rent control\u201d, \u201cregulation or taxation\u201d of the short-stay industry and \u201cimprovements\u201d to the state\u2019s vacancy tax, according to a letter sent to the Greens by treasurer, Tim Pallas, seen by Guardian Australia. Pallas has also committed to meeting with the Greens each month to discuss the crisis and possible solutions to help fix it. Guardian Australia understands the government has also secured the support of the remaining progressive crossbenchers \u2013 Georgie Purcell from the Animal Justice party and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs \u2013 meaning the bill should pass parliament by the end of the week. It follows weeks of negotiations between the Greens and Labor, during which the minor party had lambasted the government for failing to support renters during the housing affordability crisis. Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, said the party would continue to pressure the government to implement the proposals, as well a two-year rent freeze. \u201cThis is just the beginning of us pushing them to go further and faster to address the rental crisis and address the housing affordability crisis more broadly,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re not easing up on that pressure any time soon. In fact, given how much worse the housing crisis is getting day by day, we\u2019re going to be increasing our pressure on the government to act as a matter of urgency.\u201d It comes as an inner-city Melbourne council on Monday night became the first in the state to create an emergency fund for those struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. From 1 July, people living in Yarra city council experiencing rental stress will be able to access a pool of $100,000. At Monday\u2019s meeting, councillor Stephen Jolly moved an amendment to ensure funds would be allocated specifically for young renters in the area, which takes in the suburbs of Abbotsford, Collingwood, Fitzroy and Richmond, but this was voted down. Instead, the fund will take in all concession card holders who live in the council, as well as homelessness support services. Jolly said could equate to about \u201c30-50%\u201d cut for young people but was hopeful other inner-city councils would follow suit. \u201cIt\u2019s a start, even though I\u2019m disappointed the Greens watered it down. Direct wealth distribution is rare in Australian politics, so this is hopefully a new trend that other councils will follow,\u201d Jolly told Guardian Australia. The council is examining whether it can impose an Airbnb tax on owners in the area. According to open-source database Inside Airbnb, there were 1,608 properties available in the city of Yarra on Airbnb in March this year. Jolly said he was hopeful any revenue derived from such a tax would go directly into the fund announced on Monday. Pressure is also growing within Labor\u2019s ranks to address the housing crisis. The party\u2019s state conference at the weekend unanimously passed motions to make housing a human right, introduce a mandatory inclusionary zoning scheme and provide affordable housing for young people. Another motion to introduce a cap on the number of nights each year an owner can rent out a property as short stay accommodation also passed. The motions are non-binding but play an important role in guiding Labor policy. A government spokesperson said it was working to deliver a pipeline of more housing via its $5.3bn \u201cbig housing build\u201d and build-to-rent incentives but acknowledged more needs to be done. \u201cWhether it\u2019s housing supply, first homebuyer affordability, public housing or renters\u2019 rights \u2013 we know the housing system needs reform,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard on a package of reforms that will come later in the year, and we will have more to say in due course.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946e3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/people-smugglers-migrant-boat-disaster-greece", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Evil people smugglers\u2019 are easy to blame for migrant boat tragedies.

They stand accused of piloting a fishing trawler that sank off the Greek coast last week, leaving hundreds missing and presumed dead in one of the Mediterranean\u2019s worst boat disasters. All have pleaded not guilty. When a mass drowning such as this one hits the headlines, governments squirm as their own culpability is probed. Just weeks ago, the Greek government was accused in the New York Times of involvement with pushbacks of migrant boats, and many questions have been raised about the Greek coastguard\u2019s actions in this latest disaster. In response, ministers follow a well-trodden path and try to divert blame towards \u201cevil people smugglers\u201d. It\u2019s what Priti Patel, the former UK home secretary, did after mass drownings in the Channel in November 2021. No matter that kingpins of smuggling operations generally don\u2019t pilot overloaded leaky boats across dangerous expanses of water. Sometimes, however, impoverished migrants do, in exchange for free or reduced passage. The organisation Alarm Phone \u2013 which monitors migrant boats in distress and alerts coastguards to boats in peril, providing GPS locations and other vital information \u2013 said in a statement that it had emailed the Greek authorities and Frontex, the European border agency, alerting them to the fact that 750 people were on board an overcrowded boat that was in distress near Kalamata. According to a Twitter post, \u201cnobody intervened and the boat capsized\u201d. The organisation appealed to the authorities to \u201cstop blaming people on the move for their own death\u201d. (Greek authorities have claimed that those on the boat repeatedly refused assistance.) While many smugglers may be greedy and ruthless, they are responding to human demand with a form of supply, albeit one that is high-risk and overpriced. Smugglers are not the cause of the mass migration of people searching for survival and safety. Contrary to government adverts, people do not decide to uproot from their families, homes and communities based on a smuggler\u2019s slick TikTok post. In fact the decision to escape is made first and the smuggler is sought second \u2013 often using personal recommendations from within communities rather than social media enticements. The gap between the anti-migrant rhetoric of many heads of government and the rising numbers of people migrating is growing. Rishi Sunak boasted that plans being rolled out to prevent people crossing the Channel in small boats were working, with a 20% reduction in crossings so far this year \u2013 just days before more than 2,000 people crossed in the space of a week. According to the latest data released by the International Organization for Migration\u2019s Missing Migrants Project, in 2022 nearly 3,800 people died on migration routes within and from the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 the highest number since 2017, when 4,255 deaths were recorded. The figures are likely to be an underestimate of the true number of lives lost during irregular migration journeys. Clearly the deterrent mechanisms are not working. The UK sees deporting people who arrive on small boats to Rwanda as the jewel in its deterrent crown. Yet asylum seekers threatened with being sent there say the plan will actually increase people smuggling, as anyone who is sent there will beg or borrow money to pay smugglers a second time to get out of the east African country. Irregular migration undoubtedly poses complex challenges for governments, but achievable pragmatism rather than unachievable rhetoric is required. Can conditions in people\u2019s home countries be improved to prevent some from leaving? Can those who arrive here have their protection claims processed swiftly so they are not forced into expensive, taxpayer-funded limbo while their claims are processed? The scale of the presumed loss of life from this boat is difficult to comprehend. No doubt many people were fearful from the moment they squeezed onboard, but also hopeful that the precarious vessel would take them to a safer place. The yearning to survive is engrained in human DNA irrespective of global postcode. That should be the starting point for government policies to tackle the migration challenge.

The footage of Sunak addressing fellow Conservative MPs, leaked to PinkNews, shows him making fun of Ed Davey after the Liberal Democrat leader said it was possible for a woman to have a penis, which can happen under the government\u2019s own gender recognition laws. Addressing the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories on 5 June, the footage, seemingly shot on a phone held surreptitiously towards the floor, has Sunak\u2019s voice saying Davey \u201chas been very busy\u201d. Sunak went on: \u201cLike me, you can probably see that he was trying to convince everybody that women clearly had penises. You\u2019ll all know that I\u2019m a big fan of everybody studying maths to 18, but it turns out that we need to focus on biology.\u201d The comment was greeted by laughter in the room. While Sunak\u2019s government is opposed to self-recognition for transgender people, as sought by the Scottish government, people are allowed to apply for a gender recognition certificate, changing their gender under law, even if they have not had gender-affirming surgery or treatments, or do not plan to. An unnamed Conservative MP quoted by PinkNews said: \u201cIt is profoundly depressing \u2013 this whole \u2018othering\u2019 of minorities \u2013 pretty much any minority. Without stopping to think we have equalities legislation for a reason, to stop discrimination against anyone with a protected characteristic \u2013 we should be trying to understand and support, not belittle and demonise.\u201d Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said the target of the joke had been Davey, and the general tone of the comments was not different to remarks the prime minister had made before. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the prime minister talk about his enormous compassionate understanding for people questioning their identity and that they should be treated with dignity and respect,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOn this specific issue, these are points he\u2019s made in interviews, publicly \u2026 My understanding is that this was a joke aimed at a political opponent rather than a specific group.\u201d Asked if Sunak would use any other minority group as the punchline for a joke, the spokesperson said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that characterisation.

In a sign No 10 wants to defuse the blue-on-blue row over the former prime minister\u2019s conduct as quickly as possible, Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said he was not planning to attend parliament on Monday due to \u201ccommitments that he can\u2019t move\u201d. The duties were said to include welcoming the prime minister of Sweden to Downing Street and a series of other meetings. Monday evening\u2019s vote will be the culmination of a 14-month inquiry by a cross-party group of MPs into Johnson\u2019s Partygate denials, which found he committed five contempts of parliament. As well as deliberately misleading the Commons, Johnson misled the privileges committee behind the investigation, the inquiry concluded. He was also found to have partially leaked its findings, been complicit in a campaign of abuse against its members and undermined parliament\u2019s democratic processes. MPs will have up to five-and-a-half hours to debate the report from 4.30pm on Monday. Commons sources suggested it was likely to take four hours, based on the number of MPs who wanted to speak. At the end, a vote will be held on endorsing the findings, which recommended Johnson should be blocked from getting a pass for former MPs allowing him privileged access to parliament. The sanction was proposed by the privileges committee because it was not able to enforce the 90-day suspension it was going to recommend, as Johnson quit as an MP last week. No 10 would not say definitively whether Sunak would abstain on the vote, given it may go through uncontested \u2013 meaning there will not be a formal division and instead the report will go through \u201con the nod\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we know yet whether there will be a vote on this issue,\u201d said Sunak\u2019s spokesperson. Asked whether the prime minister planned to attend the Commons if there was a vote, they said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got his schedule for today, which doesn\u2019t include attending parliament, but obviously we will see how the timings play out.\u201d Johnson\u2019s supporters were said over the weekend to be planning to abstain on the vote as well. The move was viewed as a sign of Johnson\u2019s weak grip over the parliamentary party he once commanded, signalling his allies\u2019 fears of demonstrating how few in number they were. Several Tory MPs have indicated they will endorse the report. But the Brexiter backbencher William Cash wrote in an article for the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cI shall vote against the motion that approves the committee on privileges\u2019 report because I do not believe it serves parliament well.\u201d Though Downing Street and Johnson have sought to avoid holding a formal division whereby MPs must register their vote in the \u201caye\u201d or \u201cno\u201d lobby, there were increasing signs that Labour would push for one. Multiple sources told the Guardian they were confident there would be such a vote, which would force each Tory MP to register their view on the matter."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946e7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/macron-rugby-club-beer-stunt-sparks-binge-drinking-row", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Macron\u2019s rugby club beer stunt sparks binge-drinking row", "lead": "French president accused of irresponsibility and toxic masculinity after downing beer in 17 seconds", "author": "Angelique Chrisafis in Paris", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:45:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546370", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3f4e6176ef1ac529b412d242f813e6e08b6ced/404_0_1464_879/500.jpg", "body": "Footage of Emmanuel Macron downing a bottle of beer in 17 seconds in a rugby club dressing room has prompted a political row about binge drinking and accusations of toxic masculinity. The video shows the French president being handed a bottle of Corona in the Toulouse changing room after they beat La Rochelle at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday. Urged to down the beer in one, Macron drains the bottle to cheers from coaching staff and players, then proudly slams the empty bottle down on the counter. \u201cToxic masculinity in political leadership in one image,\u201d tweeted Sandrine Rousseau, an MP for the Green party. \u201cA president who is sharing in the joy of 23 players and taking part in their traditions. That\u2019s all,\u201d replied Jean-Ren\u00e9 Cazeneuve, an MP from Macron\u2019s centrist party. The choice of Corona beer \u2013 favourite drink of the late rightwing president Jacques Chirac \u2013 led to comments about whether Macron was using it to make overtures to the right, or whether, after accusations that he is out of touch, he was trying to show he was a man of the people. When Macron was filmed having a beer in Kinshasa in March, during the French pensions crisis, he was accused of being cut off from ordinary concerns back home. Most of the commentary, however, centred on Macron\u2019s stance on alcohol. He is a strong supporter of France\u2019s wine industry, once claiming he regularly drank a glass of wine at lunch and another in the evening. He has been seen to have defended the wine and alcohol lobby by blocking attempts by public health authorities to promote \u201cDry January\u201d. The daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration recalled that in 2018 Macron had told local newspapers in an interview that rather than wine being a problem, it was the binge-drinking of beer and spirits that was dangerous for young people. He said there was a public health problem \u201cwhen young people get drunk at high-speed with strong alcohol or beer\u201d. Lib\u00e9ration said Macron was now showing off his own \u201chigh-speed\u201d drinking. Bernard Basset, from the charity Association Addictions France, told BFMTV: \u201cThe president has a responsibility as a role model in terms of setting a healthy example for behaviour \u2026 In this case, he\u2019s associating sport, parties and the consumption of alcohol in a context of virile peer pressure where everyone drinks a bit too much.\u201d William Lowenstein, a doctor and addiction specialist, told the BFMTV: \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate \u2026 You could do it, but not in front of the cameras.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946e8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/share-your-stories-about-your-first-loves", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share your stories about your first loves", "lead": "We would like to hear from people about their first love, why it mattered and if you still think about them now", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:43:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546387", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7143eea60ff3ae6ebf77d98ae695644bdada3b/0_330_5100_3061/500.jpg", "body": "Do you remember your first love?

He is now nearing the end of a seven-month theatre tour. It must be tiring by this stage, I suggest. But no, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really the one thing that I enjoy doing more than anything. Performing on stage is kind of a release for me.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt sounds a bit heavy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Nicholas is about to release the audio version of the memoir he wrote during lockdown, which covers his career from failed rock singer to successful pop star, from being the first actor to play the lead in Jesus Christ Superstar to being part of the original cast of Cats, appearing in numerous films including the cult hit Tommy and the 80s BBC sitcom Just Good Friends. In recent years, Nicholas has appeared in EastEnders and the reality show version of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, among others. Over a video call from a low-cost hotel room, he seems fun and lacking in self-importance, as does his book. It made me laugh, often intentionally \u2013 going to dinner in Paris with Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin in the 60s, 24-year-old Nicholas is taken to a restaurant where they serve only flowers and he asks for chips with them. But sometimes it\u2019s just his turn of phrase, almost Partridgean at times. On being asked to invest in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical: \u201cNow, I had saved a bit, but not enough that I wanted to blow it on a show about cats.\u201d His inclusion of a Private Eye report on his father, the flamboyant showbiz lawyer Oscar Beuselinck, made me laugh out loud: \u201cNever marry,\u201d warned Oscar, who had divorced three times. \u201cI reckon my cock has cost me \u00a3100,000 per inch.\u201d With a father like that, says Nicholas, \u201cyou could either go the other way and become a priest or you could find yourself expressing yourself with a similar kind of humour at times, which of course is deeply inappropriate. I have to be careful, but I still find myself making mistakes, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Later, he asks me if I \u201cdetect an old dinosaur\u201d. \u201cHaving grown up in the 60s, and having that freedom to say what you want, now we\u2019ve regressed a little bit. Overall, it\u2019s good that people are more careful about how they speak about others, but there is a willingness among some people to be offended.\u201d His book is so un-PC that it\u2019s almost quaint. On at least two occasions, Nicholas describes female co-stars, of similar vintage to him (he is 78), as \u201cstill an attractive lady\u201d, as if it\u2019s surprising at their advanced age. His wife, Linzi, to whom he has been married for more than 50 years, is always telling him off, he says. Recounting a sex scene in one film, he writes that he gives his co-star \u2013 who happens to be the wife of the director \u2013 a \u201ctongue sandwich\u201d. \u201cDid I say that? Please forgive me,\u201d he says with a laugh, but also looking aghast. \u201cI think I was overdramatising the tongue. It sounds very energetic, and I wouldn\u2019t have been that energetic.\u201d During the second world war, Nicholas\u2019s father apparently worked for MI6 \u201cbecause he could speak Flemish, so he was quite useful\u201d. His mother, Peggy, worked at Bletchley Park, and he likes to say she cracked the Enigma code \u201cbut she wasn\u2019t a codebreaker, though she wasn\u2019t bad at crosswords\u201d. Until Oscar, who had started at a law firm as a tea boy at 14, advanced through the ranks and then specialised in showbiz \u2013 he brokered contracts for the Beatles and Sean Connery, among others \u2013 the family wasn\u2019t well off. They moved in with Nicholas\u2019s grandmother on a council estate in north London until Nicholas was seven. Then Oscar bought a house and, later, once his parents had separated, Nicholas and his mother lived in a flat. It was his mother who took him to the cinema and introduced him to performing. England in the late 40s and 50s, he says, \u201cseemed to be a very grey place, but colour in my life came through film \u2013 and I particularly liked musical films. I used to go home and imitate Gene Kelly, tap dance on the lino.\u201d Nicholas was in bands while still at school, including his own, Paul Dean and the Dreamers, but \u201cwe weren\u2019t really going anywhere\u201d. When his guitarist joined Screaming Lord Sutch\u2019s band, the Savages, Nicholas went to see them. \u201cI was amazed at [Sutch], who had really long hair down to his shoulders in 1961, which no one had. I loved his act. He lit a fire on stage; it was a very outrageous act.\u201d Nicholas joined the band. \u201cWhat was great about that for me was that it wasn\u2019t just standing there singing; there was a sense of theatre about it. Much more fun.\u201d During Sutch\u2019s song Jack the Ripper, Nicholas dressed up as one of the serial killer\u2019s victims and would be murdered on stage every night by Sutch, who would hold aloft a pair of bloodied rubber lungs; at one point, he started using animal hearts procured from the butcher. When Sutch, the founder of the Monster Raving Loony party, stood for parliament against Harold Wilson in 1966, Nicholas ran around in leopardskin, handing out leaflets. Nicholas\u2019s next band toured with the Who, then he tried to become a solo star and was taken on by a manager, Robert Stigwood, who would go on to manage Cream and the Bee Gees. The Who\u2019s Pete Townshend wrote a song for him, as did the Bee Gees (who sang backing vocals on his single) and a young David Bowie. \u201cHe was very stylish, as you would imagine, even then,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cHe was quite serious, I thought, for a young man. He told me about learning to be a mime artist and did a bit of mime for me, you know, putting the hands on the windows.\u201d The song Bowie wrote, Over the Wall We Go, inspired by a number of jailbreaks, was banned by the BBC, says Nicholas. \u201cIt was too outrageous to become a hit. I had really quite a long go at becoming a pop star without any success.\u201d He took an office job at a music publisher \u2013 by then he was married with two children and it was stable work \u2013 but when auditions came up for a new musical, Hair, inspired by the hippy counterculture, he went. He got the lead role. The musical opened in 1968, the day after a 200-year-old legal act censoring plays was abolished. \u201cThere was a freedom,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cIt was the beginning of women becoming freer. It was kind of throwing off the shackles of the 50s. All that music was happening here. It was a big awakening for London and the UK, and Hair was part of that. It was exciting.\u201d Sometimes cast members would smoke weed on stage. \u201cYou\u2019d think: \u2018We\u2019re supposed to be playing hippies, we aren\u2019t really hippies.\u2019\u201d Next, Nicholas auditioned for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice\u2019s musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Lloyd Webber, he remembers, was \u201cvery foppish. He was in the style of the moment, but quite flamboyant, quite gentlemanly, in some ways rather 18th-century.\u201d The musical was exciting, he says, \u201cbecause it was considered to be a rather taboo subject, calling Jesus Christ a \u2018superstar\u2019. A superstar in those days was pretty out-there.\u201d There were protests outside; it was Nicholas\u2019s \u201cfirst experience of really being in the limelight\u201d. After Grease with Elaine Paige, \u201cI thought: \u2018You haven\u2019t done any real straight acting.\u2019\u201d He was invited to do Much Ado About Nothing at the Young Vic. \u201cI bought the play, had a look at it and didn\u2019t understand it. If you don\u2019t know Shakespeare, it takes some interpretation.\u201d There was a snobbishness that musical theatre actors weren\u2019t considered \u201cproper\u201d actors. \u201cNot by them all, but by one particular actor who was in it. We had a few cross words in the wings one night and a slight dust-up, not major, and then we had to go on and be friends in the play.\u201d An opportunity to play Hamlet in a musical version in New York fell through because Nicholas couldn\u2019t get a work visa. \u201cI wasn\u2019t considered a name worthy enough in America to usurp an American actor,\u201d he says. And so Nicholas decided he needed to become famous. The best way, he thought, was to become a pop star after all. Incredibly, he managed it \u2013 he had three UK hits, including two Top 10s, and got on to Top of the Pops. I don\u2019t even know how to describe one of his hits, Reggae Like It Used to Be. One YouTube comment under his flare-wearing performance perhaps sums it up: \u201cThis might just be the whitest thing anyone\u2019s ever done.\u201d Nicholas smiles when I say this might get him cancelled now. It wasn\u2019t a reggae song, he says in (feeble) defence, \u201cit was a song about reggae\u201d. He was a bubblegum popstar and teen heart-throb, even though he was in his early 30s. \u201cI even got an afternoon pop TV show, which I hosted, called Paul, so I was really out there as a young pop singer, even though I was rather an old pop singer.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut I was playing a character.\u201d He\u2019d tried to be like a pop star, he says \u2013 he would go to fashionable clubs to drink vodka. \u201cBut I was crap at it. I used to go home and throw up.\u201d By then, he had split up from his first wife and was in a relationship with Linzi, but he had a lot of attention from female fans. \u201cAs a result, my darling lady decided that things shouldn\u2019t be continuing as they were and decided to leave, which she did. Which was difficult.\u201d Things got even worse \u2013 his first wife was killed in a car crash, and he became sole parent to their two children (he also had two from before his first marriage). \u201cLinzi came back and helped me through that terrible time, and we\u2019ve been together ever since. It was a horrible, horrible time for everybody and without her I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done. She took on two children and our family.\u201d Later, they got married and had two more children. \u201cIt\u2019s been like that ever since, except they\u2019ve all gone \u2013 now the grandchildren are coming.\u201d He has six children, 13 or 14 grandchildren \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t added them up lately\u201d \u2013 and three great-grandchildren. How much of his long marriage was down to a reaction against his father\u2019s philandering? \u201cWell, when I was 16, if you were in a band, it was one-night stands, because you were never home long enough to have a girlfriend.\u201d Linzi, he says, \u201cwas the stable thing that I needed, and she has given me that over the years. I don\u2019t quite know what I\u2019ve given her.\u201d His father, he thinks, was a shy man whose sexual bragging may not have been entirely true. \u201cI think most of it was bullshit. I think it was reserved for other men, rather than women. He always seemed to me very courteous around ladies. He was in a profession that was quite strait-laced, but he was dealing with showbusiness people, who were the opposite, and I think that was part of his charm for them.\u201d In 1980, Nicholas was cast in Cats, which opened the year after. \u201cI went over to [Lloyd Webber\u2019s] place, and he played me these songs and I said: \u2018Oh yeah, nice tunes.\u2019 At Sydmonton Court, his home, he does this kind of festival every year where he tries things out, and so we performed Cats for 200 people in a church in his back garden. He seemed very pleased with it and the audience seemed to take to it.\u201d He regrets not investing money in the production when he was asked. \u201cIt became probably the biggest hit that Andrew has ever had.\u201d Nicholas, who played the rebel Rum Tum Tugger, was not as good a dancer as the others, and would run around the audience during the main dance piece. In his book, he recalls ruffling the hair around the bald spot of Prince Charles, sitting in the audience. \u201cHe seemed quite amused by it.\u201d The BBC sitcom Just Good Friends, written by the Only Fools and Horses creator John Sullivan and centred on his on-off relationship with his posher ex-lover (played by Jan Francis), cemented Nicholas\u2019s mainstream fame in the mid-80s. It wasn\u2019t that he wanted fame for fame\u2019s sake, he says: \u201cYou never really have got control in this business, because you\u2019re always reliant on someone calling you, but you stand more chance of [getting] work if you have a name.\u201d It was one reason he successfully went into producing, with an actor friend, David Ian. They put on Jesus Christ Superstar. \u201cI said: I\u2019ll play Jesus. That was good of me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d His other successful shows include Grease and Saturday Night Fever in the West End. He is still looking for opportunities \u2013 he writes songs and made an album recently, and has written two sitcoms, which he is hoping to develop. \u201cYou have to be a realist. I can\u2019t play young romantic leads and do those things, but there are parts out there for older people. It\u2019s such a terrible cliche, but if you do have dreams, follow them, because you\u2019re only here once. Give it a go, and if you muck up, too bad, but you\u2019ve had a go.\u201d What has he learned about showbusiness in all these years? He thinks for a moment, looking slightly as if he can\u2019t believe his luck. \u201cI think the one abiding passion is to keep going.\u201d \u2022 Musicals, Marigolds &amp; Me is released on 26 June, and is available to pre-order now on Amazon, Audible and iTunes"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ea", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/football-daily-email-euro-2024-qualifiers", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football Daily | Yet more qualifiers designed to ensure the rich countries can\u2019t fail", "lead": "<strong>In today\u2019s Football Daily:</strong> England\u2019s Euros expectations and more", "author": "Daniel Harris", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:42:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546421", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eb9c5d51cecc5fa540410cfc5999f82e7334329d/0_235_4830_2898/500.jpg", "body": "HERE\u2019S A HYMN TO WELCOME IN THE DAY There\u2019s nothing like an exciting game, and England v North Macedonia is nothing like an exciting game.

Alfred Dorris, 49, was acquitted by a jury at the Old Bailey of health and safety offences in the 2016 crash. The tram derailed at a sharp corner when travelling at three times the speed limit. The unanimous verdict was reached after less than two hours of deliberation, in the prosecution brought by the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, against the driver and transport companies involved. The ORR also prosecuted the operators of the track and the tram service, Transport for London and the First Group-owned Tram Operations Limited (TOL). Both pleaded guilty to health and safety failings earlier in the case, in 2022, and will be sentenced at a later date. Prosecutors had alleged that Dorris was paying insufficient attention, possibly due to a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d, when the crash occurred in the early morning of 9 November 2016, which seriously injured 21 passengers as well as causing the seven fatalities. The court had been told that Dorris, of Beckenham, south London, was driving the tram at 70kph (42mph), more than three times the 20kph speed limit, when the tram derailed. However, a similar incident had occurred just over a week earlier on the service with another driver, jurors were told. Dorris denied he had a \u201cmicro-sleep\u201d and said he became disoriented in the tunnel on approach to the curve \u2013 blaming a combination of external factors including poor lighting and signage around the tunnel, darkness and bad weather. Dorris, who had been excused from attending a 2021 inquest because of post-traumatic stress, apologised to the victims\u2019 families and survivors as he spoke publicly for the first time about the crash while giving tearful evidence at the Old Bailey. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control of. I\u2019m sorry that I became disorientated. I\u2019m sorry I was not able to do anything to stop myself from becoming disorientated. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply sorry I was not able to do anything to reorientate myself and stop the tram from turning over. I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d Survivors described being \u201cflung\u201d about as if in a washing machine as the tram rolled over. Dorris was found in his cabin with his eyes shut and one passenger called for him to \u201cwake up\u201d. In court, Dorris broke down as he recalled the moments before the crash. He said: \u201cIt was like I went into shock. I could not do anything. I wanted to reach for the brake but at that stage the tram was already going over and I was thrown out of the chair and I could not do anything. \u201cI can remember being thrown from the chair to the side of the cabin and my shoulder took the impact and I hit the side of my head on the side of the cabin.\u201d Prosecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman KC told jurors: \u201cWhether by virtue of a micro-sleep, or by virtue of becoming disorientated in some other way, or a combination of the two, Mr Dorris failed to attend to the most basic of requirements of a driver of a passenger vehicle, namely remaining alert and attentive at the controls.\u201d Dorris was described as having an \u201cimpeccable\u201d past record and was seen as one of the better drivers. The court was told of the previous \u201cnear-miss\u201d on the service, where Dorris\u2019s defence barrister, Miles Bennett, said a passenger had \u201cgenuinely feared for their safety\u201d. Accident investigators in 2017 found that another tram had come close to overturning nine days earlier, while drivers warned that they needed to brake heavily when approaching the bend. The Old Bailey jurors were not told of the findings of the 2021 inquest, which ruled that the deaths were accidental. The inquest\u2019s narrative verdict also found that the tram\u2019s operator TOL had failed to account for the risk of a high-speed derailment, or create a \u201cjust culture\u201d at the firm that would allow drivers to report health and safety concerns. The people who died were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, Robert Huxley, 63, and Philip Logan, 52, all from New Addington, and Donald Collett, 62, and Mark Smith, 35, both from Croydon. Some relatives of the victims were in court, while others attended by video link from Croydon. The granddaughter of Philip Logan, Danielle Wynne, said the verdict was \u201cdeflating\u201d, adding: \u201cThere has to be some kind of accountability. As far as I\u2019m concerned, accident or not, he\u2019s taken no accountability for his actions that morning.\u201d The ORR said: \u201cWe conducted an extensive, detailed and thorough investigation and took the decision to prosecute TfL, TOL and driver Alfred Dorris for what we believed to be serious health and safety failings. \u201cWe note the decision reached and will consider this appropriately. Our thoughts remain with those affected by the tragedy.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ec", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/ireland-debate-military-neutrality-president-michael-d-higgins-government", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ireland \u2018playing with fire\u2019 for opening debate on military neutrality, says president", "lead": "Michael D Higgins says government risks burying country in other people\u2019s agendas amid \u2018drift\u2019 towards Nato", "author": "Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:30:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546456", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/47436e0cf2b9fcb0094d3838bb9ce19be5703758/0_95_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Ireland\u2019s president has rebuked the government for launching a debate about the country\u2019s longstanding military neutrality and the possibility of joining Nato, saying ministers were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. Michael D Higgins accused the government of a dangerous \u201cdrift\u201d from a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy and said it risked \u201cburying\u201d Ireland in other people\u2019s agendas. The intervention, made in an interview with the Business Post newspaper on Sunday, puts a spotlight on a government-sponsored forum on international security, where Ireland\u2019s neutrality will be debated. It also raises questions on the role of the president, who occupies a largely ceremonial post. On Monday, Higgins apologised for a \u201cthrowaway remark\u201d in the interview about the forum\u2019s independent chair, Louise Richardson, who he said had \u201ca very large DBE \u2013 Dame of the British Empire\u201d \u2013 implying that she was biased towards the UK. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s grand but, you know, I think there were a few candidates I could have come up with myself.\u201d Richardson, an Irish academic and counter-terrorism expert, is a former vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford who sits on the boards of the Booker Prize Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation philanthropic foundation. Several politicians had called the president\u2019s comments unfair. In a statement, his office said: \u201cHe apologises for any offence which he may have inadvertently caused to Prof Richardson by what was a throwaway remark.\u201d However, the president did not recant other views expressed in the interview, which sharpened the debate about Ireland\u2019s military neutrality in the era of Russian aggression under Vladimir Putin. The arrival of Ukrainian refugees, incursions by Russian ships that are suspected of mapping underwater cables and a 2021 ransomware attack by suspected Russian gangs on the health service have raised questions about Ireland\u2019s meagre security resources. The justice minister, Helen McEntee, defended holding the forum. \u201cThe president himself knows what the boundaries are here, and he expressed his views. Many would agree with him, there are many who would disagree, and that\u2019s why we need to have this forum,\u201d she told the Newstalk radio network. Neale Richmond, the junior enterprise minister, said the president had sailed \u201cclose to the line\u201d. Ireland has joined UN peacekeeping missions but shunned military alliances and invested little in defence compared with other countries. Critics accuse it of saving money and claiming the moral high ground while sheltering beneath a Nato umbrella. Miche\u00e1l Martin, the deputy prime minister, said the government did not intend to abandon military neutrality but that the forum would explore evolving security needs. Ireland has previously convened citizens\u2019 assemblies to debate constitutional changes such as ending an abortion ban. The upcoming consultative forum involves experts, academics and service personnel as well as citizens. They will meet on 22-27 June in Cork, Galway and Dublin. Anxiety about Russia prompted Finland to become Nato\u2019s 31st member in April. Sweden also abandoned decades of non-alignment this year but objections from Turkey and Hungary have delayed it joining Nato."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/19/raw-milk-the-ultimate-dairy-product-is-back-but-is-it-safe", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Raw milk: the ultimate dairy product is back \u2013 but is it safe?", "lead": "Tom Parker Bowles has spoken out in favour of unpasteurised milk, along with much of TikTok.

Age: Ancient. Status: The hot new milk that everyone has to try! I\u2019m already confused. How can something be ancient and new at the same time? Oh, that\u2019s easy. People used to drink raw milk for centuries. Then they stopped. Now, they\u2019re drinking it again. Interesting. Why did they stop? There\u2019s a chance that they died of food poisoning from drinking all that raw milk. Sorry, what? Anyway, hey! Raw milk is the best drink in the world and you should try it. Even the queen\u2019s son says so. But didn\u2019t you just say \u2026 This weekend, Tom Parker Bowles wrote that raw milk has endured \u201cno pasteurisation, homogenisation or standardisation, meaning it still contains the full complement of vitamins, minerals and natural digestive enzymes, as well as providing the most lusciously creamy mouthful of pure dairy delight; rich, sweet and voluptuously full-bodied.\u201d Oh, that sounds quite nice. Remember, we\u2019re talking about the queen\u2019s son here. A litre of raw milk costs about \u00a33.50, compared with \u00a31.35 for the same amount of the usual stuff at a supermarket. Is it worth the expense? As a food fad, raw milk is growing in popularity. Aside from Parker Bowles, a fleet of TikTok influencers cannot overstate how good it is. Why do I feel a \u201cbut\u201d coming on? But, I mean, where to start? Pasteurisation has saved countless lives, because it eliminates bacteria such as E coli, salmonella, listeria and campylobacter; these can cause illnesses that \u2013 not to be too delicate \u2013 tend to leave you pallid, sweaty and blasting hot liquid jets from both ends at once. Blimey. Sorry. But raw milk is banned in Scotland. Additionally, in 2016, 65 cases of food poisoning were linked to a vending machine in Cumbria that dispensed raw milk. Reputable vendors claim their raw milk is perfectly safe (as long as it\u2019s kept fresh), but one study found that Americans who eat and drink raw dairy products are more than 800 times more likely to contract food poisoning than people who choose pasteurised ones. I\u2019ll stick to semi-skimmed then. No! Don\u2019t do that, either. Do you know what enormous emitters of greenhouse gases cows are? Industrial livestock farming is a huge contributor to the climate emergency. Almond milk? No! While it\u2019s better for the environment than cow milk, it takes 74 litres of water just to make one glass of almond milk. It represents a huge strain on the planet\u2019s resources, especially in areas where the almonds are grown. Oat? Soy? Rice? All require water and cause greenhouse emissions. Aargh! What do I do? Honestly, would it be such a sacrifice to drink your tea black?

For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of the darkest chapter in US history with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts. The US government was slow to embrace the occasion \u2013 it was only in 2021 that Joe Biden, who had been inaugurated that January, signed a bill passed by Congress to set aside 19 June as a federal Juneteenth holiday. And just as more people learn the historical details and traditions of Juneteenth, the holiday\u2019s message is facing modern pressures \u2013 especially political rhetoric, policies and laws censoring history and condemning efforts to teach Americans about the nation\u2019s racial history. Then there are issues such as companies using the holiday chiefly as a marketing event with little beneath the superficial, and people partying without taking the trouble to learn why there are commemorations and celebrations. How did Juneteenth start? The celebrations began with enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. Although president Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation officially freed all from slavery in 1863, it could not be enforced in many places in the south until the civil war ended in 1865. Even then, some white people who had profited from enslaved labor were reluctant to share the news. Laura Smalley, freed from a plantation near Bellville, Texas, remembered in a 1941 interview that the man she referred to as \u201cold master\u201d came home from fighting in the civil war and didn\u2019t tell the people he enslaved what had happened. \u201cOld master didn\u2019t tell, you know, they was free,\u201d Smalley said. \u201cI think now they say they worked them, six months after that. Six months. And turn them loose on the 19th of June. That\u2019s why, you know, we celebrate that day.\u201d News that the war had ended and they were free finally reached Galveston when the Union major general Gordon Granger and his troops arrived in the Gulf coast city on 19 June 1865, more than two months after the Confederate forces had surrendered. Granger delivered General Order No 3, which said: \u201cThe people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\u201d Slavery was permanently abolished six months later, when Georgia ratified the 13th amendment. And the next year, the now-free people of Galveston started celebrating Juneteenth. Are there other titles used for Juneteenth? It\u2019s sometimes also called Juneteenth Independence Day, Freedom Day, second Independence Day and Emancipation Day. It began with church picnics and speeches, and spread as Black Texans moved elsewhere. Most US states now hold celebrations. Opal Lee, a former teacher and activist, is largely credited for rallying others behind a campaign to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. The 96-year-old had vivid memories of celebrating Juneteenth in east Texas as a child with music, food and games and she rallied support from her home city of Fort Worth all the way to Washington DC, Lee was one of the people standing next to Biden when he signed Juneteenth into law. How have Juneteenth celebrations evolved over the years? The national reckoning over race ignited by the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police helped set the stage for Juneteenth to become the first new federal holiday since 1983, when Martin Luther King Jr Day was created. Now there is a movement to use the holiday as an opportunity for activism and education, with community service projects aimed at addressing racial disparities and educational panels on topics such as healthcare inequities and the need for parks and green spaces. Like most holidays, Juneteenth has also seen its fair share of commercialism. Retailers, museums and other venues have capitalized on it by selling Juneteenth-themed T-shirts, party ware and ice cream. Some of the marketing has misfired, provoking a social media backlash. Supporters of the holiday have also worked to make sure Juneteenth celebrators do not forget why the day exists. \u201cIn 1776 the country was freed from the British, but the people were not all free,\u201d Dee Evans, national director of communications of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, said in 2019. \u201cJune 19, 1865, was actually when the people and the entire country was actually free.\u201d Associated Press contributed reporting"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/19/uk-mortgage-rates-housing-summer-slowdown-rightmove-interest-rates-bank-of-england-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Average two-year fixed rate mortgage deal hits 6% for first time this year, as Sunak rules out extra help \u2013 business live", "lead": "Average mortgage rates hit highest level since December, as asking prices for British homes fall in June for the first time in six years", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:21:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546527", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f69d504edc21f76cc7dbb999b836914e96265f58/0_395_5951_3570/500.jpg", "body": "A quick recap\u2026 The cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage in the UK has risen above 6 per cent today for the first time this year, as thr turmoil in the property sector continued. Average two-year fixed mortgage rates hit 6.01%, from 5.98% on Friday, financial data provider Moneyfacts reported. The rise came as investors anticipate another increase in Bank of England base rate on Thursday, probably from 4.5% to 4.75%. The financial markets now believe there is a greater than evens chance that UK interest rates hit 6% by early next year. UK government borrowing costs continued to climb, with the two-year gilt yield hitting 5% for the first time since 2008. That will put further upward pressure on mortgage prices. Increased borrowing costs have prompted some lender to withdraw deals, while other products have been repriced with higher interest rates in the last month. Rising interest rates means people looking to remortgage their homes will pay an average \u00a32,900 a year more from 2024, the Resolution Foundation think tank predicted. But despite the squeeze, prime minister Rishi Sunak sounds unwilling to provide specific help for mortgage holders. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Sunak said: \u201cI know the anxiety people will have about the mortgage rates, that is why the first priority I set out at the beginning of the year was to halve inflation because that is the best and most important way that we can keep costs and interest rates down for people. Consumer champion Martin Lewis accused chancellor Jeremy Hunt, and UK banks and regulators, of missing the opportunity to agree protections for mortgage holders before rates surged. Asking prices for British homes fell in June for the first time in six years, as rising interest rates hit the markets and dragged forward the usual summer slowdown. But retail chain Next has lifted its profit forecasts, reporting that sales have been much stronger in recent weeks than expected. It attributed this increase to the better weather (more demand for summer clothes) and recent pay rises\u2026 And in other news: Former UK prime minister Liz Truss has been sharing some little gems of wisdom from her time in office. Speaking at the European Broadcasting Union\u2019s NewsXchange conference in Dublin today, Truss argued that the U.K. was, and still is, in \u201cserious economic trouble\u201d, Politico reports. Truss, who left office after 45 days after her government\u2019s mini-budget backfired, causing turmoil in the markets, said she needed to be \u201cbold\u201d to reverse declining economic growth. She admitted she lacked support from Tory MPs and \u201ccould have gone a bit slower\u201d with her economic reforms. But Truss also criticised the UK media\u2019s coverage of politics, saying: \u201cI do think sometimes politics is sort of treated as a branch of the entertainment industry, who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down, who says what about who. \u201cI think the level of understanding of economic ideas in the media and the ability to explain them is very poor indeed.\u201d The pound hit a record low in the aftermath of Truss\u2019s mini-budget, as traders were concerned by the package of unfunded tax cuts announced by chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. UK bond yields jumped, but then recovered some ground after the Bank of England launched an emergency intervention last September. Another UK interest rate rise looks almost certain on Thursday, but the market view of further borrowing cost increases is \u201ctoo pessimistic\u201d, says economic forecasters at EY ITEM Club. They argue that the ingredients for an improvement in the inflation outlook means current market expectations of rates peaking at close to 6% early next year look too pessimistic. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: \u201cRecent surveys from the Bank of England and Citi/YouGov show inflation expectations among the public continuing to decline. The Bank of England\u2019s own Decision Maker Panel survey of businesses also suggested pay and price expectations have eased in recent months. And there remain good reasons to think the fall in inflation since last autumn will gather pace, as powerful base effects kick in, a slowdown in pipeline price pressures feeds through to consumer prices, household energy bills fall on the back of a significant decline in wholesale prices, and the consequences of a marked slowdown in monetary growth leaves its mark. May\u2019s inflation report, due on Wednesday, will also influence the Bank\u2019s thinking\u2026. Consumer finance champion Martin Lewis has criticised the government, and the financial sector, for not taking action sooner to protect mortgage-payers from rising interest rates. In a post on Twitter, Lewis explains that he warned last autumn of a \u201cmortgage ticking time bomb\u201d as people\u2019s existing fixed-rate deals came to an end. Lewis says, a mortgage summit called last December by chancellor Jeremy Hunt proved to only be \u201ca missed opportunity talking shop...\u201d Lewis says he pushed for \u201ceasy to agree forbearance and help measures\u201d to assist those facing higher mortgage costs, But, Lewis says, his push for real changes met push back from the banks, and sometimes from the FCA, the City regulator, too. He writes: For example 1. Any help options should be easily reversible on request. Eg if you extend your term, to reduce payments, when things improve you should have an automatic right to reduce the term. Knowing there is a reversibility option gets rid of a barrier to action - without reversibility people are scared to be locked into a longer mortgage (which means more interest). 2. It should have no or minimal impact on people\u2019s credit scores (as it did in the pandemic). Again negative credit file impact is a big barrier to action - as it leaves people reticent to make a decision, which can lead to snowballing problems. None of the suggestions have seen any real fruition. The attention faded, especially when rates didn\u2019t rise as sharply as first expected. Next has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after upgrading its profit forecasts today. Next\u2019s shares are up 4.7%, while other retailers such as Primark-owner AB Foods (+2.5%) and Frasers (+2%) are also gaining. Just in: High street retailer Next has just upgraded its profit forecasts for the year, and cited warmer weather and recent pay rises received by UK workers. In an unscheduled trading update, Next says that trading in the last seven weeks has been \u201cmaterially better\u201d than the guidance it issued in May. Full price sales in the first seven weeks of the second quarter were up +9.3% versus last year, strongly ahead of Next\u2019s guidance of a 5% fall in full price sales. In the period, Next have beaten its full price sales estimates by \u00a393m. It has now lifted its full year profit guidance by \u00a340m to \u00a3835m. Next tells shareholders that the recent change in weather (after a damp and windy spring) has boosted sales, saying: The onset of warmer weather has made a significant difference to our performance, particularly coming after a wet and cold April. Next also suspects that annual salary increases are spurring spending at its shops \u2013 a comment that may alarm the Bank of England as it tries to prevent inflation becoming embedded in the economy. Next explains: For example, during April annual inflation was running at 8.7% and monthly inflation was 1.2%; if an individual received a pay rise of 5.0%, then their real income would have risen by 3.8% in that month. We do not think it is a coincidence that sales stepped forward so markedly at a time of year when many organisations make their annual pay awards. Last week\u2019s employment report showed that regular pay excluding bonuses increased by 7.2% in the three months to April, the fastest in 20 years. The rise in UK mortgage rates to 6% will put a tighter squeeze on borrowers who need to remortgage. Economists at ING explain that a typical houseowner refinancing their home loan would be paying close to 40% of their average disposable income on mortgage repayments. ING say: If we look at the mortgage market \u2013 the main transmission mechanism for interest rates \u2013 then 6% rates would mean a homeowner with a 75% loan-to-value ratio would, on average, be paying close to 40% of their disposable income on repayments. That compares to roughly 30% at the peak going into the 2008 financial crisis. The difference between now and then is that the share of households with a mortgage has fallen, and more people own their home outright now. And more importantly, around 90% of mortgages are fixed \u2013 predominantly for five years \u2013 a huge sea change compared to 10+ years ago when most were on variable rates. The result is that the length of time rates stay elevated is now arguably more important than the level, and the impact of 5%+ mortgage rates for a prolonged period would be large. The Bank of England is also right to highlight that the impact of past rate hikes is only now beginning to bite as a greater number of mortgage holders refinance. The curent turmoil in the mortgage market could have long-term consequences for retirement plans and pension incomes, warns Gary Smith, partner in financial planning at UK wealth manager Evelyn Partners. Smith says the increase in mortgage costs, and rents, is bound to have a disruptive effect on saving (assuming people had enough money left over to put aside anyway), adding: \u201cImpacts could be felt right from younger savers looking to get on the housing ladder who cut back on pension saving, to the middle-aged who find themselves taking on marathon mortgages that run well past state pension age, to those who have retirement on the horizon and face tricky calculations around how long their pension pot will last.\u201d Smith fears that much of the \u00a315.7bn increase in annual mortgage payments by 2026, predicted by Resolution Foundation on Saturday, could come from either reduced pension contributions or from savings that were intended for the medium to long term. The Liberal Democrats have repeated their calls for the government to intervene to help struggling mortgage payers, PA Media reports, as average fixed mortgage costs rose again today to the highest since December. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: \u201cThe time for the Government to step in is now, anything else will be a disaster for struggling families worried about losing their homes. \u201cThis Government is sitting on their hands, giving no help to ordinary working people who suffer. It\u2019s just plain wrong. \u201cLiberal Democrats are calling on Rishi Sunak to finally listen to those who need help and immediately end this mortgage horror show with a mortgage protection fund.\u201d The Lib Dems first proposed a \u00a33bn fund last November, which would provide grants of \u00a3300 per month to cover rising costs mortgage costs to prevent a home-owner being repossessed. However, such a proposal is controversial \u2013 as it could undermine the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to cool the economy, forcing interest rates higher. Plus, it would mean taxpayers effectively underwriting a major asset purchase, and prop up house prices at a time when some people are hoping they keep falling so they can get onto the housing ladder\u2026 Elsewhere in the City, the money markets are indicating a greater than 50% chance that UK interest rates will hit 6% by next February. That\u2019s up from just under 50% on Friday, Reuters reports. This calculation is based on the price of interest rate swaps, which are derivatives contracts used by investors to hedge against rising borrowing costs, or to speculate on future moves in interest rates. Sterling has risen to its highest level against the euro in 10 months, as traders anticipate a rise in UK interest rates on Thursday. The pound has touched \u20ac1.1736, the highest level since last August. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, says both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are likely to keep raising borrowing costs, while the US Federal Reserve took a pause in its tightening cycle last Wednesday. The Bank of England in particular probably has the most ground to cover still amid more rampant inflation than in other countries and the ongoing resilience of the UK economy. The pound is trading above the $1.28 level for the first time since April 2022, while the euro is back above $1.09. Heading into Thursday\u2019s meeting, the risks for sterling are symmetrical as the BoE could surprise with a 50-bps hike, but it could also signal that it is nearing the end of its tightening cycle. Shares in UK housebuilders have dropped to a three-month low, after Rightmove reported this morning that asking prices for homes dipped a little in June (see opening post). The UK homebuilders index is down 0.8%, to its lowest since 20 March, as City traders react to signs that the summer slowdown has started early this year. Renters are also feeling the squeeze from the cost of living crisis. Bristol\u2019s local mayor has warned today that tenants in his city are facing a \u201cWild West market\u201d, and argued for rent controls in the housing market. Marvin Rees told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere has been no real change in our regulatory powers as a local authority to keep up with the changing nature of the housing market. We are taking old tools to new challenges.\u201d On rent controls, Rees said: \u201cI recognise there is complexity but what we certainly need is intervention in the rental market. \u201cWhether you call that control or not is up to you, but there needs to be an intervention because allowing this Wild West of the rental market with rents growing out of all pace to people\u2019s income\u2026 \u201cWhat we have at the moment in Bristol is, over the last decade, rents have gone up about 52% and wages have gone up 24%. The Bank of England could be split this week, when policymakers meet to set interest rates. James Lynch, Fixed Income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, predicts that most members of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will vote to tighten again. Lynch says: \u201cOn the voting, we could be back to three-way splits on the committee again, with two voting for unchanged, one or two voting for a 50bps hike, and the remainder in the middle voting for 25bps. On the finer details of the forward guidance, we have the minutes of the meeting to go on, but this is not a policy review meeting where we get updated fan charts, and there won\u2019t be a press conference \u2013 so it\u2019s not the most useful meeting in the event of a big change in guidance. MPC members Silvana Tenreyro and Swati Dhingra are seen as most likely to vote for no change, having opposed recent increases at past meetings. UK government short-term borrowing costs have hit a 15-year high, in a move that signals more pain for mortgage holders. 11am UPDATE: The yield, or interest, rates on two-year government bonds has just hit 5% 4.995% this morning. That\u2019s the highest level since July 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted. Those two-year gilts are used to price fixed-term mortgages. They are rising as the financial markets anticipate the Bank of England will raise UK interest rates on Thursday, for the 13th time in a row, to 4.75%. Riz Malik, founder and director at R3 Mortgages, warns that rising mortgage rates are creating a \u2018ticking time bomb\u2019 in the UK property market: We urgently needs a cross-party Mortgage Task Force to find potential solutions to this ticking time bomb. This should be comprised of economists, lenders and other stakeholders who are actively involved in the mortgage market. We need action or the impending financial earthquake is going to send shockwaves across the country. Samuel Mather-Holgate, independent financial advisor at Mather and Murray Financial, argues that the Bank of England should be given the leeway not to raise interest rates to squeeze inflation. The Government need to change the mandate of the Bank of England so that they put more weight on the future of the economy and give their inflation target a longer term time horizon. This would allow them to maintain their independence but take their foot off the accelerator when it comes to rate hikes. Confidence breeds confidence and a pause in rate rises will mean lenders stabilise their product offerings and the resultant competition drives prices downwards. [the Bank\u2019s target is to keep inflation at 2% \u2013 so is under pressure to keep raising interest rates as inflation was 8.7% in the year to April]. Buy-to-let mortgage rates have also risen again. Moneyfacts reports that the average two-year fixed rate on a BTL mortage increased from 6.21% on Friday to 6.30% today. The average five-year fixed rate has gone up too, from 6.17% to 6.23%. The number of buy-to-let mortgage products on the market has fallen this morning, to 2,515 from 2,589 on Friday. The Labour party also aren\u2019t pledging any specific help for mortgage payers today. Asked about the party\u2019s plans on Sky News, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour would tighten up the windfall tax on oil and gas companies to yield more money to help reduce energy bills. He says: That wouldn\u2019t be a direct mortgage payment, but it would help people with their bills. Starmer argues that the situation in the UK is worse \u201cbecause of that terrible mini-budget\u201d, which has created \u201ca Tory premium on people\u2019s mortgages.\u201d Q: So the Labour wouldn\u2019t help people pay their mortgages? Starmer says Labour is trying to put \u201cconcrete plans\u201d on the table to reduce bills through the oil and gas windfall tax, to help families with their overall bills. He says: We need a long-term solution to this, we can\u2019t have sticking plasters any more. That requires a stable plan to grow the economy, properly. That hasn\u2019t happened for 13 years. Starmer adds that Labour\u2019s plan to make the UK a clean energy superpower by 2030 would help lower bills in the long term. Lenders have been \u2018scrambling\u2019 to raise mortgage rates over the last month, says ITV\u2019s Joel Hills, after UK inflation failed to fall as much as hoped in April. Newsflash: the average rate on a two-year fixed rate mortgage has risen over 6%, for the first time in six months. Financial information provider Moneyfacts reports that the average two-year fixed rate has increased to 6.01% today. That\u2019s up from 5.98% on Friday, and 5.26% at the start of May. It takes average two-year fixed mortgage rates back towards the levels seen in the chaos after the mini-budget last autumn (when they hit 14-year highs). This is the first time since the first week of December 2022 that two-year fixed-rate mortgages have cost 6% or more. Longer-term fixed rate mortgages also become more expensive, with the average five-year fixed rate rising to 5.67% today, from 5.62% on Friday. This reflects financial market expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates several times this year. As well as a quarter-point hike on Thursday, to 4.75%, the money markets predict rates could hit 5.75% by the end of the year. Mortgage providers continued to cut deals too. The product count has fallen from 4,923 on Friday to 4,683 this morning, Moneyfacts adds. Although rising interest rates are a blow to borrowers, they are welcome news for those retiring. The average rate on an annuity, which provides a regular guaranteed income in retirement, has jumped by 20% over the last 12 months, according to financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. They report that a 65-year-old with a \u00a3100,000 pension is able to get up to \u00a37,144 per year, up from \u00a37,027 two weeks ago, and an increase of a fifth on the same period last year. The last time incomes were this high was November 2022, after the mini-budget chaos drove up the cost of government borrowing (meaning UK bonds paid a higher return). Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: After being relegated to the side lines after Freedom and Choice annuities are once again taking centre stage and attracting more notice. This increase is likely to be in response to the looming rate rise we are expecting this week. Interest rates are one factor that determine annuity rates and while it is by no means a certainty, we have seen annuity incomes increase in line with interest rate rises over the past two years. With more increases rumoured to be on the way we could see further income boosts in the coming months. Though they have dropped in popularity in recent years annuities should always be considered where there is a need for guaranteed income in a retirement strategy. The state pension will offer secure income up to a certain level but if you need more, and you don\u2019t have something like a defined benefit pension scheme, then annuities are an important option. Housing market analyst Neal Hudson of consultancy BuiltPlace shows in this tweet how mortgage holders in the South East are more vulnerable to rising mortgage rates: And here\u2019s Jon Boys, economist at the CPID (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) on the generational impact: Prime minister Rishi Sunak has ruled out providing any extra help for households who are struggling with mortgage payments. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, the prime minister declined to back extra support for mortgage holders, despite concerns that millions of households facing a dramatic rise in borrowing costs as they remortgages their home loans in coming months. Instead, he said the government needs to \u201cstick to the plan\u201d, and that his top priority remains bringing inflation down. Sunak said: \u201cI know the anxiety people will have about the mortgage rates, that is why the first priority I set out at the beginning of the year was to halve inflation because that is the best and most important way that we can keep costs and interest rates down for people. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a clear plan to do that, it is delivering, we need to stick to the plan. \u201cBut there is also support available for people. We have the mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers and we have the support for mortgage interest scheme which is there to help people as well. On Friday, the Liberal Democrats called for a \u00a33bn mortgage protection fund to be set up to offer help to families at risk of losing their homes, as fears of a jump in repossessions rose. Mortgage experts fear the average rate on a two-year fixed-term mortgage could hit 6% today, having climbed to 5.98% at the end of last week. But Sunak\u2019s comments do square with the reports last night that Treasury insiders insisted that taxpayers will not bail out mortgage holders, as such state intervention would be the \u201cmost dangerous thing a government could do\u201d. Rightmove\u2019s survey covers asking prices, not the actual amount which buyers agree to pay for a home. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, reports that sale prices are \u2018softening\u2019, saying: \u2018As expected, recent mortgage market turbulence is dampening the increase in prices and activity which we would usually see at this time of year. \u2018However, these are, of course, only aspirational not achieved values. On the street, prices are softening as cash and equity-rich buyers in particular continue to hold sway over those relying on increasingly hard-to-obtain loans. \u2018Negative publicity is helping lower expectations and encourage more seller realism.\u2019 Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says sentiment has \u2018taken a hit\u201d in the past few weeks: \u201cRecent rate volatility hasn\u2019t yet had a material impact on housing market activity because, if anything, those holding mortgage offers are keen to move sooner rather than later. That said, sentiment has taken a hit in recent weeks, which will keep a lid on trading volumes later this year. Ironically, strong wage inflation rather than the mini-Budget is now the main brake on the housing market although the outlook will only become clearer this week. Those buying, selling or re-mortgaging will hope the Bank of England isn\u2019t faced with a second ugly underlying inflation reading on Wednesday.\u201d Rightmove\u2019s monthly house price report also shows regional differences in the markets In London, average asking prices fell by 1.6% in the month, while they dropped 0.6% in the East Midlands and by 0.5% in Yorkshire and the Humber region. But average asking prices rose 4.9% in the North East, followed by a 1.8% gain in Wales. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: \u201cRightmove\u2019s UK asking prices dropped for the first time since 2017 but only by \u00a382 on average. Versus last year, house prices in June rose by 1.1% to an average of \u00a3372,812. There are significant regional differences; the North East saw average property prices increase by 4.9% to \u00a3188,414 whereas London prices fell by 1.6% to \u00a3685,241. The housing market tends to get a seasonal boost around this time of year, and consumer confidence has been picking up. However the market is still grappling with rising interest rates, falling real wages, sluggish economic growth and volatility in the mortgage market. This week the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates again by 25 basis points while the latest UK inflation figures [on Wednesday] are expected to point to price pressures which are easing but remain sharply above target. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Rising mortgage rates are cooling the UK housing market, bringing forward the usual summer slowdown in the housing market. Asking prices for British homes fell in June for the first time in six years, property website Rightmove reports this morning. Rightmove\u2019s latest data shows that average new asking prices dipped, slightly, this month for the first time this year. It suggests that some sellers are pricing their properties a little more competitively, as higher borrowing costs dampen the market. Average new seller asking prices slipped by \u00a382 this month to \u00a3372,812. This is the first monthly drop in new asking prices this year, and the first at this time of year since 2017, Rightmove reports. The number of sales being agreed has dropped marginally, and in the last two weeks is 6% behind the same period in 2019; twice as fast as the 3% drop recorded in May. On average, over the previous ten years prices have risen by 0.6% at this time of year. Rightmove suggests that constraints on buyer affordability due to higher borrowing costs, and \u201cmore pricing realism from new sellers\u201d have brought forward the usual summer slowdown. Tim Bannister of Rightmove explains: Average new seller asking prices, the first and leading indicator of new trends in the market, have dropped slightly this month, signalling that the belated spring price bounce has quickly turned into an earlier than usual summer slowdown. We expect asking prices to edge down during the second half of the year which is the normal seasonal pattern, and while we sometimes re-forecast our expectations for annual price changes at this time, current trends suggest that our original forecast of a 2% annual drop in asking prices at the end of 2023 is still valid. The squeeze on borrowers is expected to worsen this week, with the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates on Thursday from 4.5% to 4.75%. One Conservative MP warned last weekend that Britain is heading for a \u201cmortgage catastrophe\u201d, due to the surge in borrowing costs this year. Lucy Allan, the Tory MP for Telford, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have quite understood the interest rate catastrophe. People [are] telling me their monthly mortgage payment is exceeding their salary. That is unsustainable. \u201cConstituents do ask about \u2018support for unaffordable mortgages\u2019. I say \u2018talk to your lender,\u2019 but the reality is they need to sell sooner rather than later and that\u2019s a hard message to hear.\u201d Allies of chancellor Jeremy Hunt have ruled out giving any direct fiscal support to households struggling with soaring mortgage costs. Hunt, according to Treasury sources, has concluded that such an intervention would drive up government borrowing and fuel inflationary pressure, leading to even higher interest rates. More than a quarter of UK homeowners on a fixed-rate mortgage are heading for sharp increase in monthly payments before the next election. Figures shared with the Guardian by UK Finance, the banking industry trade body, show more than 2.4m fixed-rate homeowner deals will expire between now and the end of 2024. According to the Resolution Foundation, total annual mortgage repayments are now on course to rise by \u00a315.8 billion by 2026, as households move onto new, higher fixed-rate deals. That means an extra \u00a32,900 cost for the average household re-mortgaging next year.

Had Britain \u201cheard\u201d the screams of caution from Black people about the racism and, therefore, unsuitability for office of Boris Johnson, there is a good chance Britain would not be \u201cfeeling\u201d the pain and shame of demise we are right now. In the story of race in Britain, Johnson may be as deserving of his own special chapter as Enoch Powell. And a fascinatingly complex chapter it would be. It is hard to conceive of anyone who has seemingly done more to decimate antiracism movements and relegitimise racism in Britain (for his own political gain) but simultaneously just as hard to name anyone who did more for high-level political diversity \u2013 once seen as a vital measure of racial progress. Powell gave a speech; Johnson gave power and the respectability of diversity to racism. As a shock-jock scribe, Johnson played to the nativist gallery with attempts at humour that only a drink-sodden toadying upper-middle-class dinner party (or a fawning media class) would laugh at. There was his reference to \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d in an infamous 2002 Telegraph column about a trip by Tony Blair to west Africa. But there were myriad others. \u201cThe problem is not that we were once in charge [of Africa], but that we are not in charge any more \u2026 If left to their own devices, the natives would rely on nothing but the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantain,\u201d scribbled Johnson in the Spectator. Indeed, a cursory study of his time as editor of the Spectator suggests an apparent disdain for, obsession with and envy or fear of Black people in particular. He did not write but he published at least one patently, eye-wateringly racist pseudoscientific article suggesting Black people had low IQs. Another piece published under his editorship described Jamaican immigrants (ie descendants of Africans enslaved by Britain) as \u201cludicrously self-satisfied, macho, lupine-gaited, gold-chained-and-front-toothed predators of the slums, with the bodies of giants and the mind of a pea\u201d. Another dismissed the idea of disaffected Black youth as politically correct cover for \u201cblack thugs, sons of black thugs and grandsons of black thugs\u201d. The piece contained the bigotry bat-signal \u201cboy, oh boy, was Enoch \u2013 God rest his soul \u2013 ever right!\u201d Far from making him a pariah, his early catalogue of racist waffle, written by or apparently sanctioned by him, helped to propel Johnson to success. Whether it was Brexit (during the campaign he labelled President Obama a \u201cpart-Kenyan president\u201d with an \u201cancestral dislike\u201d of Britain), his refusal to condemn England fans who booed their own players for making an antiracism gesture, his visit to Myanmar as foreign secretary (during which the UK ambassador to Myanmar had to stop him reciting a colonial-era poem) or writing in a column that Muslim women wearing burqas \u201clook like letter boxes\u201d (which some critics blamed, at least in part, for a 375% rise in reports of Islamophobic incidents) \u2013 time and again over the course of his career Johnson would return to his reliable ace, the racism card. Often the offence was camouflaged. The burqa article, for example, argued against a ban in Britain. Which is classic Johnson \u2013 playing the liberal and the crowd-pleasing, devil-may-care reactionary at once. And we would complain and no one would listen and no one would do anything. Here\u2019s a funny thing: no one has appointed more people from ethnic minorities to senior political positions than Boris Johnson. His cabinet was unthinkably diverse \u2013 the statistics speak for themselves. But as the business professor and economist Aaron Levenstein once cautioned about statistics: \u201cWhat they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\u201d What the statistics concealed is the fact that Johnsonian diversity represented a giant leap forward for racism. If you were an ethnic minority \u201canti-woke culture war warrior\u201d, the Johnson years were a land of milk of honey. Your anti-woke provocation was your qualification. A couple of viral anti-woke tweets or YouTube clips could propel you into the Johnsonian stratosphere or into a prestigious national institution. i Thanks to Johnsonian diversity, Britain now has more ethnic minorities in positions of power than ever. But arguably he used it to undermine antiracism or racial progress in society at large. His willingness to brazenly do so was part of his nativist appeal. That was disreputable, but then he is disreputable and we knew that. We did find the emergency glass: we did break it. And now you know what we knew about that willingness to offend, the readiness to trash rules and norms for cheap gain and self-advantage.

At 5.05pm (and 22 seconds) on 20 June 2019, the 28-strong field in the Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot was approaching the furlong pole and Turgenev, who had set off as the 7-2 favourite, was going strongly in front with a lead of nearly three lengths and trading at around 1-3 in-running on Betfair. Frankie Dettori, Turgenev\u2019s rider, had already won the first four races on the card, at odds of 5-1, 13-2, 4-1 and evens. Victory No 5 on the day would have completed a 2,024-1 accumulator at SP, with many of Dettori\u2019s loyal followers having banked much bigger prices earlier in the day. Just 12 seconds later, though, the bookmakers could breathe again, as Harry Bentley and Biometric emerged from the pack to win by a length-and-a-quarter. It was a dramatic and memorable afternoon, but also just one among many at the Royal meeting over the last three decades when Dettori, the most high-profile and popular rider of the post-Lester Piggott era, has demonstrated his ability to seize control of the narrative, at Ascot above all. Much was said and written about his final ride in the Derby earlier this month, but Epsom, for whatever reason, was never really his track. Ascot absolutely is, and four years to the day after his latest golden afternoon at the course, Dettori has six booked rides on Tuesday\u2019s opening card at what will be his final Royal meeting before he retires from the saddle later this year. All six are priced up at single-figure odds, ranging from Inspiral, at 15-8, in the opening Queen Anne Stakes, to Absurde, at 5-1, in the Copper Horse Handicap at 6.10. If we all work together and put on \u00a35 each-way accumulators at the current combined odds of around 10,000-1, the potential is certainly there to bring the bookies to their knees. But at the same time, the simple fact that all of Dettori\u2019s opening-day rides are odds-against is a reminder that while Cheltenham in March has overtaken Royal Ascot as the biggest meeting of the year from a betting perspective, these five days in June still offer the best and most competitive British Flat racing of the season. Inspiral ran away with the Coronation Stakes 12 months ago but is not even sure to start favourite for the Queen Anne, while Chaldean, Dettori\u2019s fourth and final 2,000 Guineas winner at Newmarket in May, is only narrowly preferred to Paddington, who took the Irish equivalent, in the betting for the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. And, like Cheltenham, this most traditional of race meetings continues to evolve. When Dettori rode his memorable four-timer just four years ago, the six-races-per-day format seemed unshakeable. Post-Covid, when the 2020 meeting behind closed doors increased to seven on the first four days and no fewer than eight on Saturday, it has settled at seven-per-day and 35 over the week. The race that charted the last 20 years of the late Queen\u2019s reign, meanwhile, first as the Golden Jubilee Stakes from 2002 and then the Platinum Jubilee from 2012, is now the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes, the feature on Saturday\u2019s card. And while it remains to be seen how regularly the new King and Queen will be in attendance, their colours will be aboard several runners with a chance, including Saga, the likely favourite and another in Dettori\u2019s book of rides, in Tuesday\u2019s Wolferton Stakes. And though Dettori is very likely to end his Royal Ascot career as the second-most successful jockey in the meeting\u2019s history, even that is not entirely guaranteed. Dettori has 77 winners at the meeting so far, but the rider currently attracting all the money to be the week\u2019s top jockey is Ryan Moore, who has 73. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s principal rider was, briefly, odds-against last week, but is now no bigger than 4-6 to win the jockeys\u2019 prize for the 10th time in 14 years. A net gain of four would therefore put Moore alongside Dettori in the all-time list, though still a long way behind the astonishing Piggott, who died in May 2022, and who amassed 116 Royal Ascot winners in an era when there were just 24 races to aim at each season. Whoever claims the riding honours this week \u2013 and William Buick and Oisin Murphy are in with a serious shout, too \u2013 the Long Fellow\u2019s place as the greatest Royal Ascot jockey will surely outlive us all."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-is-trolling-netflix-and-its-breathtaking", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bite the hand that streams!

The good news, then, is that Brooker was able to fully reboot what Black Mirror is during his time away. The less good news is that he probably didn\u2019t reboot it enough. For some years now, Black Mirror has been stymied by the sense that it exists solely as a vessel for predicting the future. Samsung has patented a video-recording contact lens that acts like the chip from The Entire History of You. Neural networks can reproduce the vocabulary and speech patterns of your dead loved ones, like in Be Right Back. The Chinese government has tested a system that punishes citizens who demonstrate poor social etiquette, like in Nosedive. There was that whole thing about David Cameron being inside a pig. But to watch the newest batch of Black Mirror episodes is to sense that Brooker really, really doesn\u2019t want that to happen again. For much of the new season, technology barely even features at all. In fact, the most traditionally Black Mirrorish episode \u2013 the feature-length space-set Aaron Paul melodrama Beyond the Sea \u2013 is easily the weakest of the lot. But the rest of it has the feeling of a self-willed backlash against everything that Black Mirror used to be. Unless humanity is suddenly overwhelmed by an onslaught of demons and werewolves (which admittedly, the way things are going, isn\u2019t impossible) then the sense is that Brooker is all too eager to relinquish his role as soothsayer-in-chief. The final episode of the season, a co-write with Bisha K Ali entitled Demon 79, feels like the biggest departure of all. The opening credits describe the episode as \u201cRed Mirror,\u201d a branded offshoot that eschews technological satire in favour of straight-up period horror. It\u2019s a successful experiment, largely thanks to Paapa Essiedu\u2019s immaculate turn as a put-upon demon trying to stave off Armageddon, and it hints at a whole new future for Brooker and Black Mirror. Or at least it would, if he hadn\u2019t already created an even better one. The first two episodes of season six primarily exist as a way to allow Brooker to lash out at his paymasters in extremely petulant (and wonderful) fashion. There is Loch Henry which, once it lumbers up enough momentum, becomes one of the most precise critiques of true-crime documentaries \u2013 the genre that clogs up a million Netflix submenus \u2013 that has ever been made. Every uneasy feeling you have ever experienced watching one of these documentaries is parcelled up and delivered with barely concealed fury. The same goes for the standout episode of the season, and potentially the entire show; the opener Joan is Awful. Not only is it the funniest Black Mirror episode ever, but the sheer force of its satire \u2013 aimed at glossy, dramatised biopic series like Netflix\u2019s Inventing Anna and Dirty John \u2013 is truly breathtaking. To watch either of these two episodes is to understand that Brooker has now come full circle. These aren\u2019t television episodes. They\u2019re entries from the spoof television listings site he used to run, TV Go Home. And, quite honestly, they\u2019re all the better for it. The unifying antagonist of both Joan is Awful and Loch Henry is Streamberry, an all-powerful streaming service with a distinctive Netflix-style red logo and \u201cTu-dum\u201d jingle. Black Mirror depicts Streamberry executives as craven engagement-obsessed opportunists who exist without any form of moral centre whatsoever, and the episodes would feel like extreme self-sabotage if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Netflix pays Brooker millions of dollars for his content. They\u2019re so effective, and so much more focused than Brooker has been for years, that you\u2019d like to see him sharpen his axe even further. If season six has any message at all, it is that Brooker has now outgrown Black Mirror. This isn\u2019t a bad thing. If there are no more new Black Mirror episodes, I won\u2019t be particularly sad. But if they\u2019re replaced by a full run of Streamberry Presents, we might be in for something very special."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/bournemouth-sack-gary-oneil-as-manager-in-clubs-best-interests", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bournemouth appoint Andoni Iraola as manager after sacking Gary O\u2019Neil ", "lead": "Bournemouth have named Andoni Iraola, who had left Rayo Vallecano at the end of the season, as manager after surprisingly sacking Gary O\u2019Neil", "author": "Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 14:01:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546597", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7605ad9aa4f32bff6bc74fef1d1be38d286efebc/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Bournemouth have appointed Andoni Iraola as their manager on a two-year contract after sacking Gary O\u2019Neil. Iraola was free to take charge after leaving Rayo Vallecano at the end of the season. O\u2019Neil was dismissed despite steering Bournemouth to Premier League safety after Scott Parker\u2019s departure. The decision has caused surprise behind the scenes, with O\u2019Neil understood to have been informed on Monday morning that the club wanted to adopt a different style of play to accelerate their progress. Leeds failed in an approach to land Iraola, a 40-year-old former Athletic Bilbao midfielder, in February and he was on Bournemouth\u2019s shortlist when Parker was sacked last August but was not willing to move mid-season. Iraola, who began his coaching career in Cyprus with AEK Larnaca, had three seasons with Rayo, winning promotion to La Liga and then finishing 12th and 11th. Bournemouth\u2019s American owner, Bill Foley, concluded the club could not achieve his ambitions with O\u2019Neil at the helm. Foley said last week after his ice hockey team, the Vegas Golden Knights, had won the Stanley Cup that he wanted modest improvements at Bournemouth after a 15th-placed finish. Foley said of Iraola: \u201cHe was highly sought after by other clubs across the continent, and his style of play has been an important factor in making this decision. His achievements in Spain have certainly been very impressive, and we\u2019re confident that he is the right man to lead our next chapter.\u201d O\u2019Neil had two years on his contract after an extension was automatically triggered by avoiding relegation. He was appointed as manager, initially in a caretaker capacity, with the club bottom of the league after a 9-0 defeat at Liverpool. Foley said: \u201cGary\u2019s achievement last season is one I will always be grateful for. This has been a difficult decision, but it has been made with great consideration to best position ourselves ahead of the coming season. \u201cAs a club, we have put plans in place for long-term success with improvements being made to infrastructure, most notably the development of a new state-of-the-art training facility and the ongoing discussions around upgrades to our stadium. We have also identified a number of significant targets in the transfer market this summer and believe this change in direction will provide us with the best platform from which to build. \u201cGary will go on to have a long career as a head coach or manager, but we feel that, at this moment in time, a change is in the best interests of this football club. I would like to place on record my thanks to Gary and wish him all the best for the future.\u201d Foley, the 78-year-old who bought Bournemouth from Maxim Demin in December, wants to build a new stadium and the new training ground is due for completion in autumn of next year. In January Foley acquired a stake in the Ligue 1 club Lorient, whom Bournemouth are set to play in pre-season."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/labour-pledges-british-jobs-bonus-as-it-sets-out-green-energy-strategy", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour pledges \u2018British jobs bonus\u2019 as it sets out green energy strategy", "lead": "Party to offer \u00a3500m a year for low-carbon sector but says North Sea oil and gas production will continue \u2018for decades\u2019", "author": "Fiona Harvey and Severin Carrell in Edinburgh", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:59:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546616", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/65750c38a6674eb2b663b7aa4128b05cd37e1555/0_322_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Clean energy companies would be offered up to \u00a3500m a year to set up manufacturing in the UK, to build the wind turbines, solar panels and other infrastructure needed to reach net zero, under plans set out by Labour. But Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, on Monday also gave assurances to the oil and gas industry that production would continue in the North Sea \u201cfor decades to come\u201d, to the consternation of green campaigners. Under plans for a \u201cBritish jobs bonus\u201d, Labour would allocate \u00a3500m a year for each of the first five years of government, to provide capital grants to companies in low-carbon industries, including wind and solar energy, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Companies wishing to supply clean energy in the UK, under a continuation of the existing incentive system, known as contracts for difference, would have to demonstrate they were creating high quality jobs in the UK. Labour said the bonus would particularly benefit industrial heartlands and coastal communities, and areas that have past or current coal, oil and gas industries, and pointed to an independent estimate that 65,000 new jobs could be created in this way. Starmer told an audience of energy experts and green campaigners in Edinburgh on Monday that the Tory government and the Scottish National party had failed to secure green jobs in the UK. \u201cBritain has the second largest offshore wind capacity in the world, a close second only to China, yet across the North Sea in Denmark they\u2019ve got three times as many jobs. How do you explain that?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do you explain Scottish wind turbines built in Spain, in Holland and Indonesia, as the workers in the fabrication yards in Fife \u2013 who would be proud to build something great in their country \u2013 look out their window and watch others putting them up in the Forth? There is no justification.\u201d Labour\u2019s clean energy strategy was launched in Edinburgh to wrongfoot the SNP and bolster Starmer\u2019s efforts to win back Westminster seats lost to the party. Starmer also agreed to base the proposed state-owned energy company GB Energy in Scotland, under pressure from the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar. Climate campaigners believe Labour has also outflanked the SNP, which appears to be watering down the strong pro-climate commitments by Nicola Sturgeon to quickly phase out North Sea production. While extolling the virtues of clean energy, however, Starmer was also careful to reassure his audience that jobs in the North Sea oil and gas fields were not at risk. Labour has vowed to halt the licensing of new oil and gas fields, but will not seek to rescind licences issued by the Tories, or to halt production from existing fields. This means the controversial Rosebank field in the North Sea, for which final permission is believed to be imminent, could go ahead and Labour would not rescind the licence if elected. Halting production from already licensed fields would be legally tricky, and any future government that did so could be subject to claims for billions in compensation. Taking such a stand could also spook investors now and lead to a disorderly situation in the North Sea, rather than a managed transition away from fossil fuels. Union leaders sharply criticised Starmer this month for his plans to halt North Sea licensing, calling the proposals \u201cnaive\u201d and saying they threatened current and future jobs. Starmer, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Sarwar were at pains throughout the policy launch on Monday to repeat that North Sea oil and gas would be needed \u201cfor decades to come\u201d. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, told the Guardian that Labour\u2019s policy was in line with scientific advice on staying within 1.5C of heating. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration could take place after that date, if the 1.5C limit was to be kept, but current production need not cease immediately. Miliband said the North Sea was already in decline, so a transition to green energy offered an opportunity. \u201cWe\u2019re going to carry on using existing fields, we\u2019re not going to turn off the taps,\u201d said Miliband. \u201cBut what they [the IEA] say is that governments should not be issuing new licences. It\u2019s the science-driven, evidence-based position. It\u2019s also right for energy security.\u201d Labour strategists believe the \u00a3500m green manufacturing subsidy will help address fears that renewables companies will not shift manufacturing to the UK or produce the high wage engineering jobs that will be lost when North Sea production is being phased out. Several attempts to attract those jobs to Scotland have already failed: pledges of windfarm jobs in Fife and northern Scotland have gone unrealised; the promise of large-scale tidal and wave energy schemes funded by Scottish ministers have not been met. Green campaigners said turning off the taps would be necessary. Mary Church, the head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: \u201cSaying no to new licences is an important start, but the Labour leader needs to go further and stand up to the oil and gas companies that are ripping off householders and profiting as the planet burns. \u201cAll parties need to acknowledge that no new projects can go ahead and some existing oilwells will have to be phased down before they run dry. If Rosebank, or any other development is approved by the current UK government, then it will have to be shut down by the next UK government.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/italy-mulls-law-against-glorifying-crimes-online-after-youtuber-crash", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Italy mulls law against \u2018glorifying\u2019 crimes online after YouTuber crash", "lead": "Fatal crash in Rome prompts move to jail those who make money from videos that \u2018instigate violence\u2019", "author": "Angela Giuffrida in Rome", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:56:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546634", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6d2d58b02c719a515c142ac33f55b1a040e32643/52_0_5896_3537/500.jpg", "body": "The Italian government is considering a law that would jail people convicted of \u201cglorifying illegal activity\u201d online for up to five years, after YouTubers driving a Lamborghini SUV crashed into a car while filming a video, killing a five-year-old child.

An investigation was opened in 2018 after Alexandre Gilet, a 22-year-old volunteer deputy gendarme in Grenoble, allegedly ordered products that could be used in explosive devices. The manager of a fireworks shop found his order suspicious and contacted police. A search of the man\u2019s home found \u201cregularly used\u201d weapons, including two Kalashnikov assault rifles, and laboratory equipment. Prosecutors say he and the three other accused were part of an ultra-right, neo-Nazi private online discussion forum called \u201cOperation WaffenKraft\u201d, where discussion \u201cvery quickly turned to the preparation of terrorist projects\u201d. The Waffen-SS was the military branch of the Nazis\u2019 elite SS corps, which was founded by Adolf Hitler. French media reported that investigators found pictures of the four men, one of whom was aged 17 at the time, taken when they had met face-to-face for the first time in summer 2018 for shooting practice in a forest near Tours. Investigators also found draft documents that they interpreted to be manifestos along the lines of those used to justify ultra-right mass killings. One of the accused described the volunteer deputy gendarme as radical and determined, saying he wanted \u201cto create worse carnage than the Bataclan\u201d. This referred to the attack claimed by Islamic State that killed 90 people and injured scores more at a rock gig by the Eagles of Death Metal during coordinated attacks on Paris in November 2015. The topic of the group\u2019s online discussions is alleged to have included hatred of Muslims and communists as well as comments that were antisemitic and homophobic. Targets that were discussed allegedly included mixed neighbourhoods, a mosque, a meeting of a Jewish group, an airbase, the offices of the Licra association against racism and anti-semitism and a rally by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the leader of the hard-left party La France Insoumise. The four men include a farm worker, as well as an engineering student who was the son of an army colonel. The men\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue in court that they would not have carried out any real attacks, nor had they written manifestos. Nine planned attacks by ultra-right groups have been thwarted in France since 2017, the interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, said this spring, and the threat of attacks by ultra-right or neo-Nazi groups is being taken seriously by French authorities. One of the accused was a teenager when police arrested the suspects in 2018 and 2019, which meant a closed-door trial for all four men was likely under French law. But the presiding judge, Christophe Petiteau, said on Monday that given the seriousness of the allegations, \u201cthe court considers it important to lift the restricted publicity\u201d."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/celebrity-hairdresser-charles-worthington-puts-mykonos-villa-up-for-sale-for-50m", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Celebrity hairdresser puts Mykonos villa up for sale for \u20ac50m", "lead": "Charles Worthington, who has styled Sarah Jessica Parker and others, could get record sum for Greek island home", "author": "Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:26:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546668", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5bde72f1b8b800bb91988a25fc1a2670935b510e/671_163_5337_3205/500.jpg", "body": "The celebrity hairdresser Charles Worthington is attempting to sell an eight-bedroom villa on the Greek island of Mykonos for \u20ac50m (\u00a343m). If the house \u2013 which features an infinity swimming pool, whirlpool, gym and entertaining space for more than 200 guests \u2013 achieves the huge price tag it will be the highest price ever paid for a property on the island, which is known as a popular summer party destination for gay people from Europe and the US. Worthington, who has over the years been the go-to hairdresser for celebs including Goldie Hawn, Sharon Stone, Lily James, Tracey Emin, and both Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall, said he was selling the 14,000 sq ft villa in order to start work on a new project on the island. Worthington, who sold his namesake beauty company to British consumer goods giant PZ Cussons for \u00a337m in 2004, bought the Mykonos property in 2013 with his partner Allan Peters. The couple declined to say how much they paid for the villa, which stands on a dramatic clifftop with direct sunset views. The property, which is built in the Greek island\u2019s classic stone with white facade, is also being advertised to rent at a cost of \u20ac220,000-a-week. The main bedroom suite includes an en suite bathroom, TV lounge opening on to a sea view terrace, dressing area and further reading area. \u201cWith its dramatic elevated location and unrivalled sea views The Cape never fails to deliver the wow factor for residents and guests,\u201d Worthington said of his villa. \u201cIt is the perfect setting for private relaxation, intimate dinners with friends and family, and large-scale entertaining. From the windows and terraces the panorama provided is beyond compare, you can watch the superyachts glide into Mykonos harbour, enjoy the sunset and glittering night lights of the Chora, and spy many of the other islands, which sparkle like jewels in the sea. The estate provides total privacy and security, yet the fun and glamour of Mykonos town is 10 minutes away.\u201d Gary Hersham, founder of estate agency Beauchamp Estates, which is selling the property in partnership with Roi Deldimou, an estate agent who works on the island, described Mykonos as a \u201cbeautiful, outstanding and luxurious destination like no other in the world\u201d. \u201cCatering for the wealthy with superyachts and private jets, as well as fine dining and luxury retail boutiques is it any wonder that discerning people from around the world seek to return time and time again to Mykonos, many choosing to purchase a home.\u201d Mykonos has been attracting tourists since the 1920s, when archaeologists and antiquity hunters used it as a base to visit the ancient Greek ruins on neighbouring Delos. It came of age in the 60s when the former US first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis visited with her second husband, the shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Following her lead came Grace Kelly, Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren. There are two bars and a hotel dedicated to Jackie O on the island. The island first became a destination for gay visitors in the 70s, when the Italian-American painter Pierro Aversa and a local fisher, Andreas Koutsoukos, set up Pierro\u2019s, an LGBT-friendly bar. Since then the super-rich have followed. The island\u2019s Psarou Bay has proved particularly popular for superyachts because it is a natural deepwater harbour protected from the notorious meltemi north winds. When the Guardian visited in 2019 there were 11 of them at anchor, including the Maltese Falcon, a $300m (\u00a3240m) three-mast sail-powered superyacht built for the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tom Perkins. The bay\u2019s Nammos beach club is popular with celebrities such as Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan, Ariana Grande, Wayne Rooney and Usain Bolt. In 2017, the one-time-billionaire Philip Green was caught on Instagram at Nammos smashing plates and spraying champagne with the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, the Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner and the US designer Tommy Hilfiger."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946f9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/hunter-valley-bus-crash-parents-of-groom-call-for-stronger-seatbelt-laws", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hunter Valley bus crash: parents of groom call for stronger seatbelt laws", "lead": "John Gaffney, whose son Mitchell married Madeleine Edsell last Sunday, calls for mandatory rule on all buses", "author": "Elias Visontay", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:23:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546685", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4454f7e020479f7c6b425d5aa7187f8197c9b0aa/0_170_5185_3113/500.jpg", "body": "The parents of the groom whose Hunter Valley wedding ended in tragedy when 10 guests died in a bus crash when leaving the event have called for stronger seatbelt laws. John Gaffney, whose son Mitchell married Madeleine Edsell in wine country on Sunday 11 June, has called for seat belts to be mandatory on all buses \u2013 something which is not currently the law in New South Wales. While it is a requirement for everyone on board a bus fitted with seat belts to wear them, drivers are not legally responsible for ensuring their passengers wear them, and experts have warned enforcement is grey area. Gaffney has called for stricter policies so that passengers are \u201ccompelled by laws to wear them\u201d. \u201cHopefully something positive can come out of this tragedy. 50 years ago the fitting and wearing of seat belts became compulsory in Australia for all occupants of motor cars saving countless lives since,\u201d Gaffney said in a post on LinkedIn. \u201cWhilst my wife and I can\u2019t do this on our own we believe ultimately everyone who rides a bus should have access to a seatbelt and be compelled by laws to wear them. Gaffney called for assistance by asking people to lobby federal and state MPs on the issue. \u201cIf a federal government petition could be set up that would be most appreciated,\u201d he said. His wife and mother of the groom, Carolyn Gaffney, reportedly echoed the plea on social media. \u201cSo that something \u2018good\u2019 can come out of this our family would appreciate if the community would lobby the state and federal governments to ensure that seatbelts are provided in all buses and the wearing of them made compulsory,\u201d she posted on Facebook. On Monday, Mitchell Gaffney and Edsell released a statement via the premier\u2019s office requesting privacy \u201cwhile we grieve\u201d. \u201cWhile we appreciate the outpouring of love and support from the community\u2026our primary focus at this time is processing this tragedy, and supporting our family and friends,\u201d the couple said in the statement. Also on Monday, members of the Singleton Roosters Australian rules football club \u2013 a team which several of those who died in the crash were involved with \u2013 held a press conference to explain members were suffering \u201cunfathomable heartache\u201d. \u201cOur community has experienced unfathomable heartache, distress, and sadness after a number of people closely connected to the club were on board and either injured or killed,\u201d president Dylan Hixon said. \u201cWe will lean on each other through this incredible and difficult time with the memory of everyone that has been lost at the forefront of our thoughts.\u201d \u201cOur first priority and focus is on supporting the families, friends and those from the wider club community who have been affected by this unspeakable tragedy,\u201d he said. Among the victims were Nadene McBride, who coached the Singleton Roosterettes, her 22-year-old daughter Kyah who played in the team, as well as Kyah\u2019s boyfriend, Kane Symons. Also killed were Singleton husband and wife Andrew and Lynan Scott who both played for Singleton Roosters teams and left behind two young children. Tori Cowburn, who also died, was captain of the Roosterettes and worked for mining company Thiess. Darcy Bulman, a 30-year-old investigator for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission from Melbourne was killed while her partner is believed to be injured. Rebecca Mullen, a junior doctor and Singleton local working at Calvary Mater Newcastle hospital, was one of the younger victims. Others who died were Zach Bray, who was working as a mining engineer in the Hunter region and engineer Angus Craig who had worked with mining company BHP in Queensland. Hunter MP Dan Repacholi said nine victims remained in hospital with two of them in intensive care. Two community gatherings and memorials have been set up in Singleton and Greta, he said. New South Wales premier Chris Minns said more than half a million dollars had already been donated to a fund to help victims and their families. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced on Monday that his government will provide up to $580,000 to the family members of Bulman.

Ajax want \u00a340m plus \u00a35m in add-ons for \u00c1lvarez and West Ham have decided the Mexico international is too expensive. That has left the path clear for Dortmund, who are favourites to sign the midfielder as they look to rebuild after selling Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid. West Ham will have funds to play with once they sell Rice, who is expected to join Arsenal for at least \u00a3100m. David Moyes wants two midfielders, with Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse and Manchester City\u2019s Kalvin Phillips in his thinking, and Palhinha is a key target. Palhinha has impressed since joining Fulham for \u00a320m last summer and Marco Silva will not want to lose the former Sporting Lisbon player. Fulham are expected to demand \u00a350m for the Portugal international, whose tough tackling caught the eye during his debut Premier League season, and West Ham will need to decide whether that represents value. West Ham, who qualified for the Europa League after winning the Europa Conference League, are yet to receive a new bid from Arsenal for Rice. They turned down Arsenal\u2019s opening offer of \u00a380m plus add-ons and expect Manchester City to bid. Rice has also been targeted by Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Newcastle and Manchester United. Moyes has long been a fan of Ward-Prowse, who is expected to leave Southampton after their relegation. Ward-Prowse is a proven Premier League player, which could enhance his appeal to West Ham, and his threat from set pieces would make him a good fit in a Moyes team. Phillips is unlikely to want to leave City this summer. West Ham had a bid rejected for the England midfielder when he was at Leeds. West Ham also want a left-winger and are interested in Harvey Barnes, who is available after Leicester\u2019s relegation. Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham also want Barnes, who scored 13 goals last season."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946fb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/uk-to-change-sanctions-rules-in-move-towards-seizing-russian-assets", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK to change sanctions rules in move towards seizing Russian assets", "lead": "Move changes purpose of sanctions so that they will be maintained until Russia agrees to pay compensation", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 13:01:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546719", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d768237ce9b8f8bce5baf0da8bad8099a8614f74/0_169_5983_3590/500.jpg", "body": "The UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. The laws go some way to ensuring that Russian assets currently frozen by the UK government can in effect eventually be seized \u2013 a move that many western powers have rejected on the basis that it could set a precedent for western assets held overseas to also be seized. According to the UK government, the new laws do not amount to forfeiture and could only be used if there is evidence of criminal conduct. The measures come ahead of the Ukraine recovery conference in London and critics will see it as an effort to forestall demands for more definitive steps. The laws will change the purpose of sanctions so that they will be maintained until Russia agrees to pay compensation, rather than merely protecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the current purpose of the sanctions. The UK is the first government to take these initial steps and accepts they may take time to resolve and require consultation. New measures will also require designated persons to disclose all the assets they hold in the UK, with a failure to comply leading to a fine or a seizure. A further set of measures will require individuals to disclose if they hold Russian sovereign assets in the UK, a move that will provide clearer data to the government on the amount of Russian central bank assets in the UK. These assets will not be disclosed in public. A more minor measure will make it easier for those under sanctions to have their assets voluntarily transferred and handed to Ukraine for the purpose of its recovery. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: \u201cAs Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, the terrible impacts of Putin\u2019s war are clear. Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction needs are \u2013 and will be \u2013 immense.

There\u2019s a full moon over the olive grove where the Master Musicians have cut out a flat area as a stage, and tonight it is covered in carpets beneath a green and red patterned awning. The musicians are dressed in turbans and black embroidered djellaba robes, and all are seated apart from their elected leader, Ahmed El Attar, a drummer who parades in before them, driving on an intricate, improvised and trance-inducing dance music that continues without stop for hour after hour. This ancient artistry, stretching back over a thousand years, is powerful and complex; the musicians say it is spiritual, bringing a blessing, baraka, to those who listen. There are four percussionists, beating out constantly changing polyrhythms on their goatskin drums, the small zowak and larger farad, and alongside them are eight woodwind players, blowing into their reed ghaitas. The lead player and two companions establish a riff, others respond or embellish the melody or use circular breathing to add drone effects to music that is constantly developing, creating phasing effects as it builds from crescendo to crescendo. Suddenly, the lights go out, a bonfire is blazing in the field by the stage, and Boujeloud, the Pan god appears, dancing around the flames, quivering from head to foot, brandishing olive branches as he chases village children before leaping on stage with the band. By day, Mohamed El Hatmi is a 71-year-old cafe owner but once he puts on his costume, made from the skins of four black goats, he is a man possessed. It\u2019s a role he has played for more than 50 years. This is the finale of the world\u2019s smallest annual music festival. Only 50 people, including organisers and guests, can attend, so as not to disrupt village life, and Joujouka fans have come here from all over the world. A third are from Japan, where the band have toured and played a reportedly frenzied five-hour set at an EDM festival, while others have flown in from Los Angeles, France and the UK. After three days and nights of this intense music, with lengthy sessions always starting after midnight, everyone has got to know each other. There is still no running water in the village, and alcohol is not allowed. We all stay in the houses of the musicians, whose wives provide breakfast, and the musicians themselves help cook and serve lunch and dinner, served on the stage where they will later be playing. In the afternoons there are sessions with oud or violin players. Joujouka is a farming community perched on a ridge with a patchwork of fields and olive orchards below. There are more donkeys and chickens on the one street than there are cars. It may look like a typical north African village, but it has an extraordinary musical history. El Hatmi takes visitors across a valley to the mountain cave where Boujeloud, a creature who was half-man and half-goat, was said to have first taught flute playing to a shepherd, in the hope of getting a wife in return. He failed, but the villagers became such great musicians that Boujeloud was pacified, bringing health, fertility and good crops to the village. That ancient myth lives on. The festival is organised by Frank Rynne, once a musician in Dublin, where he first met members of the Joujouka band, and now a Paris-based academic historian. He has studied the Boujeloud story and argues \u201che is absolutely derived from Pan. Look at the depictions of Pan in Pompeii with his pan pipes \u2013 and the Romans were here. This is a pre-Islamic belief that has kept going. The villagers believe that the huge fire that destroyed olive groves here last year happened because there had been no Boujeloud festivals \u2013 they had been stopped by Covid.\u201d Islam also influenced the music. In the early 15th century, Sufi saint Sidi Ahmed Sheich came here, realised the power of the music and taught the musicians to play a style that Rynne says \u201cwould act like a surgical instrument on the brain to help heal people from depression\u201d. Joujouka flourished. Some musicians travelled to Fez to play for the Sultan (a lucrative gig that ended with the colonial era: the French were in Fez, the Spanish in Joujouka, and the musicians weren\u2019t able to cross the new colonial borders). Others stayed in the village to play to the sick who flocked here to be cured. When I first came here in 1973, musical healing ceremonies were still being held in the ancient shrine to the saint in the centre of the village. The shrine remains, still dominated by an old fig tree, but it\u2019s now deserted. With Rynne translating from the Arabic, I ask El Attar what had gone wrong. There has been a clash between the old Sufi tradition and modern Islam, and they have been banned from playing there: \u201cThe authorities say it shouldn\u2019t happen because there is a mosque across the road.\u201d But he says the music still has the same power and they still treat the sick in private: \u201cFive weeks ago we played for someone who came to us with a djinn [a malicious African spirit] in his brain\u201d. He and other musicians break into a furious burst of hand clapping as they demonstrate the difference between \u201cthe Boujeloud rhythms, for dancing\u201d and the healing music written by the saint. There\u2019s another, more recent figure in the village mythology \u2013 Rolling Stone Brian Jones, who recorded here in 1968, a year before his death, and was said to be obsessed by the music. After Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka was released in 1971 the village attracted more celebrities. When I was first invited here there was still no electricity, the musicians were playing on the mud square, but the guests included William Burroughs and Ornette Coleman. Rikki Stein \u2013 later Fela Kuti\u2019s manager \u2013 had been living here for two years, and in 1980 he organised passports for the band, and bought a bus for their first European tour, lasting three months. Stein is back this year and noted \u201cthe music has the same energy and dynamism I experienced in the 1970s \u2013 though the number of musicians has reduced\u201d. It\u2019s a glorious story \u2013 but with one sour edge. Bachir Attar, the son of one of Joujouka\u2019s best-loved musicians, runs a rival band called The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar. He speaks English (unlike the Joujouka musicians), has lived in New York, played with the Rolling Stones on Steel Wheels in 1989, with Ornette Coleman at his London Meltdown in 2009, and won a gold medal from the Kennedy Centre for the performing arts this year. Which is all fine \u2013 there is surely room for two bands from the region? But Bachir, who has a house in the village but was not in evidence during the festival, claims his band are the \u201cauthentic Master Musicians \u2026 not to be confused with any imitations\u201d. And that has caused major problems. Rynne says he started the festival in Joujouka to prove that these really are the village musicians, and was delighted that Brian Jones\u2019s former partner Anita Pallenberg came along to the first event in 2008. So what do the Joujouka musicians think of Bachir\u2019s music? \u201cIt\u2019s popular music, not the ancient music of Joujouka,\u201d says El Attar. \u201cBut let him do what he wants. Anyone who comes here and sees what we do knows what the story is.\u201d And it\u2019s the Master Musicians of Joujouka, not Jajouka, who will be at Glastonbury, where they last played in 2011. They are clearly excited to be going, especially the three band members who have never been outside Morocco before. \u201cWe loved it,\u201d said El Attar. \u201cWe had no wellington boots until someone gave them to us. Boujeloud music brings blessings.\u201d \u201cPeople want the baraka, the healing power,\u201d adds the ghaita player Abdeslam Rrtoubi. \u201cThis music is ancient. It will never die.\u201d \u2022 The Master Musicians of Joujouka play London Forge, 20-21 June, and Glastonbury 23 June (Pyramid stage, noon)"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946fd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/19/peloton-lockdown-boom-ends-uk-sales-slide-full-year-results-interactive-exercise-bike-firm", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Peloton\u2019s lockdown boom grinds to a halt as UK sales slide", "lead": "Full-year results reflect slowdown for interactive exercise bike firm viewed as \u2018winner\u2019 from pandemic", "author": "Alex Lawson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:46:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546756", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/41efaf8f8988668fc1bdf630300bbba1a23a1a4d/0_163_4884_2930/500.jpg", "body": "Sales at the UK arm of Peloton have fallen after the end of Covid restrictions put the brakes on the interactive exercise bike firm\u2019s lockdown boom. The US brand\u2019s British business reported that sales had decreased by 13% in its last financial year and that losses had widened. Peloton Interactive UK said turnover had fallen to \u00a3127.8m in the year to 30 June 2022, down from \u00a3147m in the 12 months before. In accounts filed at Companies House, the firm\u2019s directors said the fall was \u201cdue to slowing sales, reflecting the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our hardware sales\u201d. The results reflect a slowdown for a brand viewed as a \u201cwinner\u201d from Covid lockdowns. UK sales of Peloton, which sells bikes, treadmills and online fitness classes, nearly trebled during the first year of the pandemic as its equipment became sought after by Britons seeking exercise while stuck at home. Some customers have since said they are struggling to resell the \u00a31,300 bikes and have resorted to using them as expensive clothes racks. The US parent company floated on the stock market in 2019 and its share price rose steeply during the pandemic, reaching $162 (\u00a3126) in late 2020. The price has since slumped to about $8 and last year the company announced it would cut more than 3,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive. Losses at its UK business more than double from \u00a381m to \u00a3210m. Administrative costs related to its expansion rose 47%, while the \u201cgross margin on hardware deteriorated\u201d. The company racked up costs by opening a fitness studio in a grade II warehouse in Covent Garden, London. The studio, which contains three gyms, was just the second such site the company had opened worldwide, after its New York studio. It also recorded nearly \u00a337m in restructuring costs as the group decided to stop manufacturing its own bikes to cut costs. The UK business said it was \u201clooking critically\u201d at its cost base, including the \u201crationalisation of our retail footprint as well as outsourcing an increasing proportion of our delivery operation\u201d. Peloton has eight retail sites in the UK, including six concessions in John Lewis department stores. Last month, Peloton Interactive Inc, the US parent company, reported that cash burn had slowed as its efforts to cut costs through redundancies and store closures bolstered its balance sheet. The company is now repositioning its brand to appeal to consumers exercising out of the house, as well as at home. Peloton, which has nearly 700 UK employees, also noted that the cost of living crisis could affect customer spending. However, it said subscription revenues had increased sharply \u2013 up 89% on the year before \u2013 as it continued to \u201cadd members and experience low churn rates\u201d. Peloton\u2019s fitness units, including the bikes, accounted for \u00a378m of sales, with subscriptions at nearly \u00a348m. A spokesperson said: \u201cInternational markets continue to be a focus and area of growth for Peloton \u2026 Full-year 2022 was a transformational year for Peloton as we began to restructure our operations, reduced headcount, and outsourced manufacturing of connected fitness units. \u201cThis update reflects the changes Peloton has made in creating a sustainable structure that allows us to focus on growth and continue to deliver an amazing member experience.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946fe", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/uk-urged-to-protect-environmental-standards-when-eu-laws-scrapped", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK urged to protect environmental standards when EU laws scrapped", "lead": "Green groups call on ministers to add environmental baseline to post-Brexit bill, fearing future laws could weaken protections", "author": "Sandra Laville Environment correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:37:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546772", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a21e197f99f9f7cc71f97b4dedf616a5607a8c6c/0_92_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Green groups are calling on ministers to put their commitment not to weaken environmental standards post-Brexit into law as part of the retained EU law bill. Peers are tabling motions on Tuesday for an environmental baseline to be put into the controversial bill, which is designed to formalise which EU-derived legislation is brought permanently into UK law. The majority of environmental laws in England and Wales are derived from the EU, so green groups are concerned that any changes to laws could weaken protections for wildlife, habitats, and water, including laws on air pollution, and rules to make developers offset the impact of increased sewage from new homes. Ministers have said \u201cenvironmental protections will never be downgraded\u201d in the bill but refused to accept previous Lords amendments to make this part of the law. Instead the government whipped its MPs to reject the draft of the bill containing legal safeguards to stop any environmental laws being downgraded. As the bill returns on Tuesday to the Lords, peers are tabling two more amendments to put an environmental baseline into the bill and prevent protections being downgraded. Ruth Chambers of Greener UK, a coalition of 10 major environmental organisations including the National Trust, RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe more that the government refuses to compromise on this amendment, the more suspicious its motives appear. Why would a government that says it is committed to environmental protections continue to resist adding a protective layer in this bill? \u201cIt is an uncontroversial change that would provide reassurance to people worried about air pollution and water quality. We hope ministers will seek sensible compromise.\u201d The government has rowed back on plans to ditch all remaining EU laws by the end of the year. It now aims to remove 800 statutes and regulations, instead of 3,700 laws it had lined up for a \u201cbonfire\u201d of EU law in December. Last month peers inflicted a major defeat on the government, voting in favour of an amendment calling for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the EU laws to be scrapped at the end of the year and an amendment ensuring that future governments cannot weaken existing levels of environmental protection. On Tuesday peers will debate a motion by Lord Krebs that any changes to regulations do not reduce the level of environmental protection arising from the EU retained law to which the provision relates."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c946ff", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/antony-blinken-xi-jinping-beijing-china", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Antony Blinken and Xi Jinping hold \u2018candid\u2019\u00a0talks in Beijing", "lead": "Meeting between China\u2019s president and US secretary of state takes place at time of heightened tension", "author": "Rachel Cheung in Hong Kong", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:20:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546789", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf8c19829474ac29b045fb0b57027c36baf40716/0_521_4590_2754/500.jpg", "body": "The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has wrapped up a rare trip to Beijing where he met China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, concluding a high-stakes visit aimed at stabilising spiralling relations. Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing before his departure, Blinken said he had had \u201can important conversation\u201d with Xi during the 35-minute encounter and stressed it was the responsibility of both countries to find a path forward. \u201cIn every meeting, I stressed that direct engagement and sustained communication at senior levels is the best way to responsibly manage our differences and ensure competition does not veer into conflict,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cI heard the same from my Chinese counterparts.\u201d Blinken, the first holder of his post to meet the Chinese leader since 2018, strode towards Xi with his hand outstretched at the Great Hall of the People, a venue China often uses for greeting heads of state \u2013 positive signals in the choreography of diplomacy. \u201cThe two sides have had candid and in-depth discussions,\u201d Xi said at the start of the meeting, in comments broadcast on Chinese state television. \u201cI hope that through this visit, Mr Secretary, you will make more positive contributions to stabilising China-US relations,\u201d Xi added, addressing Blinken. The rest of the discussion was held behind closed doors. The Chinese readout said the two sides \u201cmade progress\u201d and reached agreement on specific issues, without offering further details. Despite signs of positivity, Blinken acknowledged there were issues on which the two countries disagreed profoundly and even vehemently. China rejected a proposal to set up communication between the Chinese and American militaries. \u201cI want to emphasise that none of this gets resolved in one visit, one trip, one conversation. It\u2019s a process,\u201d Blinken said. The state department said later that in Blinken\u2019s meetings he had raised China\u2019s \u201cunfair and nonmarket economic practices\u201d, human rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and \u201cpeace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\u201d. \u201cThe two sides discussed a range of global and regional security issues, including Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, [North Korea\u2019s] provocative actions, and US concerns with [Chinese] intelligence activities in Cuba,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a state department spokesperson. Blinken\u2019s visit is the first by a US secretary of state in five years. Tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies have soared in recent years over a host of issues including trade, technology and Taiwan, with Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, calling Beijing the most serious threat to long-term US global primacy. Earlier on Monday, Blinken held extensive discussions with China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, at the Diaoyutai state guest house. On Sunday, he held talks with China\u2019s foreign minister, Qin Gang, for more than seven hours. According to a Chinese readout, Wang said China-US relations were at \u201ca critical juncture\u201d and called on the US to make a choice \u201cbetween dialogue or confrontation, cooperation or conflict\u201d. Wang stressed the need to reverse the downward spiral in bilateral ties, but also blamed the current low point on the US\u2019s \u201cerroneous perception of China\u201d. Moritz Rudolf, a fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Wang\u2019s confrontational tone \u201cshows the great level of mistrust of Beijing vis-a-vis the US\u201d. However, given the bleak state of US-China relations, the mere fact that the visit had taken place was a positive sign, he said. Blinken\u2019s trip to China was initially planned for February but was postponed when a balloon, allegedly a Chinese spy balloon, flew over the US, sparking a controversy. China insisted it was a weather balloon that had been blown off course. Given the fraught relations, expectations of the meetings were generally low. Both countries hold hardened positions on a range of issues including trade, Xinjiang and Taiwan. But both sides showed a willingness to talk, with Qin and Blinken agreeing to maintain high-level exchanges and expand cultural and educational exchanges. The meetings could launch the process for more diplomatic engagement between the US and China, laying the ground for a Xi-Biden meeting, for instance, at the Apec summit that will take place in San Francisco in November, Rudolf said. \u201cThe reopening of bilateral communication channels, including on security-related matters, would be a step in the right direction,\u201d he said. Beijing and other western countries have also sought to stabilise relations after a tense few years. On Monday, the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, arrived in Germany for a diplomatic trip that will include a visit to France.

The city\u2019s vibrant Latin music and dance scene, thriving Cuban coffee bars, cigar shops, restaurants and colorful street art can all be credited to the wealth of culture that crossed the Florida Straits with the hundreds of thousands fleeing the island\u2019s new communist regime. Those changes, it turns out, also extend to the way Miami sounds. According to linguistic analysts at Florida International University\u2019s center for the humanities in an urban environment, a new dialect has evolved blending Spanish meanings and English words into a colloquial form of language readily understood here by those who speak and hear it, but which just sounds \u201coff\u201d to the majority of English-speaking Americans. Examples include people who say they are \u201cgetting down\u201d from a vehicle, instead of getting out; \u201cmaking a party\u201d instead of hosting one; and \u201cthrowing a photograph\u201d as opposed to simply taking it. The dialect incorporates what linguists call \u201ccalques\u201d, or \u201cborrowed translations\u201d from a speaker\u2019s native language directly into another, such as the literal translation of the Spanish phrase \u201chacer una fiesta\u201d into \u201cto make a party\u201d in English, or \u201ccasarse con\u201d, meaning to be married with someone, not married to. It\u2019s a different concept, the researchers say, from the more familiar, so-called Spanglish or Franglais hybrid of single words or short phrases melded from two separate languages. Instead, what has happened in Miami, notably since waves of Spanish-speaking Cuban immigrants began arriving after the revolution in their homeland six decades ago, has been a gradual assimilation from their Spanish phraseology into a widely understood local parlance in English. \u201cWe really learn our language not from our families, but from speech communities around us,\u201d said Phillip Carter, FIU professor of English and linguistics and affiliate of the university\u2019s Cuban Research Institute, who led the research. \u201cWhat happens when the speech community is majority foreign born, as in the case of Miami where it\u2019s about 65%, you have people responsible for caregiving, nannies, schoolteachers, children in the classroom, reinforcing those language patterns, and that\u2019s kind of how it enters the language. \u201cThe forms are very close to the regular forms anyway, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s actually shifting to Spanish. It sounds like English, they\u2019re English words, just rendered a little bit differently. For that reason they kind of fly, people here don\u2019t bat an eyelid, but to people from the outside, in conversation, a little flag might go up. \u201cYou know what it means in context, but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on why it sounds odd.\u201d Other parts of the dialect rely less on direct translation, and more on the familiarity among Cuban Americans of accepted, albeit ambiguous meanings. As an example, Carter cites the use of the generic word \u201cmeat\u201d. \u201cIn Spanish, \u2018carne\u2019 can refer to both all meat, or specifically to beef,\u201d he said. \u201cWe discovered local speakers saying meat to mean beef, as in \u2018I\u2019ll have one meat empanada and two chicken empanadas.\u2019\u201d Carter\u2019s team concluded that the first waves of Cuban immigration were \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of the process, with second-, third- and fourth-generation Cuban Americans, and now immigrants from other South and Central American countries in the Miami area, continuing its evolution. \u201cAt this stage, we\u2019re already 50-60 years into it,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration from Cuba has accelerated through the 2000s to today, and also because Cubans set up south Florida as a place where you can go and be Latinx, Latino, Latina, be Hispanic, and also maintain Spanish, it meant that when there was the civil war in Nicaragua, Nicaraguans came here; when there was political turmoil in Colombia in the 1980s, Colombians came here. \u201cSo Miami became a site of immigration from the 1959 revolution to the present, and it hasn\u2019t stopped. English language learners are continually introducing those types of forms into speech communities.\u201d For the research report, compiled with the language expert Kristen D\u2019Alessandro Merii from the University of Buffalo, New York, a former FIU student, Carter spoke with several generations of Cuban immigrants and Cuban Americans, including college students identifying as Latinx and born in Miami who speak English more than Spanish. \u201cThere are immigrants most proficient in Spanish and may have some proficiency or understanding of spoken English, and people like fourth-generation Cuban Americans who may have some passing understanding of Spanish if they don\u2019t speak it, and are really proficient in English,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of variation that\u2019s going on in the speech community like Miami. When you have two languages spoken by most of the population, you\u2019re going to have a lot of interesting language contact happening.\u201d Carter said he intends to expand the research to look at different regions of Florida and other states where there are large Spanish-speaking immigrant populations, and also to other nationalities in the Miami area. \u201cI got a note from a Haitian American lady, who pointed out that in French they also say \u2018get down\u2019 from a car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s more research to be done with speech communities here that are not of Spanish-speaking background, including Haitian Creole and French.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94701", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/does-the-world-really-need-a-4650-indiana-jones-bag-phoebe-waller-bridge-dial-of-destiny", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Does the world really need a $4,650 Indiana Jones bag?", "lead": "Luxury leather bags inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character in the new Dial of Destiny movie are the latest collaboration between fashion and film \u2013 but this time fans can fawn over Indy discreetly", "author": "Stuart Heritage", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:01:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546822", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/664266848be79e1506475d913832ba6d1d0cd787/0_302_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The latest, and hopefully last, Indiana Jones film is released this month. It isn\u2019t a spoiler to say that it probably won\u2019t end up occupying the same cultural territory as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then again what could? Still, it isn\u2019t a bad film. It contains some digital de-ageing that\u2019s almost convincing, a big twist at the end that feels specifically designed to make the crankiest corners of the internet choke to death on its popcorn and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character carries a bag around for some of the film. No, really, that\u2019s important. When the dust has settled on the Indiana Jones series, everyone will remember the key pieces of its iconography. When future generations come to watch Indiana Jones, they will instantly picture Jones\u2019s hat and whip, and also the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character carries around for some of the last film. Why? Is it because the bag plays an important role in the film? Not really. Is it because it\u2019s an especially memorable bag? No. I\u2019ve seen the film and didn\u2019t even realise that she had a bag until I went back and did a Google Image search for it. But the bag is still very important, because otherwise nobody would have bothered to make an officially licensed partial replica of it and sell it on the internet for several thousand dollars. But they have, so here we are. It has been announced that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny costume designer Joanna Johnston has collaborated with London-based luxury leather goods maker M\u00e9tier to make a bunch of bags and wallets and playing card holders inspired by the film. These are statement pieces, and that statement is \u2018I am slightly too invested in the fourth-best Indiana Jones film, and also I have more money than I really know what to do with.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t to say that the resulting pieces aren\u2019t nice. Of course they\u2019re nice. They\u2019re beautiful. One of them is a suede duffle bag that\u2019s roomy and practical and very well made. But it costs $4,650, which is a lot of money to invest in something designed to commemorate the sequel to a film where Indiana Jones gets blasted across a portion of the American wilderness inside a fridge. This is, of course, just the latest collaboration between the worlds of fashion and entertainment. The final series of Game of Thrones, for example, caused an enormous rush of brands desperate to get in on the action, with Urban Decay bringing out a special Game of Thrones make-up set and menswear brand John Varvatos bringing out a $2,698 leather jacket designed to make you look like someone who lived in a time before the invention of laundry detergent. Jimmy Choo made shoes to commemorate the live-action Cinderella remake. Mr Porter sold a range of menswear based on Kingsman. Start to look for it and you\u2019ll see it everywhere. In a way, it\u2019s quite sweet. When you\u2019re a child, it\u2019s easy to show the world that you like a film, because all you have to do is wait until Halloween and then buy a hellish padded superhero muscle suit to demonstrate your abiding love for, say, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. But it gets harder as you age. You can\u2019t go to work dressed up as Darth Vader, because you are now a grownup and as such experience a suitable amount of shame when it comes to being enthusiastic about things. True, there are plenty of ways in which one\u2019s fandom can be celebrated indoors. You can buy all sorts of expensive merchandise \u2013 limited edition action figures and elaborate Lego sets, maybe even props from the actual movies \u2013 and fill your home with them, in the process creating a shrine to both the object of your enthusiasm and your own harrowing lack of impulse control. But perhaps this represents a new and better way. These bags are a way for people to quietly and discreetly demonstrate their love for Indiana Jones. Take the duffle bag out for a weekend away, and most people will simply think you have a fondness for well-made but pricey luggage. However, those who know will know. Maybe one day a stranger will tap you on the shoulder and whisper \u201cExcuse me, isn\u2019t that the bag inspired by the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character wore in some of the fourth-best Indiana Jones movie? I\u2019d recognise that anywhere,\u201d into your ear and, instantly, you will have made a friend for life."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94702", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/elemental-review-fire-and-water-fall-in-love-in-multicoloured-unworldly-pixar-fable", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Elemental review \u2013 fire and water fall in love in multicoloured, unworldly Pixar fable", "lead": "Decent family entertainment set in the city of four elements, with a message of acceptance in bricks of colour and concepts as if originated via algorithm", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:00:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546839", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b59d4593589d73a6408a18627c63af1fa4e781/0_113_2352_1411/500.jpg", "body": "Here is a perfectly decent, personable family entertainment from Pixar, based around another of this studio\u2019s oddly pedantic and algorithmically developed abstract high concepts: what if fire and water fell in love? It is also a star-crossed love story based on that most traditional of American themes: melting-pot diversity in the big city. The scene is another fabular alt-reality: Element City, a place of vivid colours and shapes like a toy held up in front of a newborn. Here, the creatures of the four elements \u2013 fire, water, earth and air \u2013 have come together to live, if not in harmony exactly, then a kind of boisterous acceptance. There is, however, a bigoted caste system that means that fire creatures are looked down on, maybe in the way the US\u2019s northern European identities look down on people from hotter countries. Each of them comes from an old country where they were members of the only element-ethnicity. Bernie and Cindy Lumen (voiced by Ronnie Del Carmen and Shila Ommi) are hardworking first-generation fire immigrants who set up a store in the city\u2019s Fire Town district. They have a smart, fiery-tempered teen daughter Ember (Leah Lewis), whom they hope will take over the business when they are gone. But left alone to mind the shop one day, Ember\u2019s explosively combustible temper cracks the pipes, which have been amateurishly installed by her dad, and this brings a certain watery young man through the cracks. This is Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), a government building inspector who really ought to penalise the Lumen family. But he\u2019s a goofy, soppy romantic whose watery identity is represented chiefly by his tear ducts. There\u2019s a funny scene showing his family playing what they call \u201cthe crying game\u201d (nothing to do with Neil Jordan\u2019s film of that name), in which they challenge each other to listen to a poignant story without bursting into tears. Wade falls in love with Ember, whose incendiary talent for turning sand into glass might yet prove to be the making of them both. To find happiness, Wade has to prove himself to Ember and also to her suspicious parents. It\u2019s a bit silly, a bit surreal, a bit simplistic, and lands itself with the problem of how to show Ember being sad (which she sometimes is) and Wade being passionate (which he also sometimes is). But this film is surely pitched at much younger kids than a comparable Pixar film such as Inside Out, in which the separate moods inside us all were represented by different characters. The question of whether Pixar\u2019s golden age is irrevocably behind us is now well-established and perhaps also misleading. In fact, Pixar has given us some outstanding films recently in Soul and Coco, and I am admittedly in a minority in thinking the Toy Story spin-off Lightyear is much better than it\u2019s given credit for. But undoubtedly Elemental is another step away from the sophisticated brilliance of this studio\u2019s glory days. Perhaps these multicoloured abstracts make the films sell better in international territories, but there is a worrying hint of PixarGPT about all this. Elemental seems to have been formulated with slightly chilling accuracy and the look of the movie is less interesting than it could have been. But having said that, a certain sweet, unworldly idealism in Elemental survives, the keynote of optimism \u2013 and this is the flame that Pixar has to keep alive. \u2022 Elemental is out now in Australia and the US, and on 7 July in the UK"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94703", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/19/courgette-budget-recipes-rosie-sykes-stuffed-bread-garlic-bulgur-pilaf", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rosie Sykes\u2019 budget recipes for courgettes", "lead": "The cheesy goodness of courgette-stuffed bread, plus wonderfully rich, slow-cooked garlic courgettes with bulgur pilaf", "author": "Rosie Sykes", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 12:00:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546857", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d0e068311673d82842f171746492a43c20f7c6/0_0_5683_3410/500.jpg", "body": "From the same family as cucumbers, squashes and melons, courgettes are very versatile, and are at their best and most affordable between June and September. Go for smaller, firmer ones for salads, marinades or grilling, while larger specimens work best roasted, fried or braised. If you have the space to grow some yourself, you will already know how well they can crop, and if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll always be on the lookout for new things to do with them, which is how today\u2019s first recipe came about. Slow-cooked garlic courgettes with bulgur pilaf Slow cooking turns courgettes wonderfully rich, and once you\u2019ve mastered the approach, there are many variations on the theme. My friend, the fabulous chef Laura Jackson, who co-owns the lovely canal-side Towpath cafe in east London, makes an especially delicious stew with braised courgettes, white beans and saffron that she serves with minty creme fraiche. The pilaf, meanwhile, is loosely based on a recipe from one of the gorgeous Moro cookbooks that I\u2019ve been making for years. I like to serve this with a bowl of seasoned yoghurt. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 15 min Serves 4 3 tbsp light olive oil 30g butter 4 courgettes (500g), washed, trimmed and cut into 1cm-thick coins (if they are fat, cut them in half lengthwise first) Sea salt and black pepper 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed or finely grated A few soft herb leaves \u2013 mint, basil or oregano (optional) Seasoned yoghurt, to serve (optional) For the pilaf 20g butter 2 tbsp light olive oil 4 spring onions, lightly trimmed and sliced 1 tsp chilli flakes 200g bulgur wheat 300ml vegetable stock A squeeze of lemon 1 small handful parsley, roughly chopped In a large pan for which you have a lid, heat the light olive oil and butter, add the courgettes and a generous dose of salt, and leave them to come up to a good heat, shaking the pan from time to time. When they start sizzling, turn down the heat, stir in the garlic, cover and leave to cook gently for 20-30 minutes, until the courgettes are collapsing \u2013 check on them every now and again, and give them a stir and a squish. Take off the lid, turn up the heat a little and cook to reduce the liquid that will have accumulated in the pan \u2013 you\u2019re after a thick, spoonable consistency. Season to taste, cover again and leave to sit on a very low heat until the pilaf is ready \u2013 the courgettes will sit happily for ages. For the pilaf, melt the butter and oil on a medium heat, add the spring onions and chilli flakes, and soften, stirring regularly, for five minutes. Add the bulgur and a generous pinch of salt, stir to coat, then add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan, leave to simmer for five minutes, then stir thoroughly to make sure nothing\u2019s sticking to the bottom of the pan. Turn down the heat to low, cover and cook for five minutes more. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley, season to taste, then take off the heat and leave to rest for five minutes. Stir the soft herbs into the courgettes. Spoon the pilaf on to warmed plates, top with the courgettes and serve with some seasoned yoghurt, if using. Courgette-stuffed bread These very simple breads can be cooked in a frying pan as well as in the oven, as here \u2013 I usually bake them, though, so I can go and do other things while they\u2019re cooking. Serve with a salad and some chutney to cut through the cheesy goodness. Prep 10 min Steep 1 hr Cook 50 min Serves 4 2 large courgettes, trimmed and coarsely grated (about 380g) 1 large red onion, peeled and finely sliced Sea salt and black pepper About 150g yoghurt 360g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed or finely grated 1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and finely diced (optional) 150g hard cheese, coarsely grated \u2013 whatever suits your tastes and pocket 1 tbsp light olive oil Put the courgettes and onion in a bowl, add a good pinch of salt and toss to combine. Set a colander over another bowl, tip in the courgette mix and press it down to squeeze out some of the liquid. Cover the courgettes with a clean cloth, weigh down with some tins or a heavy pan, then leave to drip away for an hour or so \u2013 this liquid will later be used in the flatbreads. Measure out the liquid in the bowl \u2013 you should have about 100ml or so. Add water to top it up to 200ml, then stir in the yoghurt and set aside. Put the flour in a bowl, make a well in the centre, add most of the courgette liquid and yoghurt mix, and use your hands to work the mix until it comes together into a shaggy dough; if need be, add the rest of the liquid. Turn out on to a lightly floured surface, knead until smooth, divide into four and roll into balls. Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8 and put in two large oven trays. Meanwhile, mix the grated courgette mixture with the garlic, chilli and cheese, and season to taste. Using your hands or a rolling pin, roll out one ball on a floured worktop into a 1cm-thick circle and spoon a quarter of the courgette mix into the centre. Gently gather the edges, bring them up and over the filling to cover it completely, then pinch all around to seal very well. Flour the worktop and your hands, then press out each bread into a flat, 2\u00bdcm-deep disc: the top will be thinner than the bottom, so don\u2019t worry if any small holes appear or there is a little seepage. Drizzle some olive oil on to the heated baking sheets and lay two breads on each tray. Drizzle each bread with some more oil and bake for about 25-30 minutes, until golden.

We much preferred to be out exploring a city. But we\u2019d just done a big tour of Europe, had been away for weeks, and were feeling really homesick. We\u2019d ended in Germany: it was the last show of the tour, about four in the afternoon, and it was pissing down with rain. Paul came up with the riff from nowhere, and immediately I started humming the verse. It was weird \u2013 this has only happened two or three times in our whole career \u2013 but within 20 minutes we\u2019d got the arrangement and most of the lyrics. I remember that when we played around with it in the soundcheck, our crew stopped what they were doing and just listened. We knew it was a winner. We recorded it quickly and made a pretty ropey video. The original idea was to film on a real train, but in the end they built a wooden carriage in a warehouse. It looks as if I\u2019m walking through all these different carriages \u2013 in reality I was just walking through the same one over and over. Someone stood outside spinning a light round on a pole to make it look as if the train was moving, passing places. We rush-released the single at the end of the year, which meant we were the only act in 1996 to have five Top 40 singles. The downside was that it got a bit lost in the Christmas rush and only went to No 17. If we\u2019d have released it even a couple of weeks earlier, I think it would have been Top 5, but over the years it\u2019s become the song that people most connect with. It\u2019s about disappointment and wanting what you can\u2019t have \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been chasing rainbows all my life\u201d \u2013 which obviously everyone can relate to. Now it ends all our gigs. It\u2019s such a great feeling when people leave and are still singing it down the street. Paul Banks, guitar, songwriter I\u2019m pretty sure we were playing the Luxor in Cologne. That clip in the recent film Get Back, where Paul McCartney spontaneously comes up with the title song in a few minutes, totally takes me back, because that\u2019s what writing Chasing Rainbows felt like. Normally on the bus, we\u2019d have had the PlayStation on, but I picked up my guitar and started strumming without really knowing what I was playing. It was subconscious: I just started playing the riff. My left arm got broken when I was a kid and never set right, so I\u2019ve got limited rotation. Because of that, I\u2019ve never been able to play barre chords, but someone had showed me these minor barre chords lower down the guitar, and Chasing Rainbows starts with one of those. In the space of an hour, we went from Rick and me coming up with the verse, bridge, lyrics and chorus to playing the song in soundcheck. I\u2019m pretty sure we put it in the setlist for the gig that night. Then, as soon as we got home to York, we did a demo and sent it to the record company. Going for Gold had been a big hit for us, so the label wanted to get us straight back into the studio with Chris Sheldon producing. The single\u2019s sleeve featured a man standing outside a bingo hall in London with some flowers, looking as if he\u2019d been stood up. For the song\u2019s 25th anniversary, we did a new mix and put something on Twitter asking if anyone knew the guy on the sleeve. This woman replied and said: \u201cIt\u2019s my husband!\u201d Then he got in touch. In the 90s, he\u2019d kept a diary, and still had the details of the original location on Kennington Road in London. We recreated the sleeve with him still stood outside the same building, same suit, same pose, flowers, 25 years later. It\u2019s a Tesco Express now. \u2022 Shed Seven play the Picturedrome, Holmfirth on 11 August and headline Party at the Palace, Linlithgow, on 12 August.

When the farm was liberated, the carcasses covered the land as far as you could see. Those that were not blown up or gunned down starved. They were so hungry, they ate each other\u2019s tails. The survivors standing at the trough in one of the farm\u2019s wrecked sheds have stubs where their tails once were. \u201cThe cows are terrified after what they went through,\u201d said Serhii Vorobyov, the farm\u2019s deputy manager. \u201cThey are just like soldiers who\u2019ve been on the frontline. They are scared if you just go near them.\u201d The surviving farm workers in this village near Balakliia, in Kharkiv oblast, are every bit as damaged. When the Russians \u2013 a motorised rifle regiment all the way from Kaliningrad and another from just across the border in Valuiki \u2013 first took over the farm on 3 March last year, relations between occupiers and occupied were initially terse but civil. All that changed after the Russians took heavy losses in an engagement with Ukrainian forces. \u201cThey looked like the same people but they behaved totally differently. You can see madness in their eyes,\u201d said Yurii Vovchenko, the farm manager. \u201cThey were shooting at people on the streets, yelling and screaming, so people were scared and stayed at home after that.\u201d The Russian soldiers, most of them teenagers, invited some of the farm workers to milk the cows, and six of the labourers never returned. Their remains have not yet been found. The Russians are long gone, but the occupation continues to hobble the Husarivka farm. The buildings are wrecked and the land is sown with mines. Until the devices are cleared, crops cannot be planted and the 230 surviving cattle cannot be put out to pasture. The Kharkiv regional mine-clearing team helped to screen the buildings and courtyards, but they and the international organisations supporting them are stretched far too thin to clear everyone\u2019s farmland this spring. The area of Ukraine exposed to conflict and therefore potentially mined is up to 25m hectares, the size of the UK. The Halo Trust, a landmine clearance charity, says Ukraine faces \u201cthe heaviest landmine contamination the world has seen since the second world war\u201d. The Ukrainian government is starting to decontaminate the territory it controls even as it conducts a counteroffensive aimed at liberating the rest. \u201cThe government of Ukraine plans to return over 470,000 hectares of the most valuable agricultural land to productive use within four years,\u201d said Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister. \u201cOur plan is to survey, clear and return to use most of all potentially contaminated areas within 10 years.\u201d Kyiv and the Halo Trust and other charities are pressing for mine clearance to be at the centre of the Ukraine recovery conference, which begins in London on Wednesday, as the first step in restoring the agricultural sector. \u201cThe Ukraine recovery conference must signal the start of an unprecedented effort to restore an industry that feeds the rest of the world,\u201d said James Cowan, Halo\u2019s CEO. Halo has 800 Ukrainian staff working on demining, a figure expected to double next year, but by Ukrainian law they are not allowed to remove and destroy mines themselves. They can only map them and mark their location, a limitation that has slowed clearance. An administrative fix is being worked on, but Vovchenko cannot wait for conferences and legal reform. The government is already demanding taxes and the landowners are expecting rent each month. \u201cI have two choices: to go bankrupt and become a homeless person, or I can survive and do something about it,\u201d he said. Vovchenko and his workers are clearing their land themselves. They start off by dragging a long rope across each field to trigger any tripwires and then they walk across the land finding mines, unscrewing the detonators and stacking them up. He said they had found thousands, and he showed recent photos of piles of anti-tank mines in one of his trucks. They have been lucky so far that none of the mines have been booby-trapped. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of anti-lift devices, a lot of booby traps and two or three mines being placed on top of each other deliberately,\u201d said Mike Newton, who runs the Halo Trust regional headquarters. \u201cBut as you\u2019ve seen, farmers just can\u2019t wait, and we completely sympathise with that. People just need to get out and make a living, and they do that in the most incredible circumstances and there\u2019s a great degree of innovation.\u201d Modern mine-clearing technology is beginning to arrive in Ukraine. On the outskirts of Izium, not far from Husarivka farm, a Croatian-made robot mine-clearer the size of a large bulldozer is being used by the regional emergency services to clear land under damaged electricity pylons so that repair work can begin. It will be months until that work is completed. Meanwhile, some local farmers have made low-budget approximations of the commercial robots. At Oleksandr Kryvtsun\u2019s farm at Hrakove, about 40 miles north of Izium, the workers have welded bits of an abandoned Russian tank and armoured car on to an old tractor and its harrow and then wired it up to a battery-powered remote controller. The resulting machine looks like it belongs in a Mad Max film. The operator sits at a safe distance in the scoop of a bulldozer made comfortable with a wooden crate and some cushions and works the remote control panel, running the tractor up and down the fields, triggering mines. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t wait to start planting so we took means into our own hands. We saw how the foreign machines looked and made something similar with our hands,\u201d Kryvtsun said. It took about two months to perfect. They have since made similar contraptions for five other farmers nearby and now have a line of customers for their machines. \u201cCircumstances make us innovators,\u201d he said. \u201cThey push us to think in new ways.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94706", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/chelsea-fans-oppose-sponsorship-deal-online-casino", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Chelsea fans voice opposition to sponsorship deal with online casino", "lead": "Chelsea fans have expressed overwhelming opposition to shirt sponsorship from an online casino after a deal with Paramount+ was blocked", "author": "Sean Ingle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:45:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546917", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d6122c95c7e7968ac5000a067447c084bd36f509/0_103_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Chelsea supporters have expressed overwhelming opposition to a proposed shirt sponsorship with an online casino that hails itself as a \u201cworldwide leader in crypto gambling\u201d.

All three have revealed a fine understanding of the complexities of Strauss\u2019s music and dramaturgy. His Ariadne, however, is more radical than its predecessors, a considered, if at times drastic rethink of an ambivalent even problematic work. Ravella strips the opera of its familiar associations with the baroque, either in the original 18th-century setting or the ornate profusion that most directors bring to it. In their place is something altogether more stark and austere. Designer Giles Cadle\u2019s simple set of staircases and platforms initially frame the backstage doors and rooms for the Prologue, but are later transformed by Malcolm Rippeth\u2019s lighting into a disquieting, Escher-type labyrinth \u2013 Naxos as an island of the mind where Natalya Romaniw\u2019s Ariadne is effectively imprisoned by her own loneliness. Costumes, meanwhile, suggest the 1950s, with Romaniw in a plain pink dress and her attendants in green, while Polly Leech\u2019s Composer and Young Woo Kim\u2019s Bacchus both wear suits. The absence of fussiness allows Ravella to dispense with various directorial tropes that have crept in over the years. Not having the stage awash with extras in the Prologue leaves us free to concentrate on narrative, psychology and the all important interplay of ideas. There\u2019s no attempt in the second half to suggest any sort of development of the relationship between Leech and Jennifer France\u2019s Zerbinetta, which is left unresolved, as it should be, by the time we reach the interval. And the final apotheosis, achieved by the sparsest of means, is breathtaking. There are flaws, though. The harlequinade is po-faced and unfunny. And I\u2019m not convinced that Zerbinetta\u2019s Grossm\u00e4chtige Prinzessin is really about the levels of vulnerability and anger that Ravella has France bring to it here. But it\u2019s a fascinating piece of theatre, and the best of it is beautiful indeed. The theatrical sparseness also means that music and emotion really hit home. Romaniw is an outstanding Ariadne, singing with great depth of feeling and an extraordinary richness of tone over the role\u2019s wide range, her low notes as sumptuous as her upper register is thrilling. France, in her second UK Zerbinetta this year, is also excellent, her coloratura wonderfully accurate and gleaming. Kim ducked one tricky high note on opening night, but otherwise sang handsomely with a telling, subtle use of dynamics. Leech\u2019s Composer is bright-voiced, passionate and superbly acted. In the pit, the Philharmonia play quite wonderfully for Mark Wigglesworth, whose conducting is remarkable in its finesse, intensity and emotional depth. \u2022 Ariadne auf Naxos is at Garsington Opera until 21 July."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94708", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/life-is-more-important-than-art-thats-why-art-is-important-review-whitechapel-gallery-london", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Life Is More Important Than Art review \u2013 banality turns into poetry", "lead": "From snaps of car parks and train platforms to an operatic film showing people arriving at an airport, this show reveals that art is a particular way of looking at life", "author": "Jonathan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:38:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546954", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fe67c947be22379a7888cd97534e68084d618226/0_51_939_563/500.png", "body": "Nearly 50 years ago, a young artist called John Smith took his camera to a street in Dalston, London, to film people going about their lives. Except that he pretended to construct and author this raw slice of reality. Over the black and white footage you hear Smith barking out commands like a director. \u201cI want the man in the white boiler suit to come in from the left!\u201d It\u2019s funny and thought-provoking: what is is art, if not a moment in which we frame all the stuff going on in the world, and see it as if we were part of a vast fiction? Smith\u2019s work forms part of the first exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London under its new director, Gilane Tawadros. It\u2019s a promisingly quirky, adventurous start by her, that challenges you to wonder what the difference between art and life is, if any. This is not exactly a new question. But it is asked here in a daring way that risks utter banality to unlock poetry. Smith\u2019s 1976 conceptual art masterpiece The Girl Chewing Gum is its keynote, a British punk version of French New Wave cinema that suggests art is life, and life only. The parody directorial voice becomes increasingly deranged: a young man walking by in a rain coat has just robbed a bank and has a gun in his pocket. Then the kids in the cinema queue notice the camera and start looking at it, curious, amused and self-conscious. A moment of truth that transcends invention. It\u2019s lovely. Much in the exhibition turns a direct mirror to the streets outside, in almost unmediated images of British urban life right now. Playing a similar game to Smith, Mitra Tabrizian\u2019s Film Stills invite you to find a narrative in apparently chaotic, random photos of lockups and parked cars. Yet the depth of this show lies in seeing inwards, understanding that as we pass by each other, our memories and desires brush the air like ghostly shadows. Alia Syed crosses that border between outer existence and inner consciousness in her film Fatima\u2019s Letter: against fleeting monochrome images of platforms and trains, we hear fragmented memories of migration and lost worlds, lost connections. That same sense of the infinite mystery hidden in the daily grind is given transcendent form by the classic of contemporary art that concludes this exhibition. Mark Wallinger\u2019s Threshold to the Kingdom may be familiar to some but seeing it again makes you startled at how such a simple idea can be so profound. Wallinger fixes his camera on people coming out of the arrivals gate at an airport. Their smiles and the hugs of waiting friends, or their anxious, isolated faces, or confident strides, are shown in slow motion, lifesize, approaching you directly. Allegri\u2019s Miserere plays majestically. And it is like seeing people enter heaven, a scene from a Last Judgment altarpiece, a canto written by Dante: so much poetry, taken from completely real, ordinary moments in modern lives. It makes the exhibition\u2019s point perfectly: art is just looking, in a certain way, at life. There are good works aplenty, but the discovery here is the radical veteran John Smith. In 2020 Smith started filming over the rooftops from his window in the London borough of Hackney. There\u2019s so much mist and snow in the opening shot that you can only see a white blankness above the houses. When that clears, the glass towers of the City loom and we hear Boris Johnson in the early weeks of 2020 talking dismissively about coronavirus. As the days pass his pronouncements get more alarmed. Smith carries on filming, spying on his neighbours as they move around their homes in lockdown. While Downing Street partied. It\u2019s almost too real. Often, art is an escape \u2013 or at least a way of sublimating the mess of life, like Smith pretending to \u201cdirect\u201d it in his early film. This exhibition wonders what it would be like if art was as true, as unvarnished, as a piece of chewing gum on asphalt. Refreshing, is the answer.

Liu Jianchao, the head of the international department of the Communist party of China central committee, is due to speak at the Chatham House thinktank and meet UK parliamentarians. Victims of China\u2019s transnational extraditions and their families are exploring if it is possible to make an application for Liu\u2019s arrest at Westminster magistrates court on the basis he is accused of international crimes. The peers and MPs say they are appalled at the visit and question how someone such as Liu could have been given a visa. The group, including Sarah Champion, the chair of the international development select committee, Lord Alton, the Conservative MP Tim Loughton and the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, say that between 2015 and 2017 Liu had ultimate command for thousands of so-called international fugitive recovery operations and the irregular methods employed by the Chinese government to bring them back to China. The criticism is part of a wider battle between some parliamentarians and ministers over a perceived new willingness by ministers to avoid confrontations over Chinese repression in an effort to improve wider relations with Beijing. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been at odds with some MPs who have accused him of going soft on China in recent months. Cleverly is due to visit Beijing later this year, but is struggling to manage angry backbenchers. The group of British parliamentarians cites a submission written by the NGO Safeguard Defenders that says Liu, as director of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\u2019s (CCDI) International Cooperation Bureau, had direct command of and responsibility for thousands of international fugitive recovery operations. The recovery operation was presented as a drive against corrupt officials who had fled abroad and needed to be extradited to face charges. But Safeguard Defenders says this was not the case and the operations targeted opponents of the regime. Laura Harth, the Safeguard Defenders campaign director, said \u201cthe \u2018persuasion to return\u2019 operations account for the vast majority of successful fugitive returns and flaunted those individuals\u2019 as well as their families\u2019 rights to a legal defence and fair trial\u201d. In a 21-page dossier, she claims the \u201cmethods employed institute a wanton climate of fear within overseas diaspora communities, aimed at silencing dissent and accounts of gross human rights violations inside China\u201d. The report claims Liu was the co-author of \u201cthe special investigative mechanism of liuzhi, a system of incommunicado detention firmly outside the bounds of any judicial overview, that institutionalizes enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture for investigative purposes by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\u201d. The report estimates that more than 9,000 Chinese fugitives or exiles have been extracted from abroad. The group, coordinated by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, acknowledges in its letter that diplomacy requires meeting people with whom one disagrees, and that the visit has not been sponsored by the UK government but they say \u201ca line is crossed when someone with his human rights background is afforded such a platform\u201d. The letter says \u201cLiu himself, when speaking of the system of \u2018liuzhi\u2019 which he helped design \u2013 consisting of enforced disappearances, incommunicado detention and torture \u2013 said: \u2018These are not criminal or judicial arrests and they are more effective.\u2019\u201d The report estimates approximately up to 70 people are put into Iiuzhi every day. As secretary of the Zhejiang CCDI, Liu Jianchao had command responsibility over the use of the system in Zhejiang province between 2017 and 2018. As a member of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and a member of the 20th party central committee, he continues to bear oversight responsibility for the implementation of the measure nationwide."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9470a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/sir-michael-hopkins-portcullis-house-lords-mound-stand-architect-dies", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sir Michael Hopkins, Portcullis House and Mound Stand architect, dies aged 88", "lead": "Hopkins was part of vanguard of \u2018hi-tech\u2019 architects who dominated building design in UK and beyond", "author": "Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:31:17", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.546989", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2276a49b11a9ce8b655c2805de7a52daa4b015c6/0_340_4789_2875/500.png", "body": "Sir Michael Hopkins, one of the leading British architects of his era, has died leaving behind a built legacy including Portcullis House at the Palace of Westminster, the Mound Stand at Lord\u2019s cricket ground and the Jubilee campus at Nottingham University. His wife, Patty Hopkins, with whom he formed Hopkins Architects in 1976, said he had \u201cdied peacefully at the age of 88, surrounded by his family\u201d. Alongside Richard Rogers, who died last December, Norman Foster and Nicholas Grimshaw, Hopkins became part of a vanguard of \u201chi-tech\u201d London-based architects who from the 1980s and into the 2000s dominated building design in Britain and beyond. He and Lady Hopkins won the Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1994, he was elected a Royal Academician in 1992 and knighted for services to architecture in 1995. Michael Taylor, the current principal of Hopkins Architects, described Hopkins as \u201cbrilliant in his analysis and fearlessly creative in his designing\u201d. He said Hopkins approached building design by first \u201cestablishing a sense of place, about how to make historic connections, how to put the materials together in an honest and contemporary way so that the building would appear calm and make immediate sense to the end user\u201d. Lady Hopkins said: \u201cMichael was obsessive about architecture and tenacious in refining a design until he was absolutely satisfied with it. He was usually (and annoyingly) right. He made the world \u2013 and the buildings so many people live, work and learn in \u2013 more beautiful. We will miss him more than we can imagine.\u201d The couple first met at the Architectural Association, a school for architecture in London, and started their partnership in the 70s with commissions including their own house in Hampstead, a glass and steel structure that quickly became a case study of the pared-backed aesthetic of the hi-tech movement. It was also the family home, where the couple brought up their three children. It was open plan, but when the children became teenagers they demanded their bedrooms get walls. By the 1980s they discovered brick, after being asked to rebuild the Mound Stand for Marylebone Cricket Club, which included Victorian brick arches. They went on to use the material for a new opera house at Glyndebourne and used stone amply at Portcullis House. Meanwhile, Rogers and Foster, who had worked with Hopkins on the celebrated Willis Faber and Dumas building at Ipswich, pressed on with steel and glass. When lottery money for public architectural commissions started to flow around the turn of the millennium, Hopkins Architects built the Forum, a new covered public space in Norwich. The commission for Portcullis House led them into one of the most controversial building projects of its era. The soaring \u00a3235m cost for the MPs offices, which opened in 2001, grabbed public attention. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on indoor fig trees, recently felled. The Guardian\u2019s critic at the time of opening complained its robust appearance meant it \u201clooks across to the Palace of Westminster like a podgy, old-time pugilist might, squaring up to its well-mannered Victorian partner and sniffing: \u2018Come on then, wanna fight?\u2019\u201d But the building has become increasingly well-loved, with a huge atrium where MPs mingle with lobbyists over coffee and lunch, and handsome committee rooms where everyone from Rupert Murdoch to Boris Johnson has been grilled. The concrete cathedral of Westminster tube station below was also designed by Hopkins Architects, as part of the architecturally ambitious Jubilee line extension, with architects such as Will Alsop, Foster, Ian Ritchie and Richard MacCormac picked to design distinctive stations as the line headed east towards Canary Wharf. The Hopkins partnership was also known for 1985\u2019s Schlumberger Cambridge Research Centre with a tent-like roof that would be echoed at Lord\u2019s, the Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Evelina Children\u2019s hospital, which opened in 2005 and was a rare example of a new NHS building at that time that was not built under the private finance initiative that was known for sidelining the contribution of architects. Hopkins was born in 1935 in Poole, Dorset, to a builder father and a mother who decided when he was 12 that he would be an architect. He is survived by his wife, three children and 11 grandchildren. His family said that in his final years he had lived with vascular dementia."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9470b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/19/the-big-idea-will-ai-make-us-stupid", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The big idea: Will AI make us stupid?", "lead": "There may be an unexpected upside to machines taking on more of our mental tasks", "author": "Simon Winchester", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 11:30:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547009", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f0fd62e6e27028303b44694c05c2db52be5183fc/0_51_1847_1108/500.jpg", "body": "Modern historians count 1967 as an especially busy year: the six\u2011day war, the summer of love, Sgt Pepper, the first recorded deaths of American astronauts, the founding of the suburban utopia of Milton Keynes. And also, half-forgotten in the crush, perhaps the most consequential event of all: the invention of the first device ever that permitted us to henceforward stop using a part of our brains. A young Dallas engineer named Jerry Merryman and his team gave us, courtesy of his employers, Texas Instruments, the Cal-Tech electronic calculator. For $400 you could own a shirt-pocket-sized plastic box with buttons and symbols that, if pressed, would answer in an instant, and with impeccable accuracy, any simple arithmetical question you might ask it. And most important, it performed its work invisibly. The abacus and the slide rule might have been mental labour-saving devices, but they still required you to make some use of your grey matter; the Cal-Tech freed you up entirely, removing all mathematical tedium from your daily life. It was semiconductors and algorithms that helped make Merryman\u2019s magic, and for the 60 years since, and in the hands of other similarly blessed engineers, they have continued to do so, relentlessly. Their gifts have been all we might ever have wished for. Our brains can now relax. Whatever cerebral nooks and crannies we employed, for instance, to read paper maps, or to use sextants and compasses and chronometers to find out where we were, have now been put into cold storage: GPS has given us all the direction we might ever need. Not sure how to spell a word or how best to compose a sentence? From the 1980s onward there has been no urgent further need for an OED or a copy of Fowler\u2019s Modern English Usage: Commodore\u2019s WordCheck and its successors have such matters taken care of. And after the presentation in April 1998 at a conference in Brisbane by two (now very rich) young Americans named Page and Brin, of their paper The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine, we had Google, which, for the past quarter-century, has been able to answer all our questions about just about anything in microseconds. OpenAI is currently inventing even more advanced things that promise to blow out of the water whatever still remains of the requirement to do mental work. This has in recent months led to widespread hand-wringing. Our minds, it is said, will inevitably fall out of use, atrophying, or distending, whichever is worse. The nightmare model \u2013 for our bodies \u2013 is a movie like Wall-E, that dystopian vision from 2008 in which humans, having abandoned their polluted and garbage-choked world, live out their lives in cocoons suspended in suborbital space. Here they have evolved into flaccid slobs, marooned in recliners, fed on high-calorie mush from squeeze-packs while gazing glassily at telescreens. So now there comes a similarly dire vision for our minds. With machines doing all our daily mental tasks for us, our brains will become literally thoughtless, our minds a haven for endless daydreaming. We will become spiritually moribund. As inherent knowledge vanishes, no longer much needed since it is now always on tap at the slightest brush of a touch-glass surface, the concept of human wisdom, which is after all a mix of knowledge and experience, will evaporate. Society will slowly flounder and decay, body, mind and soul. This is one vision of our future doom. But I am not a doomsayer \u2013 not so far as our minds are concerned, at least. I challenge the notion that all is now going to intellectual hell. Rather I see ample reason for optimism. And I draw this hope from the sextet of Ancient Greeks who laid the foundations for and defined the very idea of knowledge: Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus and Euclid. These figures, rightly revered and sanctified by time, had minds essentially little different from the finest of our own today \u2013 except in one important respect: there was, in the centuries in which these men lived, so much less for them to know. Karl Popper\u2019s droll and much-quoted remark that \u201cknowledge is finite but ignorance is infinite\u201d is objectively true, of course \u2013 and yet the amount of knowledge in our contemporary mental universe is immeasurably more vast than that in which the intellectual elite of classical times existed. These six and their like travelled little (Aristotle excepted), existing in a world necessarily circumscribed by so little known geography, by very much less history, by the existence of so little written prior description. Their minds, though steeped in the totality of contemporary knowledge, were thus almost tabulae rasae \u2013 nearly empty, ready to take it all in, ready to think, primed for purpose. Which is why our modern minds, once they have been purged of all that today\u2019s algorithms might now deem unnecessary information, will be as ready as theirs were to think, to inquire, to wonder, to contemplate, to imagine, to create. So I see today\u2019s algorithmic revolution as a necessary cleansing, a movement by which we rid ourselves of all the accumulated bricolage of modern intellectual life, returning us to a more reasonable sound-to-noise ratio, gifting us with a renewed innocence, filled with potential. Fanciful though it may sound, this new-made post-AI society could even see the emergence of a new Euclid, a new Plato, a new Herodotus. Such figures may now be waiting in the wings, ready to rise from the ashes of whoever created Milton Keynes, maybe to write us a new edition of the Ethics, or teach us afresh the true worth of human happiness, as Aristotle did so impeccably, 2,500 years ago. If that is the true benefit of clearing our minds of the busywork that is perhaps best left to electronic others, then I can hardly wait. \u2022 Simon Winchester is the author of Knowing What We Know: The Transmission of Knowledge \u2013 from Ancient Wisdom to Modern Magic (HarperCollins).

From inauspicious beginnings in Glasgow \u2013 their debut album Tigermilk was assisted by a Scottish welfare programme for unemployed musicians \u2013 to Brit awards, cruise-ship festivals and the Hollywood Bowl, Belle and Sebastian have brought a fair amount of razzle-dazzle to music that is often (rather inaccurately) thought of as meek and retiring: \u201csad bastard music\u201d, as Jack Black\u2019s character in High Fidelity had it.

A wealth tax on the fortunes of the world\u2019s richest people would raise trillions of dollars that could be spent on helping poorer countries shift their economies to a low-carbon footing, and on \u201closs and damage\u201d, the rescue and rehabilitation of countries stricken by climate disaster. A 2% tax on extreme wealth would yield about $2.5tn a year, by recent estimates. The economists, including the prominent degrowth advocate Jason Hickel, have written a letter to world leaders before a global summit on finance this week. They are calling for a tax of 1.5% for 1.5C to help ensure the world limits global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world\u2019s wealthiest people are responsible for an outsize proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with the richest 1% responsible for double the carbon emissions of the world\u2019s poorest half, according to Oxfam, but there are few constraints on them. Recent research suggests if the combined emissions of wealthy countries was counted against the destruction that the climate crisis is wreaking in poorer countries, the rich would owe the poor $6tn a year in \u201creparations\u201d for the damage caused. Mark Paul, of Rutgers University, and a signatory of the letter, which was spearheaded by the campaigning group Oil Change International, said rich countries were not facing up to their responsibilities. \u201cGlobal north leaders saying they can\u2019t afford to address global crises is the oldest excuse in the book, and simply put, a lie. What\u2019s truly unaffordable is the status quo. The truth is there is no shortage of public money that can be dedicated to the cause, only a lack of political will \u2013 but that must change.\u201d In the letter, the economists also call for an end to harmful subsidies of fossil fuels, and the forgiveness of debts for some of the poorest countries. Alex Lenferna, of Nelson Mandela University and the Climate Justice Coalition, one of the signatories of the letter, said: \u201cCountries in the global south are drowning in debt, which is driving austerity and undermining our ability to respond to the climate crisis. \u201cWe need much more public money to drive a truly just transition. The global north must pay their climate debt, and not use climate finance as a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing that advances their interests.\u201d Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute, said fossil fuel companies must pay for the damage they have caused. \u201cThe wealthy fossil fuel companies that have acted in concert to delay action and perpetuate the carbon economy should also contribute substantially to an atmospheric trust to aid the nations and peoples who have contributed little to the climate emergency.\u201d About 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend the summit for a new global financing pact, which will be held in Paris on Thursday and Friday, hosted by the French president Emmanuel Macron, with Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados. It is intended to address the deep concerns that developing countries have over the continuing lack of the financial assistance that has long been promised to them by richer countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Leaders including Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, are expected to attend. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, is unlikely to attend the meeting, however. Climate finance is an increasingly contentious issue for poorer countries, which are aggrieved that the richer countries are helping Ukraine, and found trillions to cope with Covid, but are unwilling to help them with the impacts of the climate crisis. In November governments agreed to set up a fund for \u201closs and damage\u201d, to help reconstruct communities afflicted by climate disaster. But there is no agreement yet on how to raise the money needed to fill it. Poorer countries also find it hard to access money for green development of their economies, despite being urged by richer countries to cut their emissions. Mottley has set out her proposals for reform of the World Bank and its fellow international institutions to triple the money they can make available to developing countries. The conference will also discuss potential new sources of revenue such as taxes on high-carbon activities, including global shipping. Avinash Persaud, an economic adviser to Mottley, told the Guardian: \u201cWe need a complete rethink of the whole nexus of climate, debt and development. What we are seeing today is new \u2013 countries affected by climate disaster, this is happening now. Countries are drowning.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9470f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/australias-shadow-economy-leeches-124bn-from-tax-revenue-amid-treasurys-failure-to-crack-down", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia\u2019s shadow economy leeches $12.4bn from tax revenue amid Treasury\u2019s failure to crack down", "lead": "Auditor general\u2019s report says bid to tackle cash-in-hand work and tax avoidance measures haven\u2019t worked", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:39:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547080", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9f500b2bec5f9e2664e96c72c8bb2cf2e7191500/0_29_6048_3627/500.jpg", "body": "Treasury has failed to effectively tackle the shadow economy, which leeches $12.4bn in tax from Australia, and \u201cpaused\u201d work on it during the Covid pandemic, an auditor general\u2019s report has found.

While the union has stopped short of calling fresh strikes in the long-running pay dispute, the industrial action by about 12,000 drivers across the 16 English train operators contracted to the Department for Transport is likely to cause more headaches for passengers. The effects of the overtime ban, running from Monday 3 July until the end of Saturday 8 July, will vary for different operators, but as the mass cancellations at TransPennine Express have showed, many firms still rely on rest-day working to run a full service. Trains will continue to run normally within Wales, Scotland and London, where drivers are not in dispute, but intercity cross-border services will likely be affected. Ballots for a renewed six-month strike mandate returned overwhelming majorities in favour last week. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said: \u201cOnce again, we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve this dispute. \u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10%, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away. It\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201d Drivers have been offered a 4% pay rise backdated to April 2022, and another 4% from April 2023, which Aslef dismissed as \u201crisible\u201d given previous pay freezes and the rate of inflation. There were three days of strike action by drivers and another by RMT train operating staff in late May and early June. The RMT union also remains in dispute and may call further action. Ministers and rail industry leaders have said there will be no increased pay offer and have urged both unions to put the proposals to a full vote of their members. Aslef last week announced separate action at Avanti West Coast and LNER in disputes with the companies. There will be a 24-hour strike at Avanti on Sunday 2 July and a continuous overtime ban at LNER from the start of July. This Wednesday marks the first anniversary of the first RMT strike in the current dispute, with unions in rail and other sectors vowing to continue action for pay to keep up with the cost of living."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94711", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/migrant-groups-urge-reform-of-australias-broken-skills-recognition-process", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Migrant groups urge reform of Australia\u2019s \u2018broken\u2019 skills recognition process", "lead": "Streamlining system would get more people into suitable jobs and ease labour supply issues, advocates say", "author": "Mostafa Rachwani", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:35:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547115", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf65d82c3f26e9922651e160812df20b5233b0d/1105_1052_5203_3123/500.jpg", "body": "Mohammad Zubair Harooni has been trying and failing to get a job in his field since he arrived in Australia nearly 18 months ago. While Harooni has a glittering CV, with more than 20 years of experience in public health in Afghanistan, including work as a UN program specialist in HIV, his biggest obstacle has been his status as a recent migrant. He is one of the many who have struggled to have their qualifications recognised in Australia, with one in four migrants working beneath their skill level. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cI have applied for several positions within the health sector and it has been rejection after rejection,\u201d says Harooni, a father of four. \u201cIt\u2019s been really frustrating because my qualifications have not been considered since my arrival. Not even my master\u2019s degree, which was actually completed in Australia, has made a difference.\u201d Only 33% of permanent arrivals in Australia have had their post-school qualifications recognised, even as Australia faces a crippling national skills shortage, with approximately 350,000 skilled job vacancies across the country. It can be an arduous task to get overseas qualifications recognised in Australia. The Productivity Commission in 2006 described it as \u201ccomplex, time-consuming and bureaucratic\u201d process. And it has forced Harooni to turn to other options, including taking an entry-level role at Transport NSW, a job he says he is happy for but doesn\u2019t reflect what he can do. \u201cI\u2019m really thankful for my job, but within myself I am not feeling happy that I am not working in my profession, which is what I have dedicated most of my life to,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has affected all parts of my life.

So I just had to take any role.\u201d A new report from a consortium of migrant advocacy and service groups is calling for reform to get more migrants into suitable jobs that will ease labour supply issues as 286 occupations face shortages. The consortium \u2013 comprising Settlement Services International, The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), Amnesty International, Settlement Council of Australia and Community Corporate \u2013 proposes five solutions. These include fixing the \u201cbroken\u201d skills and qualifications recognition system, strengthening protections for migrant workers, reviewing the right to work for people on temporary visas, building partnerships between public and private sectors, and reforming English language requirements. Violet Roumeliotis, the CEO of Settlement Services International, said the proposed reforms would be a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d for migrants, employers and the economy. \u201cThese ideas could have a significant impact on their lives. We have so many cases of doctors or dentists or lawyers who are Uber drivers because they need the money and can\u2019t get their qualifications recognised,\u201d Roumeliotis said. \u201cThey become de-skilled, they become demoralised and lose motivation, it can be a real struggle for them and their families, particularly when they know they can work in a role they are skilled in and can be paid well.\u201d She said the current system for recognising overseas qualifications was a \u201ccumbersome and confusing process\u201d and as a result only a third of permanent arrivals get through it. \u201cIt\u2019s around 34 different authorities that govern around 400 professions.\u201d Roumeliotis said there are also often cultural barriers to employment and qualification recognition, such as racism. \u201cWe\u2019ve got recruiters who tell us there is, unfortunately, a racist element here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some who insist they don\u2019t want to hire people from particular backgrounds, or people with names they can\u2019t pronounce. It\u2019s a toxic attitude.\u201d Mohan Gunasekara, the acting CEO at Western Sydney Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) said the cost of qualification recognition should also be reformed. \u201cIt can cost thousands of dollars to have some skills assessed, with some occupations requiring multiple tests that can multiply the cost,\u201d Gunasekara said. \u201cAnd it acts as a disincentive \u2013 it leaves people behind.\u201d The federal government, ismeanwhile, is moving to increase Australia\u2019s humanitarian resettlement program for 2023-24, in keeping with its election promise.

The victims were all cyclists or pedestrians, including a woman and child who were left seriously injured in a hit and run while crossing the road on the way to school on Thursday. The other victims include Hussein Nur Teklise, 45, father of a two-year-old boy, who was killed while cycling on 16 May when he was hit by a driver who failed to stop after the collision. A 12-year-old boy, named locally as Azaan Khan, was killed on 8 June while cycling through South Yardley, before a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and being unfit to drive through drugs. On 30 May, a four-year-old boy was killed after being hit by a driver in Erdington, not far from where in a separate incident a cyclist was killed in a hit and run the following day. \u201cIt feels lawless sometimes because people are driving at terrifying speeds. It\u2019s just got really scary recently, it feels like an epidemic of bad driving,\u201d said Rachel Segal Hamilton, part of the Better Streets for Birmingham campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the results of a lack of enforcement and lack of safe infrastructure with people dying and getting seriously injured.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re living through is an emergency but it hasn\u2019t been called that by the people with the power to change things. It requires an emergency response,\u201d added Matthew MacDonald, a fellow campaigner. Hundreds of local residents attended a demonstration led by the campaign group on Sunday in Kings Heath, south Birmingham, near to where the woman and child were injured crossing the road, to demand better behaviour from drivers, enforcement from police and safety infrastructure from the council. Last week they published an open letter to the city council calling for the delivery of cycling and walking infrastructure schemes to be brought forward to 2025 from 2027, urging leaders to use the \u201cGames mindset\u201d employed to deliver the Commonwealth Games in the city last year under urgent time pressures. John Cotton, leader of Birmingham city council, said councillors were working on refreshing the city\u2019s road safety strategy with measures including reducing 40mph urban roads to 30mph and increased \u201cgreen times\u201d for active travel at junctions and crossings. \u201cThe council is horrified and saddened by the recent tragic incidents on the city\u2019s roads involving cyclists and pedestrians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe agree that we cannot wait for new infrastructure \u2026 We need to move far more quickly if we are to meet the range of challenges currently facing the city.\u201d Adam Tranter, cycling and walking commissioner for West Midlands combined authority, said undoing Birmingham\u2019s history as the UK\u2019s \u201cmotor city\u201d was a big challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole ecosystem of car culture that has gone too far and is now stopping people from travelling,\u201d he said. \u201cWalking to school or going to get a pint of milk on your bike should not be a dangerous endeavour. We need a much more robust and urgent response because we can\u2019t as a society accept this as normal.\u201d Tranter said he was pushing the police for greater enforcement and deployment of officers in areas where cyclists and pedestrians are more vulnerable, such as crossings. He added that he supported the council\u2019s recently announced long-term vision to double the city\u2019s green spaces and build about 124 miles of walking and cycling routes, putting it on the same level for cycle friendliness as Copenhagen. \u201cBut we should bear in mind that that that will take a long time, potentially decades, to deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already have the tools and funding now to make a difference, and unless we change, unfortunately, it will keep happening.\u201d In a statement, Ch Insp Rebecca Barnsley, from the West Midlands police central motorway policing group, said the force was working with communities to target \u201chotspot\u201d areas, and conduct speedwatch operations in areas where speeding had been flagged as an issue. \u201cSince April, we have launched investigations into collisions where people have been killed on our roads as either a passenger, driver, cyclist or pedestrian,\u201d she said. \u201cThese truly sad and tragic incidents have brought devastation and loss to families and loved ones and we understand that people are concerned. \u201cWe are working to bring to justice those responsible for causing the devastation and long life impact incidents like these have on victims, families and communities.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94713", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/share-your-experience-with-litter-enforcement-in-the-uk", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share your experience with litter enforcement in the UK", "lead": "We would like to hear from people in the UK about local environmental enforcement", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:22:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547165", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e8cdee2dd82104669379e8370e52b5d13c984346/0_278_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "Across the country, councils are using enforcement companies to issue fines when people drop litter or fly-tip.

Sea temperatures, particularly off the north-east coast of England and the west of Ireland, are several degrees above normal, smashing records for late spring and early summer. The North Sea and north Atlantic are experiencing higher temperatures, data shows. The Met Office said global sea surface temperatures in April and May reached an all-time high for those months, according to records dating to 1850, with June also on course to hit record heat levels. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has categorised parts of the North Sea as being in a category four marine heatwave, which is considered \u201cextreme\u201d, with areas off the coast of England up to 5C above what is usual. The Met Office says temperatures are likely to remain high because of the emerging El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. Daniela Schmidt, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Bristol, said: \u201cThe extreme and unprecedented temperatures show the power of the combination of human-induced warming and natural climate variability like El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cWhile marine heatwaves are found in warmer seas like the Mediterranean, such anomalous temperatures in this part of the north Atlantic are unheard of. They have been linked to less dust from the Sahara but also the North Atlantic climate variability, which will need further understanding to unravel. \u201cHeat, like on land, stresses marine organisms. In other parts of the world, we have seen several mass mortalities of marine plants and animals caused by ocean heatwave which have caused hundreds of millions of pounds of losses, in fisheries income, carbon storage, cultural values and habitat loss. As long as we are not dramatically cutting emissions, these heatwaves will continue to destroy our ecosystems. But as this is happening below the surface of the ocean, it will go unnoticed.\u201d Dr Dan Smale from the Marine Biological Association has been working on marine heatwaves for more than a decade and was surprised by the temperatures. He said: \u201cI always thought they would never be ecologically impactful in the cool waters around UK and Ireland but this is unprecedented and possibly devastating. Current temperatures are way too high but not yet lethal for majority of species, although stressful for many \u2026 If it carries on through summer we could see mass mortality of kelp, seagrass, fish and oysters.\u201d Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at the University of Leeds, said: \u201cBoth Met Office and NOAA analyses of sea-surface temperature show temperatures are at their highest ever level \u2013 and the average sea-surface temperature breached 21C for the first time in April. These high temperatures are mainly driven by unprecedented high rates of human-induced warming. \u201cCleaning up sulphur from marine shipping fuels is probably adding to the greenhouse gas driven warming. The shift towards El Ni\u00f1o conditions is also adding to the heat. There is also evidence that there is less Saharan dust over the ocean this year. This normally reflects heat away from the ocean. So in all, oceans are being hit by a quadruple whammy \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of things to come.\u201d Marine heatwaves are becoming more numerous, a 2019 study found, with the number of heatwave days having tripled in the past couple of years studied. The number of heatwave days rose by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with 1925-54. Scientists said at the time the heat destroyed swathes of sealife \u201clike wildfires take out huge areas of forest\u201d. The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful to humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-heating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A report by the Met Office says warmer than usual marine temperatures are contributing to a reduction in sea ice. It found the amount of Arctic ice was well below average for the time of year but still above record low levels after near-average ice loss during May. However, Antarctic sea ice extent is exceptionally low, the lowest on record for this date by a wide margin. Dr Ed Blockley, the lead of the polar climate group at the Met Office, said: \u201cOver recent decades we have seen a sustained loss in Arctic sea ice extent in every month of the year \u2013 especially in late summer to early autumn. Although the current Arctic sea ice extent is considerably higher than the record low for the time of year, it is still well below the long-term average. \u201cAntarctic sea ice has been at very low levels since November 2016. This year we have seen Antarctic sea ice shrink to a record low point for the time of year, following a second successive annual record minimum sea ice extent in February.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94715", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/19/did-this-tomato-travel-the-underground-railroad", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Did this tomato travel the Underground Railroad?", "lead": "It could have been a gift from a runaway enslaved person.

As the story goes, a Black man entered Ohio from bordering Kentucky. No details about when he made this journey are available, but it may have been during slavery or well after emancipation. His travels took him to Ripley, a town that slavery\u2019s proponents characterized as infested with that most odious species: abolitionists. While there, he gave tomato seeds he\u2019d been carrying to a white woman. Years later, her great-nephew, Francis Parker, began sharing the seeds for what had become \u201cAunt Lou\u2019s tomato\u201d with fellow gardening enthusiasts. Passed from person to person, the seed spread in the small corner of Kentucky and south-west Ohio connected by the Ohio River, a region known for Underground Railroad stops from which runaway enslaved people were secretly ferried to free states. At some point, the Kentucky tomato guru Gary Millwood proposed a revision of the plant\u2019s name to fellow seed keepers who knew of the variety. Millwood, who was white, suggested adding the \u201cUnderground Railroad\u201d part to reflect the anti-slavery activity in the plant\u2019s apparent home ground, and to acknowledge how enslaved people helped build the nation\u2019s agricultural wealth in captivity. Despite centuries of forced farming that transitioned into sharecropping and other exploitative labor systems, few plants bear the names of the Black Americans who stewarded flora and fauna in fields and provisioning grounds. Black workers tilled the land, but white Americans have typically gotten credit for importing, breeding and cultivating crops that became critical to the US diet and economy. Millwood\u2019s move cemented the pinkish beefsteak tomato\u2019s place in history as one of the few vegetable varieties whose name references, however obliquely, slavery or Black contributions to what we grow and eat. Aunt Lou\u2019s Underground Railroad tomato illustrates the difficulty of constructing a more inclusive and accurate historical record. Documenting the lives of African Americans, who were denied in slavery three things that make people more \u201ctrackable\u201d \u2013 surnames, property ownership and literacy \u2013 often leads to a maddeningly long list of dead ends. Still, an ever-expanding host of farmers, seed keepers and historians have dedicated their work to excavating, whenever possible, how Black Americans stewarded and preserved plants. Amirah Mitchell, one such excavator, is the founder of Sistah Seeds, a farm that grows and sells seeds of cultural import to African diasporic communities. Among the seeds she offers are the large, curvy cushaw squash that her North Carolina ancestors grew; a Caribbean tomato that may have been carried to the US by migrants fleeing the Haitian Revolution; and a fish pepper collected by the early 20th-century folk artist Horace Pippin. After seeing the Aunt Lou\u2019s Underground Railroad tomato in the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange database, Mitchell added it to the inventory of Truelove Seeds, a company that partners with 50 farms nationwide to produce seeds. She appreciates the hard-to-find, often flat and creasy tomato for its lower acidity, prolific fruit production that can make trellises sag under the weight, and how it makes a substantial slab for a sandwich. Squirrels also seemed to have a special hunger for them, she added. Even though the Underground Railroad tomato\u2019s story is far from complete, \u201cthe Aunt Lou story is more fleshed out than most of the others we have,\u201d she said. \u201cSome seeds I steward have way less detail. It is really striking how few have that explicitly stated connection to diaspora, even though they are our heritage.\u201d The connections between a common foodstuff and slavery may not be obvious, but the global slave trade trafficked in plants as well as people. Slave ships carried yams and peanuts as food for the captives. Tough grasses from Africa, which functioned as bedding in the fetid quarters of the vessels, took root in coastal South Carolina (and now are having a rebirth as highly desirable and durable golf-course turf). Some enslavers sought people from west Africa\u2019s \u201cRice Coast\u201d, including present-day Senegal and Sierra Leone, for their specific expertise with the crop, in hopes of firmly and profitably ensconcing that grain on the American continent. And when Africans landed in the Americas, they engaged with new plants, translated Indigenous knowledge into their new lives, and became the most important and involuntary farming workforce in the Americas. In the worlds of plant biology and zoology, the person who breeds, \u201cdiscovers\u201d or introduces a variety or species often gets to name it. But as enslaved people were classified as property themselves, they had no claims to intellectual property. Perhaps the most famous example is a Louisiana man named Antoine, who did what no one else could do in the 1840s: graft a pecan tree. His work ensured the successful reproduction of the trees, spawned scores of varieties, and established a business that thrives to this day; the United States produced about $490m worth of the crop in 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Antoine\u2019s work was displayed decades later in a national expo, and his pecan variety was named Centennial after the event. At least that story has a name attached to it. An 1863 encyclopedia of fruits and vegetables listed a watermelon with this note: \u201cThis remarkably large melon originated with a negro man on the property of Col. [Adam Summer], of South Carolina,\u201d the owner of Ravenscroft Plantation. Like the unknown man who landed in Ripley, Ohio, this man\u2019s status as an enslaved or free person is a mystery. Free people were a tiny sliver of the South Carolina population pre-1865, but a small enclave lived very close to Ravenscroft in Newberry county. For growing an almost 60lb specimen, Summer\u2019s friend, Milton Odell, got the props and the produce named after him. But the South Carolina-based scholar James Kibler, who studies the horticultural heritage of the Summers family plantations, disputes that notion: \u201cMilton Odell didn\u2019t develop that watermelon,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd neither did Adam Summer. It was just a chance freak watermelon that a Black gentleman had enough sense to say, \u2018My God!\u2019 and took it to Adam. That\u2019s probably close to the story.\u201d For her part, Mitchell offers this plant\u2019s seeds on her website, but she intentionally avoids the Odell moniker in favor of \u201clarge, white watermelon\u201d. She\u2019s searching for a better way to identify the plant for people who have heard about it and to reflect its origin. Christopher Bolden Newsome, a co-owner of Truelove Seeds with his husband, Owen Taylor, told me there needed to be a concerted effort to research the roots of plants. Rather than resting on a claim that a modern-day explorer uncovered an unusual pink-striped peanut in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Truelove enlisted an Ecuadorian colleague and South American partners to trace it. And trace it they did, back to the Shuar and Achuar Indigenous communities to which Truelove donates some seed proceeds. Newsome observed that that kind of knowledge doesn\u2019t always reside in a book. \u201cThe problem with a more literal, letter-based society is that we want to have written proof,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a function of a type of European thinking, If it wasn\u2019t written down, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d He added that stories are just as important to heirloom plants as the literal seed itself. Descendants might not have the exact origin stories, he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to make new ones. The food that the seed produces quickly gets associated with human activities and emotions\u201d: a meal after a milestone, the last seeds planted before losing a family farm. Like seeds, narratives are dynamic. They grow and travel, sometimes unpredictably. New information can emerge. Stories drop and pick up details. They change in the telling, the listening, the recording and the erosion of time. Taylor constantly thinks about botanical storytelling; he writes all Truelove seed descriptions. He wants to include accurate data, while simultaneously understanding that oral histories are valid, that archival evidence is not necessarily authoritative, and that people yearn for meaning. \u201cThere\u2019s a blurry line between powerful metaphor and history,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am not a historian. I like to understand history as much as I can, but there is a hunger for a reclamation of a story of power and liberation.\u201d That was the case with Jay Erisman, a Cincinnati distillery owner with a broad interest in heirloom grains and a specific one in Aunt Lou\u2019s Underground Railroad tomato. He felt drawn to the story, and he submitted the tomato to the Ark of Taste, a global listing of endangered or distinctive foods. A hobbyist historian, Erisman tried to trace the Aunt Lou\u2019s Underground Railroad tomato and hit the expected roadblocks. He couldn\u2019t pin down details of the various narratives he\u2019d heard: did Aunt Lou actually say the man was formerly enslaved? If so, what did that mean: that he\u2019d liberated himself on the Underground Railroad or simply that they\u2019d met after slavery was abolished? \u201cI think naming it this honors really where it came from, not just Francis and Aunt Lou, but the [maybe] enslaved person who delivered it,\u201d Erisman said. \u201cI started developing this image in my mind of how he\u2019s wading across the Ohio River. His possessions are in a bag on top of his head, and it includes these tomato seeds. Whether that was really the case or not, we don\u2019t know.\u201d In the end, Erisman decided the most valuable thing about Aunt Lou\u2019s Underground Railroad tomato was not the pursuit of truth or sussing out the \u201creal\u201d story. Instead, it was people in different eras engaging in an age-old practice \u2013 gifting each other precious seeds, an act of kindness and community."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94716", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/alliance-defending-freedom-lgbtq-rights-america", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Well-funded Christian group behind US effort to roll back LGBTQ+ rights", "lead": "Advocacy groups condemn Alliance Defending Freedom as \u2018a danger to every American who values their freedoms\u2019", "author": "Adam Gabbatt in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:00:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547223", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/47a9ac2736b5931f79c5b43f80052358846a02d6/1_0_3045_1827/500.jpg", "body": "With the US besieged by a rightwing culture war campaign that aims to strip away rights from LGBTQ+ people and others, blame tends to be focused on Republican politicians and conservative media figures. But lurking behind efforts to roll back abortion rights, to demonize trans people, and to peel back the protections afforded to gay and queer Americans is a shadowy, well-funded rightwing legal organization, experts say. Since it was formed in 1994, Alliance Defending Freedom has been at the center of a nationwide effort to limit the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people, all in the name of Christianity. The Southern Poverty Law Center has termed it an \u201canti-LGBTQ hate group\u201d that has extended its tentacles into nearly every area of the culture wars. In the process, it has won the ear of some of the most influential people in the US, and become \u201ca danger to every American who values their freedoms\u201d, according to Glaad, the LGBTQ+ advocacy organization. Through \u201cmodel legislation\u201d and lawsuits filed across the country, ADF aims to overturn same-sex marriage, enact a total ban on abortion, and strip away the already minimal rights that trans people are afforded in the US. Under the Trump administration, the group found its way into the highest echelons of power, advising Jeff Sessions, the then attorney general, before he announced sweeping guidance to protect \u201creligious liberty\u201d which chipped away at LGBTQ+ protections. The organization counts among its sometime associates Amy Coney Barrett, the supreme court justice who the Washington Post reported spoke five times at an ADF training program established to push a \u201cdistinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\u201d. ADF is engaged in \u201ca very strong campaign to put a certain type of religious view at the center of American life\u201d, said Rabia Muqaddam, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201c[The ADF campaign] extends to abortion, it extends to LGBTQ folks, to immigration, to what kind of religion we think is America, what kind of people we think are American,\u201d Muqaddam said. \u201cIt\u2019s as dramatic as that. I think we are in a fight to preserve democracy and preserve America as a place where we do tolerate and encourage and empower everyone.\u201d ADF was founded in 1994 by a group of \u201cleaders in the Christian community\u201d, according to its website. Among those leaders was James Dobson, the founder of the anti-LGBTQ+ Focus on the Family organization who has said the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were killed, was a \u201cjudgment\u201d from God because of declining church numbers. Its leaders remain involved in niche interpretations of Christianity. Kristen Waggoner, the ADF chief executive, also serves as legal counsel to Assemblies of God, a church which encourages worshippers to speak in tongues and believes in \u201cdivine healing\u201d \u2013 the power of prayer \u2013 as a medical tool. Over the past two decades, ADF has been a main driver in dozens of pieces of rightwing legislation and lawsuits. The organization is currently behind the lawsuit 303 Creative, Inc v Elenis, which the supreme court is expected to decide this month, and which could chip away at LGBTQ+ rights. It\u2019s a case that is classic ADF \u2013 a seemingly manufactured issue which the group has managed to chase all the way through the American legal system. The plaintiff, 303 Creative, is a website design company. 303 Creative has never made wedding websites, but its owner, Lorie Smith, claims her first amendment rights are being impinged because, if she were to start making wedding websites, she would not want to make them for same-sex couples \u2013 which would violate Colorado\u2019s anti-discrimination laws. Another ADF obsession is abortion. It was involved, Muqaddam said, in crafting a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi \u2013 which prompted a legal case that found its way to the supreme court \u2013 eventually resulting in Roe v Wade, which guaranteed the right to abortion, being overturned in 2022. \u201cAlliance Defending Freedom has been instrumental in the dismantling of Roe and the ongoing efforts to eliminate abortion nationwide,\u201d Muqaddam said. \u201cThey enacted a law that they knew was unconstitutional, they enacted it for the purpose of generating case after case after case to push it out to the supreme court until they found a court that was sympathetic to their argument,\u201d Muqaddam said. She added: \u201cI think that\u2019s exactly what is happening in the LGBTQ context as well. Their goal is to limit individual rights as much as possible.\u201d The ADF website shows the breadth of its involvement in rightwing culture wars. The organization touts its work opposing abortion, on opposing same-sex marriage and opposing trans rights. \u201cWe advocate for laws and precedents that promote human flourishing by recognizing the important differences between men and women and honoring God\u2019s design for marriage between one man and one woman,\u201d ADF\u2019s website reads. But Emerson Hodges, a research analyst at the SPLC, said what ADF is really doing is attempting to \u201cundo LGBTQ social and legislative progress\u201d. \u201cThey go under the guise of religious liberty, and religious freedom. What that means, though, is this religious liberty to discriminate and the religious freedom to invalidate LGBTQ individuals,\u201d Hodges said. Worryingly, there are signs that ADF, and other groups like it, are growing in influence. As Republican politicians and rightwing media fan the flames of an extremist culture war, NBC reported that donations to ADF, which is a registered non-profit, more than doubled from 2011 to 2021. As it has grown in influence, ADF\u2019s \u201cmodel legislation\u201d has found its way into state legislatures across the country, as the group attempts to strip away LGBTQ+ rights, and the rights of trans people in particular. \u201cJust about every anti-LGBT legislation that you\u2019ve seen probably in the past decade was probably copied or paraphrased off of a model legislation built by Alliance Defending Freedom,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cThey provide legal advocacy support, litigation and policy models for government officials.\u201d An article on ADF\u2019s website states that it is a \u201cbiblical truth\u201d that \u201cmen and women are physically different\u201d, and the organization has duly worked to prevent trans people taking part in women\u2019s sports. The group sued a school district in Minnesota in 2016, and in 2021 a judge in Connecticut dismissed an ADF lawsuit which sought to prevent transgender athletes competing in high school sports. The same year, ADF backed a lawsuit brought by a teacher in Virginia who had said he would not use a transgender child\u2019s preferred pronouns because that would amount to \u201csinning against our God\u201d. In April, ADF, which did not respond to a Guardian request for comment, filed in Oregon on behalf of a Christian woman who wanted to foster children, but said she would not agree to \u201crespect, accept, and support \u2026 the sexual orientation, gender identity, [and] gender expression\u201d of a child placed with her, the Statesman Journal reported. \u201c[ADF\u2019s] obsession with targeting LGBTQ people is unhinged and drastically out of touch with supermajorities of Americans who support LGBTQ people and laws to protect us from discrimination,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of Glaad. \u201cEveryone should understand the truth: the ADF is simply an anti-LGBTQ group trying to abuse levers of government to push discrimination and keep their warped sense of control. \u201cThey\u2019ve also worked to ban the right to choose, and are in cahoots with other extremist groups to oppress marginalized people. ADF is a danger to every American who values their freedoms \u2013 to be ourselves, live freely, and be welcome to contribute and to succeed in every area of society.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94717", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/19/stuffed-aubergine-recipe-rachel-roddy", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for stuffed aubergines | A kitchen in Rome", "lead": "Two stuffings in each aubergine, actually: first, the scooped-out flesh mixed with tomato, capers and anchovies, and the second made from breadcrumbs whizzed with tomato, herbs and olive oil", "author": "Rachel Roddy", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:00:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547241", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4762dcdb2527af06e707b0e2ab12216b85c0434e/0_3256_4000_2398/500.jpg", "body": "An aubergine hangs above my desk; it is on a tablecloth that looks like a latticed jam tart, beside a plate of pasta, a pair of binoculars and the sea, from which two tiny figures wave. There is also a hot dog, an apricot, the start of a letter and a glass filled with red and pink that could be Campari or cherry. It is a print by the Sicilian artist Lia Fiore; a psychedelic, summer daydream that provides me with an ideal escape at least once a day, and often reminds me that I\u2019m hungry, for pasta, or for aubergine with plenty of salt and oil. Fortunately, there are aubergines in the kitchen, too \u2013 Vincenzo calls them the keenest vegetable, ready to soak up anything you give them. Advice is mixed when it comes to salting. In the past, aubergines were inherently bitter, and salting was a way of breaking down the cells in order to draw out that bitterness in the form of drops. There is another effect, too: apparently, less water means less oil is absorbed in the subsequent cooking, which is why, even with modern varieties carefully bred to be sweeter and free from excessive bitterness, salting is sometimes suggested. Although not by me, because I think the amount is negligible, plus I always fry or bake them in good-tasting olive oil. Astringency, though, the puckering kind, is often an issue with very young or mature fruit that has done time in cold storage. So, when faced with those (and if I have time), I sprinkle the slices with coarse salt and leave them to sit for 30 minutes, before brushing off any water droplets and salt and blotting them dry. Another benefit of salting is that, even when the coarse salt is brushed away, some seasoning is left. Inspiration this week comes from the countless recipes that call for aubergine halves to be hollowed out and the flesh cooked with other things, before being packed back in like a roof-rack box for a family camping holiday. In Sicily, such recipes are sometimes called tabacchiera di melanzane, or aubergine snuff boxes \u2013 the parliamentary snuff box being a better comparison. My version has two stuffings: the first of scooped-out aubergine flesh mixed with tomato, capers and anchovies, and the second soft white breadcrumbs pulsed with a bit more tomato, herbs and olive oil, which bake into a crisp and golden cover. Use a wide spatula to lift them carefully on to a serving plate, then let them sit for about 10 minutes (or longer), so the flavours can settle. Salted yoghurt is welcome here, or a chopped salad of tomato, cucumber and red onion; alternatively, cubes of roast potatoes or a glass of Campari. Stuffed aubergines Serves 4 2 medium-large or 4 small aubergines Coarse salt 1 bunch spring onions, trimmed, white and green parts finely diced 6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the crumbs and tin of garlic 3 medium ripe tomatoes, peeled and roughly chopped 4 anchovy fillets (optional) 1 tbsp capers, rinsed 100g soft white breadcrumbs 1 handful parsley, roughly chopped 1 tsp dried oregano Cut the aubergines in half lengthways. Using a spoon, scoop out the flesh to create boats, being careful not to puncture shell, and leaving about 5mm flesh still attached all around the skin. Sprinkle the insides with coarse salt and leave upside down to drain while you make filling. Chopped the scooped-out aubergine flesh. In a frying pan on a medium-low heat, gently fry all the diced spring onion in the olive oil until soft, then add the aubergine and fry, stirring, for about five minutes. Add two-thirds of the chopped tomato, the anchovies and capers, and fry, stirring, for another five minutes. In a blender, pulse the breadcrumbs, remaining tomato, two teaspoons of olive oil, the parsley, oregano and a pinch of salt to a rough rubble. Brush the salt from the aubergine boats, blot the insides dry and arrange on a greased oven tray. Share the fried filling between all four boats, then do the same with the crumbs, pressing down so the filling is compact. Zig-zag with olive oil and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 30-40 minutes, until the shells are soft and the tops golden.

Taking on the slippery nature of memory, Eskape revisits the dangerous journey taken by her mother, Thany Lieng, who fled Cambodia for France. As Hay retraces Thany\u2019s footsteps, footage from her trip is entwined with her mother\u2019s recollections, creating a rich and poignant tapestry of familial history. While Hay\u2019s presence in Angkar took the form of a voiceover, in Eskape the camera often lingers on her from behind, as she gazes at the various places once passed by her mother \u2013 suggesting that Hay is simultaneously a part of and distanced from this history. As a baby, she was with Thany as they made the perilous trek to Khao-I-Dang, a refugee camp known as the \u201chill of death\u201d on the border of Cambodia and Thailand. Hay\u2019s memories only begin, however, when her family finally arrived in the south of France. A reluctant Thany recounts her ordeal in matter-of-fact and practical details. Compared to Hay, who yearns to learn more about her origins, Thany has the mindset of a survivor and is reluctant to disturb the ghosts of the past. The difference in how Hay and Thany think about the act of remembering is apparent in the film\u2019s style. While conversations between the two women are filmed in intimate close-up, Hay\u2019s visits to locations are largely filmed in distancing tracking or drone shots. The fractured reality of a diasporic identity is beautifully realised here; the feeling of always being on the other side of the glass panel, even when it comes to one\u2019s own history. \u2022 Eskape is available on 23 June on True Story"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94719", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The pet I\u2019ll never forget: Emmeline the tiny bat taught me the power of empathy", "lead": "She was only the size of a conker, but the sound of her papery wings comforted me at night.

She didn\u2019t live in a grotto dripping with stalactites, but in a 1960s detached four-bedroom house, with carpeting up the side of the bathtub and a serving hatch in the kitchen. She was known as the Bat Lady not because she stalked alleys in latex, but because she rescued and rehabilitated injured bats. She kept them in her cool, dark loft, in cages she crafted from green netting and planks of recycled wood. One day, when I was about nine, my mum took me over to Sylvia\u2019s house. The bats hung there, blinking blearily through beady nocturnal eyes. Their wings were wrapped around them like leathery papooses, and they snuggled inside, like gothic babies suspended in the gloom. Entranced, I asked if I could have one. Sylvia laughed her tinkly laugh and said I could look after a bat if she ever went on holiday. True to her word, when she did go off on her travels, probably somewhere like Easter Island or Borneo \u2013 Sylvia didn\u2019t do anything by halves \u2013 I was allowed to foster Emmeline. She was a pipistrelle, one of the world\u2019s smallest bats, weighing in at 3g. The size of a conker. She arrived with her bespoke cage and a container writhing with live mealworms. I insisted on keeping Emmeline in my room, and was comforted during the night by the papery sound of her wings as she flitted around the cage. I was terrified at night as a child, and loved the thought of a conscious creature waking up and doing things just as I was going to sleep. She was looking out for me. Once, weighing her gently between thumb and forefinger, feeling I could crush her at any minute, I held a mealworm aloft, and a tiny tongue flicked out to taste it. Then, with surprising ferocity, she lunged forward and gulped down the whole thing. I was impressed. It would be like eating an entire Subway footlong in one bite. In that moment, Emmeline taught me empathy in the most literal and physical of ways. The fact that she was utterly reliant on me for sustenance and life hit home in one of those childhood lightbulb moments you remember for ever. It was my first experience of sole responsibility for another living thing \u2013 and my last, unless you count the cactus that sat on my desk from 2015 to 2020.

The federal suit alleges the EPA\u2019s science shows the human health risks and harm to endangered species associated with widely spreading the chemical on US cropland, but the agency failed to properly calculate those risks during the reapproval process. The herbicide is also prone to damaging non-GMO crops or vegetation on neighboring fields. The suit asks a federal judge to order the agency to rescind its approval and recalculate the environmental and health risks using proper methodology. \u201c[The herbicides] are highly toxic and have devastating impacts on wildlife and rural communities that live near sprayed fields,\u201d said Kristina Sinclair, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety. The non-profit brought the suit with Pesticide Action Network North America, and Alianza Nacional de Campesinas. It comes after a federal court invalidated the herbicides\u2019 previous approval in late 2020, but the EPA still \u201crushed\u201d to reapprove the herbicides, the complaint alleges. The chemical 2,4-D, is used in Enlist One and Enlist Duo, which are applied to fields with corn, soybeans and cotton genetically engineered to resist the herbicides. It is considered a likely carcinogen by the World Health Organization, and, among other human health effects, is linked to non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, birth defects and respiratory problems. The chemical is also thought to harm hundreds of endangered species including butterflies, birds, fish, deer, panthers and bats. It works by attacking the roots and leaves of weeds and causing them to produce unwanted cells, not unlike inducing cancer to kill or hobble it. The suit also alleges the products\u2019 approval threatens to increase the spread of new herbicide-resistant weeds because the EPA failed to properly mitigate risks, which will make it harder for farmers to manage troublesome weeds. One of the Enlist products also uses glyphosate, a controversial and highly toxic ingredient linked to cancer and subject to another lawsuit over EPA approval. The EPA first approved Enlist One and Duo for use in several states in 2014, and since then has approved its application across much of the US. The products are now widely used, but were up for a registration renewal in 2021 that triggered a health review. The EPA based its health and environmental impact assessments on earlier usage levels, which the environmental groups say dramatically underestimate the threat. The products were spread on about 1.5m acres of cropland in 2018, and the weed killer\u2019s manufacturer, Corteva, reported that use has since tripled, the complaint states. Enlist is sometimes applied to the ground near the base of a plant and also sprayed over the top of farmland. While both methods cause harm because the chemicals accumulate in the environment and run off into waterways, spraying the herbicide makes it more prone to drifting into neighboring fields. The groups also allege that EPA violated the Endangered Species Act because the products threaten endangered species in rural areas across the US, but the agency did not properly consult with expert wildlife agencies. Sinclair characterized the move as an attempt to \u201cskirt\u201d the law, and said it was unclear why the EPA seems so determined to allow the use of the active ingredient for Agent Orange on cropland. \u201cI do not know and I wish I could tell you, but that\u2019s why we are challenging it,\u201d she added."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9471b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018She doesn\u2019t have the power\u2019: Central Park birdwatcher Christian Cooper on why racist \u2018incident\u2019 won\u2019t define him", "lead": "A white woman made a threat against Cooper in 2020, and the world took notice.

While doing so it weaves the history of Black people in America \u2013 from slavery and lynchings to segregation and economic disparity \u2013 into the unfolding of his life. It also covers the moment, three years ago, when Cooper received international attention when, while birdwatching in Central Park, he asked a woman to leash her dog, in compliance with park rules, because he didn\u2019t want it to disturb or maim any nearby birds. The woman, Amy Cooper (a stranger to Christian, their shared surname a coincidence), who is white, became irate and said that she would call the cops and tell them that an African American man was threatening her life. Christian Cooper was doing no such thing, but he did film the entire exchange. He posted the video to his Facebook friends with the context of what happened. His sister Melody asked if she could share it on Twitter. Cooper hesitated but ultimately obliged. Kathy Griffin retweeted him and the rest, as they say, is history. The 69-second video got more than 45m views. Cooper now references this whole ordeal as \u201cthe incident\u201d. In that instant, a white woman made a false accusation that could have led to his death. She knew the stakes, which is why she feigned hysteria on the phone with the cops. Christian Cooper knew the stakes, too. But though Amy Cooper swiftly lost her job after the video went viral, Christian Cooper did not want any part of the prosecutorial process, a decision that put him at odds with some Black people, including his relatives. He tells me: \u201cThere were a lot of factors involved. It was potentially very important to set a precedent where someone was held accountable, legally, for making a false accusation against a Black person.\u201d He stresses that it was a tough call not to get involved, but unless the district attorney were to subpoena him, he was going to choose mercy. Not everyone was a fan of his choice. One of his relatives revealed the reason for their ire: \u201cThey had a brother who was in an affair with a white woman and when she got found out, she said it was rape. That person spent years in a jail in the south for that reason. So false accusations have haunted us for a long time,\u201d Cooper says. I admit to him that, at the time, I was one of those people who was shocked that he didn\u2019t want to be contribute more to her downfall. Punishment along with further punishment is part of what structures \u2013 and upholds \u2013 our society; we live in a punitive culture and the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world. It would be normal for Cooper to want retribution, but he doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cWe [African-Americans] are fighting to have some sense of proportionality in how we are treated in the criminal justice system. So how can I turn that around and not consider the same thing?\u201d he says. Cooper thought that the woman had already received enough punishment without further piling on necessary. \u201cHer life had imploded. It\u2019s not like I had been handcuffed or thrown to the ground or God forbid anything more deadly or serious,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you could look at what happened to her and not conclude that you shouldn\u2019t make false accusations, then how is any legal proceeding going to change your mind?\u201d Furthermore, he says, he is not traumatized. People will approach him and say how sorry they are about his trauma. \u201cWhat trauma?\u201d Cooper says. \u201cShe just does not have that much power. Maybe it\u2019s a consequence of being Black our whole lives.\u201d In this country, Blackness is inextricably linked to suffering. A racist incident can often be the summary, rather than a chapter, of how our entire lives are esteemed, and this is what Cooper resists. We approach a spot where, about five or six years ago, Cooper spotted a Lincoln\u2019s sparrow; he calls these \u201cthe fine wines of birding\u201d because they are so hard to find. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone took pen and watercolor and drew a sparrow because it\u2019s so finely marked,\u201d he says. This is what Cooper thinks about when he enters the park. He was neither traumatized nor shellshocked after \u201cthe incident\u201d. He tells me: \u201cWhen I go back to the park and I am at that spot where that mess happened, I\u2019m not thinking about that. I\u2019m remembering that time when there was a mourning warbler on that chip path 15 years ago and I remember the scarlet tanagers last week. That\u2019s what I think about when I\u2019m in the park.\u201d Today, for example, he\u2019s more excited about whether or not we\u2019ll get to see an Acadian or great crested flycatcher. He\u2019s concerned we might not get lucky because spring migration has already passed and fall migration is still months away. This is a man who routinely wakes up at 4am and ventures into Central Park at 5.30. He lets me know early on that his life and passions are more than \u201cthe incident\u201d. As we start walking we spot a red-winged blackbird. It\u2019s a very significant bird in Cooper\u2019s life, he calls it his \u201cspark bird\u201d, a term used to describe the type of bird that first converts a person to birdwatching. Cooper references the bird at the beginning of the book and it sets the tone for a multilayered and intricate exploration of his own identity. In his book, Cooper describes the red-winged blackbird as a trickster of sorts. In the Americas, it\u2019s part of a family of birds called icterids. When English settlers came to the western hemisphere, they thought it to be the same as the birds they saw in the UK, thus giving it the same name. But the joke was on them because the Eurasian blackbird is not an icterid, it\u2019s part of the genus thrush. To add even more complexity, the UK already has a bird called the redwing, which belongs to the thrush family as well. Are you confused yet? Cooper writes in his book that these complicated taxonomies, through which humans label birds, first resonated with him when he was young, as a Black, queer, closeted kid growing up in a conservative Long Island community in the 60s and 70s. Though Cooper knew he was queer from the moment that his five-year-old self saw a male superhero in a comic book, he wasn\u2019t open about his sexuality until he began studying at Harvard, where he took part in the ornithological club and the gay students association. His love of comics landed him a job as an assistant editor at Marvel in the early 90s. When he talks about this period of his life, I\u2019m astonished by how certain he was in his identity at that time. He tells me that one day Paul Becton, a Black colorist for Marvel, walked into his office and saw a picture of the former Yankees player Steve Sax on the wall. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Yes! Are you a Yankees fan?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018No.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Are you just some homosexual with a thing for Steve Sax?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Cooper says. Cooper was only in his late 20s then, at a time when the world of comic book publishing was even more blindingly white than it is today. But he never tried to hide who he was: \u201cI didn\u2019t give them a choice. I\u2019m queer. I\u2019m OK with it. You can either be OK with it or not. That\u2019s on you.\u201d Cooper\u2019s love of nature initially came from his father, Francis, a Korean war veteran, science teacher and civil rights activist. Francis took Cooper on trips to Yellowstone, Maine, the prairie provinces of Canada and the Olympic peninsula, trips that Cooper found it hard to return to in his writing. \u201cAt one point, my editors had to wait a whole month before they got any more pages out of me because I came to the part in telling the story of my family where everybody starts to die. I was like, \u2018I cannot write this.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know how to deal with this. I\u2019m not a very confessional person. And I\u2019m not a very emotional person.\u201d In his memoir, he writes that his father was a man who often projected his anger and frustrations on to his family, which made Cooper, his mother and his sister feel as though they were walking on eggshells around him for many years. The binoculars that hang around Cooper\u2019s neck are the pair his father gifted to him on his 50th birthday. Even if it might have been hard for Cooper to write about and memorialize his father, his father was with us on our walk. Activism is also in Cooper\u2019s blood. There is a photo of him as an infant in a stroller during a protest. Whether it was fighting school segregation or spearheading a Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Cooper\u2019s parents phoned, marched, organized and did whatever else they could to get into \u201cgood trouble\u201d, a phrase most popularly attributed to John Lewis and his activism efforts. Cooper was arrested twice in 1999 within a matter of weeks while he was protesting for justice over the murder of Amadou Diallo. After a gay couple was bashed in upper Manhattan, he along with his allies at Glaad, the LGBTQ advocacy organization, organized an anti-violence rally. Black people and birds are connected particularly because of our shared history with migration, Cooper says: \u201cBirds and African American history \u2013 they weave together in surprising ways. My family left Alabama because there was all this opportunity \u2013 the great migration. That\u2019s exactly why birds migrate. Birds leave the south to come to the north because of opportunities seasonally.\u201d He gets enthusiastic when I mention that even before this turning point in US history, Harriet Tubman learned bird calls in order to signal to other freedom seekers when it was safe or unsafe to proceed. He loves this part of her story. The silver lining of \u201cthe incident\u201d is that Cooper has met many other Black people who\u2019ve gotten interested in birding, which delights him to no end. Months after the incident happened, he did a PBS special in which he talked about the \u201cjoys and challenges of birding while Black\u201d and was featured in the Washington Post about his desire to diversify the activity. Birds have always meant liberation to Cooper. Alongside his memoir, he has a forthcoming National Geographic wildlife show in which he will examine birds across the US, including in his family\u2019s ancestral land of Alabama. He hopes that readers and viewers alike can understand this symbolism. In his own words, as the birds sing above us, \u201cEvery place has atmosphere, every place has sky, and they just spread their wings and they can go anywhere. You know, the whole time we\u2019ve been walking and talking, we can walk forward, we can walk back. We can walk left, we can walk right, but we can\u2019t really go up or down very much unless, you know, we\u2019re walking up a hill or down a hill. They just think it and they can go up or down under their own power. That freedom, that ability to think in three dimensions. All of that just makes birds incredibly inspiring.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9471c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/why-did-it-take-a-murderous-war-on-ukraine-for-germany-to-wake-up-to-the-threat-from-russia", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why did it take a murderous war on Ukraine for Germany to wake up to the threat from Russia? | Helene von Bismarck", "lead": "The invasion has plunged Germany into an agonised debate about its history \u2013 this process is only just beginning, writes historian Helene von Bismarck", "author": "Helene von Bismarck", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 10:00:09", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547332", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6f0bb316459735f4f64f599b1e6fef569a909a61/0_21_2000_1200/500.jpg", "body": "Under the veneer of western unity in support of Ukraine, reactions to the war across Europe have been informed by different countries\u2019 readings of their own history, of earlier conflicts on this continent, and by their conceptions of Russia\u2019s national character. There is no automatic consensus within democratic societies about the lessons of the past, nor should there be. Remembrance is often selective, and the way ahead involves a discussion about what went wrong before. Nowhere has this process of revisiting the past in search of the right decisions for the future been more fraught since the Russian invasion than in Germany. Over the past 16 months, the country has ended its heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas, abandoned its reluctance to send weapons to the war zone, and turned into one of Ukraine\u2019s most important military and financial backers after the US. Most Germans now support this policy shift \u2013 or Zeitenwende (turning point) as Chancellor Olaf Scholz terms it \u2013 but public debate about the future of Germany\u2019s security policy has not stopped. And arguments about history play a prominent part. The brutality of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, Putin\u2019s blatant disregard for international law, and his explicit threats against the west have compelled Germany\u2019s political and intellectual elites to reconsider long-held and widespread assumptions about the lessons for Germany of the second world war and the cold war. The significance of this change should not be underestimated, nor should anyone be surprised that it remains precarious and contested. In the three decades after the end of the cold war, Germany\u2019s policy in central and eastern Europe was heavily influenced by a reading of history that put Russia at the centre of German thinking about the region, while neglecting the smaller countries in its neighbourhood. This Moscow-centric bias reflected the extent of Russia\u2019s power, but was also, at least in part, due to Germany\u2019s recognition of its historic responsibility for the second world war, which on its eastern front, was a brutal war of annihilation. More than 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died, and they play an important role in Germany\u2019s culture of remembrance. The readiness to face up to its historical responsibility for the second world war, and the focus on reconciliation and remembrance, are hard-won achievements of German democracy that should not be taken lightly. What remained problematic after the cold war, however, was a widespread German tendency to equate Russia with the Soviet Union, and for politicians to argue that Nazi Germany\u2019s crimes imposed a special German obligation to seek dialogue with Russia, without extending the same consideration to the other former states of the Soviet Union, such as Ukraine. After all, roughly 8 million of the Soviet victims of the second world war were Ukrainians, and Ukrainian territory was the site of brutal battles and unspeakable crimes, particularly against the Jewish population. There has been no lack of nuanced historical research on this, but it is only now, after Putin\u2019s invasion, that the important distinction between Russia and the Soviet Union is being more widely appreciated in Germany\u2019s public discourse. The emphasis on the terrible price of war with the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945 also resulted in a lack of German sensitivity about German-Russian collusion from 1939 to 1941 and its long-term consequences. Before Hitler decided to attack the Soviet Union two years later, he and Stalin agreed in the Molotov-Ribbentrop nonaggression pact of 1939 to divide central and eastern Europe into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence. The countries that paid the price for this in brutal occupation, deportation and displacement were as deserving of Germany\u2019s special consideration after the fall of the iron curtain as Russia. The memory of this collusion has profoundly shaped central and eastern European thinking about both countries to this day, especially in Poland and the Baltic states. However, in the two decades leading up to the war in Ukraine, their point of view mattered less to Berlin than Moscow\u2019s. Another defining chapter in Germany\u2019s history that is now under re-examination is the famous \u201cOstpolitik\u201d of the cold war chancellor Willy Brandt. This remained central to Germany\u2019s thinking about Russia until 24 February 2022. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Brandt and his Social Democratic party (SPD) pursued a policy of dialogue with the Soviet Union in the hope of stabilising West Germany\u2019s relationship with eastern Europe. His belief, 25 years after the end of the second world war, was that a strategy of \u201cchange through rapprochement\u201d would reduce east-west tensions and possibly even help change the Soviet Union from within. Rapprochement included trade with the Soviet Union. One does not have to be a member of the SPD to be proud of Brandt, albeit for a different reason. He is most famous for kneeling down in front of the memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1970, an unprecedented and hugely important gesture of shame and repentance for Germany\u2019s war crimes and the Holocaust. It is also important to stress that Brandt\u2019s pursuit of dialogue with the Soviet Union was from a position of strength. West German defence spending was at 3% of GDP a year during his time as chancellor, vastly higher even than what is envisaged in Germany\u2019s first national security strategy, published on 14 June. But Germany\u2019s Russia policy lost its way after the cold war, as large parts of the SPD maintained a naive attachment to the principle of \u201cchange through trade\u201d and remembered or reinterpreted Brandt\u2019s policy in a selective way. Decades after Brandt, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, another SPD chancellor, is accused of turning this cherished and widely idealised tradition into a convenient excuse for prioritising German business interests in Russia over the geopolitical concerns of Germany\u2019s central and eastern European Nato and EU allies. In their recent book, The Moscow Connection, Reinhard Bingener and Markus Wehner present a forensic and damning account of how Putin\u2019s Russia spent decades courting both German political elites and public opinion, showing that the debate about Germany\u2019s long-held Russia-centric assumptions is essential. Germany\u2019s support for Ukraine since the invasion constitutes a clear break with its Russia policy. The Scholz government has burned its bridges with Putin and abandoned longstanding principles that had resonated with many Germans until February 2022. This was not easy. But the crucial question is not just whether the Zeitenwende Scholz promised is really happening, but why it took a murderous war in Ukraine for it to begin. Germany changed its mind about Russia, but not until it was too late. The necessary and agonising interrogation of why is only just beginning. A change, which from the German government\u2019s point of view feels significant, even drastic, was long overdue and far too slow in the eyes of many of its allies. The criticism is valid. It is the urgency of Ukraine\u2019s plight that should set the pace of Germany\u2019s response to this catastrophic crisis of European security \u2013 not its own soul-searching.

The image, taken by a Ukrainian drone and given to Associated Press, was taken on 28 May. It appears to show a white car with its roof cut open, revealing large barrels inside, one of which appears to have a landmine attached to its lid. A cable runs from the barrel towards the side of the river held by Russian forces. A Ukrainian special forces communications official told the Associated Press he believed the car was there to stop any Ukrainian advance on the dam and to amplify a planned explosion originating in the machine room. More than 11,000 people have been evacuated since the dam collapsed on 6 June, flooding land downstream. On Monday the death toll was raised to 52. Russian officials said 35 people had died in the areas of Kherson that were under its control while Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry said they were aware of 17 deaths and 31 people who had gone missing. The warring countries have traded accusations as to who was responsible for the environmental and human disaster. Ukrainian officials claimed to the Associated Press that Russian troops had set up a firing position in the dam shortly before the blast. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has long claimed that the dam was mined by Russia. Vladimir Putin told military bloggers in a recent meeting he had no interest in damaging the dam, which flooded territory controlled by Russia. He did concede that Ukraine\u2019s offensive plans may have been impacted by the flooding of the Dnipro River, which Ukrainian forces need to cross to access the parts of Kherson controlled by Moscow. The image of the white car parked at the top of the dam is just the latest piece in the puzzle, with experts counselling that an authoritative assessment cannot be made until independent engineers are given access. Last week the international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance, acting in support of Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor, said it believed it was \u201chighly likely Russian forces deliberately destroyed the dam\u201d, and that a recently passed Russian law that prohibits investigations into incidents at hydrotechnical structures in Russian-occupied Ukraine offered compelling albeit circumstantial evidence for that case. Seismic signals from an explosion at the dam were picked up on sensors at 2.35am and 2.54am on 6 June. The size of the explosion is said to discount an external attack as being the cause. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank that has monitored Russian actions in Ukraine since the war began, has claimed that \u201cthe balance of evidence, reasoning, and rhetoric suggests that the Russians deliberately damaged the dam\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service released an intercepted conversation it claimed was between a Russian soldier and someone else in which the soldier said \u201cour sabotage groups were there. They wanted to create a scare with the dam.

There, she was involved in a number of important projects and initiatives including the tri-boroughs care proceedings pilot in London, seeking to improve decision-making in court and reduce delays for children. For many years she was a vital member of the UEA team undertaking the triennial serious case reviews for the Department for Education, to which she brought kindness and academic rigour. Colleagues have told how she wore her knowledge lightly, and shared it generously. She retired in 2016. Away from work and family, Sue had two passions: Norwich City football club and music. She was a season-ticket holder at Carrow Road from 1994, and a keen choral singer. She spoke with pride of having sung, in her younger days, with the Aldeburgh festival singers under the baton of Benjamin Britten. Born in Epsom, Surrey, Sue was the youngest child of Geoffrey Wiseman, a cost accountant, and Audrey (nee Day), a bank clerk. She passed the 11-plus before attending Rosebery grammar school for girls. On leaving school she initially defied her teachers\u2019 advice to attend university and undertook a secretarial course at Kingston College of Further Education, before moving to Norwich to study social sciences at UEA.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is meeting China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing. The talks between Blinken, who is on the first visit to China by a US secretary of state in five years, and Xi began at 4.30pm (0830 GMT). Earlier on Monday, Blinken held extensive discussions with China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi. Describing the US-China relationship as being at a low point, Wang said the root cause was the US\u2019s wrong perception of China. Blinken underscored the importance of open communication channels to manage their competition during more than three hours of talks with Wang, the state department said, calling their conversation \u201cproductive\u201d. Yesterday, Blinken held talks lasting more than seven a half hours \u2013 an hour more than expected \u2013 with the Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang. How did the talks go? The US state department called the talks \u2013 which were held at an ornate state villa and included a banquet dinner \u2013 \u201ccandid, substantive and constructive\u201d although they did not appear to make concrete progress on disputes that include Taiwan, trade, human rights and fentanyl. What did Qin say? Behind closed doors, Qin told Blinken that relations between the US and China \u201care at the lowest point since the establishment of diplomatic relations\u201d, according to the state-run broadcaster CCTV. \u201cThis does not conform to the fundamental interests of the two peoples, nor does it meet the common expectations of the international community,\u201d Qin was reported as saying during the talks at the ancient Diaoyutai gardens. Moscow blocking aid to flood-hit areas after dam destroyed, says UN The UN has accused Russia of refusing to allow aid deliveries to Moscow-controlled areas affected by flooding following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam almost two weeks ago. \u201cThe government of the Russian Federation has so far declined our request to access the areas under its temporary military control,\u201d Denise Brown, the UN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement. \u201cThe UN will continue to engage to seek the necessary access. We urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law. Aid cannot be denied to people who need it.\u201d Ukrainian and Russian authorities said the death toll from the flooding had risen to 52. Russian officials said 35 people had died in Moscow-controlled areas, while Ukraine\u2018s interior ministry said 17 people had died and 31 were missing, Reuters reported. More than 11,000 people have been evacuated on both sides. What caused the dam to collapse? A team of international legal experts assisting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors in their investigation said it was \u201c highly likely\u201d the dam\u2019s collapse was caused by explosives planted by Russians. What else is happening? The Russian military has \u201chighly likely\u201d started relocating troops from the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. \u201cThe DGF [Dnipro Group of Forces] redeployment likely reflects Russia\u2019s perception that a major Ukrainian attack across the Dnipro is now less likely following the collapse of Kakhovka Dam and the resulting flooding,\u201d the MoD writes. Workers sue secretive elite club Bohemian Grove for wage theft Workers at Bohemian Grove, one of the most elite and secretive clubs in the US, have filed a lawsuit alleging numerous unfair labor practices, including 16-hour workdays without breaks, and a failure to pay overtime and minimum wages to the workers. Bohemian Grove, which attracts some of the world\u2019s most powerful people to a mysterious gathering in the woods north of San Francisco, has long been the subject of fascination and conspiracy theories. The lawsuit was brought by former valets who worked for several years at the club\u2019s Monte Rio summer camp in Sonoma county, California. The secretive 2,700-acre camp near the Russian River has operated every summer for 150 years and is rumored to end in a ritual involving a human effigy and burning of a giant sacrificial owl. The club was purportedly visited by the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas and billionaire donor Harlan Crow, and has been rumored over the years to be the site where Richard Nixon\u2019s successful 1968 presidential election campaign was launched, and where J Robert Oppenheimer first discussed the Manhattan Project. What does the lawsuit say? The lawsuit alleges about 100 separate camps that comprise the club each have one or more captains who violate numerous labor laws every summer. The complaint includes an allegation that Bohemian Grove treasurer, Bill Dawson, has personally directed valets to \u201cfalsify payroll records and to work off-the-clock\u201d. The lawsuit alleges valets were paid only eight hours despite working 16-plus hours a day without breaks for the duration of a 14-day summer camp. Another allegation in the lawsuit claims a worker was directed to hide from a payroll employee when they made a surprise visit to the camp, as they were being paid under the table.

The plans for approval of 4,560 housing units in various areas of the West Bank were included on the agenda of Israel\u2019s Supreme Planning Council that meets next week, although only 1,332 are up for final approval, with the remainder going through the preliminary clearance process. Most countries deem the settlements, built on land captured by Israel in 1967, as illegal. Their presence is one of the fundamental issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The US state department said it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the latest move, which comes despite US pressure to halt the settlement expansion that Washington sees as an obstacle to peace.

Her fetus had no skull. Her pregnancy threatened her life, and that of her twin boy. When she first started writing a diary documenting her pregnancy, Miller had no idea of the obstacles she was about to face. Now, she is suing the state of Texas with the Center for Reproductive Rights alongside 14 other plaintiffs for being denied access to life-saving abortion care, writes Poppy Noor. Miller came to the Guardian wanting to publish her journal \u2013 a real-time diary of the twists and turns of going from discovering a very wanted pregnancy, to navigating the need for a termination in a state where abortion is now banned. Climate check: India heatwave \u2013 nearly 100 dead amid warnings to stay indoors At least 96 people died in two of India\u2019s most populous states over the past several days, with swaths of the country reeling from a sweltering heatwave. The deaths happened in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and eastern Bihar, where authorities warned residents aged over 60 and others suffering various maladies to stay indoors during the daytime. April, May and June are generally the hottest months in most of India. But temperatures have become more intense in the past decade. During heatwaves, the country usually suffers severe water shortages, with tens of millions of its 1.4 billion people lacking running water. A study by World Weather Attribution, an academic group that examines the source of extreme heat, found that a searing heatwave in April that struck parts of south Asia was made at least 30 times more likely by climate change.

Police recorded a 59% increase in crimes against swans, ducks and geese from 2020 to 2022. The crimes ranged from fireworks and BB guns being shot into duck ponds to swans and geese being strangled and beheaded. Avon and Somerset police found the remains of two swans in a blood-filled bathtub surrounded by shotgun shells on open land. In Dorset, a decapitated swan was found by an underpass with an arrow sticking out of its body. Neighbouring Devon and Cornwall recorded three separate incidents of swans being decapitated, as well as a goose that had a stable door slammed and bolted on its neck. Three more swans were found with their heads chopped off in London, one in Merseyside and another in Avon and Somerset over the three-year period. A man in Cumbria was arrested after picking a swan up by its neck and throwing it at someone. Ducks have also been attacked. In Merseyside, youths were reported to police for shooting fireworks into a duck pond, while in Essex a mallard died after being shot with a BB gun. Avon and Somerset police said a large number of ducks were found tied up and drowned in the village of Yatton. Police in England and Wales recorded a total of 62 crimes against ducks, swans and geese between 2020 to 2022, based on data accessed under freedom of information laws by the Guardian. There were 27 crimes against these birds in 2022, up from 18 in 2021 and 17 in 2020. Essex (11), Merseyside (11) and Devon and Cornwall (nine) accounted for half of the nationwide tally. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 protects wild birds, making it illegal to take, injure or kill them, or to damage or destroy their eggs or nests.

On Monday, Crikey\u2019s editor-in-chief, Sophie Black, and editor, Gina Rushton, penned an almost 500 word editorial \u2013 the second apology the publication has issued since it published, then hastily took down, the article by columnist Guy Rundle on Friday. In his opinion piece headlined \u201cThe Brittany Higgins case: we\u2019re not required to leave our brains at the security entrance\u201d, Rundle argued that because Higgins received a compensation payment from the commonwealth, \u201cwe have a right to hear the full story\u201d. The piece was published following a federal parliamentary sitting week in which the Coalition attacked Labor, accusing the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, of misleading parliament over her knowledge of Higgins\u2019 rape allegation, after text messages from Higgins\u2019 phone were leaked. In his now deleted piece, Rundle wrote that the case became something else when Higgins received a \u201ctaxpayer-funded\u201d compensation payment from the incoming Albanese government in a \u201cstunningly rapid process\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Rundle also wrote that Higgins had \u201cabout as much motive as anyone has ever had to make a false sex crime claim,\u201d saying that being found \u201cnaked and asleep on your boss\u2019s office sofa is a career killer, obviously\u201d. Higgins alleged that she was raped in Linda Reynolds\u2019 Parliament House office on the night of 22 March 2019 by fellow Liberal staffer Bruce Lehrmann, who has repeatedly denied the allegation. A criminal trial was aborted after juror misconduct and plans for a retrial abandoned over concerns about Higgins\u2019 mental health. On Friday, after taking down Rundle\u2019s piece, Crikey issued a five paragraph explanation of its decision, noting the columnist\u2019s assertion the consultation process for Higgins\u2019 compensation was \u201cstunningly rapid\u201d was incorrect. Crikey also said there was no factual basis for Rundle to claim the compensation figure was believed to be $3m, and that the \u201cthe tone of the piece did not meet Crikey\u2019s journalistic standards, crucially given that it concerns writing about allegations of sexual assault\u201d. In Monday\u2019s more lengthy apology, Black and Rushton wrote: \u201cAs editors, we take full responsibility for publishing the piece. Our editorial processes failed. We are in the process of addressing that.\u201d The pair said that Rundle\u2019s writing \u201ccan challenge people to think differently, surprise and provide in-depth context\u201d, but that his piece from Friday \u201cdidn\u2019t do any of those things\u201d. \u201cThere is a line, and this crossed that. Crikey does not seek to cause harm. This caused harm.\u201d Black and Rushton said that Crikey\u2019s publisher, Private Media, was in \u201congoing\u201d conversations with Rundle. \u201cRundle states that he stands by the argument made in the article and the article\u2019s overall approach to the matter.\u201d \u201cAs female journalists, we feel acute regret as the publishers of this piece. We\u2019d be lying if we said that catering to a Crikey audience as women is not sometimes difficult. As with any news outlet, to publish any kind of opinion piece doesn\u2019t ever necessarily mean that editors endorse the sentiments but in this instance, we want to highlight that,\u201d the pair said. Before Rundle\u2019s piece had been removed on Friday, readers complained about the article on Twitter, with some posting pictures of themselves cancelling their Crikey subscription. Higgins tweeted \u201cpithy but disgusting given the context\u201d. Her partner, David Sharaz, tagged the CEO of Private Media, Will Hayward, in a tweet that read \u201care you happy with this victim-blaming bile being on your website?\u201d. On Monday, Hayward tweeted a link to the editorial from Black and Rushton, saying \u201cwe deserve our share of criticism this time\u201d.

DAF, which owns UK manufacturer Leyland, and Iveco are among the companies lagging behind in the race away from polluting diesel and towards zero-carbon technology such as batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, said Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), a Brussels-based campaign group. The truck industry is far behind the car industry in the shift away from fossil fuels, in part because of the higher cost of installing enough electric batteries to carry tonnes of cargo over longer distances. However, manufacturers are gradually developing zero emissions lorries, starting with smaller vehicles for urban deliveries. Volkswagen\u2019s Scania and MAN and Mercedes-Benz Trucks make the diesel lorries best placed to shift to electric versions, T&amp;E said. The group ranked the manufacturers on a 100-point scale, with points awarded for aspects such as Mercedes-Benz\u2019s plans to only sell zero-emission trucks by 2040 or Scania\u2019s solid industrial strategies to achieve the goals. However, other existing truck makers risk losing out to newer entrants such as US electric vehicle pioneer Tesla and its Chinese rival BYD, T&amp;E said. That could represent a potential repeat of the new manufacturers\u2019 rapid ascent in carmaking, which left \u201clegacy\u201d carmakers scrambling to catch up. The European Commission has proposed rules for manufacturers to cut average carbon emissions of new lorries by 45% compared with 2019-2020, but T&amp;E said it wants this target toughened to 65% to spur investment in clean technology. Sofie Defour, T&amp;E\u2019s freight director, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap in the truck industry between manufacturers with a plan to fully decarbonise and those without. The EU needs strong truck CO2 standards to bring the whole European industry up to speed.\u201d The least prepared among Europe\u2019s lorry makers was DAF Trucks, which is owned by the US\u2019s Paccar. DAF builds its 19-tonne LF Electric at its Leyland subsidiary in Lancashire, but unlike its rivals it has no public target for zero-emission truck sales by 2030. A DAF spokesperson said the company does not recognise the picture offered by T&amp;E, citing its sale of electric trucks since 2018 and \u201ca completely new generation of electric trucks with zero[-emission] ranges of up to 500km [310 miles]\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cDAF is embracing these impressive targets and is therefore fully committed to deliver our customers the right zero-emission vehicles for the job. That means that on the way to sustainable road transport, there is no \u2018one-size-fits-all solution\u2019. We will need a variety of technologies, of which some we already offer today and of which some are under development.\u201d Italian-listed Iveco was marked down for pushing for renewable and low-carbon diesels, which still produce carbon dioxide, to be allowed in the future. BYD is already selling electric trucks in the US, Europe and China, and it has the significant advantage of also being one of the world\u2019s dominant battery makers. The Tesla boss, Elon Musk, has long been promising to revolutionise the trucking industry, although his company\u2019s Semi lorry is still at the pilot stage after being unveiled in 2017, with production promised to start in 2019. Musk last week said Tesla would not be able to start large-scale production until late 2024 because of battery supply constraints. However, T&amp;E said the company had valuable experience in scaling up EV production, as well as strong supply chains and raw material supply. US and Chinese companies are also among the worst performers on T&amp;E\u2019s scale. The lowest scorers were China\u2019s Sinotruk and FAW, just beaten by the Paccar\u2019s Kenworth and Peterbilt brands.

She was fiercely aware of the subservience it demanded from women in general, and, implicitly, what damage it might have done to the fulfilment of her own talents. In Title divine, is mine, a poem written in 1861, three years before She rose to His Requirement, her speaker declares the marrying woman to be \u201cBorn \u2013 Bridalled \u2013 Shrouded / In a day\u201d. This fearfully rapid rise-and-fall, with the stinging pun of bridalled/bridled at its core, represents a \u201cTri Victory\u201d for the husband, but Dickinson\u2019s speaker achieves the superior triumph. Her marriage is with God, her title, \u201cEmpress of Calvary\u201d. This week\u2019s poem treats the subject of earthly marriage in a less challenging tone. A third-person narrative, its focus is indeterminate. \u201cShe\u201d may be a specific woman, a friend or relative, or a composite female figure who stands for all young initiates into marriage. The male pronoun also has a certain ambiguity. Frequent, sometimes unexpected capitalisations are customary in Dickinson\u2019s writing, and here they gain additional nuance. The man becomes at least a little God-like, even in the phrase \u201cHis Requirement\u201d. Irony hovers around this opening verse. That the woman \u201crose to His Requirement\u201d seems significant in a poem that ends with an image of sinking, the woman\u2019s treasure hidden in the depths of the sea. Are the \u201cPlaythings of Her Life\u201d that she relinquishes truly unimportant, or significant objects and activities that patriarchy foolishly denigrates? Is there a certain wryness in the formulation, \u201cthe honourable Work / Of Woman, and of Wife\u201d? Is seems that Dickinson is deliberately withholding her characteristic heightened diction, as if to suggest by understatement that the desired obedience is regrettably uninspiring. The poem unfolds rather more splendidly from the second verse. The deliberately unassertive suggestion, \u201cIf ought She missed from Her new Day\u201d contrasts with the grandeur of those qualities, \u201cAmplitude\u201d and \u201cAwe\u201d, whose loss might have been keenly felt. The substitution of \u201cought\u201d for\u201d \u201caught\u201d (meaning \u201canything\u201d) hints at a moral imperative, but there\u2019s no need to limit Amplitude and Awe to the religious context. Perhaps they are qualities Dickinson associated equally with her experience of poetic genius. \u201cProspective\u201d makes an unusual noun, perhaps with the aim of combining the idea of a vision of the future (a prospect) with the gold-prospector\u2019s search. In the poem, it\u2019s clearly a metaphorical \u201cGold\u201d that, like the gold wedding-ring, becomes worn by use, but perhaps a suggestion of monetary devaluation shadows the image. There is a reticent sadness in the comment that, if the treasure had been sacrificed, \u201cIt lay unmentioned\u201d. Is the treasure redeemed? The verb \u201cDevelope\u201d in the last verse\u2019s second line applies to both \u201cPearl\u201d and \u201cWeed\u201d: Dickinson, with her appreciation of wild flowers, might not consider seaweed a matter of extreme inferiority to pearl. The sacrificed qualities are not restored, but reassigned new value \u2013 new forms, perhaps, of Amplitude and Awe. God is still not named at the end of the poem, but it seems unlikely that \u201cHimself\u201d stands for an imperious husband. An all-seeing deity is more likely to know the significance of the lost riches and the \u201cFathoms they abide\u201d. The measured voice of the poem speaks, I think, out of Dickinson\u2019s secretly secure sense of her own accomplishment. Her spiritually based seclusion has enabled the development of a free-spirited and far-ranging art. Other women committed to the mundane forms of marriage might have had similar potential which had to be sacrificed. In theological terms the sacrifice equals the fulfilment. She rose to His Requirement is an example of the complex form that Dickinson\u2019s Christian feminism sometimes takes."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94724", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/im-not-just-faster-but-taller-how-i-learned-to-walk-properly-and-changed-my-pace-posture-and-perspective", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m not just faster, but taller\u2019: how I learned to walk properly \u2013 and changed my pace, posture and perspective", "lead": "When I was told I could reap huge health benefits by learning to walk better, I was sceptical.

I would see her coming towards me in Kensington Gardens, London, gliding past the other strollers as if she alone were on a moving walkway. When she reached me, I would fall into step and off we would walk, for an hour. At the end, Hall would stride into the distance and keep walking, for all I knew, until we met the following week. Hall\u2019s WalkActive system, a comprehensive fitness programme based around walking, aims to improve posture, increase speed, reduce stress on joints and deliver fitness, turning a stroll into a workout and changing the way you walk for ever. She says she can teach it to me, and we have set aside four weeks for my education. It is easy to be sceptical when someone claims you can reap huge health benefits simply by learning to walk better. You think: I\u2019m already good at walking. And sometimes, I walk a long way. But according to Hall, a fitness expert who enjoyed a three-year stint on ITV\u2019s This Morning, almost nobody is good at walking: not you, not me and not all the other people in the park, who provide endless lessons in poor technique. I notice they are still managing to get where they are going. Are we not in danger of overthinking something people do without thinking? Hall tells me: \u201cIf you ask someone, \u2018When you go for a walk, do you enjoy it?\u2019, they will say, \u2018Yes\u2019, but if you ask, \u2018Do you ever experience discomfort in your lower back?\u2019, quite a few people will say, \u2018Yeah, I do get discomfort in my back, or I feel it when I get out of bed, or I\u2019m tight in my achilles or stiff in my shoulder.\u2019 And those are all indicators that an individual is walking sub-optimally.\u201d What are we doing wrong? Most of us, she says, tend to walk by stepping into the space in front of us. \u201cI want you to think about walking out of the space behind you.\u201d If that sounds a bit abstract to you \u2013 as it did to me, at first \u2013 think about it this way: good walking is an act of propulsion, of pushing yourself forward off your back foot. Bad walking \u2013 my kind of walking \u2013 is overly dependent on traction: pulling yourself along with your front foot. This shortens your stride, relies too much on your hip flexors and puts unnecessary stress on your knees. The struggle to get me to absorb this basic concept takes up most of our first hour together. My opening question about optimal walking was: \u201cWill I look mad?\u201d I imagined great loping strides and pumping arms. \u201cI promise you, you won\u2019t look mad,\u201d Hall said. But when you stroll haltingly through a public park while someone instructs you on heel placement, you do attract a certain amount of attention. People think: poor man, he\u2019s having to learn to walk all over again. They are not wrong. It takes a tremendous amount of concentration to do something so basic, and so ingrained, in a different way. It begins with the feet: I am trying to maintain a flexible, open ankle, to leave my back foot on the ground for longer, and to peel it away, heel first, as if it were stuck in place with Velcro. \u201cFeel the peel,\u201d says Hall. \u201cFeel. The. Peel.\u201d Second come the hips: I need to increase the distance between my pelvis and my ribs, standing tall and creating more flexibility through my torso. Then my neck: there needs to be more distance between my collarbone and my earlobes. I need to think about maintaining all of these things at the same time. Hall acknowledges that, for beginners, there will be what she calls \u201cBuckaroo! moments\u201d \u2013 named after the children\u2019s game featuring a put-upon, spring-loaded mule \u2013 when too much information causes a system overload. This happens to me when, while I\u2019m busy monitoring my feet, my stride, my hips and my neck, Hall suggests that the pendular arc of my arms could do with a bit more backswing. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. My rhythm collapses. My shoulders slump. My ribs sink. My right heel scuffs the pavement. I can feel, for the first time, just how not good my normal walking is. How did I get like this? Hominids have been walking on two legs for more than 4m years. It is more energy efficient than walking on all fours, and it keeps your hands free for other tasks, but this advance came with its own problems. Studies suggest that some common human back problems may stem from spinal characteristics inherited from our knuckle-walking ancestors. Your walk can also be affected by the way you sit, especially when you sit a lot: favouring one hip over another at your desk, or in your car. \u201cSmall things we\u2019re doing consistently create that default neuromuscular pattern, which is just a little bit out of sync,\u201d says Hall. \u201cAnd it may not translate into anything, but over a period of time it can manifest itself as discomfort.\u201d Also, she tells me, my shoes are wrong. Between our meetings, I work my way through Hall\u2019s WalkActive app, a mix of instructional videos, audio coaching sessions and timed walks set to music of varying speeds. At this stage, I\u2019m still perfecting my technique. \u201cImagine that maybe you have a Post-it note on the sole of your foot,\u201d Hall says in my headphones as I turn the corner at the end of my road. \u201cAnd you want to show the message on the Post-it note to the person behind you.\u201d Feel the peel, I think. Read my heel. Hall conceived the WalkActive system more than a decade ago, during the double whammy of pregnancy and appendicitis. \u201cAs soon as I was pregnant, even prior to having the appendicitis challenge, I never felt I wanted to do high-impact activity,\u201d she says. \u201cSo walking was a natural thing for me to focus on.\u201d She later applied the techniques to her clients, but the regime she developed was originally for herself. She says: \u201cIt came from a personal space of wanting to rehab myself, to try to walk myself through rehab and walk myself through a fit pregnancy.\u201d Hall\u2019s programme may be low-impact, but it is not low energy. By the end of our second session together, I am exhausted, because of the concentration required and the distance we have covered. A study that Hall commissioned showed that participants who completed a month of WalkActive training increased their walking speed by 24%. This alone amounts to a pretty big lifestyle adjustment \u2013 and you suddenly find that everyone is in your way. I\u2019m not just faster, but taller, and my arms swing with a natural, easy rhythm, exuding a confidence wholly at odds with the rest of my personality. It feels, frankly, amazing. One Friday morning, just before 7am, I join Hall\u2019s twice-weekly WhatsApp group, along with several dozen other people also dialling in from around the country. I can hear birdsong in my earbuds as I walk out through my front door, while Hall guides us all through 30 minutes of brisk, optimal walking in real time. \u201cLeave that back foot on the floor,\u201d she says, \u201cso it\u2019s a really sticky foot. Feel the peel.\u201d I can feel it, I think, although I\u2019m actually stuck at a level crossing. By our fourth and final meeting I have the right shoes, as recommended by Hall. They are ugly, but they have a flexible sole and enough width to allow the toes to spread when the foot is on the ground. Today, we are concentrating not on speed but on varying our pace, slowing it down and shortening the stride, without compromising technique. This is because, during our third meeting, I mentioned that on ordinary walks I found myself outpacing the people I was with. \u201cI like to say the technique has a dimmer switch,\u201d Hall tells me as we glide past the Albert Memorial. \u201cYou can turn it up or down, but it\u2019s always on.\u201d She has mistaken my boast for a complaint. I didn\u2019t mean that I feel bad for leaving my friends behind. I meant that I am done with those people. Perhaps the most significant claim Hall makes is that, in terms of fitness, walking can be enough. It can complement other forms of exercise, such as yoga and pilates, but if you don\u2019t do anything else, improving your walk can still confer major health benefits. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-running, I\u2019m not anti-gyms, I think they all have a role to play,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also think, sometimes, if we just think about the simplest thing that we could all do, and just get people to do it better, even if someone doesn\u2019t necessarily feel as if they want to walk for longer, even if they just looked at changing their walking technique and applied it to their commute, that can be powerful.\u201d This is the real question: whether, after four weeks of training and new \u00a370 shoes, I will continue to walk like this for ever. But after I leave Hall in the park, I cross the street with my head high, feeling the peel with every step, all the way to my train, in case she is behind me, watching."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94725", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/19/remember-the-quickshot-why-its-worth-rediscovering-the-joy-of-joysticks", "primaryCategory": "games", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Remember the Quickshot?

Unlike buying a console, you didn\u2019t get a controller with your machine, so every player had this vital input decision to make from the offset. Most of my friends went for the ubiquitous Quickshot II, a great hulking giant of a controller, designed to resemble a fighter jet joystick, complete with multiple fire buttons and an autofire switch so that you could cheat on R-Type. It was reasonably delicate, though, so a session with a joystic-waggling sports game such as Daley Thompson\u2019s Decathlon could see over-enthusiastic players wrenching the shaft clean off \u2013 surely the most Freudian mishap ever to befall a schoolboy. When I asked Twitter users for their favourite ever joysticks, the Quickshot got many mentions but so did the Super Pro Zip Stik and the pastel-coloured Powerplay Cruiser, both rugged, dependable stars of the Amiga era. More eccentric designs were also recalled \u2013 the squat little Cheetah Bug, the Konix Speedking (also known as the Epyx 500XJ), an ergonomic oddity designed to sit in the palm with the fire buttons on the side. The real experts favoured more expensive options with tough construction and supremely precise directional control. \u201cThe Kempston Competition Pro was my joystick of choice,\u201d recalls veteran games journalist Julian Rignall, who worked on Commodore magazine Zzap!64. \u201cIt was very comfortable to use, extremely responsive and early versions were easy to maintain since you could take them apart and \u2018tune them up\u2019 by bending the leaf spring switches to make them even more responsive \u2013 something you couldn\u2019t do with the later iterations that had microswitches. And they were nigh on indestructible. Those things survived the rigors of the Zzap! office handsomely \u2013 which included mammoth Decathlon sessions, extended sessions on Dropzone, and even being hurled against the wall or across the room.\u201d Most of the serious sticks of the home computer era can be traced back to one progenator: the Atari CX10, designed by early Atari employee Steve Bristow, co-creator of Breakout. When the company released its groundbreaking VCS console in 1977, it wasn\u2019t just the machine\u2019s wooden chassis that caught the attention of early gamers \u2013 it was the iconic controller. Featuring a stick, a button and a sturdy base, it was a stylish and intuitive piece of hardware, allowing a new level of control beyond the basic paddles that came with early Pong-based consoles. Rival consoles such as Intellevision and Colecovision experimented with more complex pads resembling bizarre 1970s telephones, but it was the original Atari CX10 and later CX40 that would go on to inspire a generation of game controllers. Three years later, Pac-Man arrived in arcades using a ball-top joystick instead of buttons for the direction controls and the coin-op industry never looked back. The arcades of the 80s and 9os were alive with the sound of joystick microswitches clicking as players wrenched their way past enemies and obstacles. It became a ritual to test the stick for rigidity and reliability before committing your 10 pence pieces for that all-important Gradius high score attempt. But for home users, everything changed when the mass market began to shift from computer games to video games and Nintendo launched the NES, a hugely successful console that came with two flat joypads, inspired by the company\u2019s Game &amp; Watch handhelds. These were cheaper to produce and package, but they also featured multiple buttons to facilitate new types of console games that required a wider range of inputs. The pads were also designed to be held in the hands in front of the family TV rather than planted on a desktop in front of a computer. The concept stuck. Look at your Xbox Series X or PlayStation controller and you see the influence of the NES: a D-Pad, main button array, and extra buttons for start, pause and other game management purposes. It\u2019s all still there. But even after the NES made joypads the default controllers for home consoles, the joystick stuck around as a specialist alternative, especially with fighting games, shoot-\u2019em-ups (or \u201cshmups\u201d) and flight sims. The NES itself had the Advantage arcade controller, designed to be used on a tabletop and widely considered to be one of its best ever accessories. Sega ensured there were excellent arcade sticks for the Mega Drive, Saturn and Dreamcast \u2013 the latter\u2019s Agetec controller is considered one of the greatest ever made, a supremely comfortable and highly customisable piece of kit. It\u2019s now found a secondary life as a brilliant accessibility controller, and has been utilised by gaming charity SpecialEffect to help players with conditions such as cerebral palsy play games they couldn\u2019t have with a standard joypad. In the modern era, there is a large dedicated community of specialist joystick users, supporting a thriving hardware market. So what benefits do they provide, apart from that feel of arcade authenticity? For fighting games such as Street Fighter, the smoother stick rotations and large programmable buttons allow intuitive access to special moves and combos, while many models also have restricted gates, so the stick\u2019s circular rotation allows precise four or eight-way movement. For shmups, you get much more precise 2D spatial control than with a D-pad or stubby analogue stick, allowing you to weave between bullets and enemies. As the success of Street Fighter 6 has shown, there is still a mass market for arcade genres. \u201cFighting and shooting games have never gone away but over the last five years there\u2019s been a growing audience for arcade-style games and retro gaming,\u201d says games journalist and arcade enthusiast Will Freeman. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just nostalgia \u2013 Steam is full of new indie shmups, inspired by classic titles. I quite like the term nowstalgia \u2013 modernised takes on classic games. So there are loads of reasons to own sticks \u2013 if you\u2019re controlling something on a 2D plane, it makes sense. I bought a new shmup the other day with no keyboard support \u2013 you have to use a stick.\u201d For years, veteran Japanese accessory maker Hori was the go-to supplier, making excellent sticks from the PlayStation- and Saturn-era onwards \u2013 its Real Arcade Pro and Fighting Stick ranges are still among the best available, with high quality parts and intuitive button arrays. But mainstream accessory manufacturers such as Razer and Mad Catz now make very decent intermediate arcade controllers, while the excellent budget manufacturer 8BitDo has released its own entry-level arcade sticks for the Xbox, PC and Switch. They\u2019re extremely good, featuring lots of buttons with customisable inputs, turbo-fire functionality, audio controls and wireless connectivity. I\u2019ve tested the Xbox version on shooters and fighting games, and it performed really well for both. There\u2019s also a new class of stick manufacturer \u2013 companies such as Nacon, Qanba, Mayflash and PDP, creator of the top of the range Victrix \u2013 serving the needs of dedicated modern enthusiasts, who treat arcade sticks the way hi-fi enthusiasts treat turntables and are willing to pay upwards of $400 for a high-end model. The scene has a vast vocabulary of technical terms. People talk about throw, which is how far the stick moves from the centre to the extreme, and engage, which is the point in that movement that the contact is registered by the game. There\u2019s also resilience, which is how quickly the stick returns to its neutral position. \u201cAs a shmup player I want really short throw and engage because I want it to respond immediately,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cBut a long engage might serve a fighting game player who wants to get circular moves.\u201d The best sticks are highly customisable to the specific preferences of the owner \u2013 you can swap out the stick, the gate, or the buttons. And the companies that made the controller components for classic arcade machines (Sanwa, Seimitsu and Happ) are still around. As Freeman puts it: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to solder, and the parts are standardised \u2013 it\u2019s like skateboarding: you might want this type of bearing and this softness of wheels, but all trucks fit all boards. In a way it\u2019s kind of ridiculous \u2013 you buy an expensive stick to take all the parts out.\u201d The joystick remains an iconic symbol of gaming, despite the ascendancy of the console control pad. For modern gamers obsessed with shmups, fighters or indeed flight sims (that\u2019s a whole separate article), it\u2019s still a vital, customisable tool. For veterans, it\u2019s something nostalgic. And if my Twitter is anything to go by, the Quickshot still reigns. \u201cThey were often the first joysticks people had and tended to be reasonably priced so stick in people\u2019s memory,\u201d says Paul Andrews whose company Retro Games owns the licence to the Quickshot brand. \u201cThe first joystick I had was the Quickshot 1, it had suckers on the bottom so you could suction it down to the table or unit, and that made it so much easier to use, especially if, like in my case, I was also trying to use the keys on my ZX Spectrum at the same time!\u201d Andrews hinted that modern Quickshot joysticks could soon be going into production, introducing a new generation to the delights of this fabled design classic, or perhaps simply reminding past users about a simpler era of game controls. For other players, arcade-style sticks never really went away. When Street Fighter 6 arrived, I was excited to play, not just because of the positive reviews, but because it would give me the opportunity to dust down my expensive arcade fighting controller and experience Capcom\u2019s great fighting series as God intended \u2013 with a stick."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94726", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/ancient-britons-stonehenge-killers-plague-britain-migration", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ancient Britons built Stonehenge \u2013 then vanished.

This finding is astonishing in its own right because it pushes back the earliest evidence of plague in England by several millennia. But the discovery may also help to solve one of our greatest prehistoric mysteries: why did the people who introduced farming to the British Isles suddenly vanish shortly after they built Stonehenge some five millennia ago? Before last month\u2019s announcement, the oldest evidence of plague in Britain came from a 1,500-year-old skeleton interred at an Anglo-Saxon burial site near Cambridge. That victim died during the plague of Justinian, which spread throughout the eastern Roman empire and beyond in the middle of the sixth century. While scientists have identified plague DNA in human remains across Europe and Asia dating to between 5,000 and 2,500 years ago, until last week, we couldn\u2019t be sure that this prehistoric pandemic reached these isles. It\u2019s now clear that it did. We know that more recent plague pandemics have affected society in ways that are still evident. The Black Death, which killed more than half the British population in the mid-14th century, triggered a struggle between lords and serfs that led to the collapse of feudalism and the emergence of capitalism. Eight hundred years earlier, the plague of Justinian had halted the eastern Roman empire\u2019s efforts to reconquer its lost western provinces. Eventually, the nation states of western Europe emerged from this political vacuum. Similarly, it is likely that the consequences of the prehistoric plague that killed Britons in Somerset and Cumbria were so profound that they can still be seen and heard today. Where Britons are really from is a complicated story. The oldest complete human skeleton found in the British Isles belongs to 10,000-year-old Cheddar Man. When scientists extracted and analysed his DNA a few years ago, they realised that he wasn\u2019t your stereotypical fair-haired, pale-skinned \u201cEnglish rose\u201d. Cheddar Man had dark brown skin, black hair and blue-green eyes. He wasn\u2019t an anomaly: this is how the first Britons looked. About 6,000 years ago, Cheddar Man\u2019s foraging kinfolk were replaced by an olive-skinned, dark-haired population who originated in modern-day Turkey and migrated slowly across Europe, bringing agriculture with them. They would have looked similar to modern-day southern Europeans, who have inherited a large proportion of their DNA from these Neolithic farmers. We can even hazard an educated guess as to what language they spoke. As the Basque people have a high proportion of neolithic farmer ancestry and their language is not related to any other, Euskara is likely to be the last surviving descendant of this prehistoric tongue. It was these Anatolian immigrants who constructed that icon of Britishness, Stonehenge, between about 5,000 and 4,500 years ago. But not long afterwards, they vanished and were replaced by another genetically distinct population group who were taller and fairer. The newcomers were nomadic pastoralists from the Eurasian steppe, where they used cutting-edge technology \u2013 horses and wagons \u2013 to raise herds of animals. About 5,000 years ago, these steppe herders began to migrate westwards through northern Europe, reaching the British Isles half a millennium later. The Amesbury Archer was one of the new immigrants. His 4,300-year-old grave was discovered by archaeologists at a site slated for a new housing scheme a couple of miles from Stonehenge in 2002. Violence may have played a role in the replacement of the Stonehenge builders from Anatolia: 90% of the steppe herders involved in the great westward migration were males, and domesticated horses and metal weapons would have provided them with a distinct advantage in conflict. But even taking all this into account, it is almost impossible to explain how a small group of nomadic herders was able to replace a large, well-established farming society. The US geneticist David Reich suggests that the most similar historical parallel is the European colonisation of the Americas in the 16th century. Tiny numbers of Spanish conquistadors armed with guns and steel managed to vanquish vast and sophisticated empires. These seemingly miraculous victories were, of course, only possible because Old World germs \u2013 first smallpox, then others \u2013 raced ahead of the Spanish and devastated the enemy. Similarly, it is possible that a prehistoric plague pandemic cleared the way for the steppe herders to migrate across northern Europe. Evidence points to a catastrophic demographic crash about 5,000 years ago. The population fell by as much as 60% and remained at that level for centuries. We can\u2019t be sure that plague was responsible but it is the best explanation we currently have. The implications of all this are extraordinary. The new migrants brought the latest technology \u2013 not just horses and wagons, but also Bell Beaker pottery and metal tools \u2013 that marked the end of the neolithic and the start of the bronze age. But their impact is much longer-lasting. Although immigrants have continued to enrich the gene pool in the intervening years, the influx of steppe herders in the third millennium BC was the last transformative movement of people into Europe. Their DNA is the largest source of ancestry in northern Europe, accounting for slightly less than half of the genome of the British Isles. Steppe herders are also the most likely source of Indo-European languages, which includes English but also German, French, Spanish, Greek, Russian, Farsi and Hindi, spoken by about half of the world\u2019s population. In the distant past, proto-Indo-European was spoken by a small group of people, who then spread out across Europe and central and south Asia, taking their language with them. All Indo-European languages share similar vocabulary, including words related to wagons. Steppe herders introduced wagons to Europe and their DNA is found in significant proportions among people who speak Indo-European languages. All this should be a reality check for notions of where people are \u201creally\u201d from, and how we measure who is entitled to settle where in the world. The white British population are certainly not the indigenous people of the British Isles. They are the descendants of immigrants who arrived on boats. And it is likely that they were only able to settle here because the humble Yersinia pestis bacterium cleared the way for them.

Mubarak said: \u201cI can\u2019t talk about them unfortunately for legal reasons. And what I would typically always do is comment after, so I think we\u2019re going to go through the legal process.

I have very strong views on that.\u201d City claimed only the second treble in English football history and Mubarak insisted the charges should not adversely colour the achievement of Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating because it takes so much from the great work that\u2019s happening at this club and it\u2019s happening not just on the football pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat these players have achieved this year, the treble, is incredible. I hope people focus and judge them for their football and what they\u2019re achieving on the pitch and what they\u2019re achieving in every competition they\u2019re in.

Our executives are being targeted by the best teams in the world \u2013 always.\u201d Mubarak described City as \u201cthe No 1 football brand in the world\u201d, saying: \u201cThe club generates a tremendous revenue. You look at our sales in terms of what we produce, in terms of from our academy, from our first team \u2026 We can go on for half an hour right now with me just giving you data in terms of net spend over the last season, net spend over the last three years, over the last five years, over the last 10 years. \u201cLook at every single one of them and just look at these as the facts and compare us to our competition and then people will throw at us, \u2018the biggest spenders\u2019 or: \u2018You have the biggest squad.\u2019 I wish people can just pause and ask the question and get the facts and then comment.\u201d Mubarak promised even greater success. \u201cLook what we have this summer: we have the [Community] Shield, we have the Super Cup, we have the Club World Cup. For the first time, this club is going to be competing in the Super Cup and the Club World Cup. And we want to win these.\u201d Mubarak said that he, Guardiola, the chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and the director of football, Txiki Begiristain, had joked recently about what lies ahead. \u201cWe looked at each other and it was: \u2018OK, now we\u2019ve got to do it again.\u2019\u201d Erling Haaland, who scored 53 goals in 52 appearances in his debut season, told Mubarak he would win the Champions League for City.

The Australian Electoral Commission is writing to all politicians to give guidance on the essays, but tensions are already emerging as members and senators have to decide among themselves how to navigate competing ideas and write one argument for each side. Monday\u2019s passage of the constitutional alteration bill kickstarts a short 28-day deadline for the AEC to receive the essays. The essay for each side must be authorised by a majority of those who voted for or against the change in parliament and only one essay can be received for each side, with a 2000-word limit. They are then compiled into the referendum pamphlet, which is sent out several weeks before the referendum date. Prime minister Anthony Albanese hasn\u2019t set that date, but is expected to do so in early August, for a mid-October voting day. Exactly how the final essays will be decided is not wholly clear. Groups akin to parliamentary committees will be set up, potentially with a secretariat and staff, to debate and write the essays. In the scrapped 2013 referendum, the AEC said it would accept a majority of signatures, or the authority of the committee chair, as proof each essay was backed by a majority. The committee of those voting no will be dominated by the Coalition, but also includes One Nation, UAP\u2019s Ralph Babet, and former Greens senator Thorpe. The yes side is dominated by Labor but also includes the Greens, the \u2018teal\u2019 independents, David Pocock, and the Jacqui Lambie Network, as well as some Liberals. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The numbers mean the Coalition and Labor majorities would be able to write the no and yes essays respectively, without needing approval of the others. The no voters are expected to be heavily guided by the advice of Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, shadow Indigenous Australians minister and leader of the Fair Australia campaign against the voice, on the essay. But Hanson\u2019s office said she would \u201cfight tooth and nail\u201d for input into the pamphlet, noting One Nation was the first party in parliament to officially oppose the referendum. Thorpe\u2019s office also told Guardian Australia she would seek to contribute to the no essay. Resolving the views of Thorpe and Hanson, at polar extremes of the voice debate, into one essay is expected to be a key issue for the no committee. David Littleproud, whose National party represents most of the no votes, said he was committed to ensuring the no essay was \u201cfactual\u201d. On Radio National on Monday, he again disagreed with Coalition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s claims the voice would \u201cre-racialise\u201d Australia, and shrugged off key criticisms of Hanson. \u201cObviously Pauline will vote no, but she will be one voice within what will probably be 20 or 30 \u2026 the majority within that group, will form not only the tone, but the set of words,\u201d he said. \u201cMy input would be that I don\u2019t support what Pauline Hanson is advocating.\u201d Liberal MP and longtime voice advocate Julian Leeser has told the government he wants input into the yes essay, while Pocock, the Greens and teal crossbenchers are also expected to seek contributions. Albanese said he expected \u201ccontinued misinformation\u201d from voice critics, but pledged the government would \u201crun a positive campaign about why this makes a difference. \u201cI am very confident a positive campaign will produce a positive result.\u201d Albanese said the pamphlet would be \u201cone thing that [voters] consider\u201d but also pointed to the government\u2019s referendum education campaigns, saying some Australians didn\u2019t know much about the constitution. He claimed understanding of the proposal among the public would increase as the campaign unfolded. Yes23 campaign director Dean Parkin said direct, respectful conversations between people will be important to make Australians feel they can get involved, ask questions and seek information in a safe way. \u201cUp until now, the process has been dominated by politicians and lawyers. \u201cThis referendum is about uniting and bringing all Australians together, and that\u2019s where our efforts will be focused over the coming months. We have a lot of faith in the decency of Australian people, and we know they want outcomes to be better for us, and want to see practical change. The voice is the means for us to do that.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94729", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/football-transfer-rumours-jordan-pickford-off-to-manchester-united", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Jordan Pickford off to Manchester United?", "lead": "Arsenal to replace Partey with Lavia? | Mendy, Koulibaly and Ziyech to Saudi Arabia? | Gallagher to Spurs?", "author": "Rob Bleaney", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:39:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547590", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e36e7b09a1f27db3c5dad3178ab30f6f910bc12/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Erik ten Hag is a little fed up. The Manchester United sale is taking for ever, Kim Min-jae has chosen Bayern Munich over a move to Old Trafford, Chelsea are demanding \u00a370m for Mason Mount and now even David de Gea is wavering on a new contract he scarcely deserves after a season diving over bobbling shots and booting the ball out of play as his teammates try to build from the back. What better way for Ten Hag to cheer himself up than by signing the lovable rascal Jordan Pickford from Everton. Reports suggest United are preparing to capitalise on Everton\u2019s money troubles by slapping a \u00a345m bid on the Goodison Park table and sweetening the deal by offering England\u2019s No 1 a double-your-money \u00a3200,000 contract to jump ship. Axel Disasi is also being lined up to provide competition for Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Rapha\u00ebl Varane at centre-back, with Monaco looking for \u00a344m to let the France international go. When Mikel Arteta spoke of a reset after Arsenal missed out on the title most people though he meant mentally, but it seems he wants a whole new midfield \u2013 one without Thomas Partey as well as Granit Xhaka. Sources have made it known the Ghana midfielder is up for sale at the right price; \u00a350m and you can come on down. There is interest from clubs in Italy and Spain, but they are all broke, so the Gunners will hope the Saudis join the race after Al-Hilal trumped everyone for R\u00faben Neves. Rom\u00e9o Lavia has already been earmarked as Partey\u2019s replacement, and Arsenal have jumped ahead of Chelsea, United and Liverpool for the teenage Belgian who Manchester City can buy back from Southampton for \u00a340m next summer if he fancies a year in the Championship. Chelsea\u2019s reset is more of a yard sale, with Kai Havertz\u2019s \u00a360m move to Arsenal set to be concluded this week after N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 successfully coughed for the Al-Ittihad doctors and Mateo Kovacic agreed terms with Manchester City. If Mount also gets his way, the Blues will lose the entire starting midfield from the Champions League final only two years ago. Ripping up the rulebook is Todd Boehly\u2019s style though, and the Saudi buck might just save him from Financial Fair Play trouble. \u00c9douard Mendy is close to joining Al-Ahli, Kalidou Koulibaly is on the verge of joining Al-Hilal and Hakim Ziyech is in talks with Al-Nassr. Brighton are demanding a cool \u00a3100m from Chelsea for Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, and have made it clear they want to pursue their own midfield targets rather than taking Conor Gallagher in a swap deal. They\u2019d bite Boehly\u2019s hand off for Levi Colwill, though. Tottenham also want Gallagher to kickstart Ange Postecoglou\u2019s swashbuckling new era, but a move for David Raya is stalling over Brentford\u2019s demand for \u00a340m and the Spanish keeper\u2019s desire to play European football. West Ham are in the Europa League next season, and will use that as the carrot to stick it to Fulham by luring Jo\u00e3o Palhinha across London on the Elizabeth Line. It will take at least \u00a350m to complete that deal, but that should not be a problem once they snaffle \u00a3100m out of Arsenal for Declan Rice, even if he is frustrating their attempts to drum up a bidding war by insisting he only wants a move to the Gunners. And finally Kyle Walker is in the advanced stages of agreeing a move to Bayern Munich after the Germans declined their \u20ac70m option to buy Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and recognised their need for speed in any full-back signing from Manchester City."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9472a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/19/australia-politics-live-voice-referendum-senate-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-david-van-housing-fund-cost-of-living-rent-freeze-greens-nick-mckim", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MP issues double dissolution warning \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Emily Wind and Amy Remeikis (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:34:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547608", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6fe1061784d46eec6711b2b62509ee71677ba258/0_85_5936_3563/500.jpg", "body": "With that, we\u2019ll wrap up our live coverage of the day\u2019s news. Here\u2019s a summary of the main news developments: A bill to alter the constitution and enable the Indigenous voice passed federal parliament today. Prime minister Anthony Albanese said \u201cparliaments pass laws, but it is people who make history\u201d, encouraging people to vote yes during Australia\u2019s first referendum in 24 years. No date has been announced yet, however the vote must occur no sooner than two months and no later than six months from now. Usually during the third reading of a bill there aren\u2019t any more speeches, but there was further commentary today. Senator Malarndirri McCarthy told the ABC this is a \u201cmomentous time\u201d and that every senator had a chance to be involved, no matter their stance. During her speech shadow attorney-general Michaelia Cash said the majority of the coalition will vote to pass the bill because of people\u2019s \u201cright to have a say on this issue\u201d, but disagree with the voice itself. Meanwhile Senator Lidia Thorpe wore a shirt with the word \u201cGammin\u201d on it and said \u201cGammin as we know, is fake. A joke and that\u2019s what I think\u201d, confirming she will vote no. Ultimately the voice referendum bill passed in the Senate with 52 votes to 19. The $10bn Housing Australia future fund has been postponed in parliament until October after the Greens, who wanted further progress on a rent freeze, teamed up with the Coalition. Labor\u2019s Dan Farrell warned that the government would regard the delay as \u201cfailure to pass\u201d the bill and this could be the first step towards a double dissolution election. Victorian government support for Hunter Valley bus crash victims Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced the government will be providing up to $580,000 to the family members of Darcy Bulman, who was killed in the Hunter Valley bus crash, as well as to those from the state who were injured. In a statement on Monday evening, Andrews announced the funds will provide immediate relief and support for immediate family members of Bulman, who lived in the Melbourne suburb of Warrandyte. Primary victims who were injured, including up to eight players of the Warrandyte Cricket Club and their partners as well as related victims will also receive funding support. Their family members will also be offered up to $5,000 to assist with costs like loss of income and travel expenses. He said the government, together with Manningham City Council, will also help victims apply for the icare- NSW\u2019s equivalent to the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) - and will \u201cbe there to help in the event of any shortfalls in the NSW schemes\u201d. Counselling and support for the Warrandyte Cricket Club and its extended community will also be provided. Andrews said: This should have been such a special and joyous day \u2014 the beginning of a new chapter in a young couple\u2019s life and all of the people they love coming together to celebrate \u2014to have that ending in such tragic circumstances, it\u2019s heartbreaking. We said we would stand with families from our state who are caught up in this horror crash\u2013 and that is exactly what this support package will do. Climate activists target ports on anniversary of raid Climate activists are warning the public to expect more disruptions after simultaneous protests at ports in Newcastle, Brisbane and Melbourne on the anniversary of a high-profile raid, AAP reports. Three people have been charged over their involvement in the Monday protests, which were live-streamed to social media. Zelda Grimshaw from Blockade Australia said people should \u201cstay tuned\u201d for further protests from the group: You cannot decapitate the climate movement \u2013 you cut off one head and three will come back. Monday\u2019s protests were aimed at disrupting ports which are seen as key to the country\u2019s economic functioning, Grimshaw said. A 22-year-old woman in Newcastle was charged with causing an obstruction to a railway locomotive and entering enclosed lands, giving rise to serious risk to safety. In Melbourne, a 51-year-old man was charged with intentionally obstructing police and conduct endangering serious injury, among other charges. He is due to appear in Melbourne magistrates\u2019 court on Monday evening. And in Brisbane, a 23-year-old woman was charged with unregulated high-risk activities, trespass, committing public nuisance and several other charges relating to blocking traffic. She will face court next month. Governments in Victoria, NSW, Tasmania and South Australia have recently moved to clamp down on climate protesters, passing legislation to steeply increase jail time and fines for disrupting major roads and facilities. New South Wales must do its part to curb inflation and help the Reserve Bank \u201cslay the inflation dragon\u201d, the state\u2019s new treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, says. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s statement on the NSW budget, Mookhey also said the Minns Labor government would place a major investment fund set up by its Coalition predecessors under review and halt further cash injections into it.

Paramedics found a 70-year-old man\u2019s body at a home in Warnbro on June 1, a Western Australian police spokeswoman said on Monday. His death was referred to the Major Crime Division detectives after a post-mortem examination found injuries indicating suspicious circumstances. Police are appealing for information from anyone who spotted a tall male aged in his early 20s wearing dark clothing near Okehampton Road and Parkland Drive in Warnbro. In case you missed it earlier today, here are some words from Aunty Pat Anderson and minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, after the voice referendum bill passed in parliament: You can catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines so far with this wrap from my colleague Antoun Issa: Push to cut big money influence on federal elections Spending caps, real-time disclosure requirements, and a lower donation threshold are among recommended reforms to reduce the election influence of donors with deep pockets. The reforms are part of a push to increase transparency in federal elections and level the playing field, so the biggest spenders do not have an unfair advantage. Election spending reached a record $440m in 2022 and the top five individual donors contributed 70% of all donations, analysis by the Centre for Public Integrity found. A joint parliamentary committee has been investigating potential reforms to funding, donations and transparency, with its interim report making 15 recommendations. The committee chair, Kate Thwaites, said Australia\u2019s democracy and electoral system was only as robust as the institutions and frameworks that supported them: The evidence we have heard has allowed the committee to develop clear goals for reform, to increase transparency in election donations and curb the potentially corrupting influence of big money. Recommendations included lowering the donation disclosure threshold from $15,200 to $1000 and introducing real-time disclosure requirements. Political parties are currently required to disclose donations annually. The committee also recommended introducing donation and spending caps for federal elections. \u2013 AAP \u2018We are betting as well\u2019, says McCarthy as she reveals Labor currently has \u2018no idea\u2019 on referendum dates McCarthy is asked about possible dates for the referendum. Greg Jennett (host): \u2026 21 October, 28 October or November. We\u2019ve got it down to three weekends? McCarthy: Can I share something with you, Greg, it is a secret: we are betting as well on the Labor side as to what the dates are, we have no idea. Jennett: That one is firmly with the prime minister? McCarthy: Absolutely. \u2018We are going to hear some things that we don\u2019t want to hear\u2019, says Malarndirri McCarthy on voice debate The assistant minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, is speaking on the ABC about the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum bill passing today. She said it was \u201cunusual\u201d for the third reading speech to have commentary, but acknowledges this is a \u201cmomentous time\u201d and that every senator had a chance to be involved, no matter their stance. I did appreciate the fact that we had the outcome that we did on the floor of the Senate for the passage of the bill but I am mindful that when I say sacred, this is not the end with the legislation going through, the sacred journey is for all Australians as we walk towards the referendum. Now that the voice debate is moving out of Canberra and into the public sphere, McCarthy said while there will be misinformation, she is hopeful the country will come together: I have a great deal of love for the process that we are going through and I am very conscious that as imperfect as we are, we are going to hear some things that we don\u2019t want to hear and we will hear things that are not correct and they do need to be called out. I am also incredibly hopeful in that space of that love and the willingness that we want to see and I have heard on the ground as I have travelled across the country for a better country, a better people and an opportunity now for all of us to make sure that that\u2019s what happens on the other side of the referendum. More than $600,000 raised for victims of Hunter Valley bus crash A fundraiser for victims of the Hunter Valley bus crash has raised more than $600,000 as of Monday. Ten people were killed in the crash, Australia\u2019s deadliest bus crash in decades. A meeting was held on Monday to determine how to distribute the money raised in a fund jointly established by Rotary Australia and the NSW government. David Pearson, the national chairman of Rotary, said people who were directly involved in the crash and their immediate family would benefit from the fund. A community committee that will distribute the fund will \u201chave regard to the degree of impact\u201d, including considering whether they have short or long term injuries. The committee will give careful consideration to a proportional distribution. \u201cVery clear criteria for distribution\u201d will be established and agreed upon by the committee before any significant distributions are made, Pearson said. He hopes this will be in place and initial distributions can begin before the end of the week. Pearson understands other lines of assistance, including community insurance, will be funding the funerals taking place this week. The president of the Singleton Roosters, Dylan Hixon, released a statement on Monday on behalf of the local club which found itself at the centre of the tragedy: Our community has experienced unfathomable heartache, distress, and sadness, after a number of people closely connected to the club were on board and either injured or killed. Our first priority and focus is on supporting the families, friends and those from our wider club community who have been affected by this unspeakable tragedy. In a statement on behalf of newlywed\u2019s Mitchell Gaffney and Madeleine Edsell, the family thanked the community for its support and asked for privacy: While we appreciate the outpouring of love and support from the community, we ask that the media respect our privacy while we grieve. Our primary focus at this time is processing this tragedy, and supporting our family and friends, which is why we\u2019d like to formally decline any requests for media interviews. Greens \u2018holding the country to ransom\u2019 over housing bill, says Tammy Tyrrell Tasmanian senator Tammy Tyrrell of the Jacqui Lambie Network is speaking on the ABC about the housing bill being delayed. She argues that the longer the bill is delayed, the longer its going to take to get houses built and that the issue will compound: Even though there [are] programs ready to go in every state and territory \u2013 700 in Tasmania \u2013 if we don\u2019t get the kick-off from this legislation, they can\u2019t start. The Greens are really holding the country to ransom when it comes to these 1,200 homes that each state and territory could get happening right now. Tyrrell is asked whether the country could gain more benefits by taking the legislation to national cabinet first: I know people that are sleeping in their cars and couch surfing, and they don\u2019t want to wait a day longer \u2026 Something is always better than nothing. I have never said that the extras that the Greens want wouldn\u2019t be nice, but my line in the sand was to get houses for people as soon as possible. At the moment they are delaying that. I think that is unfair. I don\u2019t think the people of Australia, if they were honest and put their two cents worth out there and contacted their Greens members, that they would be saying anything different to what I am saying. Independent senator David Pocock has said it is \u201cdisappointing\u201d the housing Australia future fund bill has been delayed. In a series of tweets, he said: Disappointing to see the housing legislation that\u2019s been debated since February be kicked down the road to October by the Coalition &amp; the Greens. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s so much better than it was thanks to advocacy by a whole range of [people], from stakeholders to the [cross bench]. The Labor senator Don Farrell is speaking on the ABC about the housing Australia future fund bill being delayed; it has been postponed in parliament until October, after the Greens, who wanted further progress on a rent freeze, teamed up with the Coalition. During debate, Farrell warned that the government would regard the delay as \u201cfailure to pass\u201d the bill and this could be the first step towards a double dissolution election. Speaking on the need to raise this possibility, Farrell said: It was necessary to spell it out, because we want the Greens to come to their senses, realise \u2026 what they have done by joining forces with the Coalition \u2026 Remember, what the Coalition wants is nothing spent in the area of housing. They had nine years to do something about the issue of housing, housing affordability, rents and homelessness, and they did nothing. We have got a $10 billion proposal here. The Greens say they\u2019re concerned about this issue but the way they are acting is essentially to stop progress on this issue. Referendum bill\u2019s passing will make way for \u2018certainty of information\u2019, says Kirstie Parker Uluru dialogue member Kirstie Parker just spoke on the ABC about the milestone in parliament today, with the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum bill passing: There is never enough time to have all the conversations that you want to have, but today, this was a very important milestone so Australians can now be assured that we are heading to a referendum. It will be held in the next six months. We have an idea of the question that people will be asked in the referendum and also what the constitutional amendment will be. That is the sort of certainty of information that a lot of Australians have been hoping for and asking for. Now we can certainly focus on the meat of the proposal. Man allegedly shot by police north of Brisbane A man has been transported to hospital after allegedly being shot by police north of Brisbane today. According to a statement from Queensland police, officers were at the scene of an incident at Bray Park earlier today. About 12.30pm, police were called to a residence due to an alleged domestic incident between a man and a woman. A man sustained gunshot wounds after allegedly being shot by police and has been transported to hospital. Ethical Standards Command will begin investigations into the matter as well as oversight from the Crime and Corruption Commission. Snow and frost expected this week, BoM says The Bureau of Meteorology has released a weather outlook for the week ahead, with cold conditions \u2013 including snow \u2013 expected for parts of the country. Many thanks to Amy for taking us through the day! I\u2019ll be with you for the remainder of the evening. Well. That has been A day. Again. There are three more days of this sitting (which includes the mid-winter ball) and then the parliament won\u2019t sit again until 31 July. So there is a reason this week is going to be a bit full on \u2013 everyone needs to get their agendas out and lines up before the spotlight moves on. While politics continues (of course it does) the temperature is always turned down when parliament isn\u2019t sitting. We will continue to bring you everything you need to know \u2013 Emily Wind is going to take you through the rest of the afternoon but I will be back very early tomorrow morning. Until then \u2013 please take care of you Ax People make history Labor senator Pat Dodson is on leave but has tweeted on today\u2019s passage of the referendum legislation: Interim report into the 2022 election tabled The chair of the joint standing committee on electoral matters, Kate Thwaites, has tabled its interim report into the 2022 election. The main recommendations are: A threshold of $1,000 for disclosure of donations Real time donation disclosure Donation and spending caps Legislation for truth in political advertising, and that the Australian electoral commission administer these measures. Thwaites said that voters had to be \u201cconfident that our political system and our politicians are accessible to all and not just to those capable of making very large donations\u201d. She said: Across the western world, we see the potential for a drift from democracy when people feel like their political system isn\u2019t working for them and believe that their system has been captured by vested interests.\u201d We have another answer for reader question time: Angela wanted to know from Adam Bandt: Realistically it is impossible to consider an electric car in the inner city because we have no garages and there is no way to charge one - no fast stations, no kerbside power, etc. Are there any steps being considered in this direction in your electorate? Bandt said: Thanks for writing and highlighting this important and frustrating issue. You\u2019re spot on that we urgently need investment in lots of fast charging stations in high density areas, so people without garages can use chargers like we\u2019ve always used petrol stations. At the federal election, the Greens put forward a plan for $2b of fast charging infrastructure which would roll out publicly-owned fast charging stations across the country that allow drivers to get 80% charge in less than 30 minutes. In exchange for Greens\u2019 support on the climate legislation, the government agreed to a household electrification package, and this is one of the buckets of money that we will fight to be used on public fast chargers, but this is an ongoing battle that we\u2019re fighting nationally in conjunction with the advocacy of state and territory Greens. I\u2019d add that for most people the cost of an EV is still too high, and this is largely due to the federal government\u2019s failure to set high emissions standards like the EU and the USA, meaning Australia has become a dumping ground for petrol clunkers because the financial incentives don\u2019t exist for manufacturers to sell EVs here cheaply. This is something we have been able to get action on - we negotiated on the EVs Bill to limit handouts and tax breaks for petrol and hybrid cars, and ensured the government fleet is fully electric. This will have the impact of bringing more fully electric vehicles into the country and beginning to bring prices down. There\u2019s more work to do, of course, but the Greens will continue to pull every lever we can to make sure EVs become accessible and affordable, in addition to fighting for expanded cheaper and cleaner public transport, which is a topic for another day! Question time, thankfully ends. We have also had a \u201cfog of speakers\u201d suggested. So far, an order of speakers and a scold of speakers are taking your fancy (I have some latitude but I can\u2019t publish your NSFW suggestions) Warren Entsch is now giving his statement in response to Mark Butler\u2019s dixer. I gotta say to you that the the comments that were made by the health minister, I would have thought, quite frankly, I thought he was a half-decent person. Nevertheless, he is making accusations in relation to implying some sort of quid pro quo arrangement in relation to a very fine gentleman who happened to have made a donation to\u2026 (there are interjections) Let\u2019s get there. He also I might add, made a donation of $650,000 to Queensland Health to help them prepare for Covid because the then [Queensland Minister [Miles] had failed to do it. He made another $80,000 from other recruitment there and even $6,000 for donation to feed the Queensland Health stop. Now he was approached by a representative from the Torres Strait health to see whether or not he would also be interested in making a donation of an MRI machine to Tara State Hospital, Thursday Island Hospital. That is the reason why he approached me and wanted to know about protocols in travelling up to the Torres Strait, because he was invited up to actually consider making a donation like $700,000 he\u2019d done at hand. He made clear to me that he was interested and he was wanting to get the I think it was the Moderna. I rang the hospital. I rang the hospital and asked him if it was available. He said they said yes. and I said what is the protocols? They said if you present we\u2019ve got plenty of it. In fact, we\u2019ve got quite a bit that\u2019s going out of date. Entsch goes to go on but is told that it is not the place for this sort of more full statement and there are \u201cother avenues\u201d for it. He finishes with: No wonder this place is looking as bad as it is. (And then it seems his microphone is switched off) Sussan Ley: With the greatest respect to the minister articulating the challenge this country faces and closing the gap, with greatest respect, the question was straightforward, millions of Australians would like answer it. Can the minister please answer the question? Can you please bring the minister to order? Milton Dick asks Linda Burney to be relevant and she answers: I believe my answer is very relevant. By writing yes we can help change this. The voice is a practical change that will help local and regional committees across Australia. It will, I\u2019ll be supporting the yes case. Because it is a safe constitutional change and it will make a meaningful difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians over the months ahead I am looking forward to being part of a movement of Australians from all political backgrounds and playing a part in a campaign. Thank you Member for Berowra for providing me with your press release. It was very much appreciated. (That is the Liberal MP, Julian Leeser) Coalition ask about scope of voice and public policy Sussan Ley to Linda Burney: My question again is for the minister for Indigenous Australians and I refer to her previous response. What areas of public policy will not be within the scope of the voice? Burney: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question, I think, is repetitious. Burney reads out something she said was handed to her earlier today: Today is an historic day with the constitutional alteration of field passing the parliament. Later this year Australians will be able to vote at a referendum and complete our constitution. A successful yes vote will recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the constitution and create a voice to help close the gap. Despite being one of the most successful nations in the world, on too many measures are Indigenous brothers and sisters are not sharing the same outcomes as other Australians. The life expectancy of an Aboriginal Australians is eight years below that of other Australians. The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is estimated to be about nine times higher than fellow Australians. 1-in-5 initially assessed households are living in accommodation that does not make an acceptable standard. The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is almost 2.5 times that of other Australians. Young Indigenous males are more likely to end up in jail and then attending university. By writing yes we can help change this. The Voice is a practical change that will help local, regional communities across Australia. (Ley interjects on relevance) Milton Dick warns against the use of \u2018noalition\u2019. There is a lot of no-alitions going on. Anthony Albanese continues and gets a bit more personal: The fact is that those opposite have prioritised protesting, they have prioritised building up a profile, they have prioritised politics rather than prioritising building public housing which is why they voted against in the Senate to block the bill by deferring it. And I say this: At least those opposite in the Liberal party don\u2019t pretend. They would have the guts to vote against public housing. I say to the Greens in deferring this legislation are yet again, they should have had the guts, as I said to the leader of the Greens this morning, at least have the guts to go against it. To say that you are against 30,000 additional social housing units including housing for women and children escaping domestic violence, including housing for veterans, including housing for those in edginess communities, there are a range of things open to the government to do on policy wise that we don\u2019t need a set which has decided to block everything. We will take up those options. We certainly did on Saturday and announcing $2bn of public going forward. In return for that of course the states and territories have agreed on planning, they want new zoning, and I say this, the challenges I bet you that opposites oppose every new zoning because they\u2019ve never seen a medium density development they supported. In my area of the Inner West council they voted against every affordable housing development has occurred. Greens \u2018irrelevant\u2019 to housing debate: PM Anthony Albanese: It is a pity that the Greens political party have chosen to make themselves irrelevant to the debate. Because by refusing to participate just like the Coalition do on these issues, they can take no responsibility for anything that this government does. Because we will not be held back by a no-alition of the Coalition and the Greens say no to public housing. What if it is like with states and territories on the issue of housing supply because yes, I understand that renters are doing it tough. Yes, I want to do things about that. Yes, that\u2019s why we have a renters rights agreement, we working with states and territories through. What we are not doing is destroying supply while we do it. Because the key to fixing housing is supply. If we did what those opposite want us to do, there will be less supply of housing going forward. And that is what they don\u2019t seem to comprehend. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather asks Anthony Albanese: Millions of renters are in crisis and many are one rent increase away from eviction. The Greens have asked for months to make immediate investment from the budget in public housing and work with the states and territories to impose national limits on rent increases and until this weekend you have refused. Now that you have caved in and put $2bn on the table to get the Labor premiers to shift on housing, or you now show leadership and work with national cabinet and make unlimited rent increases illegal? Labor goes OFF at this question and there are a lot of interjections from when Chandler-Mather said \u201ccaved\u201d and Milton Dick has to call for order a few times. MCM has to ask the question again, with Dick warning any further interjections will lead to people being booted from the chamber. Bronwyn Bishop, who is one of the former speakers in the parliament, today is probably ITCHING to throw some people out. You can feel the vibes from the press gallery. MCM gets up to reask his question, but not before he quips \u201cif only you showed that much passion for renters\u201d but Dick tells him to zip it and ask the question (in speaker speak) Coalition attacks on Gallagher continue in Senate Over in Senate question time, the Coalition has continued its week-long attacks on Katy Gallagher over her knowledge of Brittany Higgins\u2019s allegations \u2013 where the finance minister is patiently explaining yet again that she told the Coalition two years ago that she knew about the claims a few days before they were made public. Gallagher is now pushing back on the claims. Nearly every Coalition question in Senate QT last week was on this topic, even after Gallagher gave a detailed explanation and timeline to the chamber first-thing last week. The trend continued on Monday, with the LNP senator Susan McDonald asking Gallagher if she had misled the Senate. Gallagher again denied this, saying she\u2019d been \u201cupfront and clear\u201d about her knowledge. She pointed back to that now-infamous Senate estimates committee hearing in 2021, when she responded \u201cnoone had any knowledge\u201d \u2013 which she has since said, many times, was a reference to claims Labor knew about Higgins\u2019 allegations weeks earlier (Gallagher says she was told 4 days before the stories broke). Gallagher said she had a private meeting at that time with the Liberal senators Linda Reynolds and Anne Ruston, when the meeting took a short break to chat offline, where she claims she told the senators that she did know about the allegations earlier: I did tell Senator Reynolds at the time, in that private meeting, and perhaps all this could have been avoided if that meeting wasn\u2019t private. But it was private. It was held outside the Senate estimates room, but I did say to Senator Reynolds and Senator Ruston at the time that I had been aware of the allegations in the days leading up to them becoming public. Members told to stop interjecting during voice questions Paul Fletcher: I think all fair-minded Australians agreed with the point about the work we collectively have to do on the closing the gap targets. The question goes to the voice, which policies do not directly affect First Nations people? Tony Burke: On two points of order. One on the relevance rule, what matters is whether or not it is relevant to the terms of the question, that is what standing orders say and I put that it is. Secondly, and I didn\u2019t want to interrupt while the minister was speaking, but I get that when a minister and some of us do it on deliberately inflaming the place, people interject back. The constant interjections from the member from New England in particular (there are more interjections) \u2026 They are always disorderly but it is also the case \u2026.(more interjections) It is what you are doing now. I know you get angry a lot but it is what you are doing now. When a minister, when an answer is being given in the tone and which the minister for Indigenous affairs is giving the answer, the interjections that are coming from those opposite simply should not be there. Linda Burney continues but the main part of the answer is: This country does not want to see further disadvantage and the voice is about practical outcomes, it is about recognition and those two things is what you need to understand. \u2018It is not okay\u2019, Linda Burney tell QT Paul Fletcher , member for Bradfield, asks: The voice will concern itself with issues that directly affect First Nations people. Which policies do not directly affect First Nations people? Linda Burney responds: We should all reflect that just on Monday the Productivity commission brought down a report on the Closing the gap targets. And they told a terrible story. We are elected into this place to represent everyone. And to do that is also to understand these statistics. The life expectancy gap is not on track. It is not okay that my life expectancy is eight years shorter than the deputy. It\u2019s not okay. It is not okay that for those of you who have children, who are doing year 12, that those - those outcomes will not be as good for First Nations students. It is not okay that babies are born at unhealthy birth weights. That is not okay. The fact that I visited a community last week where they were 30 people living in a two-bedroom unit is not acceptable. This is why the voice is important. This is why it will make a practical difference on the ground. Fletcher gets up to interject and Tanya Plibersek calls out: What does Linda Burney know about this, why don\u2019t you go ahead and correct her?\u201d Plibersek was warned. The independent MP for Fowler Dai Le asks Jim Chalmers: I understand the government is optimistic Australia will not fall into a recession. In Fowler, charities are seeing unprecedented number of middle income families needing help. Small businesses are not seeing the same level of customers. More people are working a second job. We\u2019re yet to feel the impact of the 12 interest rate hikes. How confident should the Australian public be we\u2019re not heading towards a recession, if we\u2019re not already in one. Chalmers: It is not currently the expectation of the treasury, or the Reserve Bank, or a number of other credible institutions and forecasters that Australia will go down that path. But what we\u2019ve tried to do, what we\u2019ve tried to do on this side of the House, Mr Speaker, is to be up-front about the challenges that we do confront in our country. We see it in the budget before that and after that, we do expect the Australian economy to slow considerably. This is the inevitable consequence of the interest rate rises that began before the election and continued after, and also the substantial slowdown in the global economy. So I say to your constituents and I say to communities right around Australia, that what we\u2019re trying to do, and what we are doing in our first two budgets is to try and provide help where we can, to get your constituents and communities around Australia through a difficult and challenging period in the global and domestic economies, provide some help where we can, and also lay the foundations for future growth at the same time. Labor tactics committee has a plan Labor MP Mary Doyle gets to ask the treasurer a question just so Jim Chalmers can say that Doyle has now asked him three times as many questions as Angus Taylor, the shadow treasurer (in the post budget period). Which of course she has \u2013because that has been the set up by the Labor tactics committee. Doyle didn\u2019t just wake up and go \u201cgee, I wonder how the Albanese Labor government\u2019s housing policies helping lay the foundations for a stronger economy after a wasted decade, and what is standing in the way?\u201d and then wander into parliament to ask it. It was set out by a tactics committee so Chalmers can point out that the newest member of the house has asked more questions of the treasurer than the shadow treasurer has since the budget was handed down. Sussan Ley asks Linda Burney: Minister, what areas of public policy won\u2019t be within the scope of the Voice? Burney shows a rare flash of anger as she stands up. Burney: Can I thank the member opposite for her question. And say that if she listened more carefully to the debate, she wouldn\u2019t have to ask that question. In relation to the role of the Voice, we have been extraordinarily clear. And we have listened to the aspirations of First Nations Australians through an engagement group, through a working group, through many discussions on the ground in local communities, as well as the expert legal group. I have spoken at length with my colleagues, and spoken at length with many people in this house. The answer to the question is that it is - it is stated time and time again, that the Voice will concern itself with the issues that directly affect First Nations people. And what I find absolutely appalling by that question - what I find... Peter Dutton was interjecting \u2018what does it exclude?\u2019. Burney: You\u2019re throwing red herrings at 3.45am \u2013 there was a question in the Senate, about how the voice will affect the link road in Melbourne? And that came from Senator Cash. I don\u2019t think the Voice will have time to worry about the link Road in Melbourne. Voice debate needs to be above politics Anthony Albanese goes through what the voice is, and then moves to the debate: I make this point - that I\u2019m hopeful \u2026 we can have a respectful debate going forward. A respectful debate going forward. Clause three makes it very clear there\u2019s no right of veto. That this parliament will be prime. The principles that have put forward as well are one, the voice will give independent advice to the parliament and government. Two, the voice will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities. Not appointed by the government. Three, it will be representative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities with a gender balance and include youth. Four, it will be empowering, community-led, inclusive and community-informed. It will be accountable and transparent. It\u2019s work alongside traditional structures. The voice won\u2019t have a program delivery function and, the voice will not have a veto power. Mr Speaker, the fact that the legislation, the legislation if the referendum is successful will come before this parliament, this parliament, will determine the structure, the composition, the powers and the procedures going forward. And I think, Mr speaker, I hope that there can be a respectful debate on this issue. And I hope that people avoid misinformation. This needs to be above politics as usual, Mr speaker. It needs to be above politics as usual. Peter Dutton\u2019s question Peter Dutton: Prime Minister, why are Australians being asked to make the biggest change to Australia\u2019s constitution in decades, creating a permanent new body, without any details how it would operate? Why is the Prime Minister refusing to provide these details to the Australian people before the referendum? Anthony Albanese: The referendum is very clear. It\u2019s about two things. It\u2019s about recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution. Warren Entsch wants to respond Immediately after that answer Warren Entsch stands up and says that he would like an opportunity to \u201crespond to that nonsense\u201d. He is told the time for that is after question time. Did anyone get preferential access to Covid-19 vaccines? The health minister Mark Butler takes this dixer: Why is it important for the government to protect the health of vulnerable Australians against the risk of Covid-19 infection? Is the minister aware of any instances of people receiving preferential access to vaccines, which may have posed a risk to public health? Butler: Right through this dreadful pandemic, both Australian governments, frankly, have been particularly focused on protecting those Australians who are most at risk of severe death, severe disease or death. My predecessors worked particularly hard at protecting First Nations communities during this pandemic, working hand in hand with those communities and organisations like NACCHO, I pay credit to Greg [Hunt] and Ken [Wyatt] for that work. I was more critical about the former government\u2019s slowness in securing vaccine deals in the first year or two, that meant Australia was desperately short of Pfizer doses in the middle of part of 2021, just as the Delta wave was building. Indeed of July that year, the Atagi advice was that Pfizer not be administered to people over the age of 50. This background highlights why there\u2019s so much concern at reports over the weekend that the member for Leichhardt arranged for a local property developer, aged in his 60s, to travel to Thursday Island, to receive a Pfizer dose in that very month of July. Concern that was clearly understood across the nation, this man was not eligible on Atagi advice for the Pfizer vaccine. Concern that he was taking a dose that was intended to protect the vulnerable members of that community on Thursday Island, and concern that unnecessary travel to First Nations communities exposed those communities to a risk of infection. A risk that had been clearly identified and articulated by Greg Hunt and Ken Wyatt to their credit. Now, the member for Leichhardt\u2019s own colleagues have reported on a large donation of $304,000 from this property developer, $4,000 for just one dinner attended by just five people, some dinner it must have been, Mr Speaker. The member for Leichhardt\u2019s constituents will draw their own conclusions about this story. The member has questions to answer, at a time when his own government was so concerned about protecting vulnerable communities, and other Australians were expected to queue patiently for short dose vaccines, and not to charter a private plane to travel to Thursday Island to access one of theirs. I notice an hour or two before Question Time the Queensland government has announced this matter has been referred to the Queensland crime and corruption commission for that state for inquiry. We have now had the suggestion of a \u201cbabble\u201d of speakers. A blog watcher sitting on the floor of the house has suggested an \u201cinterjection\u201d of speakers. PM asked if pharmacy dispensing changes are hitting the sector \u2018like a wrecking ball\u2019 Former Nationals leader Michael McCormack asks Anthony Albanese: \u201cPrime Minister, your own local pharmacist, Adele Tahan, who vaccinated you against COVID-19, who you mentioned in the parliament just a few short weeks ago, has described the dispensing changes as hitting the pharmacy sector \u201clike a wrecking ball.\u201d Prime Minister, is she right?\u201d (Tahan is also one of the Pharmacy Guild members who came to the parliament earlier in the month to sit in the gallery as the Coalition began their campaign opposing the decision to allow people with chronic illnesses who are prescribed 300 listed medicines to get two months worth of medication with one script, which will cut the amount of dispensing fees pharmacists receive, but save people who take that medication a lot of money). Albanese says: Adele Tahan is a very good pharmacist in my electorate. Her pharmacy is at Rozelle, I regularly either get the flu vaccination either there in Rozelle, or at my local pharmacy in Marrickville. We have a campaign by the pharmacy guild of which Adele is the vice-president ... And like any union, they\u2019re entitled to advocate for their members. There are a lot of interjections at Albanese calling the Pharmacy Guild \u201ca union\u201d which is the same response you get when you call the Business Council a \u201cunion\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s a fact. They do the same things unions do. And people sign up to them and pay them fees to advocate on their behalf. Like \u2026 a union. Abanese continues: Like any other union, sometimes they don\u2019t get it right. Because they\u2019re advocating... ..they\u2019re advocating for their members, and we\u2019re in constructive discussions with them. I want to see pharmacies thrive. But I tell you who else I care about, besides the person who is the pharmacist, I care about the person who goes into the pharmacy. I care about the six million Australians who will benefit, who will benefit from cheaper medicines. That\u2019s what I care about. What should it be? A blog watcher says there doesn\u2019t appear to be a collective noun for a group of speakers as yet, at least according to this list, so now is your chance to have one stick. What should it be? A) Noise of speakers B) Scold of speakers C) Order of speakers D) Gaggle of speakers E) Standing of speakers F) other Order, gaggle or standing of speakers Back to the collective noun for a group of speakers, we have also had an \u201corder\u201d of speakers, a \u201cgaggle\u201d of speakers and a \u201cstanding\u201d of speakers suggested. \u2018We\u2019ll do it as soon as we can\u2019 Anthony Albanese: Behaviour that would not be accepted in workplaces across the country should certainly not be accepted here in this parliament. To help drive culture change, we expect to have a key stone reform of the Jenkins report, an independent statutory HR agency, up and running from October this year. With co-operation from across the parliament we\u2019re also working to establish the independent parliamentary standards commission, and to implement recommendations of the review of the members of parliament staff act as quickly as possible. I say to the member - with regards to timing - we\u2019ll do it as soon as we can. But we want to make sure we get it right, and we have the full input many people across the parliament and ownership of people across the parliament. These reforms do require that co-operation and we continue to work through the parliamentary leadership taskforce to secure this co-operation. We\u2019re also prioritising close consultation with staff as we implement these reforms. We know that staff can be vulnerable in these workplaces and it\u2019s critical that we make sure that these reforms work in the interests of our staff. The government is committed to progressing these essential reforms and to getting them right. I look forward to working with the member for north Sydney and other members and senators to make sure we do just that. Will the PM expedite parliamentary code of conduct, Albanese is asked Kylea Tink, the independent MP for North Sydney: Shocking allegations in 2019 led to the set the standard report on the development of the first ever code of conduct for parliamentarians. In February, you led the chamber\u2019s endorsement of the behaviours, standard, and codes for all Commonwealth workplaces. But the behaviours of the past week show we have a long way to go. Will the Prime Minister commit to expediting the due date for the full implementation and enforcement of the behaviour, standards and codes? Anthony Albanese: The government is committed to implementing all 28 recommendations from Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins\u2019s review into Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. Parliament House will never be a typical workplace, but it must be a safe workplace, a respectful workplace, a workplace that lives up to the ideals that our democracy is built on, equality, fairness, decency and respect for all. It must also be a workplace worthy of the nation and the people we are called here to serve. Early this year the parliament endorsed new draft codes of conduct. This was a historic moment and we\u2019re working through the parliament to establish the enforcement of the codes as a priority. All parliamentarians and staff should be complying with the codes of conduct and the new behaviour standards for everyone who works in parliament. (continued in next post) Fancy leaf lettuce farm features in QT Terry Young gets the next non-government question (there is a byelection in Queensland, so the Queenslanders are getting their moment in the sun) and he wants to know: Fancy leaf is a lettuce farm in my electorate. Their power bills have more than doubled since the same time last year, the price of the stock they buy has increased dramatically, and they\u2019re now paying a fuel surcharge to receive that stock. These costs need to be passed onto consumers who are already struggling. When will the Prime Minister take responsibility for making things worse for middle Australia? Have to say, I don\u2019t think of lettuce when I think of \u201cfancy\u201d leaf, so for a moment I was a little taken aback. Anthony Albanese gives the usual answer \u2013 you voted against the energy relief, you have stood in the way of anything we have tried to do to help, we are getting on with the job, we are doing our bit to get inflation down. I am paraphrasing because at this point in the debate, we all know what the question and answer is and every minute of our life is precious and we have no more time to spend on this than we have to. Right, I think I have a handle on the tech gremlins which are making my life even more difficult today, so let\u2019s get back to QT (the source of most of the difficulties in general). First question: Inflation Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor opens the oppositions questions and it is on\u2026inflation. Why won\u2019t the government admit it has made things worse for middle Australia ( you get the gist). Anthony Albanese responds with the same answer he has given for weeks. Over in the senate and the Coalition is still pursuing whether or not Katy Gallagher misled parliament. It is going to be that sort of week. There are a whole heap of former speakers in the house. I am not sure what the collective noun for a group of speakers is \u2013 a noise of speakers? A scold of speakers? Whatever it is, Milton Dick welcomes them. PwC caught up in cyber attack but says its IT network was not compromised Embattled consultancy firm PwC has been one of the many companies caught up in the cyber attack on third party file-transfer platform MoveIt. The attack, attributed to Russian cyber gang CI0pand reported earlier this month has caught up potentially hundreds of companies and government agencies across the globe, including the US Energy Department, Shell, and John Hopkins University. A spokesperson for PwC has determined that the firm was caught up in the breach, but said the platform had only been used for a \u201climited number of client engagements.\u201d The spokesperson said: \u201cAs soon as we learned of this incident we stopped using the platform and started our own investigation. Our investigation has shown that PwC\u2019s own IT network has not been compromised and that MoveIt\u2019s vulnerability had a limited impact on PwC. We have reached out to the small number of clients whose files were impacted to discuss the incident.\u201d Companies use MoveIt to transfer sensitive files out of the organisation to customers. Motion to revoke David Van\u2019s $6000 role Included on the Senate orders of business today is a motion to revoke Victorian senator David Van as temporary chair of committees in the senate. It\u2019s one of the weird roles in this place, but essentially is a back up to the Senate president and deputy president to oversee Senate proceedings. Van was appointed to that role in August of last year and received a 3% salary top up for it (about $6,000) The Senate can appoint and revoke roles at its pleasure. Next up is question time It has been a very busy session so far and we are now in the downhill slide to question time, so take a moment to get a cup of tea (or something stronger) to get through it. And very big apologies \u2013you may have noticed I wrote Aunty Pat Turner instead of Aunty Pat Anderson a little bit below \u2013 the mistake was entirely mine and I apologise. Dorinda Cox says passage of the referendum legislation is a historical moment The Greens are now holding their press conference acknowledging the passage of the referendum legislation through the parliament. WA senator Dorinda Cox has brought members of her family along for the occasion and says: These are my children who are here as part of the next generation who we will be, as Adam [Bandt] has already said, we passed in the Senate today, a historical moment and what I am calling a decade of change. I also want to introduce my mum Margaret who is part of the previous generation, the Stolen Generation in fact. This is an important juncture for us in order to trigger the referendum later on this year and pass constitutional recognition for first peoples in this country. It is not only important for us as the Australian Greens but important for me and my family and that is why they joined me today. Voice referendum now in the hands of yes and no campaigns And that is it \u2013 the referendum is now in the hands of the yes and no campaigns, before ultimately being decided by the people. We will learn of a date, the pamphlets will be sent out, the campaigns will run and then we vote. Hanson comments \u2018not worthy\u2019 of prime ministerial response Anthony Albanese was asked about some of Pauline Hanson\u2019s inflammatory comments in the debate and said: I didn\u2019t see what Senator Hanson said, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s consistent with things that she said in the past, they don\u2019t intend to respond to them, because I don\u2019t think that they are worthy of a prime ministerial response. I will say this. I will call for a respectful debate across the board, no matter what way people are voting, to try to, for the advocates, to do their best to stick to the facts, to not say things that they know are not true, that they know are not true. Will the voice have power? Aunty Pat Anderson tackled the question of whether or not the voice will have power and said: Yes, it has to have some power and you will give us the power when you vote yes, we have the mandate of the Australian people. And then we can talk as equals, more equal with the parliament and the executive of the day. Although the word advisory is used it as a very powerful word in this context, that is why we went for an instrument in the constitution because we have tried everything else. Set up committees, done this and that and nothing has worked. Me and Linda, the minister, we have worked a generation of us inside and outside trying to get that advances, but only through our own activism, nothing has been given to us. That is a falsehood that black fellas get everything because we do not. There has been advances and achievements but through our advocacy and we are coming to you again as we have done all of the generations before us, and we get questions like that. But we will answer any question but let us get some principles on the table here. Albanese \u2018confident\u2019 of \u2018positive result\u2019 Anthony Albanese is asked about the prospect of the referendum\u2019s success and says: I have faith in the Australian people and I have faith that we will put our case and I will ask people to comment as well I have always had faith in the Australian people, you cannot predetermine these things. And it is difficult to win a referendum. We knew that at the beginning. We knew that. We know that is the case. We expect continued misinformation, but we will run a positive campaign about why this makes a different and say to Australians, as I think my friend Mark Dreyfus here just said, where is the downside here? What are people risking here? Compared with how things have been working up to now? From my perspective, this is all upside. And that is why I am very confident, that, a positive campaign will produce a positive result, and will produce something that we can be proud of, and we go back to all the other advances that have been made, and my time here. Vote about \u2018who we are as a nation\u2019, says PM Anthony Albanese said the campaign will be difficult, but he believes it will prevail. We know getting constitutional change in Australia is a difficult thing to do. It is a difficult thing to do. We know that from history. They also said you could not win a by-election, that was held by the opposition if you were the government. We did that just a little while ago. What we are doing here, is something that frankly is more important. More important than any by-election that has ever been held. This is about who we are as a nation and whether we will move forward, more reconciled, the campaign is being led by the people in this room, and others, the thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, who were part of this process leading up to 2017. That is as it should be, this is something that has not arisen in Canberra. This is a Voice to Canberra, from every region, from remote communities, from every corner of this land, under the southern sky, as the Uluru Statement says. October likely for referendum There is no date set for the referendum as yet \u2013 it can be held anytime between 2 months and 30 days and six months. Anthony Albanese said he has always been transparent it will be in the last quarter of the year. (October is looking most likely.) \u2018We want to make that change\u2019 Uncle Rodney Dillon then says: The things that have happened to our people in the past are no joy, there is no joy in the prison system, very little joy in the education system, the housing system, all the systems that have been broken down and is not working, this will play a role in giving advice on making those better. This is an important role that this is going to play for this country. I see the social determinants on the other end that are so wrong and I can see that this can be so right for this country. The reason I support this, and this government, and the opposition as well, to work together, to make change \u2026 for our people. Because it has not been like that. We have been in a war zone for a long time. I think this makes the change\u2026 It puts our hand out and it goes to everyone to make change in this country, and I just see that as an important role. Having those outcomes and the advice this group will give our country is going to be so important. And all it is as advice at this stage, it is important for us to take notice this is advice to make change, to make it better for our people. Because it has not been getting better. And we want to make that change. \u2018It is important, this is a milestone\u2019 Aunty Pat Anderson takes the podium: Parliament has done its job as it is supposed to do, it has taken us a long time to get to this position, much longer than the 12 years\u2026 We have been calling for recognition, respect, acknowledge and since the first. From 1840, we were calling people in NSW to petition the king, and we have also we would go to a higher authority for someone to hear us and do something to help us. Today, parliament did its job and now as it says in the Uluru Statement, the question is said, the amendment is said and we can go out and talk to the Australian people\u2026 The Australian public, the Australian people will decide what sort of a country we are, what do we stand for, what are our values, who are we? That is what we will vote on soon. In this referendum. It is big, it is important, this is a milestone, and who we are, as a nation today. And I believe despite everything that has happened to me and my family and everybody and every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person in the country, there is a fundamental belief you will all do the right thing at the right time, thank you. \u2018No harm\u2019 from voice, \u2018only good\u2019, says Mark Dreyfus Attorney general Mark Dreyfus: The Australian people can be confident that we got this right and that this is constitutionally sound. No harm can come from this referendum, only good. The parliament has done its job and now it is up to the Australian people to take the opportunity offered by the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017, an opportunity for our nation to do better, to come together and to walk towards a better future. Linda Burney pays tribute to Pat Dodson Linda Burney steps up to the podium: The person who is physically not here today, but I can assure you that he is here in spirit is, of course, our beloved Patrick Dodson. I wanted to particularly say that - and he\u2019ll be watching, so, hi, Pat - we have done it. Burney continues: Today \u2013 the political debate ends. Today \u2013 we can start a national conversation at the community level about what a voice is, why it\u2019s needed, and how it will make a practical difference. And to those Australians who want to know more, I say this: The idea of constitutional recognition through a voice began with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a generous invitation to all Australians to walk a path to a better future. The Uluru Statement was a culmination of more than 12 regional dialogues, 1,200 Indigenous elders and leaders from across Australia, listening to advice from the ground in communities. Now, politicians may not like everything that the Voice has to say, but that\u2019s how a good democracy should function. PM repeats solicitor general\u2019s view voice \u2018enhances\u2019 political system Anthony Albanese: This change isn\u2019t about detracting from the 122 years of our democracy. As the solicitor general in his written advice says clearly \u2013 it enhances that system. This has been the culmination of years of discussion, consultation and patient hard work by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. And what shines so brightly at the very core of its gracious request is the desire to bring us all closer together as a people reconciled. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lift our great nation even higher. Recognition of this continent\u2019s First People in our nation\u2019s constitution, listening to their voices on issues that impact them, making concrete practical change that makes a difference to people\u2019s lives, people making themselves heard across our great nation. In the regions and beyond in the remotest corners of our vast and beautiful continent, that we share with the oldest continuous culture on earth. All those voices rising across Australia like the head waters of 1,000 creeks and rivers joining in to a mighty current - a chance to walk together as one to a better future. \u2018A chance to make our nation even greater\u2019 Anthony Albanese on the referendum: I say to my fellow Australians \u2013 parliaments pass laws, but it is people who make history. This is your time, your chance, your opportunity to be a part of making history. It will be a moment of national unity, a chance to make our nation even greater. A gracious chapter in the great story of Australia. How does the double dissolution trigger work? Earlier, the Labor deputy Senate leader Don Farrell noted the government would regard delaying the housing Australia future fund bill to October as a failure to pass it. Ominously, he noted that senators understood what that means. Section 57 of the constitution sets out the procedure for a double dissolution election: The House of Representatives passes a bill and sends it to the Senate. The Senate rejects the bill, or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House will not agree. After three months the House of Representatives passes the bill a second time and sends it to the Senate again. The Senate again rejects the bill, or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House will not agree. The Prime Minister may now advise the Governor-General to dissolve both Houses, this is a matter for determination by the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister takes that step, both Houses are dissolved simultaneously and elections are held for both Houses So, Farrell was effectively putting the Senate on notice that delaying the bill to October would be regarded as the first failure to pass the bill. Of course, the government is not required to do anything with a double dissolution trigger. But it would give the government the option of going to an early election in 2024 some time, for example. Or it could just be a threat to grease the wheels for the bill to pass, which it failed to do today. Albanese press conference begins Anthony Albanese is holding a press conference in the wake of the referendum legislation passing the parliament. He is joined by the referendum working group, members of the yes campaign and attorney general Mark Dreyfus. There are going to be a lot of speakers here, so we will cover what we can. There will be a story coming very soon as well. Lambie senator \u2018angry\u2019 at housing bill delay Jacqui Lambie network senator Tammy Tyrrell is not happy with the delay in the housing future fund vote: I\u2019m angry and disappointed at the decision of the Senate today to defer the vote on the housing Australia future fund to October. Every day that we delay passing this legislation, the housing list in Tasmania continues to grow. More people find themselves in need of emergency housing. I negotiated to deliver 1,200 homes over the next five years for Tasmania. Tasmanian Greens senators Nick McKim and Peter Whish-Wilson have chosen to delay these homes. It\u2019s on them to explain to Tasmanians why they don\u2019t think we deserve these houses and deserve them now.\u201d Australian military action in Timor-Leste \u2018left deep scars\u2019, inquiry hears Australian Defence Force members operating in Timor-Leste will be subject to local laws, the defence department has told an inquiry that has heard about Timorese civilians being injured and killed by Australian weapons and vehicles. A parliamentary inquiry into the defence cooperation between Australia and Timor-Leste and the status of visiting forces heard from the department of defence and the department of foreign affairs and trade on Monday morning about a new treaty. The Timor-Leste Institute for Development Monitoring and Analysis, La\u2019o Hamutuk/Walking Together, said in its submission that the \u201ctroublesome history of Australian military activities has left deep scars\u201d. It said that from 2008 to 2010 alone, Australian soldiers in Timor-Leste as part of the international stabilisation force [ISF] had been in nine vehicle crashes in which civilians were injured, including a 2009 crash that severely injured two brothers and was kept secret. Its submission said victims were \u201cconfused\u201d with \u201cmixed messages\u201d on compensation: Unfortunately, this has been the pattern for nearly all Timorese people injured or killed by Australian weapons or vehicles. The committee chair, Labor MP Josh Wilson, asked the defence department whether Australia had taken appropriate responsibility for accidents. Air Commodore Patrick Keane, the director general of the department\u2019s legal services, said the \u201cdefault position\u201d was that visiting members and civilian workers were subject to the laws of the country they were visiting, and that there would be mechanisms in place by which anyone affected by the ADF in Timor-Leste could be dealt with: They\u2019re subject to local law and would be subject to any issues in relation to civil claims like the ones raised in the submissions. The ISF withdrew from Timor-Leste in 2013 but the ADF maintains a presence in the country, working with the local force. \u2018You own more property than most people ever will\u2019 Renters advocacy group Better Renting says the latest ATO taxation statistics show that 51.1% of all rental properties are owned by people who own multiple properties \u2013 at least 2.6% properties, on top of their main residence. Better Renting Executive Director Joel Dignam says the data shows the reality of housing investment: If you are lucky enough to own a rental property, consider stopping to smell the roses. You own more property than most people ever will. But if you rent, it\u2019s more likely than not that your landlord owns, on average, 2.6 investment properties - in addition to their own home. These people are unusually wealthy and the data show that, while renters were tightening their purse strings during Covid, landlords were making bigger profits than ever. We estimate that in 2020-21 taxpayers subsidised landlord losses to the tune of over $2 billion. It is unclear why our government continues to give tax handouts to wealthy investors, while refusing to contemplate action to help reduce the burden that runaway rent increases are placing on the roughly one in three Australians who rent their homes.\u201d I think most of us struggle to understand just how well off landlords actually are. If you\u2019re a home-owner struggling with mortgage repayments, you have much more in common with the renter next door than someone who owns their own home plus two others.\u201d Coalition calls for more support for Ukraine Meanwhile, the government will also face pressure to do more for Ukraine, with the opposition moving an urgency motion \u201ccalling on the Albanese Labor government to deliver a further package of assistance to Ukraine\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean that the government will send a package \u2013 just that (if passed) the Senate thinks it should happen). Simon Birmingham: We urge all parties to support this motion to maintain Australia\u2019s strong and bipartisan support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s illegal and immoral invasion. For months now need has been mounting for this Labor government to deliver a further package of military, humanitarian and energy assistance to Ukraine. It is embarrassing to see Ukraine resorting to public campaigns for Australia to do more, and concerning to have members of the Australian Ukrainian community express their disappointment at the lack of recent action. The Coalition calls on all parties to support this motion to ensure Australia continues to provide support for a friend and country in need, and Australia continues to defend democracy and the international rules-based order. Most importantly, we urge the Albanese government to act, swiftly and comprehensively, by delivering a further package of support that restores Australia\u2019s standing as a leading non-NATO contributor to Ukraine. Greens leader Adam Bandt said his party is willing to go to the line to fight to have renters rights considered during the housing crisis: Unlimited rent increases should be illegal. The pressure is now on the Prime Minister and the Labor Premiers to act on a rent freeze and limit rent increases. This is a test for Labor. It\u2019s wall-to-wall Labor across the mainland, so rent rises are their responsibility. For months we have been calling for two things: real money on housing now, not after the next election, and action to limit soaring rents. For months Labor has said this was impossible. Over the weekend, Labor found an extra $2b to start going out the door in two weeks\u2019 time, but they still won\u2019t act on rents. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight this hard to get Labor to limit rent increases during this rental and housing crisis. The Greens want a two year rental freeze and then caps on raises there after. The government says it has advice it wouldn\u2019t do it and that it is not the domain of the Commonwealth. The Greens say if it worked for the energy intervention, it would work for this. The debate will now continue for the next few months \u2013 but the legislation won\u2019t pass this sitting, unless there is enough movement for the Greens to support it suddenly being brought back to the senate Now for the next phase of the yes campaign Key campaigners for the Indigenous voice have welcomed the passage of the constitutional alteration bill, and seem itching to move the yes campaign into its next phase: The Uluru Dialogue said it was now \u201can opportunity to write a new respectful and more inclusive chapter\u201d in Australia\u2019s history. This is the recognition we\u2019ve been fighting for and what the vast majority of First Nations People support. The significance of this moment cannot be overstated,\u201d said leader Professor Megan Davis. In 2017 we issued the Uluru Statement from the Heart to the Australian people inviting them to walk with us. In 2023, we are asking them to hear us. We are confident that the Australian people are ready to change history.\u201d Co-chair Pat Anderson said: We now have more clarity on the plan ahead and trust the Australian people will seek and receive the information they need to make an informed decision and, ultimately, vote yes. Dean Parkin, campaign director for the Yes23 organisation, was buoyed by the campaign \u201cnow being turned over to the Australian people.\u201d The legal and parliamentary scrutiny has been necessary, however, it\u2019s now where it belongs, with the people of Australia,\u201d he said. This marks a new phase in the campaign where the focus turns to having conversations in the community with everyday Australians about why a successful referendum will help deliver practical outcomes on the ground and move Australia forward.\u201d Parkin noted there had been over 500 organisations publicly backing the yes vote including multicultural and faith groups, businesses, land councils, unions, advocacy groups, sporting clubs and universities. This referendum is about uniting and bringing all Australians together, and that\u2019s where our efforts will be focused over the coming months,\u201d he said. We\u2019re expecting a press conference from Linda Burney and Mark Dreyfus shortly at Parliament House. The Greens have won their bid to have the Haff moved to October. So the Housing Australia Future Fund is officially parked for at least another four months. Which the government consider to be the bill failing in the Senate, for the first time. Vote goes against Labor Ayes: 23 Noes: 37. So Don Farrell lost his motion to amend the motion. The senate is now dividing to Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s original motion to delay debate until 16 October. Farrell warning on double dissolution trigger The Senate is now dividing on Don Farrell\u2019s amendment to Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s motion. He wants to change October 16 to \u201cthe next sitting day\u201d. If the Senate rejects his amendment, then the government will consider the bill to have failed in the Senate for the first time. If a bill fails to pass the parliament twice, then that could trigger a double dissolution election. The government is in ultimate control of whether to pull that trigger or not, but Farrell has shot a warning out. So what Don Farrell is asking the Senate to consider is that the government considers delaying the vote until October, a failure of the Senate to pass the bill meaning \u2013 the first trigger for a double dissolution election. (There are other steps, obviously. But it is a warning) Don Farrell says if the senate delays the vote until October, it will consider it as the \u201csenate failing to pass the bill\u201d. He is urging the senate to consider that. Minister says the Greens and Coalition are an \u2018axis of evil\u2019 in housing fund debate The Senate has voted to suspend standing orders. 36 ayes 26 noes Now Sarah Hanson-Young will move the motion to move the bill debate to 16 October. Trade and tourism minister Don Farrell is moving a motion to amend the Greens motion to change 16 October to \u201cnext sitting day\u201d which is tomorrow. The \u201crespectful\u201d debate starts off with Farrell referring to the Greens and the Coalition as the \u201caxis of evil\u201d so it\u2019s getting off to a great start. Senate divides on housing future fund debate The Senate chamber is dividing on the Greens motion to delay debate for the housing bill until October. The Coalition are in support. So it looks like having the numbers and the Haff will be parked for another four months. Housing debate gets personal in the Senate Back in the Senate, Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi tells Labor to \u201cnot get angry\u201d that their community campaign to do something for renters is working. Labor senator Tim Ayres says the consequences of the Greens and Coalition voting to delay the bill will mean \u201c30,000 less homes\u201d. He refers to the Greens as \u201cTrotskyites student politicians\u201d and the Coalition as the \u201chard right\u201d So, yup. Things are getting personal. Voting yes to the voice will help close the gap Liberal MP Julian Leeser has welcomed the passage of the referendum legislation through the Senate: Today is an historic day with the constitutional alteration passing the parliament. Later this year, Australians will be able to vote at a referendum and complete our constitution. A successful yes vote will recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the constitution and create a voice to help close the gap. Despite being one of the most successful nations in the world, on too many measures, our Indigenous brothers and sisters are not sharing the same outcomes as other Australians: \u00b7 The life expectancy of an Indigenous Australian is eight years below that of other Australians. \u00b7 The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is estimated to be about nine times higher than their fellow Australians. \u00b7 One in five Indigenous households are living in accommodation that does not meet an acceptable standard. \u00b7 The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is almost two and half times that of other Australians, and \u00b7 Young Indigenous males are more likely to end up in jail, than attending a university. By writing yes we can help change this. New CSIRO chief revealed Prof Doug Hilton has been named the new chief executive of the CSIRO, Australia\u2019s national science agency. Hilton, a molecular and cellular biologist, will commence at the CSIRO on 29 September. He is currently the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. Hilton will replace Dr Larry Marshall, who will step down on 30 June after eight years in the top joband the agency\u2019s longest serving chief executive in the last five decades. Ed Husic, the minister for industry and science, said in a statement: Prof Hilton brings decades of experience to this role, which will no doubt prove invaluable to helping address some of Australia\u2019s greatest scientific challenges. Professor Hilton\u2019s research into blood cell production and communication has helped Australians live longer, healthier lives. Kathryn Fagg, chair of the CSIRO board, said: Beyond research, Doug has emphasised the importance of strong institutional cultures, and furthered diversity in science. A member of the Champion of Change Coalition and a board member of Australians Investing in Women, he has led initiatives to boost gender equality and diversity, and address better representation of women in senior roles in the Australian medical research sector. The debate to change the housing legislation debate is continuing, so we will come back to that when it goes to a vote. Labor calls Greens and Coalition the \u2018anti housing coalition\u2019 Labor senator Anthony Chisholm is accusing the Greens and Coalition of being the \u201canti housing coalition\u201d and takes aim at the Greens for \u201ca new low\u201d in \u201cpartnering up with the coalition who did nothing for 10 years\u201d. Chisholm said this delay \u2013 four months \u2013 if it goes through, would only hold up housing solutions even longer. Liberal senator accuses government of throwing billions around Anne Ruston, who one moment ago was saying the government could just spend the money on housing now if it was really serious about housing, has just accused the government of \u201cthrowing a couple of billion dollars around\u201d on the weekend (the $2bn social housing acceleration fund) without consultation. Where\u2019s the guarantee the money will go into housing, Liberal senator asks The Liberal senator Anne Ruston says the government is \u201cabsolutely hellbent\u201d on putting through a bill without a guarantee that any money will be going into housing: If you were really deadly serious, you could spend this money today. The government has said the $500m from the dividends from the fund will be a \u201cfloor, not a ceiling\u201d. The Coalition was originally against the bill because it said it would be inflationary. It is now against the bill because it says it won\u2019t deliver enough housing. The Labor senator Don Farrell says the Greens can \u201cvote today\u201d to improve housing supply. It is the same debate \u2013 this time over whether or not the bill should be voted on this week. Greens will reveal housing future fund decision at noon The Greens party room met on Monday morning, but party spokespeople would not comment on the motion circulated in Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s name before a scheduled press conference at noon. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, and housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, will reveal the party\u2019s decision at that press conference. The bill sets up a $10bn future fund to invest and pay out earnings of at least $500m a year to invest in social and affordable housing. Chandler-Mather has spent months attacking the future fund model as a form of \u201cgambling\u201d, forcing concessions from the government including guaranteeing the $500m annual disbursement as a minimum not maximum, and the $2bn of direct investment. Renters need to hear government cares about them Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says while the Greens welcome the $2bn social housing acceleration fund, there is still no commitment to help renters. She says that \u201cwe need a prime minister for all Australians\u201d whether you own a home, are in social housing or rent. Hanson-Young said that renters \u201cdesperately need to hear that this government cares about them\u201d but that all they have heard so far is that it \u201cis too difficult\u201d. Government wants housing fund debate tomorrow In the midst of all of that, the government will seek to amend the Greens motion to delay the housing Australia future fund vote from 16 October to tomorrow (the next sitting day). Lidia Thorpe interjection As the Senate president Sue Lines announced the vote, Lidia Thorpe interjected with something (the microphones did not pick it up) and her voice could be heard protesting above the applause. Senate watchers tell me Thorpe said: Another day in the colony. The chamber has divided. The yes vote wins (as expected and there is a lot of applause. A standing ovation from the gallery. Yes: 52 Noes: 19 Senate division begins The Senate chamber is now dividing on the bill. It will pass and with the absolute majority needed for bills which pertain to constitutional changes. (An absolute majority means half of the Senate, plus one. So at least 39. That is opposed to a simple majority which is just a majority of people in the chamber.) Onus to tell the truth Senator Murray Watt, as the minister representing Mark Dreyfus in the senate, is now wrapping up the debate, where he answers what was raised by opponents. He says while he respects people\u2019s right to vote no and oppose the voice, he thinks there is an onus on people to \u201ctell the truth\u201d. Malarndirri McCarthy urges respect on all sides of the debate McCarthy also pays tribute to the work of senator Pat Dodson, who is on leave receiving medical treatment. She finishes her speech saying: I am concerned, a little bit, when I hear about some of the commentary that goes on and I still urge all Australians to dig deep, to listen to the better side of yourself throughout this debate, and to keep it at a level that is respectful. I am mindful when we reflect on the marriage equality debate and the hurt, the deep hurt, that impacted a lot of those families throughout that whole debate, and I ask all Australians to ensure that we keep our discussions and debate at considerations as we walk this journey, this very sacred journey of our country, with the utmost respect for one another. That means all sides - all of us on the yes side, I urge you to be mindful of the commentary and the conversations that we have with the broader Australian public. All those on the no side, I ask you to do the same. It is only then can we find the better part of ourselves as a country, president, the better part of ourselves as Australians, as all Australians, but this is a critical moment in our country\u2019s history. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do, president. And it is time now to put this question to the Australian people. Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy says she is incredibly proud I stand here not only as a Senator for the Northern Territory, but also as a First Nations woman from Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria and say how incredibly proud I am, president, to be able to stand and speak for the voice and the importance of being able to go to a referendum and Say yes for our country. Yes for a better future. Yes for First Nations people to be able to make decisions in terms of advising the parliament and the executive, as to decisions made about them so they can have input into that. It is a very simple request, president, to be recognised in the Australian constitution and, yes, there are many schools of thoughts in terms of that constitution, but in terms of the symbolic nature of being able to be included in that constitution means a great deal to many First Nations people. In fact, this whole debate, we have seen with research polling across the country that majority of First Nations people want this to happen. Greens move to have housing Australia future fund debate postponed Just breaking into the voice third reading debate for a moment \u2013 we have seen a Greens motion asking for the housing Australia future fund legislation debate to be put off until 16 October. That doesn\u2019t mean that it will be. The Greens are seeing if there is support in the senate to put the legislation debate off until after the winter break to \u201callow time for national cabinet to progress reforms to strengthen renters\u2019 rights as advised by the prime ministers\u2019 press release of 28 April 2023\u201d. The rest of what Pauline Hanson is saying is conspiracy rubbish which you\u2019d expect that guy your weird aunt is marrying to post on facebook, instead of being said in the senate, but here we are. In case it needs to be explicitly stated, the voice to parliament will not create \u201ca black state\u201d in Australia. OK, Pauline Hanson is now essentially outlining the song plot line to \u201cwhat about me\u201d but in her own very unique way. The word \u2018racist\u2019 means nothing these days. I mean \u2026 it does. It means \u201cracist\u201d. Senator Pauline Hanson is now giving her view. You already know what it is. Lidia Thorpe finishes with: The prime minister of this country \u2013 a Labor prime minister has not even got the courage to come out and say that he wants a treaty. He is going straight for constitutional recognition to put us in there nice good little Aborigines with the parliament supremacy over us at all times. Well, well done. Well done. On the assimilation agenda. Which has the Greens backing. Which is why I left. This is a point in this country where the final nail in the coffin and I\u2019ll be voting no to this disastrous idea of giving us no power. Thorpe said if the bill gave any power she would have considered it, but can not support it. I can\u2019t support something that is just going to be considered as not very important in this place. We know how we operate in this place. It\u2019s hard enough to find time for a meeting. Who\u2019s going to have time to listen to the voice opinion. You don\u2019t have to turn up to get the advice. It\u2019s just advice and as a previous advisor to ministerial groups and women\u2019s ministerial advisory bodies I have done all of that. You\u2019re just a token advisor so happy assimilation day everybody. Thorpe calls for Indigenous Senate seats Lidia Thorpe says if the parliament was serious about recognition, Indigenous people would have Senate seats, like in New Zealand and a treaty. There is not one law in this country that has ever, ever, ever been good for us. Not one. And now we\u2019re meant to accept a powerless voice. It is truly assimilating our people. So we speak nicely as your little Indigenous Australians. It\u2019s what you want us to be right? You don\u2019t want us to speak our language. You don\u2019t want us to practice our culture. Only when you go to some festival and feel good about it. The only time you want to look at our culture when it suits you. When you want to hang a painting in your Senate office doesn\u2019t back up what you\u2019re actually doing. \u2018I\u2019m ashamed we\u2019re not standing here for a treaty\u2019 Lidia Thorpe: Well, I\u2019m ashamed. I\u2019m ashamed that we\u2019re not standing here for a treaty or for some truth to happen in this country. And that we follow a conservative regime. John Howard\u2019s regime. Labor! His position and the king\u2019s position is to wipe us out. We\u2019re a problem. We\u2019re certainly a problem to this law, which is a problem that needs to be fixed all the time. And use it just tinkering around the edges. You won\u2019t implement the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. You\u2019ve had ample time to do that in the last 32 years. You\u2019ve had ample time to implement the recommendations to the stolen generations. Like you are completely gammin. Fake. You\u2019re not genuine. You wave your flag around and deadly black earrings and feel real good about it. We\u2019re hearing all these beautiful, heartfelt stories about how this is going to fix our lives. It\u2019s going to solve everything. We can\u2019t even do anything until after this referendum. Lidia Thorpe goes on to reference her shirt, which says \u201cGammin\u201d and is asked to cover it up by Sue Lines. Thorpe does up her blazer as she speaks: Gammin as we know, is fake. A joke and that\u2019s what I think. A powerless voices to this place. We have fought over 200 years against colonisation. The constitution is an illegal document. It\u2019s illegal. The occupation in this country is illegal. You following the king. The king. We\u2019re all bound by the king. Now poor black fellas are begging for a seat at the table and all we get is become advisors. No power. \u2018I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s white guilt\u2019 Lidia Thorpe: I\u2018m here for five more years. I don\u2019t need no one\u2019s vote. I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s white guilt. And that\u2019s what this is about. It\u2019s appeasing the white guilt in this country by giving giving the poor little black fellas a powerless advisory body\u2026 They decide what it is. Lidia Thorpe says she will \u2018rattle the cages\u2019 Independent senator Thorpe opens with: Well happy assimilation day. Sovereignty has never been ceded. But for the first time in this country\u2019s history, people are starting to talk about sovereignty and what that actually means. To recognise First Peoples\u2019 sovereignty in this country will dissolve this colonial, violent institution that we\u2019re all in right now. That\u2019s why you want don\u2019t want to acknowledge sovereignty in the racist Australian constitution. That\u2019s why the Greens voted that down on the hypocrisy of climate. \u2026Yes, I\u2019m here to infiltrate it. To rattle the cages to destroy the white supremacy that is represented in this place. Senate president Sue Lines asks Thorpe to make her comments through the chair. Pocock says voice claims already \u2018bordering on misinformation\u2019 Independent ACT senator David Pocock gives a speech to \u201ccorrect\u201d some of what has been on the record: We\u2019ve heard much about the need to have a respectful conversation for it to be grounded in fact, and there was just a few things that are being said this morning that already bordering on misinformation, if not well into that territory. Senator Cash asserted that Australians have an equal say in this debate, we\u2019d like to point out that Australians who live in the territories only count for half their income for the total national vote. Look at that. The territories votes. The other assertion was that this is adding race to the constitution. Race is already in the constitution. This is about ensuring that First Nations people, Australia\u2019s first peoples, have a say on issues that affect them. And after 10 years, where we\u2019ve seen things not improve, it makes no sense to hear arguments to say well, we shouldn\u2019t change anything. Yes, if it isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t think so. But if it\u2019s broken, it requires to fix it. And this is an opportunity to fix it. He goes on to say this is not \u201cLabor\u2019s voice\u201d or the \u201cCanberra voice\u201d and says he will vote yes. There is applause from the gallery and president Sue Lines says no more applause. Australians being divided, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price tells Senate Country Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has given a speech. Nampijinpa Price will be voting no and has been one of the leaders of the no campaign: The goodwill of many non Indigenous Australians is being exploited by those who seek to profit in money, clout or power off the real problems being faced by marginalised Australians. This is a dangerous and costly proposal. It is legally risky and full of unknowns. It is exploitative. It is emotionally manipulative. But worst of all, from the day Mr Albanese put his word into the Australian people, the process of division was begun. We are being divided. We will be further divided throughout this campaign. And if the yes vote is successful. We will be divided, forever. I want to see Australia move forward as one not too divided. That\u2019s why I will be voting no. Again, there are no further rights being given to Indigenous people by the voice. It is one of the key criticisms of the voice from the sovereignty movement. There are multiple definitions of \u201cgammin\u201d which is Aboriginal-English slang, but essentially it boils down to meaning \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cjoker\u201d. The Senate president Sue Lines has asked for senator Lidia Thorpe to put a jacket on as \u201cslogans are not allowed\u201d in the chamber. Voice architects in Senate to see bill pass The public viewing chambers in the Senate are filled with Indigenous leaders, architects of the voice and Yes campaigners, including Tom Calma, Megan Davis, Pat Anderson and Thomas Mayo. Greens\u2019 First Nations spokesperson Dorinda Cox called Monday\u2019s passage of the bill \u201ca historic day\u201d. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe entered the chamber wearing a t-shirt reading \u201cgammin\u201d, a reference to her opposition to the voice. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney, attorney general Mark Dreyfus and energy minister Chris Bowen, all members of the lower house, are sitting in the chamber to watch the vote officially pass. They\u2019re alongside Indigenous MPs Marion Scrymgour and Gordon Reid. Voice \u2018first important step\u2019 towards Uluru statement, says Dorinda Cox Greens senator Dorinda Cox is now also speaking on the third reading. The Greens are in support of the referendum, so Cox\u2019s speech is in favour of the yes campaign: Our sovereignty has in fact never been ceded. My sovereignty is my birthright to care for this country, to protect this country and to be a knowledge holder and to pass those traditional knowledges on to the next generation. These chains of the constitution does not impact our sovereignty, my sovereignty. I would not be standing\u2026 Independent senator Lidia Thorpe interjects and Cox asks if Thorpe would like to finish her speech. (Thorpe has interjected a few times in Cox\u2019s speech. The senate president Sue Lines warns Thorpe and Cox continues). Cox: \u2026 We had discussions with the referendum working group, the attorney general, Minister for Indigenous Affairs who joins us here today and many others and I want to thank them for their respect of our concerns and for taking the time to hear us and address these concerns. Ceding our sovereignty is something that I and I assume all First Nations people in this place would not want to do. The Australian Greens remain committed to the full implementation of the Uluru statement from the heart, truth, treaty and voice. The referendum is the first important step. And I continue to push the government for the establishment of the Makarrata commission to oversee that truth telling and treaty making my message to all Australians is on referendum die, I will in fact be voting yes to unite Australia and bringing us together for what I see to be a decade challenge. Cash claims voice opens up \u2018legal can of worms\u2019 Michaelia Cash is using this opportunity to re-litigate issues which have already been settled: Ultimately, despite what the government says it is the high court of Australia, who will determine what the right to make representations actually means a vital question that we did pursue the committee stage, and there is still no adequate answers to that. What we do we know is that legal experts don\u2019t agree. And the legal experts cannot be sure how any high court will interpret such a constitutional change. Again, what are we doing here? We are opening up a legal can of worms. The proposed model, as we know it is not just to the parliament, it\u2019s to all areas of executive government. It gives an unlimited scope \u2026 or, in the words of a constitutional law professor, from submarines to parking tickets. And what does then that mean for the Australian people and for the government that they know, will there is a considerable risk of delay to government decision making. Again, this is not correct. Most legal opinion is that people may try to challenge the voice in the high court, but that doesn\u2019t mean the high court will pick up the challenges. Because the parliament remains the decision maker. What the parliament decides, it can also un-decide. It remains in control of its own destiny. The parliament decides whether or not to take on the recommendations from the voice. The voice can not overrule the parliament. This has been an argument from the Coalition since it openly decided to not support the voice, but it hasn\u2019t been backed up by the facts. As telegraphed, shadow attorney-general Michaelia Cash has decided to take up the opportunity for a rare third reading speech. Cash says the majority of the coalition \u201cwill vote to pass this bill because we believe them in the people of this nation and their right to have a say on this issue\u201d. But she says they do not agree with the voice which she says will \u201cdestroy one of our most fundamental values, equality of citizenship\u201d. That is not true. There is no additional benefits of citizenship Indigenous people will receive if the voice passes the referendum. There are already committees which examine bills and give recommendations, which the parliament can accept or not accept. That is standard. The bells have just finished ringing \u2013 the parliament session has begun and all eyes are on the senate, where the third reading of the referendum legislation will be held. Josh Butler and I will keep you up to date on that. Climate protests at major coal ports There are climate protests occurring at some of Australia\u2019s major coal port terminals, as AAP reports: A climate protester has suspended herself from a rail bridge at the Newcastle coal ports, blocking trains, as coordinated protests were mounted at ports in Melbourne and Brisbane. The woman is livestreaming her solitary protest online and police are on site. She said on Monday morning as she swung several hundred metres above the ground from the Kooragang rail bridge that the action was in response to Australia\u2019s lack of action on climate change. In Brisbane a Blockade Australia protestor caused major disruption on the Port of Brisbane Motorway at Lytton on Monday morning, sitting atop a bamboo pole. Blockade Australia said in a statement the protests were part of a \u201ccoordinated mobilisation in response to Australia\u2019s facilitation of the climate and ecological crisis, and its active blocking of impactful action towards a safe climate\u201d. NSW premier Chris Minns told 2GB while people have the right to demonstrate, protests in precarious sites put emergency service personnel at risk: Emergency service workers, particularly the police, are put in extreme danger as a result of having to go and remove people from dangerous situations. It\u2019s one of the reasons we supported the previous government\u2019s protest laws which are going to remain in place. Usually in the third reading of a bill there aren\u2019t any more speeches \u2013 that is what the second reading is for. So the minister does the third reading of the bill, the chamber divides and votes and its done. But this time around, for the referendum legislation, it looks like the shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash will seek the call to make a rare third reading speech. Which Malarndirri McCarthy will respond to. And THEN the Senate will divide for the final vote. There has to be an absolute majority for the bill to pass because it is dealing with altering the constitution \u2013 that will happen, so most Coalition senators will vote for the bill, even though they oppose the referendum. Some will have to vote no so they can meet the requirements to have input into the no pamphlet which will be mailed out along with the yes pamphlet to every voter. Universities to take Australia-Indie relationship to \u2018next level\u2019 University ties between India and Australia are continuing to tighten with the chief executive of Universities Australia to deliver a keynote address alongside Indian education minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Pune. Catriona Jackson\u2019s visit to the the 2023 Universities 20 Conference in India coincides with the G20 Education Working Group and education ministers meeting, attended by university leaders from all G20 countries. Jackson will use her speech to outline how universities can take Australia and India\u2019s relationship \u201cto the next level\u201d, following a prime ministerial delegation to India in March: We are entering a golden era in our relationship with India and education is key to maximising the opportunities before us. India is aiming to educate 500 million people by 2035. Australia\u2019s universities are here to help India realise its ... ambition \u2013 for our mutual benefit.\u201d The prime minister last month signed a sweeping new migration and mobility partnership allowing Indian students to arrive without caps on five-year student visas, extended working provisions and three-month visitor visa allowances. It comes amid rising concern over fraudulent visas allowing students to switch from public universities to private providers or \u2018ghost collages\u2019 after arriving in Australia. \u2018Are you not going to accept his vote, Barnaby?\u2019 Barnaby Joyce then tries to make something out of what Tanya Plibersek said. But then he Barnaby Joyces it. Joyce: Well, look, I agree with everything Tanya said in the second part there. This building should be a safe place to work, without a shadow of a doubt, and \u2013 but I didn\u2019t quite get the part where they\u2019re going to fight for his vote, that one was a little bit confusing. So, you know, you can\u2019t sort of have two positions, one being the high\u2011ground, but anyway, you know, that\u2019s something for the Labor Party\u2026 Plibersek: Are you not going to accept his vote, Barnaby? Joyce: That\u2019s something for the Labor Party\u2026 Plibersek: Are you not going to accept his vote? Joyce: That\u2019s something for the Labor Party to explain at the time. No, I \u2011 it\u2019s\u2026 Plibersek: Well, are you going to accept his vote, Barnaby? Joyce: It\u2019s an unfortunate circumstances, I look forward to, you know, the\u2026 Plibersek: So, you\u2019re not going to accept his vote? Joyce: \u2026 I\u2019ll leave it up to the Senate \u2011 I\u2019ll leave it up to the Senate as to what their views are in regards his vote, the Senate leadership, and I\u2019ll leave it up to the leadership of our party to determine exactly where that resides, and also the negotiations that may or may not happen between senators and the leadership of the government; that\u2019s something for the government to decide as to how deep those negotiations go. There will be questions for you in the future. (Again, it is not the government or the opposition who decides whether or not a vote is accepted or not. Every elected MP has the right to vote and there is no mechanism to not accept it. It gets recorded as yes or no and that\u2019s it.) Will the government accept David Van\u2019s vote? Over on the Seven Network and Tanya Plibersek continued her sisyphean task of \u201cdebating\u201d Barnaby Joyce. First up was the question of whether or not the government would accept the vote of David Van. Peter Dutton expelled Van from the Liberal party room after former senator Amanda Stoker raised allegations of \u201cinappropriate touching\u201d against him, following a statement Lidia Thorpe gave to the senate. Van has denied all the allegations against him. He quit the Liberal party on Saturday and said he was \u201cdeeply distressed and hurt that I have not been afforded procedural fairness in relation to these claims\u201d. Van will now sit on the crossbench as an independent senator (where Thorpe also sits). There is always the question of whether or not a government will \u2018accept\u2019 the vote of an MP but it is a ridiculous premise because it is not for governments or oppositions to decide. An MP represents an electorate \u2013 in this case the state of Victoria \u2013 and governments can\u2019t not accept his vote. Van will vote as he pleases on legislation in the senate and that will be recorded on the hansard. Governments can choose who they negotiate on bills with, but that is a completely different question. Plibersek says: We\u2019ll have to of course, he\u2019ll have to vote yes or no on legislation, and of course we\u2019d prefer him to vote yes for government legislation than to vote no. But once again, I think we\u2019re kind of missing the point here. We\u2019re all talking about whether David Van is going to resign or stay in the Parliament, and really, once again, the point here is that we need to make sure that every workplace is safe, that every workplace has processes in place if people want to make complaints about safety at their workplace, sexual harassment, or even sexual assault, that they\u2019ve got somewhere to go for it to be properly dealt with and properly investigated. To reiterate \u2013 Van has denied all allegations against him. Voice vote tops parliamentary agenda The parliament will sit at 10am today. The Senate will immediately get about the business of passing the referendum legislation. Josh Butler will be in the chamber for that moment and will keep you updated on that. There are a lot of voice supporters in town for the moment \u2013 expect there to be some emotion when the final vote goes through. And then \u2013 it up to the campaigns. Chalmers to herald record job growth Treasurer Jim Chalmers will no doubt take a dixer on this today \u2013 the Albanese government has \u201chad the strongest job growth in the first year of any new government on record\u201d. Between May 2022 and May 2023, more than 465,000 jobs were created. Chalmers\u2019 office says this is \u201cmore than six times the number of new jobs created in the first year of the Abbott and Howard governments\u201d. Which it is, but also \u2013 these are largely inherited conditions. The government has done more to support wage growth and the like, but the pandemic, closed borders, and a very tight labour market were part of the package. (So I can see why he wants to take the W, just keep in mind the context.) Among the records: The number of Australians with a job is now more than 14 million for the very first time. Australia\u2019s participation rate is 66.9% \u2013 the highest on record, primarily driven by record high participation for women (62.7%). The share of women in work is at a record high \u2013 with the employment to population ration for women at 60.5%. Victorian Liberals name byelection candidate There is the Fadden byelection coming up, but there is also a state byelection in Victoria, as AAP reports: A beaten Victorian election candidate has received a second chance as the Liberals\u2019 pick for a crucial state by-election in Melbourne\u2019s north-east. Nicole Ta-Ei Werner, who failed to regain the marginal seat of Box Hill for the Liberals in November, won preselection for the Warrandyte byelection in a vote of more than 100 party members at a Chirnside Park golf club on Sunday. The charity manager and former pastor beat out 22-year-old law student Antonietta Di Cosmo and Institute of Public Affairs senior fellow John Roskam in the final two rounds of voting. If successful, Ms Werner would become the 10th woman in the state Liberals\u2019 30-member party room following outspoken MP Moira Deeming\u2019s expulsion after she participated in an anti-trans rights rally attended by neo-Nazis. The upcoming by-election was triggered by long-serving Warrandyte MP Ryan Smith\u2019s sudden decision to quit politics early next month. Held by the Liberals on a 4.2% margin, it could prove a hurdle for opposition leader John Pesutto amid mounting internal divisions. Labor is yet to announce whether it will contest the poll, which is expected to be held some time in August or September. It will be the first Victorian state by-election in more than five years, and Labor hasn\u2019t won one since taking the seat of Benalla from the Nationals in 2000. Back to the political positions on the voice and Nationals leader David Littleproud was asked about the no pamphlet which will be sent to voters, along with the yes pamphlet, and what he would like to see in there. The pamphlet is written by politicians who support either side. It is not fact checked \u2013the MPs can choose what goes in there. When it comes to the \u2018no\u2019 side, there has already been some inflammatory claims made by politicians, which are not correct, including Peter Dutton\u2019s claim that the voice would \u201cre-racialise\u201d Australia. Littleproud said he would not support that language in the pamphlet. No. I\u2019ve made that very clear, I don\u2019t support those sort of words. I\u2019m not prepared to put my weight behind those words,\u201d he said. Littleproud is also against Pauline Hanson\u2019s wishes to include that the the voice is a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to establish an \u201cAboriginal state within the nation\u201d (I hope it does not have to be said, but just in case \u2013 that claim is absolute bollocks). There will be about 30 politicians having input on the no pamphlet and Littleproud said the majority of those will be the ones who set the tone (the majority is the Coalition) but he doesn\u2019t support Hanson\u2019s claim either: I\u2019m not the final arbiter of this, but I don\u2019t support those set of words \u2013 I\u2019ll make that very clear... I don\u2019t think that would advance a mature discussion. \u2018Everyone is absolutely shocked at the allegations,\u2019 Burney says Asked about independent senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s comments last week that her allegations against David Van (which he denies) were not taken seriously until a white woman (Amanda Stoker) \u201cstood up and said, \u2018Yeah, this happened to me too\u2019\u201d (which Van says he has no recollection of), Linda Burney turns to the parliament at large. The question was did Burney think Thorpe was right and Burney says: I think everyone is absolutely shocked at the allegations that were made last week. And you know, workplaces should be a safe, safe place. I think there has been some very good work done. Particularly with the leadership of Katy Gallagher and the Kate Jenkins report. The Labor caucus is now 50% women and no one should have to feel unsafe in the workplace. No. It is unacceptable. And it is something that obviously has shocked this parliament. Campaigning to begin in earnest \u201cI\u2019m feeling quite emotional,\u201d Linda Burney says. Once the referendum legislation passes about 10am AEST, the yes (and no) campaigns will begin in earnest. Burney: Then we will see the campaigns get into full swing. Remember we have several months out from the the actual referendum and why this is so, so important is that it is about recognition, something that you and I can both share of 65,000 years of history and culture and puts in place a permanent voice that will be able to advise government on issues that affect Aboriginal people. Voice will have \u2018enormous moral authority\u2019, Burney says The minister for Indigenous Australians is now speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast. Linda Burney is being pushed on what power the voice would have: The power very much lays within lays within the principles. It has an enormous moral authority to start with. And that\u2019s very, very important. But think about the principles that have been articulated that the voice will be will be built around and it will be independent and will give independent advice not just to the parliament, but also to the government. It will be chosen by local people. It will be accountable, it will be balanced. It will be community-led, and importantly, it will be accountable and work along existing traditional structures and organisations that are in place now. So in that sense, it brings about an enormous change in the sense of the parliament will have a permanent body protected by the constitution, that it can get advice from on the streets as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. \u2018We continue to repeat the mistakes of the past,\u2019 Littleproud says Nationals leader David Littleproud is speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast about the Nationals\u2019 objection to the voice. Littleproud says it is local bodies that are needed, not a national voice. (Local bodies would feed into the voice, which has been outlined several times). Littleproud says this is the only way to actually start closing the gap. Asked by Hamish Macdonald why the Coalition didn\u2019t do this in the 10 years it was in power, Littleproud says: Well, we failed. You got to be, Hamish \u2026 I\u2019m not afraid to put my hand up and say that governments of all persuasions of the past have failed on this and this is where we continue to repeat the mistakes of the past. This is about making sure the empowerment of local communities at a local level about getting bureaucrats out of Canberra and putting them around town halls and campfires and listening to those elders. Junk food advertising targeted Independent MP Dr Sophie Scamps will introduce a private member\u2019s bill to ban junk food advertising. Scamps says: The Healthy Kids Advertising Bill 2023 (the Bill) aims to protect children from junk food marketing by removing ads from TV and radio between the hours of 6am and 930pm. The Bill would also place an outright ban on junk food marketing on social media and other online environments. Under the regulations, substantial fines would be imposed on broadcasters, internet service providers, and food companies that fail to adhere to the guidelines. That comes after Scamps\u2019 crossbench colleague Zoe Daniel introduced a private member\u2019s bill to ban gambling advertising. Scamps: Approximately 40 countries around the world, including the UK, Ireland, Chile, Norway, Mexico, Thailand, and South Korea, already have or are planning to regulate junk food advertising. I want to see Australia join this list. And she thinks she might have some government support for the bill: I\u2019ve been heartened by conversations I\u2019ve had with members of the Albanese government as well as public comments made by the Communications Minister and believe there is genuine political will to address this issue. Protecting our children from obesity and a potential future of chronic disease is something all sides of politics can get behind. Brunei\u2019s leader visits Anthony Albanese will meet the Sultan of Brunei, His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkia this evening. Climate change, \u201cstrategic defence collaboration\u201d and food security for the region are on the agenda, which means Aukus will be too. The sultan\u2019s visit will continue until Wednesday. Welcome to the final sitting before the winter break. It being the last four days the government can pass anything for more than a month puts a sense of urgency over the proceedings as all the parties strive to make their final points ahead of some time off. The politics won\u2019t stop of course \u2013 it never does \u2013 but it will slow with most MPs planning on taking a week or two of leave over the parliamentary break. Anthony Albanese will head to Lithuania (labas!) next month for the Nato summit and when it comes to defence and foreign policy, the Coalition is back to being in lockstep, so you won\u2019t find too many differences there. Which means this week is it for the political parties to set out their agendas and points of differences while voters are (mostly) still paying attention. After leading an abhorrent week last week, which sent the parliament backwards in how it addresses allegations of sexual harassment and assault, the Coalition is looking to reset (again) as it deals with the fallout of the allegations against David Van. Van has vehemently denied the allegations raised against him and quit the Liberal party, saying he is devastated action was taken without allowing him due process. Peter Dutton had expelled Van from the party room and the Victorian Liberals had withdrawn organisational support in the wake of allegations being raised against the senator. Van will be absent from the parliament this week, with a spokesperson confirming yesterday he had requested leave. Moving to policy and the referendum legislation will pass the Senate today with the third reading debate scheduled. That comes after the Senate sat until four in the morning on Thursday to get through the speeches. The referendum campaigns will begin in earnest from next week with the bill\u2019s passage through the parliament and the referendum itself is thought to be planned for sometime in October. Meanwhile the other big fight remains the housing Australia future fund, with the Greens making a final push to have the government do something for renters to secure their crucial support. The housing peaks have thanked the crossbench for making changes to the bill so far and for securing more help to address the housing crisis but they have come together to ask for the bill to now be passed. The government announced a further $2bn to accelerate social housing, with the money to begin flowing in the next fortnight. That can be used to refurbish vacant housing stock as well as expand existing projects to try to get more houses made available faster. The Greens still want a rent freeze but that\u2019s one area the government has not budged on. It\u2019ll all play out this week. You\u2019ll have Paul Karp and Josh Butler in Canberra with Amy Remeikis on the blog. It\u2019s a two-coffee morning so far. That will change. Probably very soon. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9472b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/keir-starmer-no-resignation-honours-boris-johnson-partygate", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Keir Starmer: I won\u2019t hand out resignation honours if I become PM", "lead": "Labour leader says Sunak \u2018waved through\u2019 Boris Johnson\u2019s honours and challenges PM to vote on privileges committee report", "author": "Peter Walker Deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:34:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547625", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bf640245e7754c6668d71b089faa0cd131c83889/0_355_7227_4336/500.jpg", "body": "Keir Starmer has ruled out ever producing a resignation honours list, as he urged Rishi Sunak to \u201cshow leadership\u201d by attending and voting in Monday\u2019s debate about the report that found Boris Johnson had misled parliament. Speaking in Edinburgh on Monday morning before a speech on energy, the Labour leader accused the UK prime minister of weakness for waving through Johnson\u2019s long and increasingly controversial resignation honours list. Among those on the list were two people who attended a party held by London Conservatives during lockdown in December 2020, which is being reinvestigated by police after footage emerged of staff drinking alcohol and dancing. The party was organised by the campaign team of the unsuccessful London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, who was made a peer by Boris Johnson in his recent resignation honours list. Bailey had left the gathering before the video was filmed. The Tory aide Ben Mallett, awarded an OBE on the list, is seen in the video. Asked by BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether he would hand out resignation honours, Starmer said: \u201cNo. There are other opportunities.\u201d He added: \u201cTony Blair didn\u2019t have a resignation list. It\u2019s very hard to justify \u2026 There are other avenues for that and I think it\u2019s easier to be clean about this and simply say, no, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Starmer said he did not believe there was a way to rescind the awards to Bailey and Mallett: \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is. I certainly don\u2019t think they should be getting honours. And I think that the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, should have said no. But he didn\u2019t \u2013 he waved it through.\u201d He did, however, say he would intervene as prime minister if he objected to resignation honours nominated by Sunak. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think what Rishi Sunak did was wrong. Everybody knew the privileges committee was about to report on the behaviour of the former prime minister. \u201cWhy on earth didn\u2019t Rishi Sunak take the provisional list of Boris Johnson and say, \u2018Thank you very much, I will put that on one side, and I\u2019ll come to it and look at it when I know the findings of the privileges committee \u2026 If, for example, the privileges committee says you lied to parliament, then I\u2019m not going to put your list through.\u2019\u201d Speaking earlier to BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme, Starmer said he would return to parliament in time for the debate and vote on the privileges committee report, which found Johnson repeatedly misled MPs, and called on Sunak to also attend. \u201cI want to see the prime minister there when I arrive back in parliament, because he has to show leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat his predecessor got up to was unacceptable. The prime minister wants to lead. So he has to come to parliament and vote in this debate this afternoon to show where he stands on this issue.\u201d Many Conservative MPs and ministers are either expected to stay away from the debate, or else not push it to a vote, amid competing pressures to distance themselves from Johnson\u2019s behaviour but not anger Johnson supporters among Tory members. Speaking on Sunday, the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, said he would abstain as he believed the committee\u2019s recommendation that Johnson be suspended for 90 days was \u201cnot merited\u201d. The suspension is moot because Johnson resigned from parliament after learning the recommended punishment. However, the vote will ask MPs to endorse whether he should be barred from having the parliamentary pass normally given to former MPs."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9472c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/19/astrazeneca-china-spin-off", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "AstraZeneca considers spinning off its China business ", "lead": "UK\u2019s largest stock-market-listed firm weighs up Hong Kong or Shanghai listing to shield it from geopolitical tensions", "author": "Alex Lawson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:24:54", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547642", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/253ff2cd90c5cf1d1f2554c52dac5c14e9ba3c05/0_127_4945_2966/500.jpg", "body": "AstraZeneca is considering spinning off its business in China and listing it in Hong Kong or Shanghai to shield the multinational drugmaker from geopolitical tensions.

The spin-out would mean Astra separates its division in China into a new legal entity and lists it on a stock market in Asia while retaining control of the business.

Blinken was greeted by China\u2019s top diplomat on Monday, although it is unclear whether he will meet President Xi Jinping during the first visit by a US secretary of state to China in five years.

The prime minister said the government should \u201cstick to the plan\u201d to halve inflation in its attempts to tackle the cost of living crisis, despite growing pressure on the Conservatives as households across the country face a surge in borrowing costs. Mortgage rates have soared in recent weeks as the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to cut stubbornly high inflation have fed through into lending deals. City investors widely expect the central bank to announce its 13th consecutive rate increase on Thursday this week in response to persistently high inflation. Threadneedle Street is expected to raise its key base rate by at least a quarter point from the current level of 4.5%, extending its most aggressive round of interest rate increases in decades since lifting it from 0.1% in December 2021. TSB became the latest high street bank on Monday to pull their cheapest mortgage deals, as high street lenders reacted to the prospect of higher Bank of England base rates by pushing up the cost of new home loans to the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. The average rate on a two-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.01% on Monday \u2013 the highest since 1 December \u2013 from 5.98% on Friday. The average five-year deal rose to 5.67% from 5.62%. The government has faced calls to help homeowners as more than 2.4m fixed-rate deals are due to expire by the end of 2024, leaving households with the prospect of a sharp increase in rates before the next election. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Sunak said: \u201cI know the anxiety people will have about the mortgage rates, that is why the first priority I set out at the beginning of the year was to halve inflation because that is the best and most important way that we can keep costs and interest rates down for people. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a clear plan to do that, it is delivering, we need to stick to the plan. But there is also support available for people. We have the mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers and we have the support for mortgage interest scheme which is there to help people as well.\u201d UK inflation is 8.7%, well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. The consumer champion Martin Lewis said on Monday he warned the government last autumn that a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d of higher mortgage costs was facing millions of households this summer. He tweetedL \u201cThey can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned! We needed to prepare in case it rates rocketed \u2013 waiting for it to happen would be too late. Yet now, the timebomb has exploded and we\u2019re scrambling about what to do.\u201d On Sunday, the cabinet minister Michael Gove had raised hopes that the Treasury may intervene to help homeowners, saying help for mortgage-holders was \u201cunder review\u201d. However, Sunak\u2019s comments suggest no extra help is planned. Keir Starmer has also refused to pledge extra specific support for mortgage-holders should the party gain power. Asked whether Labour would offer support, he said the party would tighten up the windfall tax on oil and gas companies to yield more money to help reduce energy bills. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be a direct mortgage payment, but it would help people with their bills,\u201d the Labour leader told Sky News. The average two-year fixed rate on a buy-to-let mortgage increased from 6.21% on Friday to 6.30% today, Moneyfacts said. The number of buy-to-let mortgage products on the market has fallen, to 2,515 on Monday from 2,589 on Friday. Separately, Rightmove said on Monday that rising mortgage rates had brought forward the usual summer slowdown in the housing market. Asking prices for British homes fell in June for the first time in six years, according to the property website. Average new seller asking prices slipped by \u00a382 this month to \u00a3372,812 \u2013 the first monthly drop in new asking prices this year, and the first at this time of year since 2017. Against last year, prices were up 1.1%. Riz Malik, the founder and director of broker R3 Mortgages, said: \u201cWe urgently need a cross-party mortgage taskforce to find potential solutions to this ticking timebomb. This should [comprise] economists, lenders and other stakeholders who are actively involved in the mortgage market.

The Albanese government still has a difficult road ahead determining the level of spending and donation caps, with warnings from the crossbench not to block political newcomers. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The joint standing committee on electoral matters interim report on the 2022 election recommended lowering the disclosure threshold for donations to $1,000 and real-time disclosure, two policies Labor promised before the election. The special minister of state, Don Farrell, told ABC News that these two measures were \u201ckey to transparency\u201d, suggesting that these and caps on donations and spending \u201care perfectly capable of being dealt with in our first term\u201d. In July 2022, Guardian Australia revealed that the Albanese government intended to legislate spending caps and truth-in-political advertising, two reforms that were backed by the committee, chaired by Labor MP Kate Thwaites. But the committee sidestepped difficult questions about the amount of the cap on donations and spending. Instead, it said they should be \u201cbased at a level that is consistent with objectives including: reducing the potential for big money to have undue influence on elections, increasing transparency, recognising the additional hurdles to entry faced by independents or new entrants, and maintaining the implied right of freedom of political communication, as well as participation in elections\u201d. The government should also consider whether the caps would apply \u201cto all parties, candidates, and associated entities \u2026 [be] set on a per annum basis, [be] aggregated across candidates and parties, and [provide] for an appropriate exclusion for party membership fees, subscriptions, levies and affiliation fees\u201d. It recommended that \u201cdonation caps and expenditure caps apply to third parties and associated entities\u201d. The inquiry also called for \u201ca new system of increased public funding for parties and candidates, recognising the impact changes a reformed system will have on private funding in elections\u201d. Currently, federal electoral law only bans advertising and statements that mislead voters about the process of voting, with no laws prohibiting other false statements. The committee proposed truth-in-political advertising laws, with a new division within the Australian Electoral Commission to administer them. Tabling the report, Thwaites told the lower house that voters had to be \u201cconfident that our political system and our politicians are accessible to all and not just to those capable of making very large donations\u201d. Liberal MP, James Stevens, said the opposition was \u201cconcerned\u201d that the reforms amount to \u201cgerrymandering a financial benefit to the one union movement\u201d and the Labor party, and vowed to resist it \u201ctooth and nail\u201d. In a dissenting report, the Coalition members said they oppose spending and donation caps, warning that a spending cap would \u201crig an expenditure system\u201d in Labor\u2019s favour, due to the support of affiliated trade unions. The Coalition members called for the AEC to gain powers to judge that groups of independent candidates are in fact political parties, claiming that teal independents are \u201cwrong\u201d to claim they are not a party. Despite pushback from the Liberal party, the government could seek to legislate the reforms with Greens and crossbench support, including senator Pocock, who provided qualified support for political donation and spending caps. The Climate 200 fundraising body which supported Pocock and teal independent MPs has raised concerns that spending caps could disadvantage political aspirants who don\u2019t enjoy advantages of incumbency. The independent MP, Kate Chaney, who agreed with the majority report, said that the \u201cdevil will be in the detail\u201d in determining the level of caps, warning they should not become a \u201cbarrier to entry\u201d. In her additional comments, Chaney said donations caps should be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than state caps, and donations from related companies and associated entities must be aggregated. Pocock backed those principles, warning that \u201cbadly designed spending caps will entrench advantages of incumbency and the existence of party machinery\u201d. In his additional comments, Pocock called to \u201cincrease the baseline level of representation for the ACT and NT in the Senate to as close to half the representation of states as possible\u201d, a move which would increase the number of senators for each territory from two to six."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9472f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/warren-entsch-denies-he-helped-lnp-donor-get-pfizer-vaccine-during-supply-crisis", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Warren Entsch denies he helped LNP donor get Pfizer vaccine during supply crisis", "lead": "Allegation raised in parliament that MP arranged for property developer Alex Sekler to travel to Torres Strait for Covid jab referred to state corruption watchdog", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:09:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547693", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/83efaad5bc0fa5e23c24058a8f60e1b8e90a2d60/0_0_3917_2351/500.jpg", "body": "Queensland\u2019s corruption watchdog will consider whether to investigate allegations raised in parliament that Liberal National Party MP Warren Entsch helped a political donor get a Covid vaccine in the middle of the pandemic when doses were in short supply.

He denied \u201call allegations of wrongdoings or inappropriate actions\u201d. In question time on Monday, the federal health minister, Mark Butler, was asked whether he was aware of anyone getting preferential access to vaccines. In response, Butler referred to reports in the Australian that named Alex Sekler, a Queensland property developer. Butler told parliament there was understandable concern over reports that Entsch arranged for \u201ca local property developer, aged in his 60s, to travel to Thursday Island, to receive a Pfizer dose in that very month of July\u201d, in 2021 when Australia was short of doses. According to donor reports, Sekler\u2019s company Liral Holdings donated $304,000 to the LNP in 2021-22 and he personally donated $13,000 in 2019.

Arturo, a longstanding Argentinian exile, is still coming to terms with the terrible things he saw during the days of the junta. Sarah, an architect and soon-to-be-grandmother, is struggling with her Christian faith and the consequences of a broken friendship. Fred, who works for HM Revenue and Customs, fears he may be about to lose his job, the victim of a cover-up over a company tax evasion. But in Oscar Zarate\u2019s hefty and involving new graphic novel, it isn\u2019t their worries that bond this trio so much as their newfound enthusiasm for the 18th-century watercolourist Thomas Girtin. Over dinner at one another\u2019s houses, they\u2019re soon talking of little else. Such passion may be traced back originally to Fred, for it was he who first found himself spellbound by Girtin\u2019s uncommon talent, beguiled by how relatively little is known about the artist, and frustrated that so much of his work is hidden from public view; his enthusiasm was catching. Girtin, a friend and rival of J M W Turner, died in 1802 at the aged of just 27, and there are those who believe that had he grown old, he would have become the greater artist of the two, a conviction Turner may have shared. \u201cHad poor Tom lived, I would have starved,\u201d Turner is supposed to have said after Girtin\u2019s untimely death (the result, probably, of an asthma attack). Turner is known particularly to have admired Girtin\u2019s exquisite and widely celebrated The White House at Chelsea (1800), a picture now in the collection of Tate Britain, where it can be seen only by appointment. Zarate\u2019s graphic novel has two time frames. In the first, we follow the three friends as they attend to the various shadows in their lives, and pursue their new interest in Girtin; here are London pubs, London bus queues, and many late nights spent in the blue glow of a laptop. In the second, we travel back in time to revolutionary Europe, when the young Girtin, his hair cut as outrageously short as Danton\u2019s, was leading his own insurgence, hellbent on finding an artistic language that would capture nature as it really was. Zarate\u2019s drawings in both realms are intensely atmospheric, but it\u2019s in the candlelight and sepia shades of the 18th century that he\u2019s at his best, not least because he knows his limitations. Rather than trying and failing to play the copyist, he has chosen simply to reproduce several of Girtin\u2019s greatest paintings, sometimes on double pages that fold outwards, almost as if this were a sketch book. The result is deeply satisfying and, at moments, spectacular. If this is a story about the power of art and the role it can play in enriching everyday lives, it\u2019s also a pretty nimble biography \u2013 and if it leaves you wanting to know more, you\u2019ll find your starting point here, too. The novel comes with an enlightening afterword by Dr Greg Smith, a senior research fellow at the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and the man responsible for the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Girtin\u2019s work that was finally published online last year.

HM Revenue and Customs has announced that taxpayers now have until April 2025 to fill in gaps in their national insurance so they can get the full state pension \u2013 a boost that will be particularly welcomed by women who took time out to raise a family, carers, and those who have worked abroad. Under the scheme, someone investing just over \u00a38,000 could end up seeing their state pension payments increase by more than \u00a360,000 over their retirement. But anyone thinking of filling their gap years has been warned to do their research so that they know they are making the right decision. Plugging the gaps In order to qualify for a full new state pension, which is \u00a3203.85 a week, you typically need to have a 35-year history of paying national insurance contributions. However, many people have gaps in their record, which means they will not get the full amount. This could be someone who takes time off in their career to look after children, or members of their family, or who lived abroad for some time. Under the rules, you can pay extra to fill in gaps, but this usually only extends to the previous six years. But under the government extension scheme, you can fill them in for any year from 2006. This opportunity was due to end next month, but HMRC has announced \u2013 amid claims of lengthy delays in the system \u2013 that taxpayers have until April 2025 to take advantage of the scheme. But it only applies to people who have reached state pension age after 5 April 2016. To do this, you need to pay voluntary class 3 NI contributions of \u00a315.85 a week, or \u00a3824.20 a year. This one-off payment can add up to one-35th of the full rate to your eventual state pension. A boost that is worth \u00a35.82 a week, or \u00a3302.86 a year. Steve Webb, former pensions minister who is now a partner at the actuarial business LCP, says that in the case of someone who wanted to top up 10 years of contributions, they would have to give \u00a38,242 (10 lots of \u00a3824.20) to the taxman. And, for that, they would get an annual boost of \u00a33,028 \u2013 or just over \u00a360,000 over a 20-year retirement. Breathing room The substantial extension was announced last week, with HMRC saying tens of thousands of people had already chosen to make additional contributions. Victoria Atkins, financial secretary to the Treasury, says it will allow people to take some time to decide whether it is right for them, and also to spread the costs. The shift has been broadly welcomed by the financial services industry, with many referring to reported problems with processing existing requests. Alice Haine of Bestinvest says: \u201cThe good news is that Britons with gaps in their national insurance record no longer need to panic about running out of time to make up a gap and receive the full pension income they are entitled to. \u201cBuying back missed years is a great way to bolster retirement income, with this window of opportunity to backdate contributions all the way to 2006 is something not to be ignored.\u201d Jon Greer of wealth management company Quilter says that about 193,000 people a year make the top-ups. \u201cThis will hopefully help avoid any further logjams for the government, and more people can take advantage of what can be a very valuable bit of retirement planning. \u201cUltimately, this represents a golden opportunity, and people should not squander it.\u201d Is it right for you? That the scheme is in place and extended does not necessarily mean it is right for everyone. Webb says it is important for people to talk through their options with the Department for Work and Pensions. \u201cThis is complex, with great potential for people to improve their position, but also the risk that they may get things wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is essential that people can talk through their options with the DWP, and this has simply been impossible for too many because of lack of phone capacity.\u201d HMRC says that paying additional contributions does not always increase the state pension. Taxpayers can get a pension forecast at gov.uk or see if additional contributions are worth it. But Webb says the site does not specify which years a person should fill, and includes prices for years that the individual should not fill because it would not boost their pension. \u201cThis is why it is vital for people to discuss their individual record with the [government\u2019s] future pension centre,\u201d he says. Haine says that whether someone needs to top up depends on how many more years they will work. \u201cThose aged 45 and over, who won\u2019t have enough time to achieve the 35 qualifying years needed for the full new state pension, may be more inclined to pay up, while someone close to retirement and in poor health might not feel it is worth it. \u201cFor younger people, it may not be worth the expense of filling the gaps, as they are more likely to hit the required contribution target.\u201d People who live longer are more likely to profit more from increasing contributions. Tom Selby, of investment platform AJ Bell, says: \u201cThat income will be protected by the \u2018triple lock\u2019, meaning it rises every year by the highest of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%. \u201cIn April this year, the state pension increased by a whopping 10.1%, in line with inflation in September 2022. Broadly speaking, anyone who increases their state pension on these terms will need to live three to four years in order to be in \u2018profit\u2019 from the deal. \u201cThose in good health who can boost their state pension could benefit handsomely by doing so.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94732", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/november-review-replay-of-bataclan-terror-response-is-good-pr-for-french-cops", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "November review \u2013 replay of Bataclan terror response is good PR for French cops", "lead": "C\u00e9dric Jiminez\u2019s focus on police operations in the aftermath of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks doesn\u2019t give a real sense of who any of the agents involved are", "author": "Ryan Gilbey", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 08:00:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547746", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/db2c5fb79328a206cc2f3795957b5d4d71ef05da/0_141_2288_1373/500.jpg", "body": "Artistic responses to the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks \u2013 including You Will Not Have My Hate, Paris Memories and the excellent You Resemble Me \u2013 have rightly erred on the side of the contemplative, though even that couldn\u2019t excuse last year\u2019s soft-rock stage musical For You I\u2019d Wait. With November, the director and co-writer C\u00e9dric Jiminez, who excavated the origins of The French Connection in his 2014 thriller The Connection, zeroes in on the police operation in the immediate aftermath of the attacks when the terrorists were still on the run. Jiminez\u2019s Connection star Jean Dujardin oversees the hunt, calling his wife to say \u201cGive the kids my love\u201d before five solid days of barking at suspects and pointing at maps. Deploying the standard Jason Bourne vocabulary of swish-pans, shaky-cam and jittery editing, the film mercifully avoids restaging the attacks themselves and instead catalogues the surveillance operations, false leads, interrogations and high-speed pursuits. Despite reliable work from a wiry-looking J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier as a scowling cop and Ana\u00efs Demoustier as a novice agent, we don\u2019t get to know much about these (fictional) heroes who are pulling pizza-and-Alka-Seltzer all-nighters. A gun-runner (Hugo Dillon) with a colourful if dubious defence \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t blame my Kalashnikovs, blame pussy politicians!\u201d he fumes \u2013 comes more sharply into focus than anyone else here. Aside from one moment when Dujardin loses his cool and roughs up a suspect who has threatened to kill his family and \u201cinfidel wife\u201d, the cops here are a uniformly diligent and conscientious bunch. Any errors are shown to be wholly understandable, and even the near-betrayal of a key witness is later explained to have brought about a change in the law, which is quite the silver lining. As a thriller, November is slick, functional and rather hollow. As a PR exercise for French law enforcement, it\u2019s exemplary. \u2022 November is released on 22 June at Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re, London."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94733", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/nsw-must-help-reserve-bank-slay-the-inflation-dragon-state-treasurer-says", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NSW must help Reserve Bank \u2018slay the inflation dragon\u2019, state treasurer says", "lead": "Daniel Mookhey to give major speech to parliament outlining the state\u2019s finances as budget delayed until September", "author": "Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 07:53:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547763", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/026b4c655c12b5eefada729ce732e6e82e918bdd/0_191_7360_4414/500.jpg", "body": "New South Wales must do its part to curb inflation and help the Reserve Bank \u201cslay the inflation dragon\u201d, the state\u2019s new treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, says. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s statement on the NSW budget, Mookhey also said the Minns Labor government would place a major investment fund set up by its Coalition predecessors under review and halt further cash injections into it. Mookhey said tomorrow\u2019s speech would provide further \u201cdiscoveries\u201d to the $7.1bn \u201cblack hole\u201d of unfunded or hard-to-avoid expenses he had inherited. While plugging the gaps where possible, it was also important to rein in spending. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get our spending under control, we run the risk of the [Reserve Bank] continuing to put up interest rates month after month which means our mortgage holders will be effectively making a bigger sacrifice to fight inflation,\u201d he told a media conference in Sydney. The RBA earlier this month raised its key interest rate for a 12th time in 13 months and warned that \u201csome further tightening of monetary policy may be required\u201d to curb inflation. Unlike the federal government \u2013 which is on track to post a surplus in the 2022-23 year \u2013 states haven\u2019t faced as much scrutiny about their spending. NSW accounts for about a third of the Australian economy, with an annual gross state product of about $770bn. The state\u2019s net debt is about $80bn, or about half that of Victoria. Queensland\u2019s finances, though, are healthier because of a special tariff imposed on coal royalties that NSW has ruled out. Mookhey said the Labor government had gone to the March elections with a promise not to increase royalty rates for the 2023-24 year and \u201cthat remains our approach\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Unlike Queensland, most of NSW\u2019s coal is thermal used in power plants rather than coking coal used in steel mills. Extra royalties would have an impact on consumers\u2019 power prices, he said. After its election, the government opted to delay this year\u2019s budget until September to examine the previous government\u2019s spending plans. Much of Tuesday\u2019s speech will focus on the review of the debt retirement fund, created by the NSW Generations Fund Act set in 2018 \u201cto help lower the debt burden for future generations\u201d. Mookey said the fund had the potential to cost billions of dollars while also creating \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d that masked the true state of the budget. The previous government had planned to borrow as much as $25.3bn to deposit into the fund \u2013 or about half the $60bn in total debt sales \u2013 over the next four years. \u201cNSW stands to lose billions if the economy faces a shock akin to Covid-19 or the global financial crisis, sending the value of those investments lower,\u201d he said. Stripping out assumed profits the fund would have paid into state coffers, the annual surplus projected at $311m for the 2024-25 year instead becomes a deficit of $911m, Mookhey said. For the following year, the forecast $824m surplus becomes a $601m deficit. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can use this money to pay our bills to pay our essential workers a pay rise, to pay for our schools, or pay for our hospitals,\u201d he said. The government will ask for a \u201cshort\u2019\u201d upper house inquiry and will use its findings to \u201cdetermine final settings\u201d for the fund before the September budget. Martin Foo, a director at rating agency S&amp;P Global, said borrowing money to invest in the fund did \u201cadd market risk to the state\u2019s budget over time\u201d. Projections had put the fund swelling to $90bn by decade\u2019s end. The fund seems like a good idea when interest rates \u201clooked like they were going to be low forever\u201d, he said. Mookhey said the cost of borrowing had risen about 10-fold from the Covid-era lows. The shadow treasurer, Damien Tudehope, said the government was \u201crobbing the future to pay for today\u201d. \u201cThe taxpayers of NSW should be concerned that the savings responsibly invested for the future are going to be raided to pay for Labor\u2019s unfunded election promises,\u201d Tudehope said. \u201cThe treasurer needs to rule out any move to abolish the NGF and assure NSW taxpayers that the fund will remain in place for the purpose of debt retirement.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94734", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/19/manchester-united-fans-suffer-slow-torture-as-glazers-bide-their-time", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glazers\u2019 slow torture delivers fresh insult to Manchester United fans  | Sean Ingle", "lead": "While few are willing to bet on the takeover as the owners\u2019 motives remain uncertain, most believe we are now in the endgame", "author": "Sean Ingle", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 07:00:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547781", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a0d3a414b540f97fb0dd19650c6522be1827cafc/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Purgatory spiced with speculation, hope blunted by stasis. So it goes for Manchester United supporters, for week after interminable week. It is nearly seven months since the Glazers put the club up for sale \u2013 the \u201canniversary\u201d is Thursday. Yet the family remains in situ, still inflicting the sort of slow torture that would make Torquemada flinch, still desperate to make every last penny before they depart. If they depart. At least the Glazers have been consistent. They started their 18-year-old reign at the club by stiffing fans. They appear to want to go out the same way. But every week that passes without a sale risks jeopardising United\u2019s chances of improving again next season. If you were an agent of a player lined up for a move to Old Trafford, wouldn\u2019t you wait to see if the Qataris, with almost bottomless pockets, took over first? The sense both publicly and privately is that Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani\u2019s Nine Two foundation has slipped ahead of Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s Ineos bid after making a fifth and final offer this month. That said, it is understood both parties were still in active and detailed discussions last week, and few behind the scenes are willing to make firm bets. That is partly because of the opaqueness of the process, and the uncertainty of the Glazers\u2019 full motives \u2013 along with the way Raine, the US bank running the sale, has repeatedly tried to ramp up the price. Even so, most believe we are now in the endgame. But when the takeover fog does eventually lift, and United\u2019s new owners swan into Old Trafford with smiles and promises, the indelible stain the Glazers have left on English football must not be fast\u2011forwarded over, or forgotten. It is astonishing, even with 18 years\u2019 distance, to remember that United were once a debt-free and profit-making club \u2013 before being loaded with \u00a3540m of debts purely so that Malcolm Glazer could make himself owner. And it is also frankly incredible that the Premier League, and a Labour government, saw no reason to object to Glazer using a leveraged buyout to fund his takeover \u2013 even though United fans warned of the grim consequences. It meant that Glazer only had to use \u00a3272m of his own money to buy a club valued at \u00a3810m \u2013 with the rest borrowed using the assets of the company as collateral for the loan. In effect, United paid for their own takeover, as well as their continued upkeep. Even now the debt is still eye-watering. In very simple terms, the debt went from almost nothing pre-Glazers, to more than half a billion when they took over, then over \u00a3700m in 2010, and now \u00a3535.7m in early 2023. In essence, the Glazers resemble the zombie-ant fungus seen on nature documentaries, which takes over its host and drains its vital nutrients from the inside out, to its benefit. And the host? Well, that doesn\u2019t end well. At least the Premier League has finally appeared to recognise such behaviour isn\u2019t good for the game. Last week it voted to cap leveraged buyouts at around 65% of a club\u2019s value, banning the type of big-debt takeover used by the Glazers. What took it so long? Meanwhile the rest of the Glazers\u2019 record is little better. You don\u2019t need an MBA to understand that allowing David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson \u2013 your chief executive and greatest football manager \u2013 to leave in the same summer was rank incompetence. Until then, the Glazers could use United\u2019s success on the field to deflect from the club\u2019s balance sheets. For the past decade, though, there has been no hiding place. Yet remarkably, despite the downturn in performance, the Glazer siblings have pocketed millions every year since 2015 when shareholders started to be paid a dividend. The biggest, at \u00a334m incidentally, came in 2021-22, when United finished sixth, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was sacked, and Ralf Rangnick turned out to be a disaster. Success should be rewarded. But abject failure? All told, the Glazers have taken out \u00a3154m in dividends and share buybacks since 2015. As the highly respected football finance blogger Swiss Ramble pointed out last year, no owners in the Premier League have taken out more money over the last decade. Indeed many have put in significant funds, including Manchester City\u2019s (\u00a3684m), Chelsea\u2019s pre-Todd Boehly (\u00a3516m) and Aston Villa\u2019s (\u00a3506m). United might still be the world\u2019s biggest cash machine, but when the team, Old Trafford and the Carrington training facility are no longer world class, it comes at a cost. And let us not forget the Glazers\u2019 shocking attitude to the club\u2019s fans. It says so much that they only began talking to the Manchester United Supporters Trust in 2021 \u2013 16 years after buying the club \u2013 following the collapse of the European Super League. By contrast, MUST\u2019s Chris Rumfitt tells me that both the Qataris and Ineos have made clear that if they are given preferred bidder status they will speak to the trust within days. For now, however, Rumfitt and other United fans must hold their breath. Some of them hoped that when Avram Glazer chartered a \u00a3250,000 private jet to watch United play in the women\u2019s FA Cup final last month, with the club footing the hefty bill, it would be the final insult before the takeover became real. But with the Glazers it was never going to be that simple."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94735", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/19/diary-woman-fled-texas-for-abortion", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Days of desperation: the diary of a woman forced to flee Texas for an abortion ", "lead": "Lauren Miller\u2019s fetus had fatal brain abnormalities.

Mr Nugget is healthy \u2013 still on the tall side (shocker given that Jason is 6ft 8in \u2026) and in the 50th percentile for weight. On the way home, I started burping. Like frat boy burping. The kind of unholy belches I\u2019ve only ever done while pregnant. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant!\u201d Jason teased. I completely dismissed him. After 10 months of trying for Logan, it just didn\u2019t seem like it would happen on the first go this time around. Well, looks like Jason was right! I used one of the tests that say \u201cpregnant\u201d or \u201cnot pregnant\u201d, so there was no room for doubt. I\u2019m ecstatic, but can\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s always such a strange shift to realize that you\u2019re pregnant. I feel like the focal point of my consciousness drops 3ft from my head into my abdomen. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve adjusted volume controls so that the pregnancy is ramped up, while everything else is muted. But life goes on around me. I hope (especially with the fall of Roe v Wade) this pregnancy is as uncomplicated and normal as my pregnancy with Logan. If it\u2019s not, I want to be able to share what I\u2019m going through. I hate the \u201cdon\u2019t tell anyone until the second trimester so you don\u2019t have to tell about a miscarriage\u201d mentality. Why are we telling people to bottle up and not unburden themselves of something terrible? Rant finished \u2026 hopefully, that won\u2019t be something that we have to worry about! 27 July Today has been ROUGH. It\u2019s amazing how much worse I feel than just 24 hours ago. I hope this isn\u2019t a sign of things to come! It\u2019s early, but since the pregnancy confirmation visit isn\u2019t until eight-10 weeks (yet another reason why those ridiculous six-week \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills are so outrageous!) I sent my OB-GYN a message to give her a heads-up. I\u2019m really nervous about being pregnant in Texas right now. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have a doctor who you didn\u2019t trust. I just spoke with the schedulers. We will see \u201cDos\u201d on 29 August at 8.40am. Can\u2019t come soon enough! 20 August: first trip to the ER This baby is murdering me. Like actually. I started throwing up at 5 yesterday morning and it won\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t even keep down crackers. Water, tea, coffee, juice? Threw it up. Pedialyte? Threw it up. Our fabulous nanny tried to make water with lemon for me to settle my stomach and that didn\u2019t stay down either. At least it smelled nicer when I vomited that. 21 August: twins! After hours of vomiting, a doctor friend told me I should go to the ER to get rehydrated. My doctor friend was set to clock out of her shift at midnight, but she said she had to be the one to give us the news. I will definitely never forget how the next conversation went! [ER doctor friend]: Well, I wanted to let you know that everything on the ultrasound looks fine. You do have hyperemesis gravidarum, but that\u2019s something that\u2019s fairly common with multiples because of the higher hormones \u2026 She paused, beaming. \u201c\u2026 Because you\u2019re having twins!\u201d She showed us the ultrasound photos and sure enough \u2013 two little beans in there. Jason and I had a range of reactions, among them, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a bigger car\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re definitely going to need a night nurse this time\u201d. We told our families this afternoon. Jason\u2019s mom just said, \u201cHoly shit,\u201d as Jason\u2019s dad called out in the background, \u201cYour nanny\u2019s gonna quit!!\u201d My mom was typical, \u201cOh what a blessing.\u201d My dad, who was at the ranch and necessitated his own call, just goes \u201coh shit. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I think that may be more where we are at the moment! 29 August: first prenatal appointment We got our first pictures of Los Dos! Eee! They\u2019re really in there! Like last time, we got a dark blue folder after the visit with the hospital\u2019s standard hand-outs for pregnancy. Last time, I had labelled the folder \u201cBurpy\u201d. This time, I very proudly put \u201cLos Dos\u201d. Not just one, but two! My OB-GYN was fabulous as always. We did have a sobering conversation about the Texas laws though. As she put it, \u201cThe laws in Texas are a little kooky right now.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement. We understand this will be a higher-risk pregnancy because of the multiples and should the worst happen, it\u2019s good to know we can trust her. She said that we should always ask and if she feels a need to pause the conversation, (I assume she meant because of the legal risk) to let her do that, but not to hesitate to ask her anything. That\u2019s very nice of her, though I certainly hope that we\u2019re never in that situation! 23 September: bad news Not a good day. The Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist informed us Baby B (who I still think is a girl and A is baby boy) has a two cystic hygromas on her brain. I don\u2019t need a doctor to know the brain isn\u2019t supposed to be half fluid. The doctor said she suspects Baby B may have Turner syndrome or Down\u2019s syndrome, rather than one of the clearly fatal chromosomal abnormalities like Edwards Syndrome. She said cystic hygromas can resolve themselves, but she was careful not to be too optimistic. I had a bad feeling even before the appointment. I told Jason when we were standing outside the elevators waiting to go up that I was worried about Baby B. When the ultrasound tech said she needed to check she got all the photos she needed, I knew something was wrong. They didn\u2019t do that for Logan. She\u2019s going to refer us to another doctor. She also offered that we could wait a few weeks for amniocentesis, but we both immediately agreed we can\u2019t wait that long. This is devastating. I need to know what is happening with my baby. 26 September: \u2018Our boy has no chance\u2019 I feel sick. We just got the NIPT test. It\u2019s so much worse than I imagined. Trisomy 18. Edwards syndrome. I want to throw up. I can\u2019t even come up with words to describe how devastating this is. This is the prognosis for Edwards syndrome per Wikipedia: \u201cAbout 95% of pregnancies that are affected do not result in a live birth. Major causes of death include apnea and heart abnormalities \u2026 Half of the live infants do not survive beyond the first week of life. The median lifespan is five to 15 days. About 8-12% of infants survive longer than 1 year. One percent of children live to age 10.\u201d They\u2019re not talking about a happy, fulfilling life. They\u2019re just talking about surviving infancy. Surviving. That doesn\u2019t mean independent, pain free, happy. Our boy has no chance. Yes, boy. I was wrong. Our twins are boys. Found that out from the test, but it\u2019s hollow news. Telling them apart won\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to throw up and for the first time in weeks, it\u2019s not the hyperemesis gravidarum. Later that morning I spoke with the genetic counselor from my OB\u2019s office. There\u2019s no good news. It just gets worse. Every day he continues to develop, he puts myself and his twin at greater risk for complications. She can\u2019t say much because of the new Texas laws. She said that when she was in New York, they would do a single twin reduction (ie, an abortion of one twin), but she couldn\u2019t give me any more information. We have to scramble. We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re doing and we have to make plans. I feel blind and confused and scared and I hate all of this. I want my baby to be OK and he will never, never, never be OK. 27 September: meeting with genetic counselor I just feel like everything is worse and worse. We met with a second genetic counselor and a new specialist. She was super nice but you can just tell they\u2019re all so over this law. The Texas legislature has turned her job from saying: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry \u2013 these are the options for your situation\u201d to: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry \u2013 hope you don\u2019t die. Oh and by the way, I hope you have tons of time, money, and resources to support your child should it live!\u201d And \u2026 that\u2019s all she can say. We can no longer freely discuss healthcare options in Texas without fear of retribution. \u2018I didn\u2019t put our plans in writing\u2019 After the genetic counseling, we went back for another ultrasound. If I thought Friday\u2019s ultrasound was bad news \u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to describe this one. \u201cBad\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Devastating. That may be closer to the word. Baby A was fine. The abnormalities that Baby B has are heartbreaking. Cystic hygromas where most of the brain should be. Single artery umbilical cord. Incomplete abdominal wall. Abnormal heart. It\u2019s just one thing after another. None of them are any sort of life for Baby B. And when combined? We didn\u2019t even need to attempt the CVS. The doctor was frank about that. Honestly, his directness was refreshing. Of course, being data people, we thought that since we were there, we might as well do it. I wish we hadn\u2019t even tried. The process for trans abdominal CVS is pretty straightforward, even if unpleasant: a massive, thick needle, approximately a foot long, is inserted through the belly and uterus, and into the placenta. A second smaller needle is moved through the larger one in order to take the sample. As the needle gets to the uterus, the uterus does what uteruses do: it contracts. Not just a little contraction. I\u2019ve been through labor before. It was on that level. My uterus didn\u2019t want to cooperate either. Getting answers is an excruciating process. After multiple attempts, the doctor finally gave up. Throwing his gloves in the trash, he was very blunt: \u201cLook, I can try all day, but I\u2019m just causing you a ton of pain and your uterus isn\u2019t going to let me through. This baby isn\u2019t going to make it to birth. You need to go out of state.\u201d I guess I\u2019m lucky. If you have out-of-state resources, thousands of dollars at your disposal, time to take off work, childcare, ability to travel, you can find the abortion that you need. But for everyone else? You\u2019re screwed. I texted my family to let them know what had happened. I didn\u2019t put our plans to go to Colorado in writing though. 1 October: second ER visit Yesterday was rough. I was vomiting bile (or dry heaving as there was nothing left in me) the entire way to the ER. I can\u2019t help but think how I was directly put in this situation because of Texas\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. The doctor could have performed the termination on Tuesday in a world where we still had access to healthcare. This has been miserable. Eight hours later Finally, after almost eight hours in the ER, I was released. I want the hyperemesis to end. I want this pain to end. But we\u2019re not there yet. On some level, I\u2019m glad for that. I cradle my growing belly and talk to my boys in there. We don\u2019t have much longer now. Nothing anyone could say could make me doubt that we\u2019re doing the right thing. I just wish that we weren\u2019t in this situation at all and that both of our twins were healthy. I would take hyperemesis through the rest of this pregnancy and infinite ER visits in that cold, uncomfortable chair if it meant I could have my twins be healthy, with the ability to live long, happy lives. This is the most painful option for me, but the best for Thomas (as we\u2019ve now named Baby B) and Baby A. It makes me even more appalled at those who oppose abortion. The sheer selfishness of causing someone ongoing pain because of your beliefs will never cease to amaze me. \u2022\u2022\u2022 3 October: packing for Colorado I don\u2019t want to pack for Colorado. I don\u2019t want any of this. I want to be home snuggling Logan. Everything is so much more heartbreaking and depressing now that I have to travel for care. It cuts me off from my usual medical care team and my support people. It keeps me from being able to find a therapist. I can\u2019t have my own doctor who I trust to help me through this, I have to rely on a stranger. I just want to be able to stay at home. 3 October: liftoff It\u2019s happening. I want to sit here on the plane and cry, but I couldn\u2019t. Instead, my nose is clogged with the sickly sweet smell of ketchup from the Whataburger that the guy next to me is eating. It\u2019s nauseating, but at least masks his body odor. There\u2019s no dignity in this process. I want to be home holding Logan and cherishing this last night with Thomas. Instead, we\u2019re taking off into the night in an escape from the backwards legislation of Texas. No wild blue yonder, just ink black darkness. 4 October: day of the abortion Today\u2019s the day. Jason took a last photo of me with the twins. By this afternoon, we won\u2019t have twins. Just one twinless baby. It\u2019s taking everything not to break down crying every time I breathe. I keep hoping it\u2019s all been a terrible mistake. But I know it\u2019s not. And I don\u2019t know how to make peace with that. I keep trying to remind myself that we are lucky. We will still have Baby A, but I don\u2019t want Thomas to go. I wish that I was selfish enough to carry him until he passes so I could keep him longer. But that wouldn\u2019t help him and would only hurt Baby A. I try to take comfort in the fact that all he will ever know or have known is the coziness, warmth and security of being in his mommy\u2019s belly. My belly. I love you so much, little one. And I\u2019m so, so sorry that we will never know you and that something as small as a genetic mutation means you have no future. You will always be with me. The procedure We\u2019re in the ultrasound room and just met with the sonographer. I managed to get through my lunch without crying in my bagel and cream cheese. I guess I\u2019ll check in when we\u2019re on the other side so I can take these last moments with my Dos. Later that day The procedure was straightforward. They did an ultrasound to confirm the abnormalities and the issues were all very clear. I took an Ativan and used the restroom one last time while they prepped. Jason sat in the room as they got set up. Soon came the big needle. It was about the same as the CVS, with some terrible cramping. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d one of the doctors informed us as he squeezed my knee comfortingly. The nurse rubbed my ankles to offer comfort. The tears started falling then. The cleanup was fast. The entire process had taken less than 30 minutes. Once the needles were out, they wanted to do a final check on Baby A and asked if I would like to see. I could tell they were trying to keep Thomas off screen as they showed our little Tigger bouncing around, but I needed to see. The sonographer turned the screen further and we could see Thomas there, peacefully suspended. This was the most mercy that we could offer. The doctors said they felt honored to help us and all of the women escaping the laws of Texas. They thanked us for putting our trust in them. After they stepped out, I broke down sobbing against Jason. All the despair and sadness and stress came out. I cried for me and Jason and Thomas and Baby A, forever a twinless twin now, and for Logan, who doesn\u2019t even know what has happened. I cried and cried and cried. After a while, we left. I took one last photo of the screen. They had given us an ultrasound photo before the procedure, but I needed anything I could get. 4 October: the aftermath I feel at peace. The worst part of any test, presentation, meeting, was always the stress before. And what stress did we have. Unnecessarily too. It was chilly in that crisp fall way when we got outside. The Uber was about 10 minutes away, so we wandered through the wildflower garden by the parking circle. As Jason gave me a hug, a leaf fell on me. He kept it. Our last memento. I will never not miss him. Every day of this pregnancy will be a reminder. As Baby A hopefully grows up healthy and happy, I\u2019ll always remember that he had once been part of a pair. If we have the third that we want, I will fear that pregnancy and think of Thomas all along the way. But maybe there will be a day that it\u2019s less painful. Goodnight, sweet darling. Goodnight, Thomas Oberon Miller. 5 October We are home. I am writing this finally back in my own bed, with two snoring dogs next to me and my son snoring in his crib down the hall. 6 October With every additional day, I have such a strange mix of emotions. I find myself wondering how I will feel when I feel those first bubbling sensations that will soon become kicks. Or when I\u2019m nursing my baby. Will Thomas\u2019s absence become unbearable sometimes in those moments? That chest-crushing, breath-taking gasp of knowing how badly something is missing? I have been thinking of my grandmother a lot the last few days. She lost three of her babies, each at such different times. I can\u2019t even fathom the absolute soul-crushing pain of carrying a baby all the way to birth only to lose it either immediately or within a few years. I don\u2019t know how she went on. How could you recover? How is this something that the state of Texas tried to force me to do? I couldn\u2019t have Thomas and know that I was waiting for the day to lose him. 24 October: first social media post I finally made a public post. We had to say something. This past weekend, at a friend\u2019s wedding, it was horrible seeing people who didn\u2019t know congratulating us and making comments about twins. I can\u2019t keep doing that. For the post, I shared the last ultrasound photo that we had of our boys alive together, with this note in a series of screenshots: The response has been overwhelming. I hate how dehumanized this issue has become, but I am glad I can do something about it. Every time I see or think anything about twins, I feel a pain in my gut (or is it heart?). Maybe one day it will stop happening. Maybe one day, I will see two little twins toddling around together and not feel pain at knowing what we\u2019ve missed. Maybe there will be a day when I don\u2019t think about this. But I don\u2019t think that day will come for a long time. 26 October : first scan after procedure Well, this has been a relief. Baby A is looking healthy. It was hard to see Thomas in there. He\u2019s so little now in comparison to Baby A. The sonographer took a few measurements of him. When she took Baby A\u2019s heart rate, the screen lit up yellow and you could hear the machine. For Thomas, it stayed blue and silent. She stepped out of the room for a minute, claiming a coughing fit. She came back, took a few more measurements and images and I just squeezed Jason\u2019s hand in silence. Finally, she asked: \u201cHow much do you know about Baby B and the NIPT test?\u201d Moment of truth \u2026 Or something along those lines. \u201cWe know about Trisomy 18 and the abnormalities and there was only one heartbeat at the last appointment. I see he doesn\u2019t have one now either. We were expecting this.\u201d Technically, all true, but I was still scared. It\u2019s like we all speak in code now. 25 October: one month since my abortion In a few days, I will have made it a month since the hardest day of my life. Someday, I will hold my boys and tell them that I love them and that for a few weeks, they had a little brother named Thomas. Thomas who never lived, but will be with us forever. I will explain that mercy can be heartbreaking. I will explain that the abortion for their brother was out of love. \u2022\u2022\u2022 June 2023: postscript The rest of my pregnancy was marked by stress and fear. I worried for my remaining twin and about Texas\u2019s vigilante system, which allows members of the public to hunt out those they suspect of aiding abortion, and sue them in civil court. Three weeks after filing the lawsuit against Texas, we welcomed Baby A, named Henry, into the world. He has been a delight and our toddler loves to pet the little tuft of hair on the top of his head while chanting \u201cBaby\u201d. Thomas\u2019s ashes sit in a glass cabinet in my office, a daily reminder of the other son we wanted and for whom we suffered more than necessary at the hands of the state of Texas. A state where my family has lived for generations. A state that held agency over my body and over my medical advice once I became pregnant. I continue to document this journey with the hopes that someday, I will be able to look back at these restrictive healthcare laws and they will be a distant memory. Until then, I am proud to be standing among the other women in this case as we try to save other pregnant people from the trauma and harm that we have faced."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94736", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/positive-patients-damaging-upbeat-honesty", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I thought I should always be positive with my patients \u2013 until I found out how damaging that can be | Mark Taubert", "lead": "It turns out that what people really value is honesty, says consultant Mark Taubert", "author": "Mark Taubert", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 07:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547815", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bfdcc2487817ca210741eff955fa6c5b9ae81faa/0_0_5615_3369/500.jpg", "body": "Years ago, when I was training as a palliative medicine doctor, I saw a woman with lower back pain. I knew from her medical history that she had breast cancer, so I wanted to make sure it hadn\u2019t spread to her spinal area. I was fairly certain that it was probably only a muscular pain, and so I reassured her. Her examination findings had not revealed any red flags, so I felt a bit of positivity was not misplaced, as she was feeling very anxious. Her MRI scan, however, confirmed the worst: a full-scale invasion of a region called the cauda equina in her lumbar spine area. \u201cYou were certain it was going to be all right, and now I have to be admitted to hospital?\u201d she exclaimed, visibly upset. She needed urgent radiotherapy to the area and had to be stretchered to hospital. Sadly, despite treatment, she became unable to walk and required a wheelchair. In my early years as a doctor, I thought it was my role to be positive, sometimes overly positive, with patients and their next of kin, reassuring them of a low likelihood of my worst suspicions being confirmed. Yet I started to find myself regretting what I had said, especially when a hunch became a reality. \u201cI wish you\u2019d told us this might happen so we could prepare,\u201d was one of the comments that would come back. A turning point for me was when I had to get informed consent from patients, to indicate that they had understood all the risks of a medical procedure. When you have an anxious person in front of you, it can feel cruel to list a whole lot of complications (\u201cbowel perforation\u201d, \u201cstroke\u201d, \u201cdeath\u201d), but the longer you work as a doctor, the higher the likelihood that you will eventually see some of these rare side-effects. And so it was for me, when a patient lost vast amounts of blood after a routine day-case hospital procedure and had not fully appreciated the risks. He survived, required blood transfusions and told me he would not have undergone the operation had I been sufficiently blunt about the risks beforehand. As a palliative care doctor, I deliver a lot of bad news. That has meant learning how to balance my instincts to not worry an individual, when I suspect something bad may be going on, versus the need to inform them of all possibilities. \u201cWe can do a scan of your head just to check what is affecting your balance\u201d can sound slightly more reassuring than \u201cI want to scan your head because I am worried your cancer may have spread to the brain and caused metastases there\u201d. The key for me is to assess the person I am speaking to and find out what they want to know. Some find too much information distressing and they tell me so from the outset. Others want all possible outcomes laid bare, regardless of how distressing I might deem them to be. But I\u2019ve learned over the years that excessive positivity can be damaging. There is a lot of pressure to be positive these days. Some people even regard it as a form of wellness treatment in itself and warn of the potential dangers of \u201callowing negativity into their lives\u201d. But such enforced optimism ignores the realities of our existence. Some patients seem to think negativity will shorten their lives. But researchers in different studies have tested the hypothesis that optimism can impact survival in cancer patients and have found that it does not have an impact. In one of these studies, there was a suggestion that encouraging patients to be positive perhaps even represents an additional burden. Whether you have terminal cancer or not, believing everything must stay positive just isn\u2019t sustainable. It needs to be balanced with realism. An expectation that outcomes will and must always conclude well can in itself create disappointment and anxiety \u2013 because, at some level, we know that we cannot guarantee those wishes will come true. Being pessimistic or negative on occasion can help, and patients tell me that it is pragmatic and even reassuring to talk about the worst-case scenarios that may lie ahead. When my patients spend more time getting used to the very real possibility that things will work out not so well, it can reduce anxiety considerably over future weeks and months. \u201cNever interrupt a patient who is expressing negativity,\u201d said one of my mentors once, and she was right: it\u2019s far better to listen and talk it through. And do not be afraid to discuss potential negative outcomes with those who have put their lives in your hands, even if the news may sound terrifying. By considering the worst and the most negative scenario, we do not make it more likely that it will actually happen. Now, I always ask my patients and their loved ones how much they feel they can handle. Nearly all want a doctor who talks frankly, but with honest compassion, outlining what may be ahead.

The test It took me a while to work out why this was even trending. When you\u2019re doing your skincare and makeup in a rush, who has the time to add a jaunty, puffy headband? But sure enough, one such headband, from vegan skincare brand Versed, did make the rounds online, prized for its exaggerated puffiness and crown-like appeal. So I gave it a go. Would it make any difference to the quality of my routine? Or was it just a \u201cfun\u201d thing to wear on social media? Of course, any band will do \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be this obnoxiously cutesy. So I used a fairly normal one and popped it on before I applied my night-time skincare \u2013 and I did notice one thing: I invested slightly more time in the routine, possibly because I\u2019d taken the time to put the darn headband on in the first place. It was also useful when doing my weekly face-mask routine; I put the band on and partially avoided the mask-in-hair debacle that usually ensues. But, really, placebo effects aside, there wasn\u2019t a sizeable difference. The verdict I probably wouldn\u2019t bother \u2013 unless you have a fringe, when it could be useful (though that\u2019s probably not news to you).

Anonymous Sudan, which surfaced in January 2023, has also claimed responsibility for at least 24 distributed denial-of-service attacks on Australian companies, including healthcare, aviation and education organisations. Last week, Microsoft confirmed that outages to its Outlook service in early June were the result of a DoS attack believed to have been carried out by Anonymous Sudan, which had claimed credit. The group presented itself as a loose group of hacktivists with a name that suggested they were located in Sudan, and it claimed to be targeting Australian organisations in March in protest against clothing worn at Melbourne fashion festival with \u201cGod walks with me\u201d written on it in Arabic. Cybersecurity firm CyberCX said in a report released on Monday that the group is unlikely to be an authentic hacktivist organisation and is likely linked to the Russian state, after an analysis of the group\u2019s activities. CyberCX said most hacktivist groups conduct their plans for operations in a semi-public way online, but Anonymous Sudan had only announced targets when they were being attacked, indicating a closely held operation. The firm also said the organisation\u2019s use of paid infrastructure in the attacks \u2013 directing mass amounts of traffic to a service in order to bring it down \u2013 would have cost tens of thousands of dollars, and was less likely to have been used by a loose collective. CyberCX said Anonymous Sudan was also publicly aligned with pro-Russian threat actors and is a member of the pro-Russia hacker group Killnet. Alastair MacGibbon, CyberCX\u2019s chief strategy officer, told Guardian Australia that Anonymous Sudan\u2019s generally low-level targets and the fact it was presenting itself as an Islamic group indicated a Russian-backed organisation that could be trying to \u201cdrive division in society\u201d and disrupt the west. \u201cIt really stems from the Russian government proclivities to drive division in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really care about the issue \u2026 anti-racism, pro-environment or whatever \u2013 [they] just get into whatever it is that matters to [harm] targets. In this case, the west.\u201d MacGibbon said there appeared to be a growing pattern in the spate of cyber-attacks from Russian-linked hacker groups against Australia. The Optus and Medibank attacks last year were \u201cless monetisable forms of attack\u201d, he said, with the groups threatening to post the data online rather than locking up systems in ransomware attacks. \u201cThere has to be a link to other forms of monetisation, potentially a state or some form of direction coming from the state that says \u2018go and cause fear, uncertainty and doubt\u2019,\u201d he said.

Now it is the turn of its top adventure watch to be enhanced with next-gen tech and new tools in the new Fenix 7 Pro. The new torch-equipped, go-anywhere watch costs \u00a3750, putting it very much in the luxury category alongside Apple\u2019s \u00a3849 Watch Ultra and the \u00a3800 and up Epix line. That\u2019s also \u00a3150 more than the cheapest Fenix 7 but roughly in line with the cost of the previous solar-charging models. So what more do you get for your money? Garmin uses its \u201cPro\u201d models to introduce new tech into its watch line while maintaining the rugged design of the original Fenix 7. It comes in a choice of 42, 47 or 51mm sizes to suit different wrist widths and looks like it means business. The 7 Pro has Garmin\u2019s next-gen low-power LCD touchscreen, which is noticeably crisper and easier to read indoors compared to previous solar-charging iterations. It isn\u2019t as beautiful as its recent OLED models, but is easier to see in bright sunlight, has solar charging built in and consumes far less power. There\u2019s an option for sapphire glass and titanium models for those that need the most durable materials. One of the best additions is the LED light in the top edge of the watch, which debuted exclusively with the ginormous Fenix 7X last year but is now on every size of the the 7 Pro. It is bright enough to be used for finding your way, similar to a phone torch and proves extremely useful in the mundanity of day-to-day life \u2013 while poking through cupboards, putting the bins out at night and the like. The LED can also act as a strobing running light, shining white when you swing your arm forward and red when it goes backwards. It won\u2019t replace a head torch or chest light, but anything that makes you more visible to cars at night is good. All models of the 7 Pro also have Garmin\u2019s best-in-class multi-band GPS that significantly improves tracking accuracy in tricky conditions such as forests or around tall buildings. Specifications Screen: 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4in transflective MIP LCD Case size: 42, 47 or 51mm Case thickness: 14.1 to 14.9mm Band size: 20, 22 or 26mm quick fit Weight: 42 to 68g body only Storage: 32GB Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: Multi-band GNSS (GPS, Glonass, Galileo), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi The back of the watch has Garmin\u2019s new fifth-generation optical heart rate monitor, which is wider and with a noticeably different design that makes it more reliable when your wrist is moving or at odd angles. That should help tracking during vigorous or arduous exercise, including lifting weights or cycling. Otherwise the sensor is the most responsive and accurate optical monitor available and very close to being as good as a chest strap for most people. The 7 Pro tracks basically every activity you can think of with a further 30 sport profiles added over the already extensive list from the Fenix 7. It includes full offline mapping on your wrist, both for pre-planned and impromptu routes should you ever get lost, something few competitors offer. The maps have improved steepness markings and weather conditions can now be overlaid on you location similar to smartphone radar weather maps. New for the 7 Pro, though eventually coming to other models via software updates, are two additional metrics: hill score and endurance score. Hill score is a measure of your ability to run, walk or hike up inclines of 2% of greater, broken up into hill endurance and strength, which broadly indicate your fitness to go the distance or how fast you can manage it. The endurance score is more interesting as a way of comparing yourself to others in a sport agnostic way. All activity counts towards it, measuring duration and intensity, allowing footballers to compete with runners or skiers. Other platforms such as Fitbit have offered similar activity agnostic competition as one of their key social selling points for a while. Long battery life and solar charging One of the big upsides of having the low-power LCD screen is very long battery life. Used as a smartwatch with notifications from my phone, general activity and sleep tracking, setting timers, using the torch several times a day and other bits, the Fenix 7 Pro easily lasts 16 days. Don\u2019t use the torch as much or add in several hours of solar charging a day and you\u2019ll get closer to 22 days between charges, which is very impressive. The battery life for running and other sport tracking features is just as generous, lasting up to 136 hours of GPS tracking in its most energy efficient mode or up to 40 days in the special \u201cexpedition mode\u201d. With daily solar charging it can last even longer. For more regular running the watch consumed around 6-7% of the battery in 80 minutes with its default automatic GPS mode without music or 12% with offline music from Spotify. That\u2019s works out to at least 22 hours of high-precision tracking, which is certainly long enough for most activities. Sustainability The Fenix 7 Pro is generally repairable. The battery is rated to last at least a few years of frequent charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees at least two years of security updates from release but typically supports its devices far longer. It offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling laws. Price The Fenix 7 Pro series starts at \u00a3749.99 ($799.99/A$1,349) and reaches \u00a31,099.99 for the most expensive model. For comparison, the Fenix 7 starts at \u00a3560, the Epix Pro starts at \u00a3830, the Apple Watch Ultra costs \u00a3849, the Corps Vertix 2 costs \u00a3599 and the Sunnto Vertical costs \u00a3545. Verdict The Fenix 7 Pro is all about cementing Garmin as the top dog of the adventure-watch market, adding its next-gen heart rate sensor and screen tech to the already extremely capable Fenix 7. Solar charging on all models, enhanced maps and the highest-accuracy multi-band GPS are all very welcome. As are the software additions to Garmin\u2019s best-in-class sport tracking, extremely long battery life and Android and iPhone support. You may only use 5% of what this watch can do but everyone\u2019s 5% will be different. It might sound odd to say that the best feature of a \u00a3750 watch is something as simple as the torch built into the top, but it is extremely useful day-to-day and great for running at night. Every watch should have one. The Fenix 7 Pro is therefore the very best adventure smartwatch going, even if it\u2019s only marginally better than its already fantastic predecessor. It certainly costs a lot but for some, it\u2019ll be worth every penny. Pros: tracks practically everything, built-in torch, next-gen HR sensor, very long battery life and solar charging, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, 100-metre water resistance, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS. Cons: very expensive, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches, no voice control, better screen is basic compared to OLED."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9473c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/a-new-start-after-60-i-made-a-good-job-of-mums-funeral-so-i-decided-to-help-other-people-with-theirs", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A new start after 60: I made a good job of Mum\u2019s funeral \u2013 so I decided to help other people with theirs", "lead": "A career in TV taught Simon Booker how to handle drama and tight schedules.

I was very control-freaky about it.\u201d In particular, he was pleased with the humanist celebrant and \u201ctucked the idea away for this phase of life \u2013 my third act\u201d. That was in 2010. Booker is 67 now, and last summer he enrolled on a training course for celebrants, run by Humanists UK. There he was, for two weekends, learning and performing dummy funeral ceremonies for his peers. At his first funeral proper, last winter, he was nervous \u2013 \u201cmainly about the logistics, whether the tech would work. And was I going to press the right buttons? There is no dress rehearsal. Your eye\u2019s on the clock, because there is another ceremony coming in straight after you. The cardinal sin is to overrun. The crematorium can levy a fine.\u201d The service builds to a \u201ccommittal\u201d, when the bereaved say their final goodbyes to their loved one before they are buried or cremated. As he says: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be accelerating at that really impactful, meaningful moment.\u201d Pacing should not be a problem for Booker. In his previous career, he was a writer for TV dramas that were watched by millions \u2013 The Inspector Linley Mysteries, The Mrs Bradley Mysteries, Holby City. Now, he says: \u201cI\u2019m still writing and everything\u2019s very dramatic, but the audience is smaller, 60 or 80.\u201d Funerals are, like TV dramas, ephemeral, Booker says \u2013 but they have a much more lasting impact. \u201cYou\u2019re helping a family going through a really difficult time to get probably the worst day of their life to go as well as it can,\u201d he says. At the end, he hopes, they will have \u201ca sense of closure, of being able to start the process of moving on\u201d. Still, it must seem very different from his previous career. Booker left school at 18. His mother had a \u201cvery glamorous\u201d job as a publicist for Hollywood films; for a while Booker harboured \u201ca silly idea\u201d of being an actor. \u201cOne of my mum\u2019s friends was the head of drama at BBC TV. He came round one night and showed me a volume of Spotlight, the casting directory for actors, and told me to go through it and tell him how many names and faces I recognised. I quickly got his point,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother put him up to that.\u201d He got a job as a producer for Capital Radio, working with Michael Aspel and Kenny Everett. He also read the traffic reports. On his 21st birthday, he opened cards from listeners, including one from his father, who had left his mother when Booker was still in nappies. \u201cThere was an address in Weston-super-Mare and the card said: \u2018If you ever feel like getting in touch \u2026\u2019 But I didn\u2019t follow it up. I think I felt it would have been disloyal to my mum, who had raised me without any help from him.\u201d Booker, who also writes novels, is a lifelong atheist, but a recent humanist. \u201cThe whole ethos is that we only have one short, precious life, and we should try to live it with kindness and compassion for others. \u201cWhen you get to my age, you inevitably start thinking about your own demise more than when you\u2019re younger. So I suppose that kind of attitude helps as you start to address that prospect.\u201d Humanist funerals are \u201cnot the kind of thing anyone does for the money\u201d, Brooker says, although he has heard of one celebrant who does three a day. He has had \u201ca cluster\u201d in London, where he is based, since Christmas. Doesn\u2019t it get depressing to prepare funerals all the time? \u201cI don\u2019t find it depressing \u2013 I find it uplifting,\u201d he says. \u201cMy own attitude to death is quite sanguine and philosophical. I\u2019m not squeamish about it. The thought of \u2018not being\u2019 doesn\u2019t spook me.\u201d The thought of retirement, on the other hand, is anathema to him. \u201cI want to do useful things.

We\u2019re planning to be out of the UK for up to six months from the end of this year-middle of next. Ideally, I\u2019d like to rent my flat out while we\u2019re away to cover costs of mortgage, bills etc. I understand that I will need to talk to my mortgage provider, but I\u2019m not sure what the options might be. I understand that if I were to rent the flat out permanently I\u2019d need to change to a buy-to-let mortgage, but will I be expected to do that for just six months? KC A You do indeed need to talk to your mortgage provider but before you do, it might be an idea to ask an estate agent how much in rent you could expect to get for your flat. If it\u2019s more than enough to cover your monthly mortgage payments, this might help persuade your lender to give you its \u201cconsent to let\u201d. This means that you would be allowed to let your flat but wouldn\u2019t be made to switch to a buy-to-let mortgage and so could carry on with your current deal. If your lender won\u2019t allow you to let your flat while you are away on sabbatical \u2013 which I suspect is pretty unlikely \u2013 an alternative would be to ask if you can reduce your outgoings by taking a six-month mortgage payment holiday. But doing that would have a seriously negative effect on your credit file and increase both the amount of your outstanding mortgage balance and the amount of interest you have to pay. So I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as a sensible option. As well as talking to your mortgage lender, you\u2019ll also need to let your buildings and contents insurers know about your proposed absence."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9473e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/19/rural-the-lives-of-the-working-class-countryside-by-rebecca-smith-review", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rural by Rebecca Smith review \u2013 a personal study of working-class life in the countryside", "lead": "Her timely defence of blue-collar rural communities works best when the Cumbrian author explores how urban money severs the links between locals and their landscape", "author": "Richard Benson", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 06:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.547962", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4e5edb47ceb9ebc909ee12718a81dbc95d1d53e8/0_48_640_384/500.jpg", "body": "The blurb for Rebecca Smith\u2019s Rural: The Lives of the Working Class Countryside sells it as a call to arms for the countryside\u2019s abused, exploited and forgotten working classes, and its most memorable passages resound with all the get-off-our-land fury of a gamekeeper\u2019s shotgun. \u201cAn Airbnb or a second home might bring in some money for the local shop, but it won\u2019t bring more children to the school,\u201d she writes, revisiting the town near where she grew up in the Lake District. \u201cThey won\u2019t be on the fundraising committees for the pantomime or the summer dances, they won\u2019t be part of the church congregation or able to organise the local ceilidhs\u2026 by buying a house to experience that for the few weeks, or even a few months of the year, they have gradually suffocated the life forever. Throughout these villages, UK-wide, country shows are being cancelled, pubs are closing down, hotels can\u2019t get the staff and schools are shutting. We have reached the tipping point. Some areas might even have passed it.\u201d For anyone with experience of country ghost towns that come alive only when the second-homers\u2019 4x4s roll in on Friday night, this feeling will be infuriatingly familiar. The ongoing displacement of local communities makes Rural feel timely, but it has a wider range of targets than the familiar villains of the interloping urban Farrow &amp; Ball set. Its strength is Smith\u2019s sharp eye for new examples of urban money breaking up the relationships between local people and their landscapes. Corporations who offset their pollution by planting thousands of trees in inappropriate locations where the saplings will die off anyway; absentee landlords who shorten tenancy agreements so farmers can\u2019t plan long-term improvements of the land; the gentry sacking estate workers and hawking their heritage to the leisure industry. For the roughly 20% of Britons who live in rural areas, such trends debilitate in the same way that gentrification does in cities. Smith conveys the emotional and psychological impacts of that without going full Royston Vasey on us, which is no small achievement. The book starts like a memoir. Smith lives with her partner and young children in a modern house on a 600-home housing development in Falkirk. Oppressed by the area\u2019s lack of natural greenery, she spends a lot of time with her children in a nearby country park. Here she finds the remains of an old stately home, which reminds her of her poor but happy childhood spent in tied houses on country estates where her father worked as a forester. \u201cOur homes were old, damp and cold, and we were four miles from any kind of shop,\u201d she recalls of those days. \u201cBut it was idyllic.\u201d Her personal idyll was one of woodland wanderings, pheasant shoots and other visceral, muddy pleasures, but it\u2019s distinguished by the social niceties of landed estate living; as a teenager, she had to learn to change her accent when answering the phone depending on whether it was a landowner or a friend calling. You can see where her interest in class comes from. Prompted by her memories and questions, she travels to various rural communities with historical links to industry, each one given a chapter with a title such as \u201cCoal\u201d, \u201cWater\u201d or \u201cFood\u201d. The best are those in which she uncovers forgotten working-class histories and communities: the villages built for forestry workers as forests were planted after the first world war, for example, or the camps for the navvies who built the great dams and reservoirs to supply the cities with drinking water. Less compelling are the chapters such as \u201cMining\u201d or \u201cTextiles\u201d, which add little to already familiar histories. In her prologue Smith says she isn\u2019t trying to provide an exhaustive account of the rural working class, but at times her selection does feel random and uneven. Her definition of \u201cworking class\u201d is very much her own, based not on economics but on being connected to the landscape through work. This leads her to some odd choices of subject, notably tenant farmers rather than any farm labourers, who surely shaped more of the countryside than any other group of workers. It\u2019s true that social class can work differently in rural areas \u2013 Marx himself decided that both the peasantry and the farmers were incapable of acting as classes, and felt they should just move into cities to join the struggle. But it is hard to grasp how certain topics \u2013 raves in a slate mine, for example \u2013 exemplify a distinct, contemporary rural working-class culture. It would have been interesting to hear her views on how and why they do. The book is better read not as as a single, tidy argument but as a series of interconnected essays linked by Smith\u2019s journey around the country. She was pregnant for much of the journey, and she details how that, and having to manage a family, affected her research. Some readers will find this intrudes on the main narrative, but she is making the point that if you are not well off, and your circumstances are challenging, then a sense of a family connection to a place can feel like the most important thing you have, and have to give. How we manage people\u2019s competing claims to ownership of places is one of the great questions for the world in the 21st century. As Rural shows, the British countryside is a good example of how not to do it. \u2022 Richard Benson is the author of The Valley (Bloomsbury) and The Farm (Penguin) \u2022 Rural: The Lives of the Working Class Countryside by Rebecca Smith is published by Williams Collins (\u00a318.99).

If I didn\u2019t amplify the voice of women, it would be like denying my own voice and killing myself.\u201d Sister LB, 34, wants to empower women and highlight social injustice through her music. In doing so she has become part of a burgeoning female rap and hip-hop scene in Senegal, carrying forward the country\u2019s legacy of socially conscious and radical urban music. A rapper since she was 13, Sister LB lives on the outskirts of the capital, Dakar. She released her first solo single, Ji G\u00ebn, in 2019 and says she went solo to make sure more women\u2019s voices were heard and to have more control over her career. Ji G\u00ebn \u2013 which means woman in Wolof, the most widely spoken language in Senegal \u2013 is a song of celebration, showing women that their happiness is important and that their lives matter. Her latest single, Do Xool, released in March, rejects the traditional expectation that a woman\u2019s role in life is to have babies. \u201cWomen have their lives. They have other things to do and we must respect that,\u201d she says. For decades, hip-hop in Senegal has challenged marginality and engaged in political critique. The Y\u2019en a Marre (I\u2019m Fed Up) movement was established in 2011 by rappers and journalists to protest against government failures and encourage young people to vote. It was credited with toppling Abdoulaye Wade in the 2012 presidential elections. A little over 10 years later, despite economic hardship, rappers are still asking pertinent questions about government, leadership and Africa\u2019s role in the world. But being an outspoken rapper is risky: prominent artist Nitdoff was imprisoned this year for speaking out against the current government. \u201cSenegalese hip-hop is engaged [in social issues]. It is in the service of the people and, above all, democracy,\u201d says Lamine Ba, editor for French-speaking west Africa at Music in Africa, an online resource. The country\u2019s hip-hop scene continues to be dominated by men but more women are becoming involved who are also engaged in activism, he says. DJ Zeyna, 31, sees it as her duty to combine her music with protest. She is active in the campaign to free Nitdoff and uses her social media platforms to raise awareness of women\u2019s rights and injustice. She posted this month about protests in which at least 16 people died and more than 500 were arrested following the sentencing of the opposition leader Ousmane Sonko. \u201cI am a person who doesn\u2019t like injustice and who loves their country,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t sit with my arms crossed. I fight for my country.\u201d Since starting out in 2011, she has seen more women enter the hip-hop scene, as artists and fans. She remembers it being a challenging environment in the past for female artists. People would question her motives for pursuing a career in music but, she says: \u201cThis is what I have wanted since I was a child. I had to prove that I could do it and I had to continue.\u201d She has since started a charity to train other women to DJ. Ba says that 10 years ago he would have been able to name only three or four female artists who had a following. Now there are at least a dozen who are well known. He says female artists raise difficult topics in their music, such as rape, which make audiences uncomfortable. \u201cThey take it upon themselves to sing about these topics because the global feminist movement is overtaking Senegal, above all in rap. Female hip-hop artists are focused on changing the place of women in Senegalese society.\u201d But, Ba says, more women are choosing to sing about hope and social justice. \u201cThey want life to change. They want the Senegalese people to be able to find work, to meet their needs and those of their family, to be able to travel like so many other young people around the world can, and to have a better life.\u201d One female artist whose star is on the rise is Magui. Growing up, the 26-year-old was inspired by the Y\u2019en a Marre movement. \u201cHip-hop in Senegal has always been considered a type of music that empowers people, highlights problems and has a big influence in politics,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen there is urgent need, we try to denounce things and say enough is enough.\u201d Her career so far has involved rapping about taboo subjects, including menstruation and rape. Last year, she was named woman of the year by the digital platform Rap 221. Despite this, she still holds a part-time job to finance her music career. Magui says parents and older generations remain wary of rap. \u201cThey see it as an area where there are only men. There are stereotypes involving gangs and other toxic things. Conservative values and the social reality here in Senegal mean that many girls can\u2019t go far in [a rap career].\u201d She adds: \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting for equality between men and women in hip-hop. It is something that is coming. The numbers of female artists are increasing.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94740", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/i-have-given-up-grooming-welcome-to-hot-crone-summer", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I have given up grooming.

As if writing about snail goo in the past absolves me of responsibility to do anything about how I look now. Then summer, oof! I cried for 20 minutes yesterday just because the birds looked too hot. I don\u2019t really have the mental bandwidth for anything other than letting the heat do its worst with my keratin and whatever skin is (I just googled \u201cWhat is skin?\u201d for a snapshot of how deep into summer madness I have sunk). But is it rude to go out without making some cursory effort? In summer, you\u2019re dealing with the dread re-emergence of feet into the public sphere, plus the way your whole face slides greasily southwards, making you look, as the writer Sarah Dempster said memorably, \u201cLike Noddy Holder screaming in a kiln\u201d. I\u2019m not budging on my \u201cfeminist\u201d (lazy) decision to give up makeup: when I found myself saying crossly, \u201cA man wouldn\u2019t be doing this\u201d, I decided I wouldn\u2019t either, mostly. So I\u2019m only making concessions to social norms that don\u2019t compromise my slatternly principles: concealing my feet and seeking out a seasonal fragrance that isn\u2019t Dove Original gone crusty. This has been made vastly more entertaining by a friend discovering surely the most over-the-top fragrance site ever. \u201cI\u2019ve found three that have notes of goat hair,\u201d she told me and I was instantly seized by acquisitive fervour and ordered some testers.

But I\u2019m returning to cycling because I want to take my children to school and nursery without the horrible sense of guilt from dropping them off in the car, complaints about walking or the juggle of pushchair and public transport at rush-hour. To replace my car on the daily school run, I need an electrically powered workhorse that will carry two smallish children and the bags of stuff that we lug around wherever we go. The options, I\u2019m told, are an elongated cargo bike that fits two children on the back, a detachable trailer, or a trike/bike with a giant child bucket on the front. In an ideal world, it will be powerful enough that I don\u2019t feel dragged down by 30kg of offspring while chugging the household around my hilly London neighbourhood. The longtail electric cargo seems like the best fit for this brief. There are various \u201ccar replacement\u201d bikes on the market with eye-watering price tags. The Tern GSD retails at \u00a35k-plus at the top end. The model I choose to try out is a RadWagon, at the cheapest end of the market, though not actually cheap at more like \u00a32,000 with all the necessary attachments. My main concern is whether I can keep my wriggling cargo safe. I spend a long time poring over Google maps to figure out a route that avoids buses and sticks to cycle paths and parks as much as possible. I also research parking, endlessly. And it seems this is one of the main disadvantages of a big, expensive bike. The advice is pretty much never to leave them unattended or on display for long. You can lock them up with as many locks as you like but nothing can stop a determined thief with an angle grinder \u2013 even in a public place in broad daylight. I decide it will have to be parked only at home, school or work. Finally, I am ready to borrow the bike from one of the handful of RadWagon partner outlets in London. It has been shipped and taken a week to \u201cbuild\u201d \u2013 the lead time for an order is usually about 10 days. The bikes are extremely popular in the US and mainland Europe but have not been without their problems, including a recall over tyre issues requiring new kit that took some months to be sent. In the UK, there are more than 500 RadWagon owners, and a handful of service outlets in London. Turning up at the shop, I admit I\u2019ve never ridden an electric bike before and the assistant laughs, telling me the RadWagon is going \u201cin at the deep end\u201d. It is a beast, at 2 metres in length and 35kg in weight. But after a short trial round a nearby park, I decide to take the plunge and cycle 45 minutes home. It is in turns both exhilarating and terrifying. At top speed, I am approaching the 25km per hour with little effort on my part. The electric motor makes cycling feel like you\u2019re gliding along. A nimble turn of the \u201cthrottle\u201d is enough to almost flatten most hills, with major physical exertion required for only the steepest climbs. The tech is impressive. It has inbuilt lights that switch on with the electrics, a range of 55-88km a charge, an easy-to-read display and the ability to charge your phone on the go. The first hitch comes, though, in deciding where to put it. Outside seems too risky and it won\u2019t fit in the shed. I settle for the hall although this could not be a long-term solution given its bulkiness. This is really a bike for people with garage space or the nerves and insurance to keep it chained in the garden under cover. When it comes to loading on my children, they give it a very positive review as comfy and fun. There are no complaints about the ride to school apart from when I take a speed bump too fast. I\u2019m worried about fights breaking out behind me among tired passengers sitting close together, but they are too busy holding on and enjoying the ride for this to be a problem. The RadWagon is built to fit two Thule Yepp Maxi child seats for the youngest riders up until the age of about five. They are also not cheap and can be tricky to find secondhand but lovely, durable seats and easy to fit. Older children can ride with legs astride the central seat pads if they are confident holding on. Its maximum weight is 54kg, which is equivalent to about two children up to the age of eight or nine. Child-carrying cargo bikes are on the increase in London but they are not prevalent everywhere. The RadWagon attracts a lot of attention and compliments. A teenage boy stops to tell me I have \u201cnice wheels\u201d and I get curious looks from other parents. Several friends come round for a test. One who transports her children by non-electric cargo says she likes it but finds it a bit less responsive than her non-electric bucket bike. I still feel it is quite steady, if slightly cumbersome to wheel because of its size, with a low centre of gravity and thick tyres. It\u2019s time to return the RadWagon and I\u2019m considering whether to buy one of my own. The pull factors are the ease, fun and speed of travel, and the fact the children love it. The downsides are the price, parking and hassle if things go wrong. It feels like this type of cargo cycling is the future in cities \u2013 I think this really could replace a car, and be more enjoyable as a vehicle, for most local travel. But on a mass basis, this is only really going to happen as the cost comes down further."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94742", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/19/an-rac-call-out-ended-up-with-me-losing-my-beloved-rolls-royce", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "An RAC call-out ended up with me losing my beloved Rolls-Royce", "lead": "When it couldn\u2019t repair the Silver Spur, the RAC offered to take it to a specialist \u2026 then it went missing for six days", "author": "Miles Brignall", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 06:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548034", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fe122522b92348bc223b23064869d00bf81c7696/477_396_3626_2176/500.jpg", "body": "A couple of weeks ago you featured a story about the RAC losing a reader\u2019s car that it was supposed to be recovering to his home. I can \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 top that. In February, I was driving my immaculate Rolls-Royce Silver Spur \u2013 one of only a few built with a turbo \u2013 when it suddenly refused to engage reverse gear. The RAC patrolman who attended couldn\u2019t repair it and therefore offered to have it recovered back to the specialist Rolls and Bentley repairer that looks after it. Just as with your previous case, it then spent the next six days missing, with no one at the RAC willing, or able, to tell me my vehicle\u2019s whereabouts. When it eventually turned up at the specialist repairer, it had been significantly damaged. The RAC\u2019s response was that it would take 20 days to investigate. That passed. It then said it wanted another 20. That\u2019s the last I heard. I approached my insurer, Direct Line, and asked it to send an engineer to investigate, only to be told \u201cwe do not send out engineers on account of Covid\u201d. Without even examining the car, it then declared it a write-off, and sent me a cheque for \u00a319,000 without any explanation. Considering this a derisory offer, I sent it back. Direct Line then demanded the courtesy car, that it had only just supplied, be returned the next day at midnight, resulting in a nightmare journey back to Manchester in the bank holiday weekend traffic. To say I feel badly treated by both organisations is a huge understatement. I am 85 and was left without a car for weeks. The final indignity is that Direct Line has cancelled my insurance. LM, Manchester The whole thing sounds appalling, and I don\u2019t know which is worse - the RAC\u2019s cavalier attitude, or Direct Line\u2019s dismissive claim handling? It\u2019s probably the latter. To simply send you a cheque in a brown envelope without an explanation as to how it arrived at its valuation is bizarre, as is its refusal to send an engineer to examine the car. It also seems a very low offer on a very rare car with a much-sought-after engine. Direct Line, which has been hit by a surge in claims in recent months and is losing money, has apologised that its interactions with you have fallen below \u201cits usual high standards\u201d. However, it has refused to budge on its valuation, which it claims was determined by approaching multiple independent Rolls-Royce dealers. It has offered to return the car to you from its storage facility. For its part, the RAC claimed it was still waiting for you to provide evidence of the damage done by its contractor, and that once you have done so, it \u201cwill deal with it promptly\u201d. In your shoes, I would track down the damage evidence and use it to get the RAC to agree a settlement. I would then commission my own valuation of the car and use it to negotiate with Direct Line \u2013 ultimately using the Financial Ombudsman Service if needs be. For the replacement car, I would use a specialist classic car insurer with an agreed valuation, and I\u2019d definitely be finding another car recovery firm to sign up with. Wizz Air \u2013 a warning Anyone planning to jet off on Wizz Air in the coming weeks needs to be aware that the airline has controversially reduced the amount of time passengers have to check in online. Until now, those passengers not paying to choose a seat could check in up to 48 hours before their departure. Now it is 24 hours \u2013 presumably to get more passengers to pay for a seat, at which point you get a 30-day check-in. It is controversial because the airline has suffered a spate of technical glitches that has meant airline passengers could not check in online, with some forced to pay the equivalent of more than \u00a340 for a boarding pass at the airport.

It\u2019s a story of a confused young teenager finding his calling in life with the help of a nice girl and some wise mentors, unfolding at the beginning of the 1970s, and it has all the hippy-era trimmings: love beads, barefoot extras, vintage cars with old-school California black and orange licence plates, and many needle drops from bands like Fleetwood Mac, America and even the Animals, who are singing about the House of the Rising Sun. That last one is a curious choice given it\u2019s supposedly about a brothel of ill-repute, and this is a film about Christians, made by Christians and clearly for Christians. Moreover, just as Eric Burdon is hitting the high notes about the ruin of many a poor boy, it becomes clear that we\u2019re seeing one of the key characters in the story, the real-life figure of Lonnie Frisbee (played by Jonathan Roumie) as he parts ways with the others in the evangelical movement he helped start. The film suggests the rift is over Frisbee\u2019s enthusiasm for charismatic theology and faith healing, but in actuality he was outed as gay and excommunicated from the denominations he founded because of his homosexuality. Funnily enough, none of that is in Jesus Revolution, although that story would make for a fascinating film itself. Instead, we get a very sexless, happy clappy account of how evangelicalism collided with the hippy movement in Orange County via the encounter between Frisbee, an older Christian pastor named Chuck Smith (Kelsey Grammer), and Greg Laurie (Joel Courtney), a young congregant who years later would become a major player in the sect and a supporter of Donald Trump. The film focuses on the 1970s, when Laurie and his girlfriend Cathe (Anna Grace Barlow) are drawn to the movement as they grow disillusioned with the druggy ways of the other flower children they\u2019ve been hanging out with. Smith\u2019s embrace of Frisbee\u2019s preaching style, which includes a rock band wailing about Jesus and hordes of new converts that repulse the old Christian squares at Smith\u2019s church, is played as divine inspiration, not as the clever co-opting of youthful style by an establishment clergy at a time when the old ecclesiastical manner was very out of fashion. In the end, if you are not a faith-oriented viewer looking to drink the film\u2019s Kool-Aid, you might wish a different, secular film-maker was telling this story, able to examine how the Jesus movement intersected with the communal living of the time, and the rise of Christian cults that would lead to the Jonestown massacre and, in a different direction, the megachurches that now dominate Christianity around Los Angeles. In strictly formal terms, this is a well-enough-made work, but one that leaves out huge chunks of relevant detail and is essentially propaganda. It is fascinating as a text, but also richly sinister as it attempts to seduce the viewer with a narrative about redemption and love.

Woodpeckers drum and cuckoos call from on high, while around the trail, finches and thrushes flutter from tree to tree, avoiding beard lichens dripping off the branches. I\u2019m the first one out in the forest this morning (or the first human, at least), a feat easily achieved when you have spent the night here. The Dundreggan Rewilding Centre, the first of its kind in the world, opened in April and includes An Spiris, an L-shaped accommodation block with 20 double/twin rooms and a spacious communal area. \u201cNature shouldn\u2019t be exclusive,\u201d Laurelin Cummins-Fraser, the director of the rewilding centre, told me over a brew the day before. \u201cThis is a gateway to the landscape.\u201d Dundreggan is Trees for Life\u2019s 4,047-hectare (10,000-acre) example of \u201crewilding\u201d in action. The tree nursery grows thousands of saplings for planting, from rare aspen to montane tree species, and the landscape has changed dramatically since it bought the estate in 2008, with nature flourishing and ecosystems restored. Back then it was (like much of the Highlands) heavily overgrazed by deer, the numbers of which are kept unnaturally high on many Scottish estates for sport shooting \u2013 a trend dating back to Victorian times. After 15 years of rewilding at Dundreggan \u2013 and a reduction in deer numbers from about 16 a sq km to five (the ideal number for natural woodland regeneration is two to five in each sq km but in some parts of Scotland it exceeds 60) \u2013 there are now more than 4,000 species of plants and animals here, including rare globeflowers and red squirrels. Golden eagles even returned for the first time in 40 years in 2020 after an eyrie was built by the ecologist Roy Dennis \u2013 and chicks followed. The back door of An Spiris opens on to the walking trails. I stroll along Ceum a Fhraoich (the Heather Path), learning from the informative signage how Scots pine supports Scottish crossbills, and wild boars \u2013 reintroduced here in 2009 \u2013 dig up soil, allowing new life to take root. By the time I return from my walk, the rewilding centre has opened. It tells the story of a past where we lived alongside lynx, eagles and aurochs (extinct giant, wild cattle), among mountains green with trees and near rivers rich with salmon, where elk grazed in willow meadows birthed by beaver dams. It also tells of a modern-day Highland landscape that, despite its beauty, has been severely degraded in the centuries since, not least because of the Highland Clearances in the 1700s and 1800s. Vast areas were transformed from places of Gaelic-speaking subsistence farming to sparsely populated areas used for large-scale sheep farming, disastrous for wildlife and people. By the 1950s, only fragments of the Caledonian pinewood forests remained, and today, Scotland ranks 212th (28th worst) out of 240 countries and territories in the Biodiversity Intactness Index. \u201cThe Caledonian forest and the Gaelic culture and language both used to be widespread,\u201d says Cummins-Fraser. \u201cNow they only exist in remnants \u2013 but they can be brought back.\u201d Accordingly, all signage around Dundreggan is printed in English and Gaelic. As well as restoring fully functioning ecosystems \u2013 trees, plants and animals \u2013 in big enough numbers to fulfil their ecological role, rewilding is also a chance to bring back people. Last year, Trees for Life welcomed about 1,000 visitors to Dundreggan, mostly volunteers. Now the infrastructure is built, they\u2019re hoping 30,000 will pop in for a coffee or tour in their first year. There will be storytelling events, and bushcraft, foraging and photography workshops, too. The organisation has certainly expanded a lot since it was created by the ecologist Alan Watson Featherstone in 1986, with the aim of restoring the Caledonian forest in Glen Affric, one of Scotland\u2019s most beautiful glens, about 15 miles north of Dundreggan. Almost 2m trees have been planted since, and Trees for Life\u2019s work continues there too. Today, it\u2019s at the geographical centre of the Affric Highlands, a bigger collaborative project with Rewilding Europe launched in 2021, with a 30-year vision to rewild a huge area stretching from Loch Ness, in the central Highlands, out to Kintail in the west. Working with landowners and local people, the idea is that livelihoods will be boosted alongside nature regeneration \u2013 and \u201cslow tourism\u201d will play a part. The 44-mile Affric Kintail Way, which opened in 2015, already provides a waymarked route through the heart of the Affric Highlands, running from Drumnadrochit, on Loch Ness, to Morvich in Kintail. \u201cThe trail shows the diversity of the landscape,\u201d says Stephanie Kiel, Affric Highlands team leader. \u201cIt takes you through a glen that is fairly agricultural, with livestock and forestry plantation, and then to the wilder areas of Glen Affric, with lots of trees. Then it takes you through a spectacular landscape with mostly short vegetation, where deer numbers are much higher.\u201d To see the restoration work in action, I walk the route over four days, starting on the forest trails near Drumnadrochit. It\u2019s on day two, after climbing to a hidden viewpoint over Glen Affric, that the scenery bursts into life. Behind a mosaic woodland, Loch Beinn a\u2019 Mheadhoin glimmers, with a backdrop of Munros. It\u2019s the messiness of the rewilded forests that strikes me: the mix of sizes and shapes and species \u2013 old pines interspersed with little birch trees; the crooked oddities you don\u2019t get in monoculture plantations. The sun shines mercifully as I walk the 17 miles to Glen Affric youth hostel \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s most remote hostels (the quickest route in is a three-hour walk) leaving Loch Beinn a\u2019 Mheadhoin and joining Loch Affric, where a line of Scots pines snake beneath An Tudair Beag and reflect a mirror image back on the water. Golden sand beaches lead me to the River Affric, and as I round a bend, the 2-metre wingspan of a golden eagle cruises into sight. The hostel is idyllic; no internet or phone signal here, but there is a log fire. \u201cYou\u2019re brought back to nature,\u201d says Marc Phipps who runs it. \u201cIt\u2019s like time stood still \u2013 in the most beautiful way.\u201d The final day takes me past towering mountains with bare slopes and round the powerful Allt Grannda waterfall. Deer watch from a ridgeline as I descend to the picturesque Glen Lichd. Then it\u2019s a short stroll to Morvich. I saw the theory of rewilding in Dundreggan, and the complexities of modern land use on the Affric-Kintail Way, from pasture and plantations to wet deserts and vibrant, regenerating forest. \u201cIn 30 years I hope I\u2019ll be tottering through a regenerating area,\u201d says Kiel. \u201cYou\u2019ll still have those beautiful views and mountains, but with more complex and diverse nature; more animals and birdsong, and more people in the landscape, enjoying all of that. That would be my vision.\u201d Accommodation was provided by An Spiris, where doubles start at \u00a3125 (two-night minimum stay), including breakfast in the rewilding centre and \u00a310 towards an activity/tour, visitdundreggan.co.uk; and by Glen Affric youth hostel (\u00a326 a bed a night), hostellingscotland.org.uk."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94746", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/first-edition-ufos-united-states-david-grusch", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Monday briefing: Why new claims about UFOs have experts wondering if the truth really is out there", "lead": "In today\u2019s newsletter: A former US official said the country has \u201cintact\u201d alien vehicles \u2013 and changing attitudes mean some are taking the idea more seriously", "author": "Nimo Omer", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:46:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548105", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0173830c99fd345c6fd8e60ab5bc0a24d97f6b67/0_176_5122_3074/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning. As the world continues to be engulfed in metaphorical and literal flames, today\u2019s newsletter focuses on something that is potentially a little more unearthly. Unidentified flying objects, or unidentified anomalous phenomena (try saying that three times very quickly), are a gateway into a topic that has for decades been characterised by grainy footage and tinfoil hats. That is changing. A little known website called the Debrief reported that a former intelligence official named David Grusch said that the US government has possession of \u201cintact and partially intact\u201d alien vehicles. Unlike previous whistleblowers who have been dismissed as unhinged or conspiracy theorists, Grusch has impressive credentials: he was a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office and led analysis on unidentified anomalous phenomena (the official term for UFOs). His claims were also supported by Jonathan Grey, a current US intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, who confirmed the existence of \u201cexotic materials\u201d to the Debrief. At first, the revelations seemed pretty extraordinary. But in the week after the initial report, Grusch offered up more interviews in which he continued to make astonishing claims with no evidence, beyond that this information had come from \u201cseveral sources\u201d. Even though many are skeptical, the US congress is interested in hearing what Grusch has to say. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Greg Eghigian, a historian at Penn State University, who is writing a book on the history of UFO culture, to sort fact from science fiction. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Covid | A group representing the families of people who died of Covid-19 has expressed its disgust at a video that appears to show Tory party workers drinking alcohol and dancing during lockdown at a gathering at the Conservative party headquarters. The police have said they are \u201cconsidering\u201d the footage. Conservatives | Dozens of Tory MPs are preparing to abstain from voting in the Commons on Monday over the parliamentary investigation that found Boris Johnson deliberately misled MPs. The former PM has urged his supporters not to vote against the committee\u2019s findings. India | At least 96 people died in two of India\u2019s most populous states over the past several days because of a sweltering heatwave in which temperatures nearly soared to 45C. Police | Suella Braverman has called on police to increase the use of stop and search powers \u201cto prevent violence and save more lives\u201d. In a statement aimed at all 43 forces in England and Wales, the home secretary said officers who used the powers had her \u201cfull support\u201d. Business | The Labour party has moved closer to ending its boycott of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which began because of a sexual misconduct scandal first exposed by the Guardian, in an early sign that steps to rehabilitate the crisis-hit UK lobby group may be working. In depth: \u2018Close to a majority of academics now believe UFOs warrant scholarly research\u2019 America\u2019s fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrials is deeply entrenched, with theories about government coverups and covert operations rife across the country. Initially, the claims made by Grusch fed this insatiable need to find out more about these mysterious objects and how much the government knows about them, so much so that the US House of Representatives launched an investigation into his claims. But as time has gone on, cracks have started to emerge and many are starting to wonder how accurate these claims really are. *** How big is this story? I\u2019m going to have to disappoint you all from the outset: this is not quite the smoking raygun moment that changes the course of history. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s just a lot of second and third hand information,\u201d Eghigian says. \u201cThe whistleblower has not said that he has seen any physical evidence himself or touched a \u2018flying saucer\u2019. He simply has said that he has seen some documents.\u201d In short, this story does not quite pass the smell test. Grusch\u2019s claims have also expanded since the original report in the Debrief, adding in subsequent interviews that the US had also found alien pilots and that some of the crafts were the size of an American football field (about three-quarters of a regular football field). Despite adding these details, Grusch has failed to show any evidence nor said he has seen any of these things first-hand. The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, an office within the purview of the Department of Defence set up to investigate UAPs, has denied all of the claims made by Grusch. With all this in mind, Eghigian encourages caution, which is pretty characteristic given his academic background as a historian. He also points out that this pattern, of somebody who previously worked in some kind of federal department, coming forward with bombshell allegations, has been going on since the 1950s. Eghigian is also skeptical about the veracity of these claims because it looks like Grusch followed Pentagon protocol in publishing this information, meaning that the Department of Defence approved the information he would pass on to the press, which is something the department only does if the information is not classified. If Grusch is telling the truth, surely this information would be classified, Eghigian says, and the department would not have allowed him to go on the record. *** Growing interest in UFOs Historically, research into UAPs has been relegated to the space of conspiracy theories, with scientists dismissing evidence as unreliable sightings made by eccentric hobbyists. But in the last six years, following the revelations from an explosive New York Times report that uncovered the existence of a defunct secret Pentagon program set up to investigate \u201cunidentified flying objects\u201d, there has been surging interest in rigorously and scientifically examining these objects. \u201cOne big change is the involvement of Nasa \u2013 last week it set up a public panel alongside a committee and they are setting out a roadmap for looking into UAPs,\u201d Eghigian says. \u201cThat\u2019s unprecedented. Nasa, historically, wanted nothing to do with UFOs and the fact that these civilian scientists are asking scientifically informed questions, that\u2019s new.\u201d This shift has helped legitimate interest in understanding and researching UAPs in universities as well: \u201cI\u2019ve seen in academia there is much more willingness for people to openly talk about investigating and studying this topic.\u201d Eghigian has been to major conferences in the past two years, where the primary topic of discussion was UAPs. \u201cClose to a majority of academics now believe that the study of UFOs warrants scholarly research. That\u2019s a sea change.\u201d Eghigian attributes this transition in opinion to the fact that the US intelligence and military services have said that some of these UAPs are not optical illusions or computer glitches or result of mass hysteria. In 2021, the Pentagon released a report on UAPs which found more than 140 instances of UAP encounters that could not be explained. Officials at the time did not rule out the possibility that the objects are extraterrestrial. *** Is it just an American obsession? While it certainly feels like a \u201cdecidedly American\u201d obsession, there are a number of other countries that have spent significant amounts of money, time and expertise on tracking down UAPs. France, for example, has had a state-run department (albeit a small one) dedicated to investigating unidentified objects. The UK and Denmark had one too but they were shut down due to budget cuts. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say however that the United States was always the major hub for the coverage of this phenomenon,\u201d Eghigian concludes. *** What might happen next? The House of Representatives plans to hold a hearing on Grusch\u2019s claims in the coming weeks, headed up by Republicans Tim Burchett, who appeared on a podcast with far right figure Steve Bannon to talk about UAPs, and Anna Paulina Luna, who believes the government has been lying to the public about UAPs for decades. So it seems that Grusch\u2019s claims are resonating with a particular faction of congress that are prone to indulging in conspiracies. For those more interested in evidence based research, curiosity about UAPs continues to grow. Eghigian predicts far more buy in from other academic disciplines: \u201cWe\u2019ll likely see interdisciplinary research from a lot of different angles: scholars in social science, philosophy, religious studies studying this phenomenon, as well as the natural sciences.\u201d This is a transitional period for the study of UAPs. But, like everything else in academia, it will be a slow multi-pronged approach that does not yield the big \u201cwow\u201d moments that capture headlines. Until a flying saucer lands in front of the White House, that is.

The impasse prompted a blunt crossbench message that the Greens were \u201churting people\u201d while Labor\u2019s Dan Farrell called the Greens and Coalition \u201cthe axis of evil\u201d. A Greens motion proposing to delay the bill until 16 October to \u201callow time for national cabinet to progress reforms to strengthen renters\u2019 rights\u201d was voted up 37 votes to 23 about noon on Monday. A bid by Labor to vote on the bill on Tuesday was defeated. That is despite the prime minister, Anthony Albanese offering an extra $2bn of direct spending on social and affordable housing on Saturday, and a warning from Farrell that the government would regard the delay as \u201cfailure to pass\u201d the bill. Such a failure is the first step in a double dissolution election, which would give the government the option of sending Australians back to the polls after a second failed attempt to pass a bill. The Greens party room met on Monday morning, after which Senator Sarah Hanson-Young stood in the Senate announcing the planned delay. Hanson-Young said the Greens \u201cwould like for us to postpone that bill until the prime minister can show what he is going to do to relieve real pressure on one-third of Australian households\u201d who rent. She said after \u201cmonths of being told there was nothing the government could do\u201d, Labor had found \u201ca bit of cash stashed down the back of the couch\u201d, promising $2bn over the weekend. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Farrell, Labor\u2019s deputy Senate leader, in the chamber labelled the Greens and the Coalition the \u201caxis of evil\u201d. The housing minister, Julie Collins, said \u201cevery day of delay is more than $1.3m that does not go to housing for people that need it\u201d. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, and housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, were due to discuss the party\u2019s stance at a press conference on Monday afternoon. In a statement, Bandt said \u201cunlimited rent increases should be illegal\u201d. \u201cThe pressure is now on the prime minister and the Labor premiers to act on a rent freeze and limit rent increases. \u201cThis is a test for Labor. It\u2019s wall-to-wall Labor across the mainland, so rent rises are their responsibility.\u201d Chandler-Mather said \u201cpressure works\u201d in seeking outcomes for renters, urging Greens supporters to \u201chold the line\u201d. In question time, Albanese labelled the Greens and Coalition an \u201cunholy alliance\u201d and argued that a rent freeze would \u201cdestroy supply\u201d. \u201c[The Greens] deal in protests, we deal in progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see issues to campaign on, we see challenges to act on. They want to build their profile, we want to build more homes.\u201d The bill sets up a $10bn future fund to invest and pay out earnings of at least $500m a year to invest in social and affordable housing. Chandler-Mather has spent months attacking the future fund model as a form of \u201cgambling\u201d, forcing concessions from the government including guaranteeing the $500m annual disbursement as a minimum, not a maximum, and the $2bn of direct investment. In April, the Albanese government asked national cabinet and housing ministers to examine renters\u2019 rights, which the Greens hope could develop into a rent freeze or an Australian Capital Territory-style rent cap. But Labor has so far refused the Greens\u2019 calls to set up a fund of at least $1bn to incentivise states and territories to institute a rent freeze for two years. The motion reads: \u201cThat, to allow time for national cabinet to progress reforms to strengthen renters\u2019 rights as advised in the prime minsters\u2019 press release of 28 April 2023, including reforms to limit rent increases, further consideration of the bill and two related bills be made an order of the day for 16 October.\u201d The Senate\u2019s decision means there will be a further four months of impasse on the bill because the government needs the Greens\u2019 11 votes to pass it. The country\u2019s peak housing bodies called for the debate deadlock to be broken and for the fund to be passed this week. That call was backed by senators David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie, who announced they would support the bill. The crossbench senator Tammy Tyrrell said by continuing to oppose the bill, the Greens were not looking after the people who elected them. \u201cYou\u2019re harming people. You\u2019re not allowing them to have a house into the future,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThey are the ones that are holding all of these people to ransom and I think that\u2019s a terrible thing. \u201cAt the end of the day you\u2019re hurting people.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94748", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/tv-tonight-chris-mccausland-and-harry-hill-enjoy-a-very-funny-holiday-together", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TV tonight: Chris McCausland and Harry Hill enjoy a very funny holiday together", "lead": "They explore the wonders of Athens.

Surrounded by homophobia on the streets and from the pulpit, the couple struggle to be themselves \u2013 but this is far from a Shakespearean tragedy, and the girls\u2019 relationship proves a match for society\u2019s prejudices.

The International Labour Organization (ILO), a UN agency, said the UK needed to \u201censure that existing and prospective legislation is in conformity\u201d with international rules on freedom of association, and added that the government must seek technical assistance from the agency\u2019s experts. The ILO also concluded the government should allow unions to electronically ballot workers \u2013 rather than relying on strictly controlled postal votes. It should also improve consultation with unions and limit government powers to ensure they \u201cdo not interfere with the autonomy and functioning of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organisations\u201d. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) described the ILO\u2019s conclusions, delivered last week by a committee on labour standards, as a \u201chugely embarrassing\u201d reprimand for the UK government. The TUC, the UK\u2019s main union body, lodged a complaint against the UK government in September. The complaint alleged that ministers had taken steps to attack the right to strike, which has been protected by an ILO convention since 1948. The TUC said it was the first time the UK had been told to seek technical assistance since 1995 under John Major\u2019s Conservative government. The conclusions were delivered by a committee that also considered alleged issues in authoritarian regimes such as El Salvador, Gabon and Turkmenistan. The ILO intervention comes ahead of the first anniversary of the biggest wave of industrial action seen in Britain in three decades. During the unrest, which began on 21 June 2022 with a strike by rail workers, workers across the private and public sector have protested for higher pay and better conditions, , with warehouse and port workers, Royal Mail employees, junior doctors, teachers and even barristers taking action. The committee\u2019s conclusions represent a blow to the UK government, which had repeatedly denied accusations of making deliberate attacks on the right to strike, and had even argued that the ILO backed its rules. Paul Nowak, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThis is hugely embarrassing for the Conservative government and speaks to the scale of anti-union attacks on their watch. \u201cThe right to strike is a fundamental freedom. But the Conservatives are attacking it in broad daylight with the draconian strikes bill.\u201d The government\u2019s latest strikes legislation, the strikes (minimum service levels) bill, is in its final stages in parliament. The bill, led by the former business minister Grant Shapps, threatens to make attendance at work compulsory throughout industrial action in several sectors, including the health service, fire and rescue services, education, transport, nuclear decommissioning and border security. The police, army and some prison officers are already banned from striking. Newer restrictions also include increasing the minimum notice period for industrial action from two weeks to four, and raising the threshold for industrial action to support from 50% of members. MPs last year also voted through a law to allow companies to employ agency workers to replace striking staff. The new laws have faced a barrage of criticism from unions, opposition politicians, parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights and even employers. Business groups have argued against several of the changes, including one law allowing companies to employ agency workers to replace striking workers. \u201cThe truth is that the UK already has some of the most restrictive trade union laws in Europe,\u201d said Nowak. \u201cThese new anti-strike curbs will poison industrial relations and do nothing to resolve current disputes.\u201d In response to the committee, the UK\u2019s representative agreed to report back on progress in addressing the issues by 1 September. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe right to join a union and organise is protected in law, but the British people also expect the government to act in circumstances where their rights and freedoms are being disproportionately impacted by strikes. \u201cThat is why we have introduced legislation to implement minimum service levels, which are common across many countries, including in the EU.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9474a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/boris-johnson-brexit-partygate-tories", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "People voted for Boris Johnson knowing he was a liar.

Watch out for them, as in the next few weeks they will be unsparingly deployed to explain how the hell someone like Boris Johnson ever came within sniffing distance of Downing Street. An exercise in orphaning Johnson that has been afoot for a few months will now reach its sad conclusion. His failure will have no fathers and his success will be attributed to an abstract set of conditions that conspired to make his premiership inevitable. Like a monster released from enclosure in an iceberg as it is thawed by a warm weather front, Johnson arrived in Westminster to wreak havoc, until finally the Swat team of British democratic norms and institutions took him out. His critics will issue plaintive laments about the tragedy of a Brexit that carried him into No 10 with a huge majority, and say that he only has himself to blame for coming undone. Johnson is simply a wrong \u2019un who was never fit to be prime minister, as the Tory MP David Gauke surmised. This is true, of course, but the problem is he\u2019s the type of wrong that we sort of like. Because he had qualities that still, deep down in our national psyche, made him forgivable. Here you need to watch out for what has become a national pastime \u2013 psychoanalysing Boris Johnson, almost dissecting him. What a grotesque creature, we will be told, as he is pinned on the slab and pored over again. How did this uniquely mendacious man come to so undermine the dignity of his post and \u201ctake us all for fools\u201d \u2013 as the Spectator (yes, the Spectator) wrote? That psychoanalysis is best directed at a political culture that has a deference to public schoolboys, to the entitled confidence of unearned privilege, and to the sort of upper-class persona that, as Oscar Wilde described, treats \u201call the trivial things of life seriously, and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality\u201d. Johnson\u2019s success in consciously leveraging these qualities \u2013 ruffling his hair, shaking hands with \u201ceverybody\u201d in a hospital ward in the early days of Covid, and assuring us that Brexit was a piece of cake \u2013 was, you will also be told, an example of the perils of \u201cpopulism\u201d. He thrived because of his ability to charm, rather than because of Britain\u2019s fondness for an aristocratic class that, with a glint in its eye, reassures us that it is entirely unflapped by the challenges of power. Conditions matter, of course. Brexit, its irreconcilable goals, its complicated border protocols and its challenges to the very union of the United Kingdom, needed a figure that could rise above its vexatious details, not get bogged down in them like Theresa May did. Johnson\u2019s battering ram approach to Brexit and his unlawful proroguing of parliament in the process was exactly the sort of behaviour he was elected for. But that hardly explains the glee with which large parts of the media received the prospect of a Boris Johnson premiership. The 2019 election brought with it a \u201csense of slightly unfocused excitement\u201d, of \u201czing\u201d, of Johnson\u2019s \u201cwhiz-bang, sparkle, fizz, gusto, passion \u2013 and fun\u201d, wrote Matthew Parris in the Times. Sure, the paper\u2019s editorial said before the 2019 election, Johnson does have \u201can on-off relationship with the truth\u201d and often prefers \u201cbluster to grasp of detail\u201d, but unlike his opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, at least Johnson\u2019s faults were \u201cin plain sight\u201d. The subtext is clear \u2013 he\u2019s a liar, but he\u2019s our liar. And Brexit still doesn\u2019t explain why, even after a damning report about his lies to parliament and his departure from political life, the Daily Mail anoints him again with a column and handsome remuneration for it. He then, with his supporters surely expecting an unfiltered account of the sabotaging of his political career, duly filed a half-arsed column about diet medication. Because it\u2019s never really about the quality of what Johnson delivers, but the style in which he does it, the very flippant contempt for that quality that many still can\u2019t wean themselves off. It wasn\u2019t the red wall, or Brexit, that handed Johnson a voice in a national newspaper, as his support leaches away and parliament prepares to vote on the Partygate report. It was an indulgence of the man and what he represents. Johnson embodies the useful spirit of a nihilistic Brexit, which was always about concentrating power in the hands of rightwing interests rather than divesting it to the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. He serves as a bulwark against political institutions, civil service processes and the rules of law that, if allowed to take their course, would defenestrate, or at least challenge, the stock and trade of certain rightwing media interests \u2013 projecting fears of a shadowy cabal of woke progressive powers that, in the words of Rishi Sunak, seeks to \u201ccancel our values, our history and our women\u201d. As long as Johnson is in play, he is a useful tool in this campaign. And what of Sunak, our grownup prime minister at last? \u201cOne of the most remarkable people I\u2019ve ever met\u201d is how he described Johnson in 2022. We simply cannot be expected to believe that it was only one specific and poorly timed lie about partying that finally revealed Johnson for what he is. Or that, as footage leaks of Tories dancing and mocking Covid-19 laws in December 2020, that Conservative party officials and MPs who behaved badly were simply channelling Johnson\u2019s disdain for the public, rather than expressing their own. This is not a call for a blame exercise, although God knows there\u2019s enough to go round, but a plea for a self-reflection that takes stock of how we came to thrust a notoriously well-known charlatan into the country\u2019s highest office, and then proceeded to blame him for that decision. One of the reasons British politics has a feel of unreality and triviality to it at the moment isn\u2019t down to Brexit stripping it of seriousness and integrity. It is because with Johnson, as with the governmental debacle during the pandemic, we are constantly finding ever more elaborate ways to explain away what are structural weaknesses in our political culture. We are stuck with a system that indulges useless, morally vacuous politicians as long as they don\u2019t threaten to reshape the economy or political culture to the benefit of those who need a strong public sector, affordable housing, fairer distribution of income and the sort of compassion that would give refugees their internationally mandated human rights. If those politicians can maintain this merciless world with flair, even better. If they fail, away from the scene of the car crash we will speed. As we do so, perhaps we can be diverted by the scenery of the many troubling but ultimately superficial outrages that now dominate our political life: peerages; Nadine Dorries; Sunak\u2019s helicopters and heated swimming pool. Anything to stop us seeing the faults that, like Johnson\u2019s, hide in plain sight. Never looking back, always racing headlong into the next disaster.

Staff working in the transformation directorate, the unit handling changes meant to prevent a repeat of the scandal, were told in an online meeting that it would be closing at the end of this month. Civil servants in two London-based teams within the directorate, working on the Home Office\u2019s post-Windrush cleanup exercise have been told their work would be terminated on 1 July, sources said. Employees in a third team were told their work would no longer be led from the department\u2019s London headquarters, and have been offered the chance to work with a Sheffield-based unit. Some Home Office staff have expressed concern that their work is being wound up before the promised commitments to reform the department have been completed. In the five years since the government first apologised for misclassifying thousands of Commonwealth-born people living legally in the UK as illegal immigrants, successive home secretaries have promised to oversee \u201ccomprehensive reform\u201d of Home Office to ensure a similar scandal could never be repeated. Over the past six months, Braverman has been forced to acknowledge that she had dropped key commitments, which would have increased independent scrutiny of immigration policies. But the decision to disband the transformation directorate marks a more decisive move away from the post-Windrush reform agenda. Three teams within the directorate were working on post-Windrush issues \u2013 one on ethics, another on training and monitoring the progress on reform commitments, and a third on engagement with those affected by the scandal. Staff in the first two have been told their work is over; those in the engagement team have been told they can apply to merge with the Sheffield-based compensation team. Work to compensate those affected by the Windrush issues remains unaffected and continues. The cross-government working group on Windrush, which was set up to monitor progress on the reform agenda, has also been told it will disband after a final meeting this summer. Analysis published in February of progress towards meeting 30 agreed post-Windrush reform promises showed just eight had been met, 13 had been partially met and nine had not been met or dropped. Work was ongoing on assessing the effectiveness of \u201chostile environment\u201d legislation (which requires immigration checks before people can access work, benefits and services). A commitment to identify victims proactively, particularly non-Caribbean people, was not complete. Among other things, a promise to improve the UK visa and immigration customer service was also not deemed to have been completed; work on ensuring civil servants highlighted to ministers how vulnerable people may be affected by new policies was also not finished. Some staff who were in the call expressed concern about the possible reputational damage to the Home Office of winding down this work. \u201cThey asked what advice had been given to ministers, and to stakeholders, and how it left our commitments to implementing the Windrush recommendations,\u201d a source said, adding that the staff had not received a clear response. \u201cThe staff in those teams feel that the commitment is being watered down. People who work in the Windrush engagement team are unhappy about this.\u201d The timing of the decision has also caused dismay among staff. This Thursday marks the 75th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush in Britain and Buckingham Palace and Downing Street are preparing to host events. In the wake of the scandal, the government agreed to mark Windrush Day on 22 June as an annual celebration of the contribution of that generation of immigrants to the UK. Those affected by the scandal come from a much wider cohort of people than the descendants of those who arrived on the ship; people who arrived as children in the UK in the 1950s and 60s from India, Pakistan, the former UK colonies in Africa and elsewhere were affected. However, the scandal has been particularly associated with people who came from the Caribbean in the decades after the arrival of Empire Windrush in 1948. The transformation directorate, which is staffed by 20 to 30 people, was expanded a few years ago to make sure the recommendations made by Wendy Williams, the independent investigator who assessed the causes of the scandal, were embedded into Home Office culture. The department source said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot still to do to make sure we from what happened with Windrush particularly in the light of some of the illegal migration bill proposals. I\u2019m worried that it signals of rolling back from the commitments that we publicly made about not repeating those mistakes. If there\u2019s no team responsible for monitoring progress then the work won\u2019t happen.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said the department would not comment on leaks, but added: \u201cThere have been and will continue to be team changes as the Windrush response is delivered. The government is honouring its Windrush commitments and providing support to those affected every day. Over \u00a372m compensation has been paid or offered already and the scheme will stay open as long as needed.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9474c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/suella-braverman-tells-police-to-ramp-up-use-of-stop-and-search", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Suella Braverman tells police to ramp up use of stop and search", "lead": "UK home secretary says police have her full support in using tactic to prevent violence and save lives", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548209", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de8d88c577ae5bebd2eeae18b47646c988abc198/0_330_5130_3077/500.jpg", "body": "Suella Braverman has called on police to increase the use of stop and search powers \u201cto prevent violence and save more lives\u201d.

Her comments are likely to alarm critics of stop and search who point out that the technique disproportionately targets black and minority ethnic communities. Government statistics suggest black people are seven times more like to be stopped and searched compared with white people. Campaign groups have previously said relaxing restrictions on police use of stop and search could compound discrimination. In remarks that appear to be aimed at addressing anticipated criticism, Braverman said young black males were disproportionately affected by knife crime. Her statement says: \u201cCarrying weapons is a scourge on our society, and anyone doing so is risking their own lives as well as the lives of those around them. This dangerous culture must be brought to a stop. \u201cMy first priority is to keep the public safe, and people who insist on carrying a weapon must know that there will be consequences. The police have my full support to ramp up the use of stop and search, wherever necessary, to prevent violence and save more lives.\u201d Braverman\u2019s statement expresses backing for the police in tackling knife crime among young black males. \u201cEvery death from knife crime is a tragedy,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I also back the police in tackling this blight in communities which are disproportionately affected, such as among young black males. We need to do everything in our power to crack down on this violence.\u201d Earlier this month, the head of the police inspectorate in England and Wales, Andy Cooke, acknowledged that the use of stop and search \u201cpolarises the public\u201d. But in his first state of policing report, he insisted that stop and search was an effective way of deterring crime and showing police visibility on the street. He said police leaders should explain why it had been used disproportionally against black people. Launching the report, he said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that the police are being racist \u2026 There\u2019s also more disproportionality for victims. It is four times more likely as a black man to be murdered than a young white man.\u201d The inspectorates audited 8,902 stop and search records in 2020 and 2021 and found that 83.9% were reasonable. But it said the overall figures masked considerable differences between forces.

The government is being urged to adopt amendments to the online safety bill enabling researchers to access platform data in order to monitor harmful material. Access would be overseen by Ofcom, the communications watchdog, and would protect user privacy. The amendments tabled by the Conservative peer James Bethell are supported by groups including the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and the children\u2019s safety charity the NSPCC. They are also backed by the Molly Rose Foundation, established by the family of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old who took her own life after viewing social media content related to depression, suicide and self-harm. In an open letter to the government, the campaign groups said the bill was in \u201cserious peril\u201d of passing without the power to make social media platforms more transparent. The bill is passing through the Lords, with outstanding amendments put forward by peers due to be debated on Thursday as it enters the final stages of its legislative progress. \u201cWe ask the government to support the data access amendments, supporting the researchers, academics and experts who work in real-time to empower and inform the British public about the online harms that affect their lives,\u201d said the letter. The letter adds that online safety researchers are already being stymied by Twitter, which is charging \u00a333,000 a month to access data that was free previously. Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of CCDH, said that without Lord Bethell\u2019s amendment \u201cwe might well end up with less transparent, less accountable and less safe social media platforms\u201d. The Bethell amendment will require platforms to follow a code of practice, set by Ofcom, that will oversee independent researchers\u2019 access to platform data and what sort of harms they can research \u2013 with platforms then providing the requisite data for researchers to investigate those issues. Researchers will also have to meet standards on independence and privacy before being appointed by Ofcom. Concerns about the amendment include the mandating of access to sensitive data and the potential for unintended consequences to handing over such information to researchers. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe online safety bill is currently undergoing detailed scrutiny in the House of Lords, with a wide range of issues being debated. The government will continue to consider arguments made by peers at committee stage, and in the proceeding stages of the bill\u2019s passage.\u201d Other amendments put forward in the Lords include strengthening online age-checking to ensure children are not exposed to pornography and requiring Ofcom to issue a code of practice on preventing violence against women and girls that social media platforms would have to follow when implementing their duties under the bill. The prospect of tougher age-checking measures has alarmed some platforms. The Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts Wikipedia, has warned it will not carry out age verification if required to do so by the act, raising the possibility it will fail to comply with the legislation. The bill requires sites such as Wikipedia to actively prevent children from encountering pornographic material, with the bill in its current form referring to age verification as one of the possible tools for this. Rebecca MacKinnon, the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s vice-president of global advocacy, told the Guardian Wikipedia would be \u201cout of compliance\u201d with the people if it was required to monitor users\u2019 ages because of the organisation\u2019s pledge to collect minimal data on users. \u201cThe Wikimedia movement is creating and running platforms for very specific educational and public interest purposes.

I have a lot of experience of being excluded from numerous courtrooms due to wholly inadequate access. The building that I was originally appointed to was an old medieval building in Maldon, Essex, and it wasn\u2019t accessible. We then merged with another small [magistrates] bench in Witham. I couldn\u2019t get up three flights of stairs to the upper floor where there are two courts so I used to only sit in hearings on the ground floor. A few years later, as the court estate started to shrink, we were merged with Chelmsford and that\u2019s where things got really challenging. Then the magistrates court sat in the Shire Hall, which I think I\u2019m right in saying was built in 1791. It\u2019s a marvellous building but not fit for purpose as a magistrates court, it had these crazy stairs. The thing that really got me was that the assembly room where everyone would meet to start the day and prepare was on the top floor. I had to sit [alone] in the retiring room [on the ground floor]. I just became Billy No-Mates. That\u2019s when I really considered chucking it in, I was being excluded. My wife actually said: \u201cWhy are you persevering with this?\u201d Something just motivated me to stick with it and try to change what I thought was wrong and that\u2019s motivated me to this day. A report by the Law Society on court access a few years ago identified one of the courts where I sit, Colchester, as the best court in the country for access. It\u2019s qualified by the fact that it was the newest court. We have seen progress but the thing that strikes me is when you achieve good levels of access of certain parts of the court state, if anything, it creates a stark contrast with other buildings. The challenges that I had to overcome 20-odd years ago are live and real today for colleagues in other parts of the country."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9474f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/dozens-of-tory-mps-expected-to-abstain-in-vote-on-committees-partygate-report", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dozens of Tory MPs expected to abstain in vote on committee\u2019s Partygate report", "lead": "Rightwingers claim Boris Johnson suspension \u2018unnecessarily high and fierce\u2019 after findings he deliberately misled parliament", "author": "Aletha Adu Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548259", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/afcc3b746e7a52f3ebaf249b373f17fc30492684/0_203_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Dozens of Tory rightwing MPs are preparing to abstain from voting in the Commons on Monday over the parliamentary investigation that found Boris Johnson deliberately misled MPs, in a sign of support for the former prime minister. Between 60 and 70 MPs with constituencies in the \u201cred wall\u201d were said to be feeling \u201cincredibly warm\u201d towards Johnson, after he urged his parliamentary supporters not to vote against the committee\u2019s findings. The senior cabinet minister Michael Gove said on Sunday he disagreed with the outcome of the privileges committee investigation, and that he planned to abstain in the Commons. He said the committee\u2019s recommendation that Johnson be suspended for 90 days over repeated contempts of parliament was \u201cnot merited\u201d. However, he refused to be drawn on whether he believed the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, should back the report, saying it was a matter for \u201ceach individual\u201d MP to decide for themselves. While Johnson cannot serve the penalty because he has quit parliament, the cross-party group of MPs chaired by Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman has recommended that he be banned from holding a pass to access parliament. Gove said it was not right to reduce the report to a \u201csingle badge to pin on Boris Johnson\u201d, as there were \u201ccomplexities\u201d in it. Speaking to BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, the levelling up secretary said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the conclusion, however, personally \u2026 The decision to impose a 90-day penalty is not merited by the evidence that the committee has put forward.\u201d Many rightwing Tory MPs said their lack of support for the committee\u2019s investigation was based on what they described as an \u201cunnecessarily high and fierce\u201d suspension of Johnson. One senior rightwing Tory MP told the Guardian: \u201cNinety days is completely absurd. At least 20 days seemed reasonable and not like it was plucked out of thin air, but 90 days feels as though they were just out to get him.\u201d Another said many MPs across the Conservative party held Harriet Harman in \u201chigh regard\u201d, claiming she was not the reason for their abstention, but that it was the handling of the recommendations by the committee. In one rightwing Tory WhatsApp group, a \u201cred wall\u201d MP of the 2019 intake was said to have described Johnson as a \u201ctop man\u201d who just \u201cwants all of us to be able to move on \u2026 I\u2019ve got huge respect for him for that.\u201d A rightwing Conservative source said: \u201cJohnson has done himself a huge favour by letting colleagues off the hook, without feeling like they have to come out and bat for him in the Commons. \u201cSince he called off the pressure on them to vote against the motion, there is a bizarre amount of respect, and sudden warmth to Boris, with so much good feeling about his future. \u201cIt seems to me to be a bit of a genius move. It makes his comeback much easier. We could be looking at the middle of a Tory opposition for his return.\u201d By abstaining, many rightwing Tories feel as though they will be able to silently vote against the motion without being grilled by the media and constituents about why they are backing the former prime minister after the committee concluded he had deliberately misled parliament. The Tory backbencher Bill Cash wrote in the Sunday Telegraph he would vote against the report, but the former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland told Times Radio he would endorse it if it came to a division, highlighting the importance of \u201cthe overall authority and standing of the House of Commons\u201d. The sanctions proposed by the Tory-majority committee are expected to pass regardless, with only a relatively small group of Johnson loyalists expected to oppose the report\u2019s findings in the vote. The former Conservative minister Justine Greening urged the growing number of Tory MPs who were considering abstaining to back the committee\u2019s work. \u201cIt would be easier to persuade the public that we have moved on from it if MPs simply went into the House of Commons on Monday and supported the privileges committee report,\u201d she told the BBC."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94750", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/the-great-face-off-16-of-the-most-wonderful-portraits-ever-painted", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The great face off: 16 of the most wonderful portraits ever painted ", "lead": "As the National Portrait Gallery prepares for its grand reopening this week, critics, artists and curators pick their favourite works from 500 years of portraiture", "author": "Adrian Searle, Rianna Jade Parker, Nicholas Cullinan, Alison Smith, Chlo\u00eb Ashby,  Thomas J Price,Jonathan Jones, Aindrea Emelife, Skye Sherwin, Stuart Jeffries, Claire Armitstead, Eliza Goodpasture, Katy Hessel, Hannah Clugston and Oliver Basciano", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548276", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f60ab4e86bf6e2ea70c1261dfa698ce9ea013fa6/774_58_2486_1492/500.jpg", "body": "Searching, wondering and staring eyes Self-Portrait of Suffering by Ibrahim El-Salahi, 1961 The African modernist El-Salahi studied at the Slade in London in the 1950s and western modernism clearly influenced him. El-Salahi\u2019s work has often delved into the personal and here we see him in a confused, uncertain state of mind. I am reminded of the gaping mouth of Munch\u2019s Scream, or the bull in Picasso\u2019s Guernica, given the equine nature of the face. The hair is manic but orderly, coiled and framing deep, endless concentric circles of eyes \u2013 searching, wondering and staring somehow both at us and into the abyss. Portraits at the precipice of melancholy or mania are the most attractive to me. They are honest and human. Aindrea Emelife Messy domestic moments Sid James by Ruskin Spear, 1962 This collage captures both the funny and sad: how life is made up of grand aspirations and messy little domestic settings. We watch comedian Sid James on TV in Hancock\u2019s Half Hour, but also see what looks like an invitation to the opening of a Henry Moore exhibition, a CND flyer, as well as adverts for remedies for colds, flu and rheumatism on the coffee table. Maybe we\u2019ll just stay in by the telly. Alison Smith, National Portrait Gallery chief curator \u2018I\u2019m a grown-ass woman\u2019 Sadie (Zadie Smith) by Toyin Ojih Odutola, 2018-19 This new commission will be shown for the first time at the National Portrait Gallery when it reopens on 22 June. Zadie Smith is one of the greatest literary voices of our time and Toyin Ojih Odutola is one of the most exciting artists, so this work is the perfect pairing. It\u2019s also the first work by Toyin to enter a British public collection. As Smith said: \u201cI know her art will have a tremendous effect on young people because I\u2019m a grown-ass woman and it\u2019s had a tremendous effect on me. Becoming familiar with her images is like having something I missed and wanted in childhood delivered to me now, as an adult. And to be a Toyin creation myself, on the walls of the portrait gallery? It\u2019s incredible.\u201d Nicholas Cullinan, NPG director \u2018I see my own family in this\u2019 Bonnie Greer (\u201cPortrait d\u2019une Negresse\u201d) by Maud Sulter, 2002 One of my favourite portraits at the National Portrait Gallery is part of the Reframing Narratives exhibition, which celebrates female artists and sitters. It\u2019s Bonnie Greer (\u201cPortrait d\u2019une Negresse\u201d), by Maud Sulter. This photograph pays homage to Marie-Guillemine Benoist, an 18th-century French artist who uplifted black female figurative art during a time of slavery. As I gaze at Sulter\u2019s portrait, I can\u2019t help seeing my own family reflected in the image: my mother, my aunts, my grandmother. It is a powerful representation of the women who have shaped my life. What resonates is its sense of growth and empowerment. Sulter captures the essence of female strength and reimagines it through the giving of a name and the act of clothing the subject. It signifies the reclaiming of identity and the celebration of womanhood. Violeta Sofia, artist and photographer A mother\u2019s sheer desperation Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California by Dorothea Lange, 1936 Some portraits are a window into the souls of their subjects. Others tell the story of a time or place. This iconic portrait of Florence Owens Thompson is both. It has become a touchstone image of 20th-century America, immediately evoking the gritty desolation and human cost of the Great Depression. Lange made the portrait, currently showing in Capturing the Moment at London\u2019s Tate Modern, while an employee of the US government \u2013 she was one of many artists who were paid to document the realities of the Depression as part of New Deal programmes. So while this conveys a mother\u2019s sheer desperation, it is also a reminder of a time in which artists were important enough to include in the most far-reaching welfare programme in US history. It\u2019s hard to imagine the same decision being made today \u2013 but the magnetism of this portrait lives on. Eliza Goodpasture Who has the winning hand? The Domino Players by Errol Lloyd, 1986 When Errol Lloyd was asked to contribute to Caribbean Expressions in Britain, a 1986 show at the Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery, the Jamaican-born artist immediately submitted the title, medium, dimensions \u2013 and then set about finding sitters. But Lloyd wasn\u2019t sure where to find a group of domino players in his suburb of London. He finally found a pub of largely white clientele who pointed upstairs, where the Black patrons played. In Lloyd\u2019s scene, the sepia tones give it a historical mood while the use of actual dominos adds realism. The young are pitched against the elders in a nevertheless unifying game. With a close reading, you can see which player has the lucky hand and therefore the right to slam the winning piece on to the table with exuberance and gusto. A warm memory and a feeling of togetherness for many West Indians, at home and abroad. Rianna Jade Parker \u2018She inspired my first novel\u2019 A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re by \u00c9douard Manet, 1882 I vividly remember the first time I saw this glum-looking barmaid. I was studying and feeling glum myself. The thing that got me was her expression: pink cheeks, pressed-together lips, heavy eyes. I tried to work out how she was feeling and settled on sad, tired, stuck, the kind of lonely that can gnaw even in a crowd. Stranded behind the bar of a popular Paris establishment, she\u2019s both seen and unseen, present and absent. To me, the greatest portraits tell us something intimate about the sitters and ourselves. Manet\u2019s model, called Suzon, inspired my first novel. She\u2019s been with me since we met. Chlo\u00eb Ashby Fearless and freaked out You or Me by Maria Lassnig, 2005 I don\u2019t have a favourite portrait \u2013 it all depends on circumstance \u2013 but this is too good to miss. A gun to her head, another aimed at the viewer: Lassnig\u2019s You or Me is self-portraiture as Mexican standoff. Painted in 2005, when the Austrian painter and film-maker was 85, this pitches us into confusion. Lassnig is both fearless and freaked out. You or Me is violent, ferocious and comical, dramatising the confrontation not only between subject and viewer, but also between painter and portrait. It is an infinity loop, a short circuit, and there\u2019s no way out. Lassnig didn\u2019t give a damn. Adrian Searle He has holy hair but is not the messiah Self-Portrait at the Age of 28 by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, 1500 A young printmaker and painter from Nuremberg depicts himself in this unsettling masterpiece as a Christ-like mystic gazing at you from strange realms of prophecy and insight. Everyone who sees it for the first time thinks this is a painting of Jesus, because D\u00fcrer flirts with that possibility as he lovingly details his long holy hair and beard and inscribes his age in gold letters: 28, not far off Christ\u2019s when he died. But he is not the messiah, he is an artist, which in D\u00fcrer\u2019s eyes may amount to the same thing. This is the first self-portrait that ever asserted the mystery of artistic genius, the melancholy danger the artist confronts in a heroic search for beauty and truth. Behold Albrecht! Jonathan Jones \u2018A rock for me to cling to\u2019 Self Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features by Adrian Piper, 1981 I was in my early teens when I saw this incredibly striking image. It made me think of ancient Egyptian portraits, with those wonderfully focused, forward-gazing eyes. It\u2019s rendered beautifully in just pencil and charcoal, but there was something about the way the eyes drew you in \u2013 a psychological meeting. Then I looked at the title. As a person who is read as Black but is mixed race, it threw up a moment of recognition \u2013 about the fiction of racial categories and the absoluteness of what people want things to be. In that moment of gazing at myself in that character, I realised that the assumptions some people made about me weren\u2019t true. It\u2019s just a small drawing, made in the year I was born, but it has such power. It felt like a rock in a sea to cling on to. Someone had created an image that ruptured the strictness of those attitudes to race. I felt seen. Thomas J Price, artist and sculptor No angels to welcome the soul The Death of Marat by Jacques-Louis David, 1793 This is an extraordinary portrait. Jean-Paul Marat, the French Revolution\u2019s propagandist-in-chief, is obviously dead, shown stabbed in the bathtub he bathed in to ease a skin condition. It\u2019s this \u201chere and now\u201d focus that led art historian TJ Clark to call it the first modernist artwork. Although the artist probably worked from the corpse, he used religious and classical tropes to cast the assassinated agitator as a secular martyr. The unheroic end becomes a Christ-like piet\u00e0 swoon, the nudity that of Greek warriors, yet half the painting is of darkness, without Christianity\u2019s heavenly angels to welcome the soul. It\u2019s a contemplation of how a man creates his own significance. Skye Sherwin A natural and fresh paradox Self-portrait in a Straw Hat by \u00c9lisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, 1782 In this self-portrait, the artist knows you know you\u2019re looking at her \u2013 and she is knowingly looking at you. Yet, paradoxically, both sides know she made this image by looking in a mirror, the better to narcissistically capture herself. It\u2019s the revenge of the painted object: a woman constructing herself as beautiful on her own terms. She depicts herself both as personification of painting and as unaffectedly natural and fresh: face gently shaded, chest luminous, hair unpowdered (unlike that of her patron, Marie Antoinette), breasts uncorseted (unlike this picture\u2019s inspiration, Rubens\u2019s portrait of Susanna Lunden). And yet everything in this wonderful portrait is artifice. Stuart Jeffries Resilience staring down brutal pain The Two Fridas by Frida Kahlo, 1939 \u201cLike a ribbon around a bomb,\u201d said the surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton of Frida Kahlo\u2019s work, which he saw in Paris a year before she painted this, her great dual self-portrait. Kahlo was in her early 30s and becoming an international celebrity, but at home in Mexico her marriage to Diego Rivera had fallen apart. The Two Fridas confronts these linked realities: on the right, her whole-hearted Mexican self cradles a miniature portrait of Rivera; on the left, European Frida tries in vain to stem the flow of blood from her shattered ventricles with forceps. Their joined hands reinforce the defiance with which they stare the viewer down. Kahlo\u2019s resilience in the face of brutal emotional and physical pain was never more powerfully expressed. Claire Armitstead Turning the tables Bernardino Campi Painting Sofonisba Anguissola by Sofonisba Anguissola, c1559 Staring out at us are two figures: a man in a dark suit and a woman in a thick crimson dress. He\u2019s painting her, a portrait, dictating her appearance, as he gazes back at us, his eyes not quite meeting our gaze while her glassy eyes pierce our view. But take a second look at the caption and you realise the painting is not by him, but by her: Sofonisba Anguissola, his pupil. Not only has she painted herself one and a half times as big as him, she has him painting the embellishment of the jacket \u2013 a task normally assigned to an apprentice. Now look even closer and you\u2019ll see her left hand \u2013 a third hand \u2013 guiding his around the canvas. Katy Hessel A land wrecked by colonial capitalism The Coffee Worker by Candido Portinari, 1939 Maybe I\u2019m attracted to this work because the story of Candido Portinari\u2019s family resonates with my own: poor workers who fled Italy for a better life. His parents ended up on a coffee plantation in Brazil, where Candido was born in 1903, and where he bore witness to the life of the immigrant poor and the legacy of slavery, then only two decades abolished. This painting is particularly striking, not just as a portrait of hardship (the mournful facial expression, the lilac tones) and heroism (the homoerotic, bulging physique), but also for its portrayal of the extractivist nature of colonial capitalism in the wrecked land that rolls out behind the worker. Oliver Basciano In his arms or hooked to a machine? How Will I Die? #2, from The End: A Meditation on Death and Extinction by Judy Chicago, 2015 If portraiture allows artists to give something or someone immortality, it\u2019s intriguing that Judy Chicago decides to use the medium to imagine herself in her final moments. How Will I Die? is a series of eight paintings of Chicago in different death scenes \u2013 in the arms of her husband, hooked up to a machine, screaming in pain. In this, the artist is naked and curled up in the foetal position with \u201cWill I leave as I arrived?\u201d written above her. It is vulnerable and harrowing, but there is power in Chicago\u2019s use of portraiture to test out scenarios and therefore maintain agency before a terrifying inevitability.

The figures for 2022 reflect the most-heard music in the UK in real terms: as well as streaming, radio and broadcast, the PPL licenses the use of recorded music in public places and public performance venues. Only Dua Lipa\u2019s chart-topping year in 2020 prevented Sheeran from a clean sweep of the past six years. Sheeran\u2019s 2022 victory is most likely thanks to the popularity of his 2021 album =, which is certified three-time platinum in the UK with more than 900,000 units sold. Sheeran first broke into the PPL\u2019s top five most-played artists in 2012, when he released the album +. His stats give him comparable staying power to Coldplay, the only other band in this year\u2019s Top 10 who appeared in the 2012 list where Sheeran debuted. Sheeran said in a statement: \u201cThanks to everyone who continues to listen to and enjoy my music. I never take it for granted.\u201d The Top 10 is dominated by UK pop stars, including the British-Kosovan Lipa at No 2. The highest charting foreign artist is French superstar DJ David Guetta at No 3; US superstar Taylor Swift caps the list at No 10. Coldplay are the only band on the list, which is 70% male, with Lipa and Swift joined by UK dance star Becky Hill at No 9. The PPL also revealed the most-played songs of 2022. Harry Styles topped the list with the ubiquitous As It Was. Sheeran and George Ezra both have two songs in the Top 10, respectively Overpass Graffiti at No 8 and Shivers at No 9, and Anywhere for You (Tiger Lily) at No 5 and Green Green Grass at No 7. The list also features eight British acts or collaborations; US flute-botherer Lizzo is at No 2, with Guetta\u2019s collaboration with Hill and the UK\u2019s Ella Henderson, Crazy What Love Can Do, at No 10. PPL\u2019s chief executive officer, Peter Leathem, said in a statement: \u201cI am delighted that this year\u2019s most-played charts recognise two of the country\u2019s great musical exports, Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles. Their global success reflects the financial and cultural importance of British music. \u201cEd\u2019s unparalleled run at the top of our most-played artists charts is a testament to his enduring popularity, longevity and exceptional talent. Many congratulations to him and his team. Harry\u2019s soaraway success reflects his hard work and consistent ability to write and perform songs that resonate the world over.\u201d Sheeran perhaps stands less of a chance at topping the chart next year: his latest album, the muted \u2013 [Subtract] received the best reviews of the year, but its muted sound lends itself less well to public ubiquity than his previous copper-bottomed hits.

But being unusually tall? Like, 6ft 7in tall? Crouch remembers walking on to the pitch after signing for QPR and hearing the laughter in the stands. At Dulwich Hamlet fans called him the \u201c20ft chicken\u201d. It never seemed to go away, no matter how much he achieved. When he made his debut for the national team, you could hear the boos from England fans echoing around the stadium.

But it still hurt in those early days, and sometimes he would cry at night. Like almost every teenager, he just wanted to be normal. Was it hard opening up about this stuff? \u201cIt was a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing 16, 17, just kind of breaking through, and being abused just for the way I looked. It was tough. But I\u2019d never let that show. Especially not in football, because it was so macho. I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone how I was feeling. Not my mum, dad, friends, no one.\u201d The thing is, he says, he doesn\u2019t want this film to be seen as a sob story. And to be fair, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s not really Crouch\u2019s style. For one thing, he likes to laugh at himself. A line he once delivered on Graham Norton\u2019s chatshow (replying to the question \u201cWhat would you be if you weren\u2019t a footballer?\u201d he said, with impeccable timing: \u201cA virgin\u201d) was deemed by one British newspaper to be the best sporting one-liner of all time. In the film we see him celebrating a goal for Portsmouth against Manchester City, an initially graceful forward roll that goes catastrophically wrong the moment his legs are required; instead of seamlessly returning to his feet he staggers back up like a drunken Bambi. Being able to mock himself has allowed him to get one over his tormentors \u2013 \u201cIf anyone was going to take the piss out of me, I would take the piss out of me better than they were about to,\u201d he says \u2013 but it also set him in good stead for the stellar post-football career he\u2019s had as a media figure: That Peter Crouch Podcast, a gently laddy banter session that launched in 2018, not long before his official retirement from football, is one of the most popular in the country, featuring guests including Prince William (recorded at Kensington Palace) and Idris Elba (a studio selfie of them together shows a starstruck Crouch with his trousers riding halfway up his legs). He\u2019s written several humorous books detailing the ludicrous lives of players, and earlier this year launched a second podcast, The Therapy Crouch, with his wife, the model and TV personality Abbey Clancy; in it they dissect various intimate aspects of their relationship. None of this would have happened, if he hadn\u2019t learned how to make people laugh. Now 42, he has always had an extremely positive attitude, he says. Frequently, his anecdotes end with \u201cbut at the end of the day, that just made me a stronger person\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s when I knew I had to prove them wrong\u201d. In the film, the abuse he receives is often framed as something that was good for him. \u201cI think it did actually help in lots of ways,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, when I was coming on for England, with my mum and dad in the crowd, that should have been the pinnacle of my career. Instead, I\u2019m getting booed by my own fans. But it made me go, right, I\u2019m going to fucking show you. You can either go under or you can fight it.\u201d Crouch was born in Macclesfield in 1981 and, although the family spent a brief spell living in Singapore, grew up in Harrow on the Hill in north-west London. A good indicator that his home life was perhaps more coddled than the average footballer is that his dad sometimes did his paper round for him. \u201cHe did, yeah,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was getting 15 quid a week and it was a real struggle, to be honest. There\u2019d be days where I\u2019d be like: \u2018Dad \u2026 what do you reckon?\u2019 And he\u2019d say: \u2018Don\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 At the time he was, like, creative director at BBH ad agency in London. And I remember this article about him, I think it was in the magazine Campaign, saying he must be the only creative director of an ad agency doing a paper round as a second job.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t from a council estate,\u201d he continues. \u201cLots of players I played with had real tough upbringings. They were fighting for their lives, for the lives of their entire families. I didn\u2019t have that.\u201d Paper round aside, his dad was no pushover. After Crouch pulled out of a tackle during a game when he was on the books at Spurs, his dad abandoned him there, leaving him to make his own way home. \u201cHarsh,\u201d agrees Crouch. \u201cBut I never jumped out of a tackle again. I learned that lesson quickly. And the next game I played, if anything, I should have been sent off!\u201d His dad doesn\u2019t actually come off as the most sympathetic character in the film \u2013 he\u2019s constantly critical, urging his son to work harder, be tougher. It leaves you wondering if it spoilt their relationship. \u201cBut I thank him every day for what he did,\u201d says Crouch. \u201cI genuinely wouldn\u2019t have got there without him. Look, if I was crap he would have just let me go and play with my mates. But he knew that I had a chance.\u201d When his schoolmates \u2013 many of whom he\u2019s still close friends with \u2013 were out partying or off traveling, he was dedicating himself to working on his game, trying to make his unusual body shape work to his advantage. Despite his height, he was terrible in the air: \u201cSo I worked my jump, I worked my leap, I worked on my leg strength, I worked on direction, I worked on the angle of my head, I worked on timing. There are so many factors to heading but people just think: \u2018He\u2019s tall, he heads the ball.\u2019\u201d Crouch would head balls repeatedly, until all he could see was stars. Looking back, he worries about the dementia risk, of course. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do a lot about it now. I\u2019ve headed them!\u201d he says with another big laugh. \u201cAnd you know what? I\u2019ve got the Premier League record for headed goals [Crouch scored 53 with his head]. So I wouldn\u2019t take even one of them back.\u201d That doggedness has come in useful for Crouch. After signing for Liverpool in 2005 for \u00a37m, he failed to score for 18 games. His profile was rising and his strike rate had never been worse. He wanted to hide. But he kept believing, eventually delivering what is described in the film by the Guardian\u2019s Barry Glendenning as \u201cthe shittest goal I have ever seen, and I\u2019ve been watching football for a long time\u201d, a speculative long-range effort, which deflects off a defender\u2019s heel and loops into the air, only to be palmed by the goalkeeper into his own net. It may have been rubbish, but it sparked a run of goals. He is still thankful for the fans who stuck with him during his darkest moment in football. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another city in England, or a club in England, that having just won the Champions League would have accepted and stuck by a player like me. It\u2019s what Liverpool is famous for, really, an us v them, siege mentality kind of thing. So I feel incredibly proud to have represented them.\u201d The same night Crouch ended his drought he went out to a bar and was approached by Clancy. \u201cI should have done the lottery that night too,\u201d he says. Despite not being a football fan, she had seen him being teased in the press and identified him as a sweet guy who needed a bit of looking after. Their relationship garnered some raised eyebrows, from the press and Crouch\u2019s mates \u2013 their gangly pal who, as he admits in the film, \u201ccouldn\u2019t pull a hamstring\u201d at the time, was dating a star of Britain\u2019s Next Top Model. Even Prince Harry asked him how the hell he\u2019d bagged Clancy. \u201cAnd I wish I\u2019d come back at him now!\u201d he says, the reference to Meghan prompting another big round of laughter to peal around the room. Crouch and Clancy live in Surrey now with their four kids, and their podcast together can be surprisingly revealing. Sometimes it feels as if you\u2019re nosing in on a couple\u2019s passive (or not so passive) aggressive rows. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually argue that much,\u201d says Crouch. \u201cBut if you sit down and discuss what pisses you off about each other, you can easily get into an argument.\u201d The first episode talked about Clancy\u2019s horror to find that her new man still lived like a student \u2013 a Premier League star sleeping with mismatched pillows and nothing in the room besides a PlayStation. \u201cI just lived how my mates were living,\u201d Crouch protests today. \u201cSome of them were at uni, they had no money, so I was like them. These days you hear of young players hiring chefs and things like that but I didn\u2019t do any of that. I didn\u2019t even think to spend it.\u201d Clancy soon gave him a bit of a spruce-up. \u201cI tend not to dress myself any more,\u201d he admits. \u201cWell, I do physically.\u201d One thing revealed by Clancy on a recent episode was that Crouch prays every night. As a child he would beg God to make him into a footballer. These days it\u2019s less aspirational. \u201cI\u2019m not religious, but I\u2019ll pray, and these days it\u2019s more about being thankful for the things I have achieved.\u201d If he\u2019s not religious, who is he speaking to? \u201cWell, that\u2019s private, to be fair,\u201d he says, looking a little uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s something private that I do \u2026 that Abs went and exposed on the podcast. And now I\u2019m talking about it in interviews!\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see what endears Crouchy to a certain type of man. He\u2019s the gawky kid done good. In the film we see punters at Crouchfest, a ridiculous and somewhat improbable live event that somehow managed to fill the 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena in its last instalment. Some of them are \u2013 in the nicest possible way \u2013 a bit nerdier than your average fan, talking about how seeing such a tall figure make it in the Premier League helped with their own issues about not fitting in. Has he stumbled on a way of being a lad without as much of the toxic masculinity? He\u2019s not sure. Big themes like this aren\u2019t his forte. \u201cI didn\u2019t make the film to change anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just telling my story.\u201d What he does know is that he\u2019s extremely lucky to have had the career he has had, and to have found something many would say was elusive: a post-football career that gives him the same buzz as he used to get playing. \u201cLike the anticipation of what will people think about this film, that\u2019s the same thing,\u201d he says. \u201cOr I did live TV for the BBC after the Euros and I\u2019m on telly with someone in my ear counting down to being on air. It\u2019s kind of like being in the tunnel before a game,\u201d he says, before glancing up at his little audience again and delivering one last self-deprecating gag: \u201cOnly this time I haven\u2019t got any of the skills.\u201d That Peter Crouch Film is available on Prime Video on 22 June"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94753", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/19/socially-stunted-how-covid-pandemic-aggravated-young-peoples-loneliness", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Socially stunted\u2019: how Covid pandemic aggravated young people\u2019s loneliness", "lead": "Combination of lockdowns, personal issues and being stuck in \u2018digital bubbles\u2019 has left many feeling isolated and friendless", "author": "Clea Skopeliti", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548328", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5f46bc1fd36d8f1885ad2185ea7de29840d4332b/0_387_5840_3506/500.jpg", "body": "Riley had hoped university would be where they would meet likeminded people and form lasting, meaningful friendships, shedding the feelings of loneliness that had often surrounded them in their teens. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with degrees of loneliness for a large chunk of my life. I was often reassured by my family that uni would change all that,\u201d they say. Then the pandemic hit. As Riley was matriculating in Sheffield, the UK was preparing for its second lockdown. Instead of getting involved in societies and nights out at the student union, they spent day after day trapped in their room. \u201cMost of my studies have been online, so I don\u2019t know anyone on my course. Obviously most societies shut down or went online,\u201d they say. In their second term, as the UK went into its third lockdown, they moved back home for the rest of the year. Although events started running again in their second year, Riley didn\u2019t get involved. \u201cPart of it was nervousness, not knowing how to handle myself,\u201d they say. Riley says they feel \u201cstunted socially\u201d. \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t know enough about how to socialise in order to make friends properly. I find myself wondering if something\u2019s wrong with me or I give off a bad energy. \u201cI worry that, because I\u2019ve [finished] uni and school, I\u2019ve missed out on the best chances I\u2019ll ever have to make friends.\u201d It\u2019s hard to put it down to just one thing, Riley says. \u201cIt\u2019s this Gordian knot of my own personal issues, things like the pandemic, and the shape of society. I think people find the idea of in-person communities less important than in the past.\u201d Riley is one of many young people caught in a cycle of loneliness in the wake of the pandemic and amid the cost of living crisis. Just under one in 10 people aged 16 to 29 reported feeling lonely often or always, according to an analysis of recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data by the Campaign to End Loneliness \u2013 the highest level of all age groups. This is set against a backdrop of chronic loneliness levels among all age groups, which rose during the pandemic and never really came down again. At the peak of lockdown in late 2020 and early 2021, levels reached 7.2%, and were still at 7.08% two years later. In 2018, the figure had been 5%. Prof Andrea Wigfield, the director of the centre for loneliness studies at Sheffield Hallam University, says that while social isolation is an objective measure, loneliness is a \u201csubjective, negative feeling\u201d. Comparison to others plays a part, Wigfield explains, suggesting a link to the role of social media. \u201cThe thing that influences loneliness is the social connection [people] desire and what they perceive their peers to have,\u201d she says. \u201cWith young people, there\u2019s an expectation that you have an active social life.\u201d Loneliness among teenagers worldwide, including in the UK, already appeared to be rising before the pandemic, research suggests. \u201cIn the past it was always argued older people are the most lonely,\u201d Wigfield says. But \u201cevidence has emerged that young people are as lonely, if not more. It\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019ll continue to be a longterm rise\u201d. But she also stresses that loneliness is a natural response, \u201cthe body telling you you need to find someone to talk to\u201d. \u201cTemporarily it\u2019s the equivalent of being hungry. When it becomes chronic, that\u2019s when it starts affecting health. \u201cThe way in which we live has changed\u201d since the pandemic, Wigfield says. \u201cOnline took off and hasn\u2019t gone back to how it was before. The figures for social isolation will definitely have fallen [since lockdown] but people aren\u2019t feeling less lonely. It comes back to the point that you could be in a crowd but still feel lonely.\u201d Marcus Johnston, 27, a video game artist, is feeling the impact of the way life has changed for many. He lives with his parents in a rural area of North Yorkshire, after moving out of his flatshare as UK society shut down in 2020. He has few friends nearby and works remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s great but means you never get that experience of being in an office environment and having that team feeling. I haven\u2019t had a proper job where I\u2019ve had that experience of making friends.\u201d Johnston says moving home was the right decision at the time, but that he feels isolated and is hoping to share a flat with friends again soon. \u201cIt\u2019s an almost constant murmuring at the back of my mind, telling you that you\u2019re lonely, and you need more fulfilling relationships in your life. I often think back on the times where I had more friends and acquaintances around me when I was younger, and it brings me down.\u201d Echoing Riley\u2019s concerns about a focus on online communities, he says: \u201cThe society we live in now seems catered to trap us in digital bubbles, now more so than ever due to working from home.\u201d The idea that time spent on social networks can leave people feeling more isolated is hardly new, with research suggesting that limiting engagement with social media can reduce feelings of loneliness and the fear of missing out. Kate, 26, often finds herself alone and scrolling at the weekend. \u201cOn a Friday night, I\u2019ll go on Instagram. I follow quite a lot of people who will be out doing stuff with friends and posting. And I\u2019ll feel like: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m on my own. Why am I on my own?\u201d Kate, who works at a university in Oxfordshire, has lived with her parents since finishing university, for both financial reasons and because most of her friends now live in London. She mostly works from home and her colleagues are rarely in the office, which is the main reason she doesn\u2019t go in, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to many people day-to-day and sometimes it can feel like I am disappearing.\u201d She says that being single is a big driver of her feelings. \u201cPeople I know from school and still have on social media all seem to be in longterm relationships and even getting married. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m the only person who isn\u2019t.\u201d Thinking back to the Covid lockdowns, Kate says she felt less isolated than she does now. \u201cObviously that was lonely, but not as lonely because everyone was [at home] and there was just more stuff going on like online chats with people and quizzes. \u201cEveryone was in the same position.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94754", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/jersey-hornet-hunters-guarding-against-invasion-uk-aoe", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hornet hunters: the crack squad keeping an invasive species at bay on Jersey", "lead": "A retired police detective and a band of volunteers are all that\u2019s stopping the Asian hornet, a voracious predator of flying insects, from spreading across the island to mainland Britain", "author": "Patrick Barkham", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548344", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3bdb89eb3f49ab20425646eae6ed97f029b262c6/222_91_1485_892/500.jpg", "body": "John De Carteret has already taken a call about three captured Asian hornets when we meet on a gloriously sunny morning on the Channel Island of Jersey. The retired police forensics detective is the linchpin of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group (JAHG), a band of two dozen volunteers. These mostly retirees are the frontline troops in a seemingly unwinnable war against an invasive foe \u2013 a voracious predator of honeybees and all other flying insects, which has rapidly conquered the west European mainland. But De Carteret, who sports a JAHG polo-shirt and a lanyard showing he is authorised by the government to catch and release Asian hornets (more about the releasing later), is undaunted. \u201cYou can\u2019t take your foot off. You\u2019ve got to be dynamic and aggressive. If we get a report, we\u2019re there within half an hour,\u201d he says. Our first call is to a beautiful garden belonging to Tony and Nicky du Feu. Tony has been checking special hornet traps \u2013 a coffee cup-like contraption filled with a sugary lure \u2013 that he and his wife have placed around Jersey\u2019s north-east corner. Nicky is fuming because her husband has caught three hornets. \u201cIt\u2019s quite addictive and it\u2019s quite competitive,\u201d says Tony of their hornet-hunting. This year so far, they have trapped more than 10% of the 208 (and counting) queens caught across Jersey. \u201cIf we don\u2019t achieve 10%, we\u2019re not doing our job,\u201d says Nicky. The Du Feus hand the traps to De Carteret. Inside one buzzes a slender, mostly black hornet, which is slightly smaller than the yellower native European hornet. The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina, has an orange face, narrow black wings, yellow legs and yellow-and-black stripes on the underside of its rear end. Remarkably, each individual is believed to be descended from one mated queen, which stowed away in plant pots from China bound for Marseille in 2004. Since then, the species has spread rapidly through France and into Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. Britain has only had a few incursions \u2013 23 from 2016-22 and four so far this year, which almost certainly hitched a lift on cross-Channel ferries and lorries. But the Jersey volunteers warn that an invasion is coming. There is a whiff of racism about an invading \u201cAsian\u201d hornet \u2013 hopefully, the species will become known as the yellow-legged hornet \u2013 but it appears to be a genuine threat to wildlife, and a voracious predator. As a beekeeper, Du Feu has watched hornets hovering outside the entrance to his hives, picking off worker bees laden with pollen as they return. Hornets create a landscape of fear, the bees stop foraging, and colonies collapse. But they don\u2019t just threaten honeybees: by late summer, their nests are as big as an extremely large watermelon. French researchers estimated that a single nest can consume 11.3kg of insects over its late-summer lifetime. The economic and human health impacts of the hornets also trouble policymakers: their late-summer search for sugar has been found to damage grapes in Spain, while grape pickers can\u2019t pluck the fruit by hand for fear of getting stung. Jersey, where the Asian hornet was first spotted in 2016, is seeking to repel the insect. If successful, it could give succour to the worried scientists, beekeepers and officials from all parts of Britain and Ireland who have visited the 46-sq mile island in the hope of finding a way to keep it out. Last year, volunteers working with the government detected and destroyed 174 nests. Of these, 117 were after worker hornets had been tracked through the countryside. \u201cThis year will show whether we can keep on top of it,\u201d says Bob Tompkins, another JAHG volunteer who is the only islander so far to lose bee hives to the predator. Jersey\u2019s efforts to keep the hornet at bay are both low- and hi-tech, ingenious and simple. The hornets overwinter as queens. In spring, these queens emerge and build their first, small nests. France is 14 miles from Jersey\u2019s east coast, and while large numbers of hornets are unlikely to cross the Channel to Britain by flying, they can easily reach the island assisted by east and north-easterly winds. Every spring and summer, the volunteers must catch the emerging queens before they build nests and their numbers explode. A network of government-funded traps are hung across the island and must be checked every day to remove live bycatch \u2013 the last thing the volunteers want to do is kill more flying insects. Each captured queen is put in a freezer to kill it. The body is preserved and pinned by a volunteer researcher \u2013 this could be valuable data for future research. My next stop with De Carteret is to a queen\u2019s early-summer nest, which has been reported as dangling above someone\u2019s front door. \u201cTo me, this is like scene-of-crime work \u2013 going to one scene after another,\u201d says De Carteret. \u201cIt gets you hooked.\u201d This \u201cembryo\u201d nest is the size of a lightbulb and looks like a pretty paper lantern. We wait for 15 minutes but no hornet appears. There is no point destroying a nest without a queen. So De Carteret will return at dusk and put the little nest into a big container \u2013 if the queen is still alive, she will be inside at dusk, and captured. The key to finding hornets is to inform the public, says De Carteret. Thanks to plenty of media coverage on the island \u2013 and his popular Facebook page \u2013 many Jersey islanders can now identify them. \u201cPeople need to know what these insects look like,\u201d says De Carteret. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem but it\u2019s a community problem.\u201d His mobile rings constantly. The next call is from Jo Burke, who reports a suspected Asian hornet in her utility room on the south edge of the island. \u201cI came back from walking the dog, heard a buzz and this huge great big thing flew towards me,\u201d says Burke. \u201cI thought, \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of that\u2019 so I retreated. I went straight to the website and it said something about an orange face, and I thought, \u2018that might be one\u2019. It\u2019s exciting but not in a good way. It\u2019s not what we want on the island.\u201d She is right: it\u2019s a queen. De Carteret collects a small Perspex pot from his car and enters the utility room. The hornet is on the windowsill. He deftly covers it with the pot and slips on the lid. He\u2019s not wearing any gloves or protective gear \u2013 only when trapped does the hornet buzz angrily. He has never been stung by an Asian hornet but he knows two people who were hospitalised after stings. De Carteret and his volunteers dislike sensationalist coverage and stress that the hornet is only aggressive if you get close to a big late-summer nest, when it wants to defend its offspring. In spring and early summer, the queens are laden with eggs and docile. \u201cThey are an incredibly successful insect,\u201d he says. The volunteers\u2019 battle intensifies in midsummer when the first workers emerge. First, they trap a worker with the usual lure. Then they mark it with special paint used by beekeepers to mark bees, release it, and set their watches. (It is an offence under Jersey law to release Asian hornets unless authorised.) Workers become habituated on the sugary lures, making shuttle runs between the traps and their nest. De Carteret discovered that it takes roughly one minute for a worker to fly 100 metres back to its nest and return again. It\u2019s like map-making, he explains: a process of triangulation. Volunteers log times and distances on WhatsApp and work along the line of the hornet\u2019s route until they find the nest. They also attach feathers or tiny streamers to workers to make them more visible in flight. It\u2019s time-consuming fieldcraft: Tony and Nicky du Feu reckon it takes them 20 hours combined to find a single nest. Radio tags have been successfully used after trials by University of Exeter researchers, but so far the Jersey volunteers have found it a 45-minute fiddle to fit a tiny tracker to a hornet, which must be chilled before being revived. This year, however, the group\u2019s researcher has devised a way of tying radio tags to hornets in just five minutes. Once located, summer nests must be destroyed as quickly as possible before a fresh generation of next year\u2019s queens emerge. Destroying them isn\u2019t simple: big nests are ferociously defended, and they are often in tall trees, so professional climbers are called in. Last summer, government climbers were not always available, leading to four-week delays in destroying nests on some occasions, which frustrated volunteers. Alastair Christie is the Jersey government\u2019s senior scientific officer, responsible for invasive species, as well as a beekeeper himself. Managing his \u201cextraordinary\u201d volunteers is sometimes like \u201cherding cats\u201d he laughs, but he says he and all of Jersey are \u201ctremendously grateful\u201d for their efforts. This year, he has contracted and trained two tree surgery companies to do the climbing to minimise delays. He and his volunteers have also mastered the use of a telescopic lance which last year successfully injected poison into a nest 26 metres above the ground \u2013 minimising the need for professional tree-climbers. Success, he says, is restricting numbers to a manageable level. He agrees with volunteers that this is a \u201cpivotal\u201d year. If hornet numbers rise too high in midsummer, it becomes impossible to track individuals to nests because there are too many nests in different directions. \u201cThis year, it could turn into the exponential phase [of hornet numbers in Jersey],\u201d he warns. \u201cIf we\u2019ve worked our socks off, taken out 200 nests and there\u2019s a sense that there are still another 20 nests out there, it all indicates we\u2019re gradually losing control. Then we have to look at what is sustainable. Because this has to go on for ever. There\u2019s no magic bullet, and for ever is rather a long time.\u201d Given that the battle against the hornet appears to have been lost in mainland Europe, shouldn\u2019t we simply accept it alongside other invasive non-native species, from grey squirrels to Japanese knotweed? \u201cIf it was good for our environment here it would\u2019ve been here all along,\u201d says Matt Goetz, curator for invertebrates at Jersey zoo. \u201cWe have the European hornet here, and that\u2019s the hornet that fits into our environment. A hornet evolved in Asia has a different reproductive output and different behaviour. It might not have the properties that mean that predators go for it. It might have bigger nests than our European hornet. It might have a bigger appetite, and eat species that aren\u2019t adapted to cope with the pressure. That\u2019s particularly problematic in already damaged environments. \u201cWith invasive species, if they have a way in and can reproduce in small numbers it\u2019s very hard to completely eradicate them but you can keep on top of it. By trying, you are gaining so much knowledge and experience that you often find a way to have permanent success.\u201d In addition, says Goetz, such efforts are often transferable to other invasive species or ecological problems. \u201cIt is absolutely and categorically never in vain. Even if it doesn\u2019t 100% work, you get so much experience and the public sensitised to the issues \u2013 people join in the radio tracking and become conservationists, or Jersey zoo staff.\u201d In a way, the Asian hornet is a recruitment tool for conservation and the cause of flying insects. While Christie believes the British government is taking the right approach by using beekeepers as its eyes and ears, Jersey volunteers are sceptical about Britain\u2019s chances of keeping the Asian hornet at bay. By the end of the day, De Carteret has incarcerated eight more hornets. The following day 11 queens are discovered \u2013 a daily record. Either hornet numbers are booming or the volunteers are becoming more efficient at trapping them, or both. De Carteret tries to remain optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely suppressing the numbers,\u201d he says. But what happens if they reach Britain? \u201cI dread to think,\u201d says Tompkins. \u201cWe are a very small island, we\u2019ve got a good local knowledge base of the environment and where things are. There\u2019s very little space on this island that isn\u2019t observed. \u201cIn Britain, if they ever got into the New Forest for instance, they could tick away there for several years without being noticed, get established, and then off and away.\u201d If you suspect you have seen an Asian hornet in the UK report the sighting through the iPhone and Android app Asian Hornet Watch or by using this online report form."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94755", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/union-leaders-vow-to-carry-on-fight-for-better-wages-and-working-conditions", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Union leaders vow to carry on fight for better wages and working conditions", "lead": "A year after start of Britain\u2019s biggest wave of industrial action for 30 years, unions say they are are resolute", "author": "Miles Brignall", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548361", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/79663488e37a7d46b745ad25381acd5c9b85dc0c/0_549_8229_4937/500.jpg", "body": "Union leaders have vowed to carry on the fight for better wages and working conditions ahead of the first anniversary of the biggest wave of industrial action seen in Britain for three decades. This coming Wednesday will mark 12 months since members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union staged their first stoppage in a dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. That dispute, which a year on remains unresolved, is regarded by unions as the start of the most significant uprising by UK workers since 1989 \u2013 a year with many of the same economic difficulties as today, when interest rates were rising, inflation had surged and demonstrators took to the streets to protest against Margaret Thatcher\u2019s poll tax. Since 21 June 2022, almost every area of the public and private sector has been disrupted by staff battling to ensure their pay keeps place with the fastest rate of inflation since the early 1980s. Barristers, teachers, nurses, junior doctors, university lecturers and civil servants in almost every government department \u2013 from driving examiners to rural food inspectors \u2013 have all gone on strike. In the private sector, the GMB union has organised warehouse strikes at Amazon, as staff push for union recognition, and Royal Mail has been repeatedly hit by industrial action, while lorry drivers and factory workers have either joined in the stoppages or threatened to do so. Over 3.7m working days were lost between June 2022 and April 2023, according to latest available data from the Office for National Statistics, the highest for any 11-month period since May 1990, when 4.8m working days were lost. On 1 February alone, 100,000 civil servants at 124 government departments all stopped work. While some groups have settled and called off strikes, many key workers have not. Faced with a cost of living crisis and inflation running at over 10%, and food prices that have doubled, unions have been turning down government offers that have typically ranged from 3% to 5%. On Saturday the National Education Union vowed to bring more coordinated strikes that will shut many schools completely in July. Representatives are calling for negotiations with the government to resume, saying they will only strike as a \u201clast resort\u201d. \u201cThis first anniversary marks an important milestone in the UK\u2019s contemporary industrial relations history,\u201d said Peter Turnbull, professor of management and industrial relations at the University of Bristol Business School, in an interview with PA Media. \u201cMore than three-quarters of the days lost came from transport, storage, information and communications, but daily life has also been affected by strikes in our schools and universities, the NHS and civil service. \u201cAfter the longest period of falling real wages since records began, pay has understandably dominated the headlines, but the causes of these ongoing disputes run much deeper after years of austerity, consequent work intensification and falling standards of service provision. All strikes are eventually \u2018settled\u2019, but workers will remain unsettled by this prolonged period of industrial action for years to come.\u201d More than half a million NHS appointments, operations and procedures have been postponed in England as a result of strikes by health service staff. The first mass walkout of nurses in history took place in mid-December, with ambulance workers, physiotherapists and other health workers following suit in subsequent weeks. More recently they have been joined by junior doctors from the British Medical Association. Across the board, union leaders have attacked the government\u2019s role in industrial disputes. Mark Serwotka, of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said: \u201cThere is no doubt that the government is completely to blame, fuelled by an unprecedented cost of living crisis in which workers have been squeezed like never before. \u201cMinisters have been appalling. They assumed there would not be the stomach for a fight, but they made a catastrophic mistake. The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said the level of industrial action was unprecedented, and workers have decided they do not want to accept continued real-terms pay cuts. He believes the government has \u201cclearly been pulling the strings\u201d of the rail dispute and thought the public would turn against striking unions, but there is no evidence of a public backlash. Christina McAnea, of Unison, praised her NHS members, whose biggest strike action in decades \u201cwon the hearts of the public\u201d. \u201cOur members braved hours of freezing weather to stand up for what\u2019s right \u2013 not only for themselves, but for their colleagues and for the future of our public services.\u201d A government spokesperson said ministers wanted to ensure pay settlements were \u201cfair, affordable for the taxpayer and reasonable\u201d and that they allowed inflation to fall. \u201cIndustrial action should always be a last resort. The government will continue to engage constructively with trade unions and is prepared to agree reasonable and affordable settlements if unions come to the table.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94756", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/19/most-magistrates-courts-england-wales-accessibility-failings", "primaryCategory": "law", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Most magistrates courts in England and Wales have accessibility failings", "lead": "Survey reveals three-quarters are inadequate for disabled people with problems such as lack of ramps", "author": "Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548377", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f15c1092b286f96d58c45e8cdb86dc41f2a17f0e/0_448_5547_3328/500.jpg", "body": "Three-quarters of magistrates courts in England and Wales are inadequately accessible for people with disabilities, with a lack of ramps, inaccessible toilets and non-functioning hearing loops all featuring as failings. An on-the-ground survey carried out by the Magistrates\u2019 Association assessed the accessibility of 57 buildings \u2013 more than a third of magistrates courts \u2013 and found a plethora of problems. Only one building was found to be \u201cgood\u201d across all areas assessed, which included magistrate entrances, car parks and public areas. In three out of 10 courts, disabled magistrates were restricted from sitting in certain courtrooms or even entire buildings due to accessibility failings or delays in repairing vital facilities such as lifts. The association said that, by restricting where its members could sit or where trials could take place, the failings adversely affected court capacity and efficiency, and undermined the government\u2019s efforts to improve diversity and inclusion in the magistracy. Mark Beattie said he found the report shocking and concerning. The national chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association said: \u201cPeople considering applying to be magistrates are required to undertake pre-application visits to a court. Imagine turning up and not being able to observe a session because you cannot get into the building or a specific courtroom. \u201cThe range of problems disabled magistrates experience on a daily basis is also of great concern. Equal access for all is surely a fundamental tenet of our justice system and yet our research shows that insufficient funds have been spent to deliver this.\u201d More than nine in 10 criminal cases are resolved in magistrates courts. Given the backlog of cases in magistrates courts, which stood at 347,769 in April, the association said anything preventing its members from fulfilling their role must be rectified to ensure timely administration of justice. The report, published on Monday, found accessibility was poorer in areas accessed by magistrates than in public areas. For example, while one in 10 court buildings did not have an accessible toilet for the public, this rose to one in three in magistrates\u2019 areas. In almost a fifth of courts surveyed, disabled magistrates had to use the public entrance due to a lack of an accessible judicial entrance. This often necessitated security personnel accompanying them on arrival and exit because of the risk. A magistrate who is a wheelchair user said: \u201cWhen I have been doing trial courts and we\u2019ve had some unhappy attendees, I feel very vulnerable leaving through the main entrance.\u201d Another reported that they \u201ctend to stay in the court and the retiring room for the whole day while my other bench colleagues go out for lunch or into town. Because it\u2019s an inconvenience to other people, I prefer to stay on my own until they return.\u201d The report also found signage was missing from about a quarter of public areas, which can adversely affect neurodivergent people or people with learning difficulties, and fewer than half of courts had a working hearing loop. Recommendations by the association to address the problems identified include an accessibility audit of all courts, an accessibility guarantee, with a deadline for achieving it, and investment. An spokesperson for His Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunals said: \u201cEnsuring that everyone is able to fully access our courts is vital for open justice, which is why we have invested over \u00a3184 million in the two years to April 2023 to maintain our buildings and improve accessibility. \u201cWhile improvements are still needed to bring parts of our estate up to the high standards we strive for, our significant investment in upgrades will ensure that nobody is excluded from seeing justice done.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94757", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/19/starwatch-a-solstice-gathering-of-the-moon-mars-and-venus", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starwatch: a solstice gathering of the moon, Mars and Venus", "lead": "Look west to see distinctive trio in twilight of the northern hemisphere\u2019s longest day", "author": "Stuart Clark", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548396", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f9c01aad9e05cd7e204d93696f43274c2ccadf/269_83_752_451/500.jpg", "body": "It is the solstice this week.

Ringer podcast network founder Bill Simmons \u2013 who sold his company to Spotify for $196m in 2020 and gained a leadership role at the company in the deal \u2013 criticised Harry and Meghan on his own podcast, following the announcement that the Sussexes\u2019 audio production company, Archewell, had severed ties with Spotify. The couple signed a $20m deal with Spotify in 2020. The Archetypes podcast, which was hosted by Meghan, featured conversations with friends and celebrities including Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Trevor Noah. It topped the podcast charts for Spotify in a number of markets, but only 12 episodes were made. Last week, Spotify and Archewell Audio released a joint statement saying they had \u201cmutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series we made together\u201d. However, sources close to Spotify have said the royal couple did not meet the productivity benchmark required to receive the full headline payout from the deal, having only produced one 12-episode series, the Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cI wish I had been involved in the \u2018Meghan and Harry leave Spotify\u2019 negotiation. \u2018The Fucking Grifters.\u2019 That\u2019s the podcast we should have launched with them,\u201d Simmons said on his podcast, the Bill Simmons podcast. \u201cI have got to get drunk one night and tell the story of the Zoom I had with Harry to try and help him with a podcast idea. It\u2019s one of my best stories \u2026 Fuck them. The grifters.\u201d The Guardian has approached Archewell for comment. Simmons had previously said he was annoyed he had to \u201cshare\u201d Spotify with Prince Harry. In a January 2022 episode of his podcast, he said: \u201cYou live in fucking Montecito and you just sell documentaries and podcasts and nobody cares what you have to say about anything unless you talk about the royal family and you just complain about them.\u201d Spotify\u2019s deals with Simmons and the Duke and Duchess were a part of the company\u2019s expansion into podcasting, after its success with Joe Rogan. However, the Stockholm-based streaming company is now facing investor pressure to improve its performance after making a net loss of \u20ac430m (\u00a3367m) last year. Earlier this year, Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek admitted that the company had made some mistakes with the $1bn spent in its push to establish itself as a key player in podcasting. \u201cYou\u2019re right in calling out the overpaying and overinvesting,\u201d he told financial analysts on a conference call. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very diligent in how we invest in future content deals,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the ones that aren\u2019t performing, obviously, we won\u2019t renew. \u201cAnd the ones that are performing, we will obviously look at those on a case-by-case basis on the relative value.\u201d Earlier this month, Spotify announced it would be making 200 job cuts in its podcasting business."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9475a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/country-diary-care-is-contagious-so-i-take-my-litter-picker-to-the-old-railway-path", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Country diary: Care is contagious \u2013 so I take my litter-picker to the old railway path | Josie George", "lead": "<strong>Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire:</strong> This stretch of edge-land is bursting with cow parsley, brambles and buttercups that deserve to exist without our rubbish", "author": "Josie George", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 04:30:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548449", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8ae943419d3f1a0ab6c8e40d5a957dd19ddbbc84/0_35_2036_1221/500.jpg", "body": "I have a new hobby. With a bin bag tied to the handle of my mobility scooter, I have taken to weaving along the old railway path that runs through the industrial estate where I live, litter-picker at the ready.

Right now, the hedgerow that grows on either side is thick with brambles beginning to flower. The cow parsley is making a last delicate display with its white firework flowers, and in the early summer heat, everything is sticky, lime and sycamore leaves slick with shine.

A combination of antisocial behaviour, apathy and the nearby wind-blown rubbish dump soon replaces whatever gets picked up, but here I am again today; I am going to make another dent in it. I weave from side to side, grabbing at what litter I can reach, wrestling it from the cleavers that cling to it, and deposit it in my bag; soon there is a noticeable, satisfying difference along the stretch I\u2019ve covered.

He has proposed suspending international student intakes for low quality courses and preventing internal assessments. Hill, who was previously the executive director of international education in the Victorian government, is co-convener of the ministerial advisory committee interrogating international education. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The parliamentary committee has heard shocking allegations of vocational education and training (VET) providers \u201cgaming the system\u201d and working with unregulated international education agents to steal students from prestigious public institutions for massive commissions, sell work visas and open \u201cghost schools\u201d where students don\u2019t attend classes but still receive degrees. Speaking in parliament on Monday, Hill said the international student sector was vital to Australia\u2019s prosperity but radical thinking was needed to clean up the sector. \u201cThe vast majority of the sector do wonderful things but a minority of students \u2013 mainly in the bottom end of private VET \u2013 are only here to work not study,\u201d he said. \u201cOur student visa must not be used as a low-rent work visa.\u201d Hill said Australia\u2019s future success relied upon quality education that had been compromised after \u201ca decade of drift and neglect\u201d and the sector\u2019s social license needed to be restored. He floated four options for reform, termed \u201cnuclear\u201d in private conversations. Among them was revamping the entire accreditation framework for private VET providers, to separate training from assessment as is done in year 12 certificates, forcing providers to re-apply for licenses and suspending enrolments in \u201clow-value\u201d courses, and banning the payment of education agent commissions for onshore students. \u201cMost providers do good things but there are a significant minority that are dodgy, selling work visas,\u201d he said. \u201cIn education, ASQA [Australian Skills Quality Authority] inspect the paperwork and use that as a proxy for quality. \u201cGood quality private providers are despairing. They report that dodgy providers just get the students in, pop the exam answers on the board and the students write them down and go back to work.\u201d Hill said dodgy providers couldn\u2019t be weeded out unless students were properly tested and the bar was raised to become an assessment provider. \u201cIf we \u2026 force the higher risk private VET providers to have their students externally assessed, then it would shock the system,\u201d he said. \u201cASQA could rapidly put colleges selling dodgy qualifications out of business.\u201d With concern over the rapid post-pandemic growth in international student numbers, Hill said suspending enrolments to courses with non-vocational outcomes in which vast numbers of VET students were enrolled was \u201ccontroversial\u201d but \u201cfood for thought\u201d. \u201cWhat benefit is Australia getting from tens of thousands of international students enrolled in certificates and diplomas in marketing, leadership and business?\u201d he said. \u201cThere are few if any migration pathways. The courses are cheap. And too many students are working not studying.\u201d The inquiry has heard sweeping allegations of education agents acting as a Ponzi scheme by taking commissions of up to 50% to enrol students in courses and funnelling them to lower quality private providers once arriving onshore. The broadly unregulated sector acts as a middle man to advise and recruit students from overseas.

In this way alone, he was lucky. Had he reached over the top, he says, \u201cI\u2019d have no hand.\u201d The explosion that followed left his body studded with more than 200 pieces of shrapnel, some of it organic material that did not show up in X-rays and could not be surgically removed. Years later, when shaving or washing his face, \u201cI\u2019d catch something that felt like a whisker, but if I grabbed some tweezers, it\u2019d be like a half-inch piece of wood embedded in there, you know?\u201d That morning in February 1987, Wright became the latest victim of the \u201cUnabomber\u201d, the terrorist who would be unmasked nine years later as Ted Kaczynski, the mathematics prodigy whose 17-year bombing spree \u2013 targeting universities, airlines and others that he linked, however vaguely, to technological progress \u2013 killed three people and injured nearly two dozen others. Kaczynski, 81, died by suicide in a North Carolina prison cell on Saturday 10 June. For years after his attack, Wright had pondered the bomber\u2019s motivation. In 1995, he received an answer in the form of a 35,000-word manifesto that Kaczynski successfully pressured the New York Times and Washington Post into publishing, on the promise that he would stop killing if they did so. Entitled \u201cIndustrial Society and Its Future\u201d, the essay laid out Kaczynski\u2019s nightmarish vision of humanity in an ever tightening embrace with technology that promised comfort and convenience, but left us enfeebled and alienated. \u201cI got a copy,\u201d says Wright. \u201cAnd I was like: OK, this is not my style of reading. I would periodically glance [at it].\u201d Among those who also read the manifesto was the bomber\u2019s brother, David, who recognised the monomaniacal style, and contacted the FBI, leading to Kaczynski\u2019s arrest. Yet over the years, something unexpected happened. Wright began to grow suspicious of the creeping reach of technology. And he became increasingly curious about Kaczynski\u2019s ideas. \u201cI can look at [the manifesto] and see a lot of value in saying that we have mental health issues because of social media, or gaming, or pick a thing. He kind of warned against that. He also talked about the value of being in nature, which I one thousand percent believe in,\u201d says Wright, who now works as an entrepreneur and life coach. \u201cI feel like, if you were able to step out of the story of murder \u2026 and say, [he was an] intelligent kid, bullied, had no friends, could see something coming that others didn\u2019t \u2013 what value could I take from that?\u201d His view points to perhaps one of the most perplexing and enduring turns in Kaczynski\u2019s story. Nearly 30 years after it was published in an eight-page insert in the Washington Post, the manifesto is Amazon\u2019s bestselling book in the category of radical political thought. Another book of his essays is among the website\u2019s top 10 books on political philosophy. TikTok and other platforms abound with clips that intersperse quotes from the manifesto with footage of industrial disasters and pollution, or the logos and CEOs of technology giants. Some users drily refer to \u201cUncle Ted\u201d, or of being \u201cTed-pilled\u201d: a reference to the red pill ingested by the protagonist in the 1999 film The Matrix that begins his journey to understanding the true nature of reality. The conservative writer Sohrab Ahmari wrote this week of the disturbing growth of a \u201cUnabomber right\u201d (\u201cbad person, but a smart analysis\u201d, Tucker Carlson remarked of Kaczynski in 2021). After the terrorist\u2019s death was announced, the entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted that Kaczynski \u201cmight not be wrong\u201d in his diagnosis that technology had been a disaster for humanity, one of a list of Silicon Valley figures who have praised the clarity of the bomber\u2019s reasoning (while condemning his violent acts). This intense interest in Kaczynski\u2019s ideas is not new, says Sean Fleming, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, who is writing the first book-length study of the Unabomber\u2019s ideology, and has spent years combing through archives filled with his journals, letters, drafts, prison correspondence and \u201ceven his grocery lists and lists of bomb-making materials,\u201d Fleming says. At the time that media outlets were considering whether to publish the manifesto, some within the FBI had figured that the tract would be too dense and idiosyncratic to find much purchase among the public. One columnist quipped it was the \u201cUnabomber\u2019s yawn\u201d. They miscalculated. \u201cThe manifesto certainly had a lot more popular appeal than the FBI anticipated,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cIt sold out at newsstands within days. There were people frantically calling the Washington Post asking where they could get a copy. Then smaller presses, such as anarchist publishers, started publishing paperback editions and pamphlet versions of it. \u201cAnd what was more striking than the quantity of the manifesto was the quality of the coverage,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cSo columnists would publish comparisons and debates between Kaczynski and some of his victims. They would present the ideas of this terrorist alongside the ideas of an Ivy League professor that he had bombed, and argue about who had the more compelling vision of technological society.\u201d Over the past decade, fascination with Kaczynski and the manifesto has risen again, becoming fodder for a 2021 feature film, Ted K, a Netflix documentary, a Discovery Channel drama and an Apple podcast series. In a world where so few feel they have control over their circumstances, that is saturated in social media and rushing into the age of AI \u2013 whether it is ready or not \u2013 it is perhaps unsurprising that interest has grown in such an infamous technological critic. \u201cI think [his ideas] resonate because they seem to respond to some of the crucial problems of our time,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cKaczynski talks about depression, anxiety, artificial intelligence, global warming, so many things, that so many of his concerns seem prescient in retrospect.\u201d James R Fitzgerald, an FBI profiler, was assigned to the Unabomber case in 1995 just as the manifesto surfaced, and remembers reading it for the first time. \u201cA lot of his ideas, I couldn\u2019t help but say, \u2018Yeah, right.\u2019 Maybe big business is a little too big sometimes, and maybe big government shouldn\u2019t be running amok here. And this was before social media was even popular,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBut the other part of my brain was saying, \u2018Look, he\u2019s a killer. He\u2019s a serial killer, we\u2019ve got to get him off the streets.\u2019\u201d Much of the embrace of Kaczynski\u2019s ideas is self-serving and selective, Fleming argues. \u201cHardly anyone who draws on the Unabomber\u2019s ideas accepts the whole package. So different people, with different motivations, pick different ideas and run with them.\u201d If Kaczynski did raise valid points, he says, it is because he took them from others, including the French sociologist Jacques Ellul, whose 1954 text, The Technological Society, electrified the bomber as a young man. \u201cFew of his arguments are actually original,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cHe borrowed most of his ideas from fairly mainstream academic authors who would never have condoned his violence. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should read Kaczynski as a theorist or philosopher, and try to separate his ideas from his violence,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s a self-described terrorist, and revolutionary, and this is how I read him.\u201d This distinction is not lost on everyone. In his later years, his prison letters and other writings indicate that Kaczynski had started to attract more hardcore supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a turning point around 2010, where he actually has devoted followers,\u201d Fleming says. The past decade has seen a rise in anti-technology radicalism, much of it with clear ideological links to the manifesto, Fleming says. European anarchists have attempted to blow up an IBM nanotech facility in Switzerland, shot a nuclear-energy executive in Genoa in 2012, and last August mailed a bomb to the head of an Italian weapons manufacturer. A group of Mexican \u201ceco-extremists\u201d known as ITS, whose missives lavishly praise Kaczynski, have been targeting scientists since 2011, prompting the brother of one victim to write to the journal Nature urging researchers to \u201ctake the threat seriously\u201d. A purported member of the group was jailed last year for attempting to detonate a bomb in Edinburgh. Publishing the manifesto led to Kaczynski\u2019s capture, but it set his ideas free. Was it a mistake? \u201cI stand by it,\u201d says Fitzgerald, who was a leading voice inside the FBI arguing for its publication. \u201cIf Kaczynski never did any writings, only sent his bombs to people, he very possibly could still be out there. \u201cI say all the time [now], when it\u2019s an unknown suspect, in a case where there\u2019s some writings, put it out there. Someone\u2019s hopefully going to recognise it, and if there\u2019s enough of it, it will also help explain why they\u2019re killing people.\u201d Over the years, conversing with journalists and supporters from his prison cell, Kaczynski, too, indicated he felt the trade-off had been worth it. \u201cIn his earliest writings \u2026 he was trying to organise an anti-tech lobby group before he took his violent turn,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cIn [an interview from] 1999, you see him finally taking some comfort that his efforts are paying off. And he\u2019s so much more assured by the 2020s than he is in previous decades.\u201d Sean Fleming and James R Fitzgerald spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast for an episode out now.

The arrests began before the outbreak of fighting in April between the RSF and forces loyal to Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto military leader, but have intensified since. The Islamists have fiercely opposed the attempt to seize power launched by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo the RSF\u2019s leader, fearing he will thwart their efforts to regain the political and economic power they enjoyed for decades in Khartoum. Dagalo, a former militia leader from the south-western region of Darfur who is accused of complicity in multiple massacres during his career, has sought to position himself as a reformer and publicly accused Burhan of being a \u201cradical Islamist\u201d. In a recent audio statement, the RSF\u2019s leader boasted of detaining thousands of Islamists during the two-month-old conflict, including many former members of the intelligence service and Islamist militias. \u201cWe exposed all the [Islamists\u2019] schemes and the terrorists\u2019 plans and extremists\u2019 plans \u2026 they are now in our prisons, now there are more than thousands of their officers and more than thousands of non-commissioned officers inside the prisons,\u201d Dagalo said. There is no independent confirmation of the numbers but several high-profile figures within Sudan\u2019s Islamist movement have been arrested in recent weeks. They include Mohamed al-Jazouli, a veteran hardliner who is the leader of a new alliance of Islamist parties, and Anas Omar, a former senior intelligence general and state governor under the regime of Omar al-Bashir, the autocratic leader of Sudan ousted in 2019. Jazouli had been a vocal supporter of the army since fighting broke out in April, and had called for a popular mobilisation to oppose Dagalo. Though Islamists in Sudan have avoided any high-profile public roles or statements in recent months, the attitudes of the main actors in the conflict towards the movement is central, analysts say. \u201c[Dagalo] wants the world to think that Islamists are a major threat and he is the one person who can oppose them. That\u2019s part of his political salesmanship. He also knows they are embedded in the economy and so rooting them out is in his economic interest too,\u201d said Prof Nick Westcott, the director of the Royal African Society. At least 2,000 people have been killed so far in the conflict in Sudan, which has spread across the country and caused suffering for millions. Since the fighting began, Burhan has rallied those who benefited from or were part of the regime of Bashir, the former dictator who was ousted in 2019. Bashir relied on Islamists throughout his time in power, filling the bureaucracy and intelligence services with ideologically committed supporters who hoped to see a rigorous system of religious governance in Sudan despite its large Christian minority. The Islamists have long had a significant presence among the regular military officers now fighting Dagalo\u2019s RSF in Khartoum and elsewhere. Estimates vary, but some put the proportion at about two-thirds. A former Islamist leader said history had taught them that the army \u201ccould kick them out of the politics\u201d and so had worked to \u201cplant their cells in the army\u201d for five decades. \u201cThe cells worked secretly but their work in the army was very clear,\u201d the former leader told the Guardian. The campaign intensified after Bashir took power in 1989 in tandem with the National Islamic Front, an Islamist organisation founded by Hassan Abdullah al-Turabi, a hardline lawyer and Islamic scholar. Burhan is seen as interested primarily in maintaining the power and influence of Sudan\u2019s military and protecting its economic interests. The career general lacked a political base on taking power in 2019 and has turned to veterans of Bashir\u2019s regime to head off challenges from pro-democracy forces and Dagalo. Early efforts at reform, including a potential purge of Islamists, were soon abandoned and reversed since the military coup in 2021 ended any hopes of a transition to democracy. Senior Islamists who had fled, many to Turkey, were able to return. In April last year, a new Islamist coalition was launched with a rally in central Khartoum, attended by many former regime supporters and officials. Thousands of other Islamists last year protested against the presence of the UN in the country. There are widespread suspicions that in April Islamists were working to prevent any deal between Burhan and Dagalo that might have avoided conflict. The RSF has accused Burhan of freeing a dozen Islamists, all former senior officials loyal to Bashir, who had been jailed in Khartoum. Sudan\u2019s military said the men escaped from Kober prison during fighting there. The exact location of Bashir, who has been imprisoned since being ousted by a coalition of pro-democracy activists, Sudan\u2019s military and the RSF in 2019 after months of popular protests, is unclear. Military authorities have said he was moved from Kober prison to a military hospital soon after the conflict broke out but \u201cbefore the rebellion broke out\u201d there."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9475e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/canada-wildfires-reconstruction-lytton", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": " Canada\u2019s fires are getting fiercer \u2013 and rebuilding is becoming a challenge", "lead": "As fires rage across the country, the experiences of those who lost everything in Lytton in 2021 raise larger questions about Canada\u2019s ability to rebuild", "author": "Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 04:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548517", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb89accb1f4365e94fcec4cb798b854d7251ffe/0_313_6469_3882/500.jpg", "body": "Mona Crowston had only minutes to gather her belongings before the wildfire which had been burning for days at the edge of her town swept down towards her house. The 84-year-old already had a suitcase packed, just in case. \u201cI made sure to tidy up what I could before we left. The last thing I wanted was to return home and have a messy room,\u201d she said. She and her husband left on 30 June 2021. Months later, when they finally returned to the site of their home of 47 years, all they found was charred and crumbled foundation. Most of the Canadian town of Lytton had also been destroyed. This year\u2019s spring wildfire season has been the worst on record in Canada, with more than 5m hectares of land burned \u2013 a figure higher than the entire 2016, 2019, 2020 and 2022 seasons combined. Already this year, more than 200 homes have been destroyed. And with warmer and drier months are still to come, the experiences of those who saw their lives destroyed in previous wildfires raise larger questions about both Canada\u2019s ability to rebuild after disaster, and its commitment to victims in the months and years after the flames are extinguished. In the days leading up to the Lytton fire, the surrounding region of British Columbia had broken heat records \u2013 at one point nearly reaching 50C (122F) \u2013 and the arid land was more parched than normal. \u201cThe wind that day was all just tremendous,\u201d said Crowston. \u201cAnd then there was the heat. Everything was so dry.\u201d When winds finally whipped the fire into Lytton, it only took 30 minutes for most of it to be destroyed. When residents returned briefly to tour the damage, they found the main commercial strip had been turned to dust. Homes and vehicles had seemingly vaporized. Nearly two years after the fire, similar conditions have set in across Canada, with typically damp regions left bone-dry. Unseasonably hot weather has shattered records in dozens of communities, and areas that typically don\u2019t experience roaring blazes \u2013 from Vancouver Island in the west to Quebec in the east \u2013 and have been left charred. JR Adams, a member of the Lytton First Nation, bore witness to the destruction of Adams\u2019s own community. And when Adams saw the recent news coverage of wildfires in Nova Scotia, painful memories came flooding back. \u201cMy heart dropped. I knew there was nothing I could do at that moment, except just feel for the people who lost their homes. I was there. I know. I know how they\u2019re feeling. And to see it on the news again, oh God.\u201d Crowston, Adams and scores of others were displaced and homeless for months. Flight, loss and homelessness exerted a heavy toll on Adams\u2019s mental health. \u201cFor months, I\u2019d wake up in a room that wasn\u2019t my home. It took a lot of time to accept this. It made facing every day difficult. I didn\u2019t know how to sleep. Even today, I\u2019m scared to sleep,\u201d said Adams. Earlier this year, the Fraser Valley Current reported on the slow efforts to rebuild Lytton. The village \u201cremains a flattened heap of dirt and concrete\u201d, it reported, with much of the space fenced off. Residents complained of bureaucratic delays and a feeling they had been forgotten. Work crews have found Indigenous artifacts at excavation sites, further slowing the process. As a result, next to nothing has been rebuilt yet. With hotter and larger fires projected to sweep across Canada in the coming years, the collective failure to rebuild in Lytton raises questions about the preparedness of governments to respond to large crises. \u201cI spent 62 years in Lytton. And I was hoping to rebuild. I just wanted to get home and get on with my life. I miss it terribly,\u201d said Crowston. A few months before the fire struck, the couple had replaced their bathroom \u2013 part of a bigger plan to renovate the property. Just days before the blaze, they had installed a new stained glass front door. \u201cAt least we got to enjoy that door for a few days,\u201d she said. But as the months in temporary accommodation dragged on \u2013 one elderly resident died still hoping to return home \u2013 Crowston and her husband eventually came to the sad conclusion that there was no going back. In November, they bought a home in the town of Ashcroft, an hour north of Lytton in a region still within the range of wildfires. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get settled. But you build your life somewhere. You have community, memories,\u201d said Crowston. \u201cWhen I looked out the windows of my home in Lytton, you saw mountains. Here, all I see are hedges.\u201d Glenn McGillivray, the managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, said that Canada no longer had systems in place to help speed up rebuilding efforts after natural disasters. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening any more. We\u2019re getting really big events, costly events, and they\u2019re coming really, really close together. And in some cases, they\u2019re overlapping,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s climate means that the construction season is relatively short, and reconstruction is often complicated by the logistical challenges of bringing large crews to isolated communities. Wildfires also pose unique challenges, such as the way vinyl siding and plastics melt into the ground, turning the soil toxic. In Halifax, where 200 buildings were recently destroyed by wildfires, contractors warn it could take three years to rebuild. \u201cWe just cannot keep this up. Disasters are getting larger and more costly. We\u2019re hitting a point where we\u2019re going to spend more on recovery than we are on building new construction in Canada. That\u2019s the trend and we just can\u2019t keep it up. Something has to happen,\u201d McGillivray said. While the community of Lytton is under the jurisdiction of the province, the Lytton First Nations reserve is under federal oversight, speeding up elements of the rebuilding process. In September, Adams got word that the modular homes on the Lytton First Nations reserve were ready. \u201cThe moment I got the key, I instantly packed up everything in my room. I left my hotel that night with my car packed with everything. And coming back, it was a rush. I was able to restart my routine again, to be with my family and after a year and a half, to almost feel home,\u201d said Adams. \u201cWe\u2019re finally all together, back on our reserves. And I feel like watching the progress happen. It\u2019s like we\u2019re taking our land back. And it\u2019s exciting to watch.\u201d But widespread news coverage of fires blazing across the country means the looming threat of future wildfires is never far from Adams\u2019 mind. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize how quickly things can change and how it can change your life,\u201d said Adams. \u201cPeople need to understand how fast Mother Nature can take control.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9475f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/over-to-you-australia-indigenous-campaigners-hope-voice-debate-is-now-respectful-not-racist", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Over to you, Australia: Indigenous campaigners hope voice debate is now respectful, not racist | Lorena Allam", "lead": "Politicians have passed legislation enabling the referendum, likely in October.

It\u2019s now up to the Australian people to decide whether or not to enshrine in the constitution an Indigenous voice to parliament. The referendum is expected to be held in October. Many key yes campaigners were in the public gallery to witness a turning point for the nation. They were no doubt relieved the question was settled and the official campaign can begin \u2013 well away from Canberra. It\u2019s unusual for there to be third-reading speeches of legislation \u2013 but this was no ordinary day in parliament. The Coalition and other voice opponents seized the opportunity to have one last crack at the voice on its way through the upper house. Most of their arguments have been well-ventilated over the past few months: the voice is risky, unknown, divisive and permanent. Some of those claims were \u201cbordering on misinformation, if not already in that territory,\u201d Senator David Pocock said. Independent senator and DjabWurrung Gunnai Gunditjmara woman Lidia Thorpe wore a \u201cgammin\u2019\u201d T-shirt and explained why she could not vote for a \u201cpowerless\u201d advisory body to the colonial institution of government. \u201cHappy assimilation day,\u201d Thorpe said in her opening remarks. \u201cAnother day in the colony\u201d she called out later as the Senate divided and votes were counted. Labor senator Murray Watt said it was \u201ca day as big as Uluru\u201d while Malarndirri McCarthy, the assistant minister for Indigenous Australians, called for dignity and respect in the coming debate. \u201cI ask all Australians, as we walk this sacred journey, [to show] the utmost respect for one another,\u201d McCarthy said. Keeping the debate respectful is what many Aboriginal and Islander people are most worried about. First Nations people know how easily any debate about us can turn racist \u2013 we know there is the potential for increased threats to our physical and mental safety between now and October. We wonder whether our country will be safe for us beyond the referendum \u2013 especially if the no vote wins. Cox is right. Parliament\u2019s work is done but it isn\u2019t finished with the voice. There are more public battles to come as politicians jockey to have their views reflected in the publication of the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d pamphlets. Opponents of the voice \u2013 who Watt accused on Monday of \u201cmaking stuff up\u201d \u2013 will have many more chances to ventilate their concerns \u2013 real and imagined. But for today, there is a celebration of another milestone reached on the road to recognition. Uluru dialogues co-chair and Alyawarre woman Pat Anderson said she had a fundamental belief \u201cyou will all do the right thing at the right time\u201d. \u201cThe Australian people will decide what sort of a country we are, what do we stand for, what are our values, who are we? That is what we will vote on soon,\u201d Anderson said. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, later issued a challenge to the nation: \u201cParliaments pass laws, but people make history.\u201d Albanese on Monday said he had faith in the public. So, over to you, Australia. \u2022 Lorena Allam is Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94760", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/wyndham-clark-holds-nerve-to-win-2023-us-open-as-rory-mcilroy-falls-just-short", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rory McIlroy falls short as Wyndham Clark holds nerve to win 2023 US Open", "lead": "Wyndham Clark claimed his first major golf championship after holding off Rory McIlroy to win the US Open by one shot at Los Angeles Country Club", "author": "Ewan Murray at LA Country Club", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 02:41:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548553", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/27d93c2d7324a8e79b0d0e65548f7b9c854bfeab/0_299_4514_2710/500.jpg", "body": "Eight years, 10 months and nine days. Thirty three major championships. The long, occasionally painful, wait for Rory McIlroy to take delivery of a fifth major title looked destined to end at LA Country Club on Sunday. Instead, Wyndham Clark \u2013 hitherto with just a single mainstream tour win to his name \u2013 prevailed at the US Open. The Hollywood Hills formed the backdrop to an epic underdog story. The Holywood man was denied once more. It was impossible not to feel sympathy for McIlroy, who has done everything in this sport since August 2014 bar win another of the trophies he craves so much. If there is sporting justice, he will crash through the barrier soon enough. For McIlroy, who fell short of Clark by a single, measly stroke, this one will sting. It is the hope that kills. At last summer\u2019s Open Championship, McIlroy was ultimately outplayed on day four by Cameron Smith. Then, as here, the Northern Irishman\u2019s putter fell as cold as a January morning in Reykjavik. What will hurt McIlroy upon deeper reflection is a sense of missed opportunity and, being blunt, the nondescript nature of the champion. Had McIlroy broken par even by one, he would have forced a playoff. A level-par 70 left him as the runner-up. \u201cI\u2019m getting closer,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cThe more I keep putting myself in these positions, sooner or later it\u2019s going to happen for me. When I do finally win this next major, it\u2019s going to be really, really sweet. I would go through 100 Sundays like this to get my hands on another major championship.\u201d This bullishness was admirable. Next stop, the Open at Royal Liverpool. McIlroy lifted the Claret Jug there in 2014. Clark is worthy of immense credit. This is a golfer who in half a dozen previous major appearances had missed the cut four times. His best finish was a tie for 75th. Now $3.6m richer, Clark\u2019s life has changed for ever. He displayed nerves of steel when chipping stone dead from a tricky lie at the side of the 17th green. Clark again required fortitude at the last; two putts from 60ft would seal victory. The 29-year-old cried with joy after tapping in for a par four. \u201cI have dreamed about this moment for so long,\u201d said Clark. \u201cI have worked so hard to be here, I have visualised winning this championship. I just feel like it was my time.\u201d McIlroy reached the turn in one-under-par 34. A birdie putt from 5ft at the 8th, which shot straight left, was the key aberration therein. Still, McIlroy was within one and striking distance of Clark in what had quickly become a two-horse race. That changed at the 14th. McIlroy found deep rough guarding a greenside bunker when his wedge-shot approach to the par five was hit by a gust. While an embedded ball meant McIlroy received a free drop, he was unable to save par. McIlroy shook his head when assessing what had transpired. He knew the extent of the damage. Playing in the group immediately behind, Clark delivered a birdie four. The advantage was suddenly three. Clark dropped shots at the 15th and 16th to leave the door open for McIlroy. However, the four-time major winner needed a birdie which had not appeared since the 1st. \u201cI need to be more efficient with my opportunities,\u201d added McIlroy. A four-four finish edged Clark over the line. As the leaders teed off, Tommy Fleetwood was in the midst of completing his second final round of 63 in a US Open. He is the first player in history to achieve that. Fleetwood\u2019s heroics catapulted him to a share of fifth. Even more striking was the fact he missed birdie putts inside of 6ft on the 1st and 18th. \u201cEverything in between was really, really good,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cI just need to be higher up the leaderboard coming into Sunday and then have another day like today.\u201d Rickie Fowler, who collapsed to a fourth-round 75, and Australia\u2019s Min Woo Lee ended tied with Fleetwood. Smith\u2019s six-under-par total sealed fourth place, one behind Scottie Scheffler. Tom Kim and Harris English completed the top 10. This, however, was Clark\u2019s day. In the shadow of Lionel Richie\u2019s mansion, he was gonna have a party. All night long."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94761", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/18/us-open-golf-2023-final-round-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "US Open golf 2023: Wyndham Clark wins his first major championship \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Wyndham Clark held off Rory McIlroy to win his first major golf title by one shot at Los Angeles Country Club", "author": "David Tindall and Matt Cooper", "datePublished": "2023-06-19 02:25:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548569", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/61ef11c02d1c5f544bafc36e9f94568ec0c7fa87/0_6_4000_2399/500.jpg", "body": "That\u2019s another US Open completed. The boy from Holywood, Belfast couldn\u2019t quite triumph in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Instead, Wyndham Clark announced himself to the world. From myself and Dave thank you for reading and emailing \u2013 and goodnight! Just before we wrap up, here\u2019s a report from Ewan Murray about the field\u2019s opinions of LA CC. \u201cWhy did you win today?\u201d Clark is asked after he lifts the trophy. \u201cI felt like my mom was watching over me today,\u201d he says. \u201cMiss you mom. And I worked so hard and so many times I visualised winning this championship and it felt like my time. \u201cUS Opens are tough. It\u2019s tough on a back nine. I kept saying I can do this, I can do this. I ground it on the way in.\u201d One of Clark\u2019s secrets to success? He said this earlier in the week: \u201cI will say that I came here (to LA CC) with my good buddy, PJ. He\u2019s a member. He\u2019s a good player and he really knows the golf course. \u201cThat 18 holes was the equivalent of probably playing 36 holes because he was telling me how certain putts break, how this one is faster than that. If you\u2019re here, you want to go there. He was spot on. \u201cWhen I left that practice round I felt like I didn\u2019t even need a practice round. I felt like it was that in-depth.\u201d The final scores on the doors: -10: W Clark -9: R McIlroy -7: S Scheffler -6: C Smith -5: T Fleetwood, M W Lee, R Fowler -4: T Kim, H English Rory McIlroy on his performance: \u201cThe putter - I\u2019ll rue some chances. That wedge on 14 coming up short, too. Just didn\u2019t quite get the job done. I\u2019ll keep coming back. I\u2019m right there but it\u2019s such fine margins.\u201d \u201cSo good, so good, so good,\u201d yelled a friend of Clark as he received back slaps and fist pumps galore. It\u2019s a sentiment that is hard to argue with. He has been superb this week. A sensational performance. A second win of the year. A first major championship. Tears and a look to the heavens. Clark\u2019s caddie removes the flag. Clark hits his putt. Oh it\u2019s good. Very, very good. Inches from the hole. Wow. The galleries have been allowed to surround the 18th green. Clark peers back at them. It\u2019s as raucous on 18 today as it\u2019s been anywhere all week. Here we go. Clark settles over his ball. 198 yards to the flag. \u201cThe palm tree,\u201d says his caddie, meaning the line. His ball finds the front of the green. He\u2019s 60 feet from the flag. Triumph is within touching distance \u2026 but it\u2019s not over yet. \u201cAll he can do now is wait,\u201d says Ewen Murray on TV, as McIlroy walks off the 18th green. Behind, Clark has to walk up the 18th hole with a cameramen beside him. What thoughts must be racing through his head! McIlroy\u2019s putt at 18 is one of his best of the day but it doesn\u2019t drop! Back on the tee, Clark finds the fairway. He\u2019s got three shots from there to become a major champion. Clark is superb \u2013 yet again \u2013 with his short game. His pitch on the 17th settles by the hole and he secures his par. It\u2019s all down to the 72nd hole now. But advantage Clark \u2013 he leads McIlroy by one. What about the approaches? Clark at 17 first: he misses the green (he\u2019s done that every round this week) but has done so in a good spot. He\u2019s 54 feet away with nothing between his ball and the flag. Relatively flat too. The biggest hazard? Nerves! McIlroy at 18: he watches Scheffler knock one close, can he produce the same? He has to step away because of the din \u2013 the first din of the week more or less \u2013 then he finds the putting surface but he\u2019s 41 feet away. Clark on the 17th tee, finds the fairway, 182 to the flag. McIlroy on the 18th tee, finds the fairway, 185 yards to the flag. There really is very little in this! What happens if we need extra holes? The US Open is now decided by an aggregate two hole play-off if there is a tie after 72 holes. McIlroy is frustrated after his birdie putt does no more than nestle by the hole. But he doesn\u2019t know what has happened on the 16th green. Riley said earlier that the Northern Irishman had ignored a leaderboard \u2013 will he know the situation heading up the final hole? -10: W Clark (16) -9: R McIlroy (17) Bogey for Clark! He slaps the face of his putter after his ball lips out at the 16th! He is now only one clear of McIlroy. TV\u2019s Wayne Riley knew better than the cameras. McIlroy, he explains, planned to take an alternative route to the 17th green. He powered the ball over trees onto an adjacent fairway. His approach landed with a roar from the galleries but he still has 32-feet to the hole. Clark executes a superb approach at the 16th. He\u2019s left himself 7-feet for par. Let\u2019s have a reminder of just how remarkable it is that he\u2019s withstood the major championship pressure. First, there is his major record which includes four missed cuts in six starts and a best of tied 75th. But it\u2019s also true that 23 of the last 25 major championship winners had experience of contending a major in at least one of the three that preceded their win (finishing top eight or sitting top four with 18 holes to play). Clark has never felt that heat. It doesn\u2019t seem to be bothering him, however. It\u2019s getting very twitchy. McIlroy\u2019s drive at 16 has gone left and might be in trouble. It\u2019s one of those where the TV camera lingers on trees and marshals who are walking towards them. Behind, Clark has to heave his ball out of the fairway bunker at 15 so needs to save par from 130 yards. The state of play: -11: W Clark (15) -9: R McIlroy (16) -7: S Scheffler (16), R Fowler (15) -6: C Smith (F) McIlroy\u2019s long distance birdie putt at 16 slips a nasty 7-feet past the hole. But drama behind him on the tee \u2013 Clark has driven into the fairway bunker and might struggle to reach the green. McIlroy putts \u2026and it drops! That was vital. McIlroy has an ugly lie after that errant tee shot at the 16th. He has, however, clattered it onto the putting surface. A long away from the hole, though. Clark\u2019s chip has slipped to around 10-feet at 15. Can he stay three shots clear? No! A bogey and the first crack in his previously iron-clad short game. The gap is two. Thanks Dave. Things have certainly changed in the last 20 minutes. I\u2019m thinking of this week\u2019s most regular emailer, Michael Meagher, who is somewhere out there sighing: \u201cOh Rory.\u201d Also, before I crack on with the finale, I just want to say that, in a week that\u2019s been full of chatter about the Golden Age of Hollywood, well played Min Woo Lee for celebrating it best with his Douglas Fairbanks/Errol Flynn style moustache. And his top 10 finish, of course. McIlroy drives into rough at 16. Not good. Clark\u2019s tee shot at 15 is waywad though and misses the green. Do we have further twists? Matt will take you down the closing stretch. Here goes McIlroy with his birdie putt at 15. It shaves the hole. Of course it does. That\u2019s a par. Clark eyes up his eagle try back at 14. Holing it would be fantastic; taking two putts for birdie is a very valuable consolation prize. Clark is rightfully cautious and makes sure of the birdie-4. He pulls three clear. Fowler also makes birdie but that\u2019s more to firm up his bid for bronze rather than gold. -12: W Clark (14) -9: R McIlroy (15) -7: R Fowler (14) -6: C Smith (F), Scheffler (15) Clark must have seen all the McIlroy drama and he\u2019s had to spend plenty of time stewing in the fairway. Under the circumstances he could be forgiven for messing this approach up. Instead, he hits a worldie from 280 yards onto the green and will have 20 feet for eagle. Very soon, Clark could be three clear with four to play. McIlroy needs to pull something out of the bag. Perhaps he\u2019s started that process with a tee shot to 19 feet at the par-3 15th. But, for goodness sake, he has to hole a putt not sooner or later but now. McIlroy drops his ball, without penalty, in rough outside of the bunker and hacks out to nine feet. A chance to save par but he hasn\u2019t holed a putt of that length all day. He looks anxious as he stalks the putt. This is huge and\u2026 he misses right. Ouch. A first bogey for McIlroy and he falls two back. Scheffler also drops a shot and he\u2019s six off the pace. A costly hole. Out on the course, Sky\u2019s Wayne Riley explains that it\u2019s broken ground so McIlroy can pluck out his embedded ball and get a free drop. It was deemed to be plugged. That\u2019s a huge, huge break. The turning point? We shall see. McIlroy slumps over his knees as his approach to 14 holds up in the wind and plonks into the front bunker. And drama, it\u2019s plugged in the face. This will require a ruling. Back on the tee, Clark booms away a solid drive. The clubhouse leader, replacing Tommy Fleetwood, is Open champion Cam Smith. The Aussie signs for a 67 to finish at 6-under. Clark does indeed take two putts for par at 13, the second a pressure-free tap-in. He retains his one-shot lead. McIlroy lays up on the 612-yard par-5 14th. Barring a big collapse from either, the 123rd US Open is surely now a two-horse race. McIlroy has only holed 27 feet of putts over his first 13 holes by the way. -11: W Clark (13) -10: R McIlroy (13) -6: C Smith (17), Fowler (13) Viktor Hovland, one of the pre-tournament favourites for victory, wraps up his week with a 72. That\u2019s currently good enough for tied 20th (Partridge shrug). Scheffler holes a bomb at 13 to return to -6 and perhaps give himself the merest squeak. What Rory would give for that. Scheffler\u2019s putt raced into the hole but McIlroy\u2019s tentative effort pulls up four or so feet short. In it goes though and it\u2019s a 12th straight par. This is Nick Faldo Muirfield \u201887 golf but, in a tough US Open, that\u2019s no bad thing. Back down the fairway, Clark has to thrash out of a tough lie but from 187 yards he lands his ball short and it runs onto the green. It\u2019s a long way from the flag but he\u2019ll fancy himself to two-putt it for par. As he walks to the green, Rory\u2019s tee shot at 14 drifts left into the rough. Great drive by McIlroy at 13, currently the 2nd hardest hole on the course. He hits his 12th green out of 13 in regulation although not within birdie range. Would Rory accept six closing pars now? Quite possibly. Back on the tee, Clark misses the fairway so making four from there is no guarantee. Top fives in majors are good to have on the record and there are currently four players in a tie for fifth: Tommy Fleetwood after his 63, Min Woo Lee (17), Tom Kim (15) and Scottie Scheffler (12). Clark\u2019s wedge at 12 is played with caution to the heart of the green. No point in taking on that front flag. He\u2019ll take his chances with a 30-footer instead. Fowler has to be more aggressive given that he\u2019s playing his third and his approach finishes 10 feet away. You sense he\u2019ll have to hole that to keep his chances alive. Clark cosies his first putt to the side of the hole so that\u2019s another par ticked off. But Fowler? Nope, he misses right. That\u2019s a fifth bogey of the day and he\u2019s five behind and almost out of it. -11: W Clark (12) -10: R McIlroy (12) -6: C Smith (16), Fowler (12) Last year\u2019s winner Matt Fitzpatrick knocks in a 12-footer for par at 18 and that completes a pretty solid defence. Rounds of 71-70-68-70 for a total of 1-under 279 which currently has him in a tie for 18th. Scheffler\u2019s putter is deserting him now. He misses his par putt at 12 and drops six back. Race run surely. Back down the fairway, Fowler can only chip back to the fairway from a miserable lie as The Smiths song goes. Thanks Matt. How good is Wyndham Clark\u2019s short game! He floats a beautiful chip up on to the 11th green and it almost drops in the hole. He\u2019ll have four feet or so for par. Fowler also hits a great chip and should save par but he doesn\u2019t, tugging his putt left for another bogey. With Clark finishing off his up and down, Fowler is four back again. McIlroy finds the green at 12 and is 30 feet away. But here\u2019s a thing: Rory hasn\u2019t holed anything over five feet today. He ranks 52nd out of 65 for Strokes Gained: Putting in round four. The consolation is that Clark isn\u2019t playing like Cam Smith in last summer\u2019s Open. Clark looks nervous. Pars may be good enough for McIlroy on this tough back nine. That\u2019s what he settles for at 12 after a good first putt which, of course, threatens but doesn\u2019t drop. Cam Smith has suddenly climbed into the top five. He\u2019s -3 for the day and -6 for the week. Trouble for the last pair as they miss the green at the 11th \u2013 Fowler in a bunker and Clark in the rough. State of play as I pass the baton to Dave. -11: W Clark (10) -10: R McIlroy (11) -8: R Fowler (10) -6: C Smith (15) S Scheffler (11) Will Clark be watching?! As McIlroy lines up his birdie putt at 11, Clark is on the tee and it might be a long way away but it\u2019s high up \u2013 the view is very clear. Footage suggests he might be keeping his head down, \u201clooking\u201d for something in his bag. McIlroy putts \u2026 and it runs out of steam. A touch dribbly. He suggests it bobbles. Upside? A tough hole negotiated. Downside? A good chance missed. Scheffler hits a terrible par putt and it\u2019s not his first rotter today. Laura Davies on TV says she doesn\u2019t even fancy the bogey putt. But he makes it. Now -6 for the week and five back. Dave Bowyer from Coffs Harbour emails: \u201cRootin\u2019 for Rory today! I got faith.\u201d The 295-yard par-three 11th. Probably the test Matt Fitzpatrick was thinking of when he poo-pooed an anonymous hole yesterday. Ridiculously long. McIlroy biffs a long iron to 18-feet. Harris English returns to our screens. Only to hole a longish par putt. Ditto DJ. They\u2019re surely spent. A big few minutes. While Clark attempts to save par from another nasty spot, McIlroy has a 14-foot birdie putt coming up at the 10th. Clark chops down on his ball and it seems, at first glance, that he\u2019s skewed the shot, but he\u2019s been very shrewd. He catches a slope and the ball runs down it leaving a very makeable par putt. McIlroy runs his putt past the hole. Back to Clark \u2013 he holes it! Very courageous. He remains one clear as he makes the turn. Someone might have slipped Kryptonite into Clark\u2019s pocket, Gregory. His tee shot at the par-three 9th has found more of the lush greenside Bermuda rough that resembles very long greengrocer fake grass. Gregory Odle emails: \u201cWell, Fowler\u2019s gone afoul, Rory\u2019s yet to roar, and Clark? I\u2019m thinking Clark Kent\u2019s in the house!\u201d Clark completes his bogey and Fowler records a birdie at the same hole to edge back into it. Updated scores at the top end: -11: W Clark (8) -10: R McIlroy (9) -8: R Fowler (8) -7: S Scheffler (9) With his fourth shot Clark has an almighty wipe at the ball and does remove it from the thicket of long grass but it has flown over the green. He\u2019s facing a big challenge here. The fifth shot is chopped out and it is very good. Very, very good. \u201cOutstanding,\u201d says TV\u2019s Andrew Coltart. A bogey 6 is on the cards. A good damage limitation exercise. Where has Clark ended up? His ball is in thick grass. His left leg is higher than his right. He thrashes at it \u2026 and nothing happens! It\u2019s still in there! Xander Schauffele has closed the front nine with back-to-back birdies. Too little, too late, but he\u2019s in the red for the day again (-1) and lifts himself to solo 5th on -6. Clark finds the barranca at the 8th! Stood over his approach to the par-five 8th, the leader had a big opportunity to edge further clear. He might still do so but he\u2019d have hoped to find the green and has instead pulled his ball into the scrub of the dry creek. Yikes. McIlroy three putts the 8th green for a par-five! Michael knows \u2026 Michael Meagher emails: \u201cThis is starting to feel a lot like St Andrews: Rory playing well but not quite sparking and an opponent playing the round of his life. Oh Rory!\u201d Don\u2019t give up faith just yet Michael! Oh dear. Talking of punctures, Rickie Fowler is having problems at the par-three 7th and will make another bogey which leaves him -7 for the week. Clark very nearly makes another birdie but will tap in for par. He remains -12 for the tournament. Up ahead, Scheffler and McIlroy will take aim at eagle-3s on the par-five 8th with putters. Thanks Dave and I enjoyed the Tour de France reference earlier (at 23.22). To run with it a little further, I think Harris English got a puncture, but is a domestique helping him back into it? He\u2019s just made a birdie at the 8th to climb back to +2 for the day, -4 for the week and tied 8th. Is this now a two-horse race? Fowler has slipped four back while Scheffler is six in arrears after eventually making a bogey at 7 following that wayward tee shot. Matt will take you through the next hour. \u201cSeriously impressive so far,\u201d says Sky\u2019s Rich Beem as Clark rolls in his birdie putt to hit 12-under. That\u2019s two clear of McIlroy whose positive putt at 7 just stays out. That\u2019s an opening birdie and six pars for Rory. All good but he may have to find some extra gears if Clark continues to set this sort of pace. -12 W Clark (6) -10: R McIlroy (7) -8: R Fowler (6) -6: S Scheffler (7) -5: T Fleetwood (F), X Schauffele (8) McIlroy launches his tee shot at 7 so far into the air it nearly clips the moon. His ball finally emerges from space and finds the front of the green. By contrast, Scheffler\u2019s tee shot is off the planet left. Marshals scuttle off into the woods, looking for signs of life. At 6, Clark finds thick greenside rough but shows magic wrists to hack out to about five feet. He\u2019ll have that for birdie and a two-shot lead. It\u2019s easy to see why he ranks 4th for Strokes Gained: Around The Green this week. Fowler wedges to 20 feet but his putt slips by. It just doesn\u2019t look to be his day. Back to Scheffler and he somehow finds a line through the trees and cashes in on his fortunate break to clip his second onto the green. Fowler flexes his knees sharply as a six-footer for par at 5 doesn\u2019t catch enough of the hole. That\u2019s another bogey and he\u2019s +2 for the day and not doing what he needs to do. Clark looks far more on it and he pars. Fowler is now three back, still in contention but current status is now \u201cwobbling\u201d. Rory plays the short par-4 6th rather scruffily. An average drive leaves him a difficult second which he leaves 30 feet away. His first putt pulls up four feet short but he holes the knee-knocker. No pictures on the scorecard as they say. A par and he moves on. -11 W Clark (5) -10: R McIlroy (6) -8: R Fowler (5) -7: S Scheffler (6) -5: T Fleetwood (F) Joe Pearson from Indianapolis mails in: \u201cIs the wording of Fleetwood\u2019s tweet meant to imply that maybe a monkey has done it? Or possibly a horse?\u201d Fair point. It\u2019s sort of a vague, English, self-deprecation type thing I guess. Much was made of Scottie Scheffler\u2019s cold putter coming into this week. If it heated up, he\u2019d be unstoppable. But at pre-US Open temperatures it would foil any victory hopes. To this point, it\u2019s fallen between those two extremes. He\u2019s a fairly good 29th for Strokes Gained: Putting but Clark is 4th, McIlroy 16th and Fowler 9th. If just a few more had dropped, Scheffler would be vying for the lead. As it is, he\u2019s four back and fighting to stay on Clark\u2019s heels. Great up and down from Fowler and he saves par at the 4th hole to stay one back. But only momentarily. Clark rattles his five-footer into the hole with aplomb and moves clear at the top. At five, McIlroy\u2019s drive bounded down the cambered fairway and toppled into the right rough. He\u2019s had to hack out to short left of the green so needs to scramble for par. Rory decides to putt from about 90 feet away and\u2026 wow, it catches the lip and spins out. That could have gone in or whizzed 15 feet by. Rory chuckles, perhaps more thinking of the latter. -11 W Clark (4) -10: R McIlroy (4) -9: R Fowler (4) -7: S Scheffler (4) -5: T Fleetwood (F), X Schauffele (6) Tommy Fleetwood missed the putt that would have made him just the fourth man in history (although the third this week!) to shoot 62 in a major. But he likes the new stat he\u2019s just been told. For now, the leaderboard has the look of a Tour de France stage. There\u2019s a three-man breakaway - McIlroy (-10), Clark (-10) and Fowler (-9) \u2013 while Scheffler (-7) is trying his best to attach himself to it. The peloton is too far back to reel them in. McIlroy two-putts for par at 4 but there are contrasting fortunes at that par 3 for Clark and Fowler. Clark hits one of the shots of the day there to leave himself just five feet for birdie but Fowler comes up way short and will have to chip from the barranca. Fowler has taken his outerwear off with the sun starting to come out and immediately looks more like a major winner. Nice shirt (thin pink and white stripes). His approach to 3 finishes 18 feet away as does Clark\u2019s but both have to settle for par, the latter\u2019s effort just darting away from the hole at the last second. Is it me or does anyone judge the chances of a final-day major challenger by what they\u2019re wearing? For example, Xander Schauffele is donning some sort of Hawaiian number today. You can\u2019t win a major with that on. Sony Open maybe but not this. I\u2019m also far from convinced that Rickie Fowler\u2019s attire is strong enough. A bit Honda Classic-y. McIlroy, Clark and Scheffler look the part though. This stuff is important. Sort of reminds me of Take The Money And Run and Woody Allen\u2019s character, Virgil Stockwell, berating his wife for picking him out the wrong-coloured shirt ahead of his attempted heist later that day. \u201cNobody wears beige to a bank robbery.\u201d Thanks Matt. Clark\u2019s par attempt at 2 is always heading right of the hole so that\u2019s a bogey. Fowler also hands one back as his right to lefter drops away, lacking the necessary pace. Up at 3, Scheffler\u2019s birdie try catches the lip but stays out so he remains three back. Rory is closer but knocks his 11-footer wide and there\u2019s still some meat on the bone there. No worries though as McIlroy holes the one back from four feet. Time for a leaderboard upate. -10: R McIlroy (3), W Clark (2) -9: R Fowler (2) -7: S Scheffler (3) -5: T Fleetwood (18), C Morikawa (10) A tester coming up for the leader Clark on the par-four 2nd green. His first putt has come up 16-feet short of the hole. And Fowler has to gouge his ball from the greenside rough. He has 13-feet for par. Dave will update you! Harris English is not alone among the late starters in having early struggles. He\u2019s lost two shots to the card in three holes while Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele are +1 through 3 and 4 holes respectively. Fleetwood magic at the last. He\u2019s hit a superb approach to 18 and has 5-feet for birdie and a 62 \u2013 oh no, he misses it! Oh dear. A second 63 for him in the final round of the US Open but that\u2019s little consolation right now. On the 2nd green, McIlroy rolls a wonderful lag putt to the hole edge. Scheffler is more tentative with his from closer range. Both add par scores to their cards. Everyone is now out on the course and here\u2019s the state of play at the top end: -11: W Clark (1) -10: R McIlroy (1), R Fowler (1) -7: S Scheffler (1) -5: T Fleetwood (17) Fleetwood saves par from 13-feet at the 17th. He is alone in fifth now on -5, by dint of English\u2019s woes at the second (a double bogey 6). The last pair out? Clark gets up-and-down from the back of the green to hit -11 for the week and regain the lead. Fowler adds a par to his card. Harris English has endured a terrible time since being one shot off the lead through 10 holes yesterday. He played the last eight holes of round three in +4 and he did eventually make par at the 1st but he\u2019s still off the green after his regulation four shots at the 2nd. McIlroy takes aim for the perfect start on the 1st. It\u2019s a beautiful effort but just brushes past the edge of the hole. A tap in birdie, though, and he\u2019s joined the Fowler and Clark at the top of the leaderboard. Scheffler secured his par. McIlroy plays a fine approach to the 1st green. He has 32-feet for eagle. Scheffler needs three shots to find the putting surface and it\u2019s still his honour. Back on the tee, Rickie Fowler\u2019s opening blow hangs out to the right, finds the rough and pops down deep into the roots. Wyndham Clark looks anxiously after his effort but he\u2019s in the fairway. Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s momentum is disrupted by a bogey at the 16th. Elsewhere, Sergio Garcia is baffled when he holes out from greenside rough and Padraig Harrington delighted to find the hole from a greenside bunker. They\u2019re out of the bigger picture but finding the hole from all angles. We\u2019ve had an update regarding Sargent\u2019s remarkable lip out. The USGA report the group ahead of him had damaged the hole and it has been fixed. Dave is delighted that there is a conspiracy surrounding him because we rather like the idea that he and PGA Tour player William McGirt sound like CIA operatives suspected to be murkily involved with events at Dealey Plaza in 1963. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy hit the 1st tee. Scheffler tugs his drive left and into the thick grass atop a fairway bunker. McIlroy takes a deep breath then steps forward and clatters his ball down the fairway. It briefly flirts with the rough but takes a straight kick. The chaos of English\u2019s opening shot here: Folk like to visit the tented village during a major. Not many, as Harris English has just done, do so with their opening tee shot when playing in the pre-penultimate group of the championship! A huge block and it came to rest among the punters milling about. One of them even picked it up, but was quickly told to put it back. A nervy start for the man who started solo fifth. Gordon Sargent finished his round a short while ago like this. An absolutely extraordinary lip out. TV\u2019s Rich Beem even suggested the USGA would go out and investigate. It did look odd. The good news is that he has still won low amateur honours. Here comes Tommy! A sensational approach to the par-five 14th from Fleetwood with his five-wood from the rough, threaded through the greenside bunkers and he\u2019s drained the eagle putt. A second eagle of the round, he\u2019s -8 for the day, -6 for the week, tied 5th on the leaderboard and he\u2019s found the putting surface at the par-three 15th. Thanks Dave. Between 1926 and 2009 just one European \u2013 Tony Jacklin at Hazeltine in 1970 \u2013 won the US Open. I remember that in the 1980s and 90s its difficulty was almost mythical, a mountain Europeans couldn\u2019t conquer. The slopes too steep, the load too heavy, the air too thin. But between 2010 and last year? Six European wins in 13 events. Can Rory McIlroy make it seven in 14? Rory looking very relaxed when the cameras focus on him doing various things on the range. Do we read significance into that? I\u2019ll hand to Matt for the next hour. Rory teeing off at 22.19 UK time. Jordan Smith is hanging tough and is nearly safely back in the hutch with a 5-under lap to show his family and friends. He\u2019s made par at 16 and 17 although the 18th could prove a sting in the tail. He\u2019s struggling for par there. Matt Fitzpatrick, who leaves the pin in when he putts, misses a par effort from two feet at 3! If I believed in the supernatural and golfing gods and magic fairies, I\u2019d say that was Los Angeles Country Club getting revenge for the defending champion rather dissing it yesterday. Dissing it in a very English way at least. \u201cIt\u2019s not my cup of tea,\u201d fumed Fitzpatrick, who is now tied 24th. A reminder of those tee-times for the final groups. It\u2019s getting close! 21:46 Bryson DeChambeau (US), Joo-Hyung Kim (Kor) 21:57 Ryutaro Nagano (Jpn), Xander Schauffele (US) 22:08 Harris English (US), Dustin Johnson (US) 22:19 Rory McIlroy (NI), Scottie Scheffler (US) 22:30 Wyndham Clark (US), Rickie Fowler (US) Here\u2019s the prediction of two-time major winner Justin Thomas. Agree? Rahm gets to 5-under for the day with a birdie conversion from 14 feet at 11. All those red numbers have hauled him up to tied 10th and in line for some more Wikipedia yellow on his majors record. Sky Sports\u2019 on-course man, Wayne Riley, does a weather forecast to camera. He\u2019s not sure when the sun will break through and burn off the marine layer. A camera pans out to reveal a limp flag. For now, the course is still gettable. Like Rahm, Patrick Cantlay is on Team Too Little Too Late. He scraped into the weekend on the number, moved up with a 67 in round three and has now just curled in a 30-foot birdie putt which drops into the cup on the very last roll to move up to tied 14th on 2-under. Another fantastic three wood by Fleetwood, this one at the long par-3 11th that leaves him inside four feet. He brushes that in to hit 6-under for the day and 4-under overall. A flick of the eyes over to the leaderboard and last week\u2019s Canadian Open runner-up is up to tied eighth. Fellow Englishman Jordan Smith is now battling to hold on to all the gains he made on the front nine. He pars 14 and 15 and remains -5 on his round and even par overall. That\u2019s currently tied 26th. Rahm\u2019s attempt to join Smith on 5-under for the day fails at 11. He lets out some sort of primal scream as his putt misses right. Jon Rahm\u2019s story this week could be one of too little, too late. He\u2019s reached the turn in 4-under 31 after a burst of birdies at 6, 7 and 9. That puts the Masters champion in tied 14th on 2-under for the championship but it\u2019s come far too late to put him in the shake up. Rahm is in positive figures for all the Strokes Gained categories this week but not in the top 20 for any of them. Basically, he\u2019s been lacking just a little in all areas. Nothing wrong with his wedge at 10 though and he\u2019ll have about five feet for another birdie. Thanks Matt. Rory said earlier in the week that Los Angeles Country Club had elements of famed Florida course, Seminole. Interesting to note then that the surging Austin Eckroat was a member of the victorious 2021 USA Walker Cup team at Seminole. That doesn\u2019t quite tell the whole story. He won both singles matches, the latter by 7&amp;6! In not ideal timing Eckroat has just bogeyed 12 but he remains inside the top 10 (tied ninth on 3-under). Cameron Young is in new territory this weekend because prior to this week, his major championship experience was pure boom or bust. He\u2019d missed five cuts, but his only other finishes? Tied third, second and tied seventh. He\u2019s currently -1 through the 1st, tied 17th for the week. Can he hunt down another top 10?! I\u2019m off for a break now so will hand you back to Dave who will keep note of any charge from him. It\u2019s been a hoodie morning in LA. Rory McIlroy arrived wearing one. And so did Rickie Fowler. Fleetwood\u2019s round is getting better. Another birdie at the par-three 9th and he turns in just 30 blows. He\u2019s now -5 for the round, -3 for the week and tied for 10th. He has form going low on Sunday at the US Open \u2013 he carded a 63 to grab second place in 2018. Here\u2019s how he made that eagle earlier: Tyrrell Hatton has just started his final round and the English are playing well today. Jordan Smith has just dropped a shot at 13 but remains -5 for the day and level-par for the week, and Tommy Fleetwood is -4 through 8 (-2 for the week). Both of them have made eagle-2s \u2013 Smith at the 480-yard 5th, Fleetwood rather more predictably at the 316-yard 6th. Remember those stats about US Open final round records? I quoted them at the start of my shift, just after 8 p.m.. By way of comparison take a look at Brooks Koepka\u2019s: he\u2019s 6-for-8 at going sub-70 \u2013 a huge contrast to this week\u2019s leaders. The two-time champion has just started his final round and, with wonderful timing, he\u2019s done so with a bogey at the par-five 1st. Ouch. Austin Eckroat just had 6-feet for birdie at the 10th and it has lipped out. Meanwhile, two Spaniards are under-par for the day. David Puig is -4 through 16 and Jon Rahm -2 through the 6th. Sergio Garcia is yet to catch fire. He\u2019s level-par through the 8th and yet again he won\u2019t finish top 10 in a major \u2013 he hasn\u2019t done so since winning the 2017 Masters. He\u2019s +2 for the week and tied 40th. Jon Rahm, by the way, has just grumbled \u201cCould I get a good lie in a bunker please?\u201d It\u2019s quite a habit of his to make sure everyone knows how the golf course is conspiring against him. It\u2019s also a habit of his to doggedly persist and he does that right now, draining a long putt to complete an unlikely sand save. Earlier Dave quoted podcaster Andy Leck, who was disappointed to report that the course has been watered. I was thinking of this when watching the Women\u2019s Amateur Championship this afternoon. Played on the linksland of Prince\u2019s GC it was dry and parched and rapid. And it made me wonder what this week could have been like if the USGA had allowed it. Take a look at some of the gallery walkways across fairways. They look like the ones we\u2019re used to at an Open Championship. We could have had fairways and greens like them, too. How are the leaders feeling right now? Ahead of the final round of the Open at St Andrews last year I found myself getting a coffee next to Eve Muirhead, the Olympic gold medal winning curling skip. I mentioned to her that she\u2019d know better than anyone how Rory McIlroy would be feeling right then and added, somewhat absurdly, that I have never dreamed of lifting trophies or visualised scoring winning goals. Instead, I would have loved to experience the fear that comes before those defining moments in sport; asking myself if I had it in me to achieve what I wanted so dearly. Muirhead looked at me as if I was mad and said: \u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to experience it. It\u2019s absolutely horrible.\u201d Austin Eckroat gave himself a great look at birdie on the 9th. It just slipped past the hole on the high side but he turns in 29 and he\u2019s tied the low score for nine holes in the championship. Hello, hello. Eckroat has drained a 23-foot eagle putt at the 8th and he is suddenly tied eighth in the US Open! He\u2019s -6 through eight holes and -4 for the tournament. Excellent point from Henni Koyack on commentary: the late starters \u2013 many of them at least \u2013 will be watching this early action on TVs in the clubhouse, in the gym or while dining. How have the leading contenders fared in past US Open final rounds? I\u2019ve had a little look. (Bear in mind that this day is as tough as it gets in golf, so many scores in the 70s are to be expected.) Rickie Fowler: 1-for-8 at breaking 72 in the final round and the exception was remarkable \u2013 a 65 in 2018 that came after an 84 in the third round. (What about when starting the final round in the top five? 72-72) Wyndham Clark: fresh ground. (n/a) Rory McIlroy: nine final rounds and he\u2019s feast or famine: four sub-70s and five failures to break 72. (69-73) Scottie Scheffler: trending? 73 in his first, 72 in his second, 67 last year. (67) Harris English: sneakily he has plenty of experience because he\u2019s 7-for-7 at making the cut in this championship. That\u2019s the good news. The bad is that he\u2019s 1-for-7 at breaking 72. He did post a 68 in 2021 but three times he hasn\u2019t broken 76. (73) Hello everyone. What a prospect we have in store: a high quality leaderboard, a front nine full of opportunities and a back nine to sift the chancers from the champions. Thanks for joining us for the ride! Dave mentioned that there\u2019s a charge going on and Austin Eckroat is the man doing it. He\u2019s ticked four birdies in seven holes and has the par-five 8th to come. He\u2019s -4 for the round, -2 for the week and on the verge of breaking the top 10. To see what Smith can get up to on the inward nine, I\u2019ll hand you over to Matt. He\u2019ll also bring you a leaderboard charge being made elsewhere. Take a bow Jordan Smith. He birdies the 9th hole and that\u2019s a McIlroy-esque (Rory did this for the first two rounds) outward half of five-under 30. The eagle and three birdies have moved Smith all the way up to tied 22nd. A good sign for Rory. And one in the face for the bloke who doubted McIlroy. A take from golf podcaster Andy Lack, who is on the grounds of Los Angeles Country Club. Good starts for three big-name Europeans. Sergio Garcia (after 3), Tommy Fleetwood (2) and Jon Rahm (1) are all 1-under for their rounds and +1 overall. But tied 34th on day four of a major is not what they had planned at the start of the week. Jordan Smith\u2019s golden start continues as he follows his eagle at 2 with birdie at 3. In fact, he came within a foot or so of holing out again. He\u2019s -4 for the day after just 6 holes and up to tied 33rd. Here\u2019s that hole-out eagle and his theatrical reaction. If you fancy someone from the chasing pack to win, a giant statistics foot will crush those thoughts into a thousand pieces. Hear this: 48 of the last 49 US Open winners were within four shots heading into the final round. That includes each of the last 24. If that\u2019s the case, those bolded up are the only ones with a chance today. -10: W Clark, R Fowler -9: R McIlroy -7: S Scheffler -6: H English -5: D Johnson, X Schauffele -4: R Nagano -3: T Kim, B DeChambeau, C Smith Nick Hardy could sell his start to the leaders. The American, who won the PGA Tour\u2019s Zurich Classic of New Orleans pairs event alongside Davis Riley in April, has opened birdie-par-birdie-par to advance to +2 and tied 40th. Back at 1, Sergio Garcia has scribbled in an opening birdie to climb to +1 and tied 32nd. Up ahead, Ishikawa\u2019s round is highlighting the difference in the two nines. The Japanese was first man out today and reached the turn in 1-under. He started the back nine with another birdie but has since bogeyed 11, 13 and 14 to drop to 63rd of the 65 players who made the cut. A check of the weather forecast today shows sunshine coming out soon for the rest of the day. Winds will pick up to about 10-11mph around 1pm and then die a little. Temperatures are a very pleasant 80 degrees. Jordan Smith is wearing a sunshine smile right now after holing his approach from 171 yards at the 480-yard par-4 5th for eagle! Smith doesn\u2019t realise at first as he sets off down the fairway but the Englishman hears a few roars (yes, there are a few people out there at least), has a moment of realisation as to what they could mean and punches the air in triumph. What a great way to jump back to +2. Smith is now -3 for his round. American Gordon Sargent, a 20-year-old from Alabama, is leading the race to finish as Leading Amateur. He\u2019s currently +6 after 4. His three rivals for that accolade are all struggling in round four. Aldrich Potgieter from South Africa is +9 overall (+3 after 7 today) while Ben Carr sits at +10 (+3 today after 8) and Maxwell Moldovan at +14 (+6 after 9 today). Talking of Patrick Reed, he\u2019s reached the turn in 1-under 34 after wiping out a bogey at 5 with birdies at 6 and 8. He\u2019s not been a factor this week though and is currently tied 58th. England\u2019s Jordan Smith is one of the other three players under par for the day. He\u2019s made par at 1 and 2, birdied 3 and has around 20 feet for another red circle at 4. Smith finished a hugely promising tied ninth in his very first major, the 2017 US PGA at Quail Hollow. But since then: four missed cuts and tied 47th. It\u2019s encouraging to get four rounds under his belt here and Smith, currently in a tie for 48th, will hope he can perhaps get into the top 25 or 30 with a good round today. It\u2019s been widely noted how muted the atmosphere has been at LA Country Club this week compared to other US Opens. A west coast v east coast different vibe/culture sort of thing? Or just modern-day realities? Give me New York hecklers shouting \u201cReed, you fucking ass\u201d, \u201cscrew you Cantlay\u201d etc for poor shots that have ruined side bets. Of those 17 players dotted around the course, only Ryo Ishikawa is under par for the day. He\u2019s birdied 4, 8 and 10 (bogeyed 7). The Japanese golfer is playing solo today due to the uneven number of players who made the cut. Ishikawa is 31 now having once been billed a teenage phenom. I remember those days at Open Championships when he was followed everywhere by a huge contingent of Japanese cameramen and reporters. Every word he said was scrutinised in great detail even though mostly he said nothing. This is Ishikawa\u2019s 24th major and his only top 20 (tied 20th) came at the 2011 Masters. He was also 30th in that year\u2019s US Open at Congressional, the one won by Rory McIlroy. Good to see him back and playing majors golf on the weekend again. Let\u2019s go to the course and check the early scores on the doors. I\u2019ve just done some fingers and toes counting and by reckoning there are 17 players out on the course (how many toes do I have exactly?) and they\u2019re a combined 8 over par. Not easy then. Ewan Murray is at LA Country Club. Here\u2019s his report from round three and what today holds in store. Good news, the final two-ball tees off a full one hour and 10 minutes earlier than yesterday. So that\u2019ll be, erm, still bloody late if you\u2019re in the UK.

It\u2019s been a week of relatively few dramas for the Northern Irishman after a turbulent build-up but McIlroy is a thinker. He knows what\u2019s at stake. He knows it\u2019s not just the bookmakers who expect him to win from here \u2013 a shot back from two players yet to taste major victory. That duo, Rickie Fowler and Wyndham Clark, have their own narratives. Fowler MkI had plenty of chances to join the majors club but couldn\u2019t take them. After a couple of years in the wilderness, will the fresh perspective that comes with being a father plus his successful reunion with coach Butch Harmon combine to make Fowler MkII a different animal? And Clark? This is all new; he\u2019s never been anywhere near a leaderboard in the majors until this week. Ignorance is bliss and all that so maybe he\u2019s the one. Certainly a recent win at the Wells Fargo Championship means we write him off at our peril. Scottie Scheffler, who surged late in round three, isn\u2019t done yet and Harris English, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele will all feel they\u2019re just about high enough up the leaderboard to have a say. Here we go then. Buckle up, it\u2019s going to be a late one.

More than 500 people are believed missing, including many children, and relatives are still seeking information after the boat sank in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean. After it emerged that dozens of Pakistanis were among those onboard the trawler, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, ordered an immediate crackdown on agents engaged in people smuggling, saying they would be severely punished. Sharif said Monday would be a day of mourning in Pakistan, with the national flag flying at half staff. He previously said Pakistan\u2019s embassy in Athens had identified 12 nationals who were rescued by the coastguard. There was no official information on exactly how many Pakistanis were onboard the vessel, how many survived and how many died. It is believed the total could be more than 200. Greek authorities have been criticised for their failure to act more quickly. They say the boat\u2019s occupants said they did not need any help, but NGOs say they received a number of calls for help. The sinking was one of the worst disasters of its kind this year. Meanwhile, police in Pakistan-administered Kashmir said on Sunday they had arrested 10 people allegedly involved in sending local youths to Libya for the onward journey to Europe. Officials said nine people had been detained in Kashmir and one in Gujrat, a city that has long served as a springboard for migrants. \u201cThey are presently under investigation for their involvement in facilitating the entire process,\u201d Chaudhary Shaukat, a local official, told AFP. In a joint statement, the International Organization for Migration and the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR, said between 400 and 750 people were believed to have been onboard the vessel. The UN agency said it could be the second deadliest refugee and migrant shipwreck recorded, after the April 2015 capsizing of another vessel on the Libya-Italy route that killed an estimated 1,100 people. Ministers from France and Germany travelled to Tunisia on Sunday evening for talks on regulating migration and measures to try to prevent deaths on dangerous routes across the Mediterranean. Tunisia, which is neighbour to Libya, from where the sunken trawler set sail, is a major north African stepping stone for people trying to reach Europe. The German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, was travelling to Tunisia with her French counterpart, G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Faeser\u2019s office said: \u201cWe want to create legal migration routes in order to remove the basis for the inhumane business of smugglers. We want the human rights of refugees to be protected and the terrible deaths on the Mediterranean to stop.\u201d People from African countries have been undertaking perilous sea crossings from Tunisia to Europe in unprecedented numbers, and European authorities are seeking reinforced action from the government of Tunisia\u2019s increasingly autocratic president, Kais Saied. In the first three months of this year, Tunisian authorities intercepted 13,000 people on boats off Tunisia\u2019s eastern port city of Sfax, a main route to Europe. In Athens, anger has mounted as questions continue to be raised over the Hellenic coastguard\u2019s reluctance to intervene despite the vessel being in international waters. Glaring inconsistencies in the information officials have so far released have fuelled accusations that Greek authorities may have deliberately held back to avoid so many people coming ashore. Greece heads to general elections on 25 June. Its centre-right New Democracy party, in power for the last four years and tipped to win the poll, has taken a tough stand on migration, with border officials frequently accused of engaging in pushbacks, or forcible expulsions, under its watch. The coastguard, tasked with overseeing the inquiry into the disaster, has been put on the defensive by the lack of video footage to support its version of events. When the rusty 25-metre trawler began to capsize after its engine stalled and it had started to list, a coastguard patrol boat dispatched to the area intervened. \u201cWhere is the video, the video [footage] that should have been taken of the [rescue] operation?\u201d asked Christos Spirtzis, a former transport minister. \u201cThat is the key question.\u201d Last week when pressed on the issue, Nikos Alexiou, the Greek coastguard\u2019s spokesperson, responded: \u201cThe vessel\u2019s cameras were operable but the operation wasn\u2019t recorded [on video]. There is no recording.\u201d Three days after the incident, a government spokesperson admitted that shortly before the sinking a rope was thrown to the stricken boat, prompting speculation that attempts by the coastguard to tug the trawler caused it to keel over \u2013 an accusation the coastguard strongly denies. Before the suspected smugglers\u2019 appearance in Kalamata\u2019s district court on Monday \u2013 on charges ranging from provoking a shipwreck to negligent mass murder \u2013 the president of the town\u2019s lawyers\u2019 association said answers were needed. \u201cThere are a lot of questions over the way this was handled,\u201d Kostas Margelis said. \u201cAnd we need to start by asking whether, at the critical moment, the coastguard did the right thing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2023.

The striker, who has been in a race against time to regain fitness after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in October, was on Monday named by coach Tony Gustvasson in a provisional group that will assemble on the Gold Coast for an intensive camp before the final 23-player squad is revealed. Simon has not played a competitive game since tearing her ACL while playing for her club Tottenham last year and faced missing out on a second straight World Cup through injury. But the 31-year-old has been offered a way back into contention with her inclusion in Gustavsson\u2019s squad, as the Swede runs through his final preparations for the tournament in a closed high-performance environment. Simon is joined in the extended group by Alanna Kennedy, Chloe Logarzo and Emily Gielnik, who are in similar situations coming back from injury but hoping to prove their fitness in time to win a place in the final squad to be confirmed on 3 July. Manchester City defender Kennedy has struggled with a string of injuries and has not featured at the international level since September last year, while Logarzo has been out since January and Gielnik since March. Sydney FC Jada Whyman was the only uncapped player named on the extended list and the 23-year-old will compete with Mackenzie Arnold, Teagan Micah and Lydia Williams for one of the three goalkeeping spots for the tournament, which begins on 20 July. Otherwise, the squad is headlined by captain Sam Kerr and fellow heavyweights Ellie Carpenter, Steph Catley and Caitlin Foord. \u201cFrom the first day of our first training session in 2021, we said it would take 23 in 23 for the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup and everyone would have a role to play in that journey,\u201d coach Tony Gustavsson said. \u201cWhat we have seen is that it has actually taken more than 23 players to bring us to this moment and for that reason I am thrilled to work with the players named in this provisional squad during the final phase of our preparation. \u201cI have been impressed by their full commitment at every step, and now we have the chance to fine tune and solidify our gameplan ahead of a phenomenally exciting couple of weeks.\u201d The Matildas kick off their tournament against Ireland in Sydney on opening night, before they face Nigeria in Brisbane and Olympic champions Canada in Melbourne in Group B.

Temperatures won\u2019t rebound to June averages until the end of the week, according to Angus Hines, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The cold front was halfway through Victoria on Monday morning, having crossed over Tasmania and parts of South Australia overnight. It will track to the north-east for the remainder of the day, crossing the rest of Victoria as well as parts of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The front will bring chilly and wet weather to the south-east of the country accompanied by a \u201cnotable\u201d temperature drop and snow in Alpine areas, Hines said. The ski fields of south-east Australia started to see modest snow at the weekend, with a \u201cdecent dump\u201d expected throughout the course of Monday, according to Hines. Hotham ski resort reported 12cm of fresh snow on Sunday morning while Perisher ski resort said it was experiencing blizzard conditions Monday morning after 3cm of snow overnight. The Australian Alps could receive between 10cm and 20cm of snow on Monday, Hines said with 30cm to 40cm possible in the \u201codd spot\u201d. \u201cGood news there for skiers hoping to get up into the mountains after a little bit of a tough start to the snow season,\u201d Hines said. The front will move out to sea on Tuesday. \u201cBehind it though, really chilly temperatures are going to stick around,\u201d Hines said. \u201cWith the skies clearing, it\u2019s a recipe for clear frosty nights, cold chilly icy mornings.\u201d Eastern and south-eastern parts of the country would experience cold morning temperatures and afternoon maximums several degrees below average into Thursday, he said. In Melbourne the temperature is not predicted to get above 12C until Thursday, with minimum forecasts in the morning between 4C and 5C. In Hobart the minimum morning temperature is between 3C and 4C, with highs between 11C and 12C until Wednesday. Canberra will not get above 10C on Monday with an overnight minimums \u201cwell below freezing\u201d with -3C Tuesday morning and -4C on Wednesday. Sydney will experience a high temperature of 18C and minimums of 7C on Tuesday morning and 6C Wednesday. The minimum temperatures have been even cooler for inland elevated parts of NSW, reaching -6.1C in Glen Innes and Mudgee on Monday morning, while Bathurst was -5.1C and Dubbo was -4.6C. \u201cIt\u2019s not been quite as cold as that further southwards with the front passing through Tasmania and Victoria, because it\u2019s been windier and a bit cloudy,\u201d Hines said. \u201cGenerally, for those really cold, icy temperatures, you need clear and calm nights, which has been the case over New South Wales, and that\u2019s why it will get colder over the next few days for other south-eastern states.\u201d Hines said it wouldn\u2019t be until Friday that temperatures would settle back to June averages \u2013 but another band of rain was predicted for the south-east at that same point. Monday would be mostly clear across Queensland and Northern Territory, while a \u201cbig band of cloud\u201d is covering much of Western Australia bringing rain in the north-west of the state.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Psychiatry, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Faculty of Public Health have written a letter to the home secretary, Suella Braverman, and the health secretary, Steve Barclay. The letter has come at the start of Refugee Week coordinated by Together With Refugees, a coalition of more than 500 national and local organisations representing refugees, and has called for an emergency meeting to outline the serious harm and risks the health professionals say these children would face. They have warned that children could develop post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal thoughts and other mental and physical risks and have added that detaining minors would cause \u201cunimaginable levels of harm\u201d. Current time limits for detention are: 24 hours for separated children; 72 hours for children in families; and 72 hours for pregnant women. Detention beyond those limits requires ministerial approval. The bill, if enshrined in law, would give the home secretary new detention powers without time limit, which would apply to both unaccompanied children and children with their families and are without the possibility of bail for 28 days. The new powers could be exercised in any place that the home secretary considers appropriate. A Refugee Council impact assessment has found that this could affect over 45,000 children in the first three years of the bill coming into force, including nearly 15,000 children who have been separated from their parents and have come to the UK alone. Prof Kevin Fenton, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: \u201cThere should be no place for locking up children who have fled terrible circumstances to find safety in the UK. The evidence is clear that it causes horrific harm to their physical and mental health with lifelong consequences.\u201d A briefing released on Monday by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res examining the impact of detention on refugee children in Greece and Nauru island found that it caused a range of serious medical issues, with a significant number of children suffering from trauma- and fear-induced symptoms including sleep disturbances and nightmares, behavioural issues and developmental regression, helplessness and detachment, skin conditions and self-harm, compounded by their containment and very bad living conditions. Enver Solomon, the CEO of Refugee Council and a spokesman for Together With Refugees, said:\u201cMost people in the UK would rightly be appalled by the idea of locking up thousands of children who arrive here in search of safety, having fled war zones and persecution. We know from our work that they are scared and deeply traumatised, in dire need of being looked after with great care. Putting them behind bars will only compound their trauma and cause huge distress.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIt is vital we send a clear message that the exploitation of children, used by traffickers and ferried across the Channel, cannot continue. That is why families, and children who come to the UK illegally will not be exempt from detention and removal under the illegal migration bill. \u201cWhile this legislation gives the home secretary the power to remove an unaccompanied child under 18 from the UK, we have amended the bill to make clear that this will only be exercised in very limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of reunion with a parent or removing someone to their safe home country. \u201cWe have additionally clarified that an unaccompanied child can also only be detained in very limited circumstances. The statistics do not take into account how the bill will be implemented and do not include any allowance for the deterrence effect of the measures in the bill.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94767", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/australia-needs-to-reduce-emissions-to-net-zero-by-2038-to-do-fair-share-to-contain-global-heating-analysis-shows", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia needs to reduce emissions to net zero by 2038 to do \u2018fair share\u2019 to contain global heating, analysis shows", "lead": "<strong>Exclusive</strong>: Researchers say government\u2019s climate schedule needs to be brought forward by a decade to keep heating to 1.5C", "author": "Graham Readfearn", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 22:57:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548672", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/01a31b7d983e658c01ecc880638e91f40caa4a70/0_156_4666_2800/500.jpg", "body": "Australia\u2019s fair share of action to give the world a chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C would mean reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2038 \u2013 more than a decade ahead of the government\u2019s schedule, according to new scientific analysis. To stay on track to keep global heating of 1.5C within reach \u2013 a goal the climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen has described as vital \u2013 Australia\u2019s 2035 target would need to see a cut of 90% on 2005 levels by 2035, the analysis says. The research, from two leading scientists who contributed to the UN climate panel\u2019s assessment of how quickly global emissions will need to drop, points to how far Australia has to go to legitimately claim its targets are in line with the 1.5C goal. The Albanese government has already updated the country\u2019s target to a 43% cut on 2005 levels by 2030 \u2013 an improvement on the Morrison government\u2019s 26% commitment. In a briefing report commissioned by WWF-Australia, associate professor Malte Meinshausen and Dr Zebedee Nicholls of Climate Resource say the improved target would need to have been \u201cat least 67%\u201d to have been in line with 1.5C. While Australia has a net zero target by 2050, Meinshausen and Nicholls say this net zero date should be 2038 based on Australia\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d of effort. Nicholls said: \u201cWe are at the point where we need to be going for maximum possible ambition. Every mitigation option that we have we need to look at seriously. \u201cThis is the minimum that Australia should be looking at if we\u2019re serious about 1.5C.\u201d The concept of what a \u201cfair share\u201d of effort represents is contested and not agreed between countries. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The new analysis considers how much the entire planet could emit \u2013 known as the carbon budget \u2013 while giving a 50% chance of keeping global temperatures to 1.5C. The new analysis gives Australia a 0.97% share of that global budget, a figure taken from a 2014 Climate Change Authority report that sees developed countries making faster cuts to allow developing countries more time to decarbonise. That 0.97% share is considered generous, the authors said, because Australia makes up only 0.33% of the planet\u2019s population. According to Climate Resource, the government\u2019s current plans would lead to 7.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent being released by Australia between 2021 and 2050, which was \u201croughly double\u201d a budget of 4bn tonnes \u201cfor a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C.\u201d Prof Frank Jotzo, a climate policy expert at Australian National University, said it was \u201cimpossible to pin down\u201d what the \u201cfair share\u201d of any country\u2019s efforts on emissions reductions would look like \u201cbecause there are so many value judgments that need to be made\u201d. But he said to pass any \u201cplausibility test\u201d for a 1.5C-aligned commitment, emissions reductions would need to be \u201cextremely rapid, deep and sustained\u201d and Australia\u2019s current policy ambition was \u201cnot in line with 1.5C\u201d. Keeping global temperatures close to 1.5C would reduce the impacts of heatwaves, sea level rise, temperature extremes and give ecosystems such as Queensland\u2019s Great Barrier Reef a better chance of avoiding collapse. The government will set its 2035 target in 2025 after the Climate Change Authority issues advice in 2024. The authority is in the middle of a community consultation process on that issue. Last month, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, wrote to Unesco to promote the federal and Queensland government\u2019s steps to conserve the reef after a UN-backed monitoring mission called for a series of new measures. In the letter, Plibersek wrote the government was committed to setting \u201csuccessively more ambitious emissions reduction targets\u201d that would be \u201cin alignment with efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5C\u201d. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said: \u201cAustralia needs to do its fair share. We can\u2019t expect the rest of the world to do the heavy lifting to save the Great Barrier Reef. Australia has to set the example and give the reef a fighting chance.\u201d In a statement, Unesco said together with its science advisers it was finalising an assessment of the reef that was \u201cexpected to be public in July\u201d and \u201ca final decision over whether Australia\u2019s commitments are sufficient or not will be decided by the world heritage committee in September\u201d. Guardian Australia asked minister\u2019s Bowen\u2019s office if the government considered its 2050 date for net zero to be in line with the country\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d of global effort to keep temperatures to 1.5C, and what criteria it would use to make that assessment. Those questions were not answered, but a spokesperson said the government was implementing strong policies to achieve its \u201cambitious\u201d 2030 and 2050 targets. Under the new Climate Change Act, the Climate Change Authority\u2019s advice on the 2035 target to be updated in 2025 would give \u201cspecific consideration to the temperature goals\u201d of the Paris agreement, the spokesperson said. Queensland is the largest-emitting state but its 2030 emissions reduction target remains stuck at 30% by 2030 and well behind other states. The Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, said 2021 data showed the state had almost reached its 2030 goal \u201cnine years ahead of time\u201d and the government was \u201ccommitted to meeting its overall goal of zero net emissions by 2050, in line with leading global economies\u201d."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94768", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/18/tories-pick-local-councillor-for-selby-and-ainsty-seat-after-johnson-ally-quits", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tories pick local councillor for Selby and Ainsty seat after Johnson ally quits", "lead": "Claire Holmes is Conservative candidate to be MP in seat Nigel Adams suddenly stood down from after winning large majority", "author": "Tom Ambrose", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 22:51:28", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548689", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7508bef43dd608e80326040b94d1fcf52974b696/30_0_915_549/500.jpg", "body": "The Tories have named a local councillor as their candidate in the upcoming Selby and Ainsty byelection, triggered by the resignation of a Boris Johnson ally. Nigel Adams, who had already confirmed his plans to retire at the next general election, last week announced he was standing down with immediate effect. The Conservatives are now facing four byelections as a result of resignations. Councillor Claire Holmes, who works as a lawyer, will stand in Adams\u2019s North Yorkshire seat after the previous Conservative candidate, Michael Naughton, withdrew his nomination due to a family emergency. Holmes told BBC News: \u201cI know right now people want an MP who\u2019ll only focus on improving our local communities across Selby and Ainsty \u2013 not on political point scoring in Westminster. \u201cThat means I will work with Rishi Sunak and the government on our five clear priorities: halving inflation, growing the economy, reducing debt, cutting hospital waiting lists and stopping the boats.\u201d Adams, 56, had been nominated by the former prime minister for a peerage, but did not make the final list. Others reportedly blocked included Nadine Dorries, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, who has also said she will step down but has refused to officially resign until she gets answers from ministers about why she did not get her peerage. The Bedfordshire police and crime commissioner Festus Akinbusoye will fight the seat for the Conservatives against Labour\u2019s Alistair Strathern, who works at the Bank of England. The Liberal Democrats say they are the main challengers in the seat, where Dorries had a 24,000 majority, but are still to declare a candidate. In Selby in the 2019 general election, Adams won the seat with 33,995 votes and Labour candidate Malik Rofidi came second with 13,858, beating candidates representing the Lib Dems, the Yorkshire party and the Greens. Holmes will stand against 25-year-old Labour candidate Keir Mather, who most recently worked at the Confederation of British Industry, in a byelection on 20 July \u2013 the same day as a byelection will be held in Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. The Tories have already announced local councillor Steve Tuckwell will be their candidate in the west London seat, with Labour having chosen charity worker Danny Beales to fight for a seat where Johnson had a 7,200 majority. Meanwhile, the resignation of Tory MP David Warburton, who was suspended from the party in April 2022 pending the outcome of an independent complaints and grievance scheme investigation into allegations of harassment and drug use, on Saturday triggered a fourth byelection for Sunak. Warburton was MP for Somerton and Frome in Somerset, which he won with a 19,000 majority."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94769", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/18/back-in-the-mix-hamilton-happy-to-share-podium-with-icons-canadian-grand-prix", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Back in the mix\u2019: Hamilton happy to share podium with \u2018icons\u2019 in Canada", "lead": "The British driver, third behind race winner Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso in Montreal, said: \u2018It\u2019s a privilege to be up here fighting these two\u2019", "author": "Giles Richards", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 22:30:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548706", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bc3c11ba9bb5c05da6c728235b40e1fd57cf9805/0_186_7659_4594/500.jpg", "body": "Lewis Hamilton has expressed his pleasure in being back in the fight at the front of the grid after taking third place in the Canadian Grand Prix. The British driver relished his battle with Fernando Alonso, who was second, and was hopeful that at some point he and the Spaniard might also challenge race winner Max Verstappen. The podium in Montreal was a rare feat indeed with three world champions on the steps, boasting a total of 11 titles between them. Verstappen won with a dominant run from pole to flag but Hamilton and Alonso enjoyed a fine fight as Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes car continued to display good form in the wake of recent upgrades. \u201cI am happy to be back in the mix,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cI am just hoping at some stage it can all be a bit more level, so we can get back to some of the good races we had back in 2021. To have all three of us in a super-tight battle would be sick. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be up here fighting these two who have had incredible careers. This is quite an iconic top three, I don\u2019t know if there has been a top three like this before, I don\u2019t believe there has. Hopefully there will be more, there is a lot of respect between us that we are able to race so closely and trust one another.\u201d Hamilton and Alonso are the two oldest drivers in F1 at 38 and 41 years old, while Verstappen is still only 25 and the Dutchman, who leads the world championship by 69 points from his Red Bull teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez, acknowledged how special it was to be competing with two of the greats of the sport. \u201cI remember back in the day watching these two racing each other, now I am in F1 and racing them, it is the best thing out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we can share a podium together it\u2019s great. They want to swap positions of course but I am happy in the middle at the moment \u2026\u201d Verstappen secured his 41st win in Canada, matching Ayrton Senna\u2019s tally while his Red Bull team reached a century of victories but the Dutchman, who is on his way to his third title this season, was already expectant of many more. \u201cWhen I was a kid in go-karting I was dreaming of being in F1 but would never imagine I would win 41 grands prix,\u201d he said \u201cSo to match Ayrton is incredible but I hope it\u2019s not stopping here. I hope we can win more races.

The greatest generation Croatia have ever had, a nation of just 3.8m people and a team of extraordinary talent and strength, seemingly unbreakable resilience, have given football so much but weren\u2019t given it back. Runners-up at the World Cup in 2018, third in 2022, on Sunday night Zlatko Dalic\u2019s side fell in the final of the Nations League. Defeated by France and Argentina then, now it was Spain. Just when they seemed to have done it again too, somehow seeing their way through to their place. This time, though, penalties deserted them. Four shootouts Croatia had won, in the last 16 and the quarter-finals of each of those World Cups, but having got there again, as they headed into sudden death Bruno Petkovic saw his spot-kick brilliantly saved by Unai Sim\u00f3n and Dani Carvajal scored to take this trophy to Madrid. As Spain celebrated, Luka Modric looked sunk. His 166th and possibly his last game for his country had ended in defeat and it was hard not to feel like something bigger had been lost. He had run to the last, at 37, and there was reason to be proud once more but just could not get over the line. Yet again \u2013 for the eighth time in 11 knockout matches \u2013 one of football\u2019s most epic, most seemingly indestructible national teams had gone to extra time. Six of the last seven had seen them emerge still standing but not here, not even when Aymeric Laporte\u2019s spot-kick thundered off the bar, giving them a lifeline. Sim\u00f3n had saved Lovro Majer\u2019s penalty \u2013 the first Croatia had missed in their last 13 at tournaments \u2013 giving the Manchester City defender the chance to win it. When he crashed the shot against the frame of the goal, it felt a little like fate. These great survivors were going to do it again; somehow, these players, this team, was at last going to complete their quest. At De Kuip though, as at Lusail and the Luzhniki, they were denied, a second superb save from Sim\u00f3n gave Spain victory, 5-4 on penalties. The seleccion had won. No, it is not a World Cup, it is not a Euros either and there may never be a \u201cmajor\u201d before trophy in the case of the Nations League but it mattered. Spain after all had not won anything since 2012, all too aware that their greatest generation is all but gone \u2013 only Jes\u00fas Navas remains from South Africa 2010, plus Jordi Alba from the Euros two years later. Croatia knew this might be a last chance. Just their midfield three alone \u2013 and what a midfield three it is \u2013 had 345 caps between them before tonight. Ivan Perisic had a further 126. At 33, he was flying for much of the night and, still going at the end. Modric was too, four years his senior. Both men scored their penalties, but ultimately the medals they wore said runners-up. As they went up for them, there was a guard of honour from Spain. There was applause from this place, packed with proud countrymen. \u201cSpain will feel like they\u2019re playing in Croatia,\u201d Dalic had insisted. There were over 25,000 of them here singing for Modric to stay, fireworks everywhere. Yet if Spain were the \u201caway\u201d team, in the end it did not matter. Alba, the captain who hadn\u2019t expected to be in the squad at all, lifted silver to the sky. It had taken a while but through the smoke, an occasionally fun game had emerged. Most of all though a tense one did, drawn seemingly inexorably to extra time, despite Andrej Kramaric running through early on, Sim\u00f3n scrambling to stop a Perisic header and Josip Juranovic missing a great opportunity at the start of the second half. At the other end meanwhile, Marco Asensio headed over. Luis de la Fuente said Spain would try to avoid extra time, and substitute Ansu Fati should have done. Eight yards out with five minutes to go, his shot was cleared off the line by Perisic. Perhaps though this was inevitable. Perhaps penalties were too, 30 minutes more bringing opportunities but no breakthrough. An incredible tackle from Nacho stopped Lovro Majer running through. Dani Olmo shot over and wide. And right at the end, Mateo Kovacic\u2019s effort deflected wide. A shootout called and this time it called Spain."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c9476b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/18/we-love-glastonbury-review-prepare-to-be-jealous-of-anyone-with-a-ticket", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "We Love Glastonbury review \u2013 prepare to be jealous of anyone with a ticket", "lead": "From Jessie Ware enthusing about Jay-Z to Jake Shears welling up at his memory of the festival, there are loads of incredible highlights in this retrospective.

We Love Glastonbury is just that. It\u2019s a preamble to the big weekend, whetting the appetites of both ticket-holders and telly-watchers with some of the most famous performances of the last couple of decades. It is interspersed with talking heads chatting about their favourite memories of the festival, whether they were there to see it or caught it from the comfort of their own living room via the BBC\u2019s substantial and comprehensive annual coverage. The programme is, it\u2019s true, a bit slight, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It was always going to be impossible to condense more than 50 years of festivals into a single hour. This is mostly made up of the televised, BBC-affiliated last 25 years or so, although there is a brief clip of Oasis in 1994, when it would have been broadcast on Channel 4. The film also has to deal with the problem of other people\u2019s memories of a really fantastic night out never being quite as interesting if you weren\u2019t there with them. \u201cThe problem we\u2019ve got is that there\u2019s not much I can tell on camera,\u201d says Self Esteem, sagely. That means there\u2019s not much in the way of genuine backstage gossip, hazy snapshots of hours lost at the Stone Circle or recollections of an ill-advised gong bath. Nor is there any sense of that band you discovered quite by accident because you got lost and ended up somewhere entirely unexpected \u2013 only for it to turn out to be one of the greatest sets you\u2019d ever seen (before you went home, looked them up and realised they were terrible after all). There isn\u2019t a lot of insight into why it is so great, because I suspect that is difficult to capture, and even more difficult to convey. I\u2019m also not entirely sure why Joe Wicks is there, other than to tell us that he\u2019s going for the first time this year, and that he enjoyed Adele on the live stream in 2016, but then again, he is doing a live workout at the festival, so I suppose he is earning his keep. Other guests have more to chew on. Self Esteem remembers playing the John Peel stage last year, dressed as the Sheffield shopping centre Meadowhall. Jake Shears recalls playing the Pyramid stage with Scissor Sisters as the sun was setting, and looking out on a crowd that stretched as far as he could see. \u201cHaving that many people sing your songs back at you \u2026\u201d he says, unable to finish his sentence. Nish Kumar talks about being a fanboy, and there\u2019s a clip of him with James Acaster in the crowd, nodding along to Big Thief on the Park stage last year. The comic Kerry Godliman, who recalls going without any camping gear as a teenager, makes an equally good case for watching the festival on telly; she almost chooses Dolly Parton as her favourite performance, before remembering that she actually watched it from the sofa. Musically, this is all about the headliners doing their star turns, pleasing the big crowds and having a great time doing it. We get performances of full tracks from Pet Shop Boys and R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy last year, Arctic Monkeys in 2007, the Killers and the Foo Fighers in 2017, Stormzy in 2019, Jay-Z in 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 in 2011 and the late Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros in 1999, with the added bonus of a lovely bit of Strummer-related trivia from Sharleen Spiteri. One of the hidden treats in this documentary is in scanning the crowd, with its shifting fashions, and wondering where everybody is now, especially from that earlier footage. Will We Love Glastonbury persuade naysayers? Not a chance, but there\u2019s no reason why it should. If you\u2019re watching a documentary with a title such as this and you\u2019re still planning to walk away unimpressed, well, you couldn\u2019t claim you weren\u2019t warned. This is a Glastonbury greatest hits, sandwiched together with perfectly pleasant chat, from perfectly engaging people, and it is just fine as an opening act. It may even get you poring over the lineup as if it\u2019s the Radio Times Christmas edition and you\u2019re armed with a ballpoint pen, circling everything you\u2019re planning to see. It made me intensely envious of everyone who is going this year, and it reminded me of many magical moments I have been lucky enough to enjoy there. Jessie Ware picks Jay-Z as one of her favourite performances, and remembers being in the crowd. \u201cI\u2019ve got goosebumps thinking about it,\u201d she says, and I have to admit, at moments, I had the exact same feeling.

The post said Big Pokey was a \u201clow key, humble mountain of a man who moved with honor and respect. He was easy to love and hard to hate. He\u2019d pull up, do what he had to do and head home.\u201d Houston\u2019s mayor, Sylvester Turner, honored the rap legend on Twitter, saying: \u201cThe City of Houston and I extend our prayers and condolences to our own Screwed Up Click legendary rapper #BigPokey family and friends.\u201d One of the original members of the Screwed Up Click named for the late rap star DJ Screw, Big Pokey helped to pioneer Houston\u2019s \u201cchopped-and-screwed\u201d approach to hip-hop that referred to slowing the pitch of the underlying track to create a heavy, laid-back sound. The style was often associated with lean, also known as purple drank or sizzurp, which is a concoction of codeine and promethazine cough syrup mixed with fruit-flavored soft drinks and ingested alongside large quantities of cannabis. The mix is supposed to make the world seem like it\u2019s moving in slow motion. George Floyd \u2013 who was murdered by an on-duty Minneapolis police officer in May 2020 \u2013 was once a part of Houston\u2019s Screwed Up Click, and he rapped on multiple mixtapes as Big Floyd during the 1990s, according to Stereogum. Milton Powell joined the \u201cchopped-and-screwed\u201d scene as a teenager. Known for his baritone singing style, Big Pokey had his first hit with a six-minute long appearance on the 1996 epic June 27th. \u201cWe were just playing around. Once I got in with Screw and we got to do it on the table, we were always doing it for the fun of it. I was never doing it for things to blow up,\u201d he said in a 2001 interview. Big Pokey released his debut album Hardest Pit in the Litter in 1999. He put out two subsequent albums, D-Game 2000 and Da Sky\u2019s Da Limit, over the next three years. Last year, he joined Megan Thee Stallion on Traumazine\u2019s Southside Royalty Freestyle alongside a slate of fellow Houston rap legends, Pitchfork reported. Two years ago, Big Pokey was asked in an interview with K-Rino if there was anything he\u2019d have done differently. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, but honestly man, I take the bitter with the sweet.

A yellow thunderstorm warning almost entirely covered England and Wales between noon and midnight, and there was also one until 9pm in Northern Ireland.

And Spain celebrate their first trophy in 13 years! \u201cGermany in 1974 were definitely not tedious,\u201d says Onadeko Mf. \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t have Netzer but they were a very lovely team. Outplayed the dutch in the final as well.\u201d I\u2019d agree with that, no team featuring Beckenbauer, Breitner and Muller could ever be tedious. An apology: earlier, I said that Kuyt\u2019s jacket was Prince of Wales check, but actually it\u2019s dogtooth. I promise to do better next time. It\u2019s taking them a serious amount of time to ready the presentation, but here comes Giovanni van Bronckhorst with the trophy. \u201cAs a counter to what you said earlier,\u201d says Paulo Biriani, \u201clook at Argentina 78. The German teams of the 80s. Later Argentina teams of the 90s. Brazil of any age since the 70s. They were really not very \u2018great\u2019 teams in any sense whatsoever. They had one or two great players but the standard wasn\u2019t high at all. Germany 74 were unbelievably tedious. The Dutch of Gullit and Co were great. The Germans of 96 not so.\u201d No one said to the contrary \u2013 not every team to win stuff was great, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s quite some time since we\u2019ve had one. Also going on: Spain celebrate with their fans while Croatia applaud theirs. Spain were the better side in extra-time so you can\u2019t resent their win, but neither side are all that \u2013 admirable though Croatia are. Ah man, poor old Modric is feeling it. He\u2019ll have to console himself with his three La Ligas, five Champions Leagues and the adoration of the masses. Carvajal calmly panenkas his penalty as Livakovic dives low, and Spain take the trophy! Simon goes right and saves \u2026 but does he go early? He does not, and again Spain have a kick to win it! Livakovic goes right and Laporte goes central \u2026 but hits the bar! Croatia and Modric are still in it! Sudden death it is! Perisic scores easily inside the right-hand post. Laporte to try and win it\u2026 Asensio pauses, Livakovic goes right, and Asensio lofts high into the net directly above him. This is a really good save, simon diving right and saving with his feet! Merino waits for Livakovic to go left, then sweeps right. Simon dives left, Modric caresses high into the roof down the middle. Same place as Brozovic, left side-netting. Low into the left side-netting. Very good again, and players are so good at this these days. A brilliant penalty slammed into the roof. He opens his body and sweeps into the right side-netting. Nicely done. Yup, Vlasic will take the first kick\u2026 Jordi Alba wins the first toss and picks the Spain end; I think Modric wins the second so he\u2019ll presumably opt for Croatia to go first. We cut to the studio right as some kind of rumble between the teams germinates. We don;\u2019t really get to see what or why, but our FOMO is saved when it\u2019s quickly defused. I like to think we\u2019re here to share love, so while we wait for the players to get sorted, here\u2019s my tune of 2023 so far. Penalties it is! We\u2019ve earned that. 119 min On which point: 117 min Asensio to Carvajal, who picks a nice return pass into the box, down its left; Asensiao crosses and Perisic blocks behind for another corner which comes to nowt. Currently, only one team are threatening, but then a foul on Modric by Alba allows Croatia ti stick a ball into the box, and when Modric hoists it in, Petkovic lays back and Kovacic\u2019s drive from the edge is deflected behind. This corner could be the last chance to avert \u201cthe lottery\u201d of penalties. 116 min The resultant corner comes to nowt. 115 min Rodri wants this game finished, and with Fati forcing Croatia to spread their midfield blanket wide, he\u2019s got a bit of space, lamping another shot from distance which Sutalo\u2019s head sends behind. 114 min 113 min Modric flicks a ball out to the right but when it comes back to him he can\u2019t pick out a man and Spain clear. However Brozovic quickly wins it back \u2026 for all the difference it makes, Alba clearing when Modric tries to pick another pass. 112 min Change for Croatia, Stanisic replacing Juranovic \u2013 who\u2019s flagged as Spain have ganged up on him down their left. 110 min \u201cThe standard of international football is as good as it has ever been,\u201d says Paulo Biriani. \u201cThe issue you relate to is that in major tournaments there is a more equal field, very few teams now dominate every game because their opponents are so much better than their historical counterparts. In olden times it was different. One could argue for all of the cash spent on teams the champions league is actually rather boring.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with that. There\u2019s no team as good or even close to Spain 2008-12 or France 98-02 and so on. And look at the recent tournament winners \u2013 Argentina 22, Italy 20, France 18, Portugal 16, Germany 14 \u2013 also nothing special whatsoever. 108 min My coverage starts glitching, returning in time for me to see Olmos\u2019s shot deflected wide, the corner yielding another. It\u2019s Spain looking to seize this, but Rodri\u2019s shot is blocked and they build again. 107 min Good work from Fati, who finds Alba, and his ball in is decent, but Asensio, hitting the box, can\u2019t control it, a poor first touch seeing it run away. 106 min Burnley, meanwhile, are in pre-season training for 2023-24. But back on the pitch, Fati shows lovely feet to move the ball behind his standing leg and escape Majer, but the cross he stands up is easily claiemd by Simon. 106 min Here we go again\u2026 105+2 min Spain give it away deep inside their own half and Vlasic seizes on the loose ball only to have a shot blocked, then down the left of the box, Brozovic makes an angle to shoot on his right foot but can\u2019t get the power or elevation to trouble Livakovic. 105+1 min It really is odd that Spain have no better attackers than these. 105 min We\u2019ll have two additional minutes. 104 min Yup, Spain look the likelier and when Asensio cuts in fro the right, he drills a shot that\u2019s blocked and bounces back to Olmo, but the ball bounces just before it reaches him so he gets underneath it and, from the edge, slams a shot over and plenty. 102 min Apologies, a few minutes ago Carvajal replaced Navas at right-back. 101 min A side with better attackers than Croatia could have a lot of fun with Spain\u2019s high line. I know it\u2019s an odd thing to say, but I\u2019m Zlatko Dali\u0107 \u2013 for avoidance of doubt, I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m thinking about sticking Perisic through the middle just to see if his pace and power can give them a problem. 99 min Back to what I said about tournaments, the highest-level match in Qatar and by far was England v France. Anyhow excuse me while I interrupt myself because here\u2019s Kovacic breaking forward and ball-carrying as we said, sliding a pass through to Majer \u2026 and for a second it looks like he\u2019s in! But his first touch, though it\u2019s good, leaves the ball a little under his feet and from nowhere Nacho, who\u2019s got to be careful because he\u2019s on a yellow, slides in to pull off a terrific saving challenge. It\u2019s cost him a bit of pain too, and Spain have used all their subs, but I think he\u2019ll be fine to carry on. 98 min I\u2019m not in favour of binning extra-time, but I\u2019d be interested to know how often the score changes during it. 98 min Nacho fouls Petkovic and is booked; Rodri fouls Majer and is booked. 96 min I hate to say it but real talk: the standard of international football is pretty low at the moment, and it\u2019s a long time since we had a properly great team. Rather the tournaments, which used to be won by the best, are now being won whoever plays best in the last two or three matches. 95 min But what a waste: Fati goes short and soon Spain are back near the centre-circle. 94 min It\u2019s Spain looking more interested in finding a winner, perhaps because they\u2019re a younger side who didn\u2019t play 120 midweek \u2013 though Croatia had an extra day to recover. And here\u2019s Navas swinging over a cross from the right, which flicks a head and goes behind for a corner. 93 min \u201cBeing a Man City fan,\u201d says Phil Grey, \u201cI\u2019m curious to know how Kovacic is doing, as he seems to be heading for the Etihad. He was robbed by Gavi in the12th minute and since then Peter Shilton has been mentioned more than Kovacic. Quiet game?\u201d I\u2019d say so. He\u2019d be a similar signing to Phillips, there in case Rodri gets injured or suspended and whose ball-carrying can be useful, but isn\u2019t good enough to start regularly. 91 min Juranovic crosses from the right and Vlasic might shoot from the edge, but instead he lays off for Petkovic who\u2019s quickly crowded out. 91 min Croatia set us away again. For the first time, the Nations League final requires extra-time. 90+4 min Croatia win a corner, Modric swings it out \u2026 and Spain clear. 90+2 min This has been an alright game, but the sides have largely cancelled each other out. 90 min Another Croatia change, Majer \u2013 who was effective against Holland \u2013 replacing Kramaric. We\u2019ll have four additional minutes. 90 min And here they come, Navas teasing a lofted pass in behind for Asensio. But he\u2019s no one up with him so has to go for goal on his weaker right foot, sending an effort across goal and a foot or two wide of the far post. 89 min Croatia look like they\u2019re playing for extra-time, while Spain are seeking a winner. 87 min Another change for Spain, Olmo replacing Gavi. 85 min Looking at that shot again, Perisic wasn\u2019t close to the corner but actually a yard along from the keeper. Fati killed the ball well with his left, but rushed the shot with his right. 84 min OFF THE LINE PERISIC! This is great defending but he oughtn\u2019t to have smelled it, Alba playing a clever pass into Merino who cuts back cleverly for Fati. He takes a touch and, from seven yards out, has space to shoot, but he concentrates on getting the effort away and on target, picking out Perisic who hacks clear. Released from the shackles of Spurs, he\u2019s had a fine match. 83 min Persic escapes down the left again, released by a lush turn and outside-of-the-foot pass from Modric. He nips infield then tries to slide a reverse-pass in behind for Vlasic, but there\u2019s too much on it and it runs behind. 82 min \u201cAs with every sporting contest, context is key,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThere have been major finals I didn\u2019t care who won, but I\u2019m finding myself desperate for Croatia to take this one, just so that this great generation gets the gold medal they deserve.\u201d Yup, I can see that. It\u2019ll mean much more to them, so we\u2019ll get more joy if they take it. 81 min Modric eases clear of Gavi, who schleps him back and is booked. 80 min Spain had a little period the last five but now it\u2019s Croatia back passing it about. I suppose if they\u2019re to win their first trophy, penalties would be a fitting way of making it happen. 78 min More changes, Croatia trying Vlasic for Ivanusec and Spain Nacho and Merino for Le Normand and Ruiz. 77 min Fati has made a difference, his pace and feet giving Spain a different threat. He burrows into the box, beating one challenge before being crowded out by another, and when the ball breaks to Asensio, he flicks it up for himself then swivels on the half-turn to shoot wide. 76 min Alba slides Fati in behind down the left, forcing Livakovic to slide into a challenge, and while he\u2019s picking himself up, the ball arrives at Ruiz who, from 25 yards, swipes an outswinger that drifts just over the far angle. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s something. 75 min \u201cI concur with the idea that the Nations League is worth persisting with,\u201d emails Andy Flintoff, \u201cfor the single fact that it gives teams in Leagues C and D genuinely competitive football against teams of similar ability, with the possibility of qualifying for the Euros. It\u2019s not much fun for San Marino (for instance) to get beaten in every match in a qualifying campaign, but they get a good chance to stick one over on Andorra or the Faroe Islands or similar, who they are very unlikely to play in World Cup or Euro Championship qualifying because they are equally low seeds.\u201d Yup, agreed. 74 min And actually, both teams are now looking long, which tells us they\u2019ve run out of ideas. 73 min It\u2019s been a while since we had any telling action. Spain just aren\u2019t that good, while Croatia lack firepower. 71 min There seems to be a significant striking imbalance in the men\u2019s footballing world currently. England have two forward lines better than those we\u2019re seeing here, Brazil, France and Argentina too. 69 min \u201cWith regard to fashion rules,\u201d writes Mary Waltz, \u201cand white trainers with a black suit, there should be few rules. Unless you are in the military or a profession that requires uniforms there should be just a couple. Do your clothes fit your body shape? They must be clean. And men of a certain age and body shape should not wear speedos in public. You know who you are.\u201d If I wasn\u2019t allowed to laugh at what sportsfolk wear, I\u2019d be struggling for copy, and I\u2019d be confiscating Gundogan\u2019s medals for this rig. 67 min And here come the Spain changes, Fati and Joselu for Pino and Morata. 66 min Meantime Rodri, who\u2019s been quiet tonight, suddenly unleashes a donkey-kick from 25 yards that screeches just wide. 65 min Spain are making changes, but not bringing on the players I suggested \u2013 it\u2019ll be Fati and Joselu. 63 min \u201cOn all-white kit for keepers,\u201d says Robert Knap, \u201cI think Villa in 83-84 (or thereabouts) had the goalie\u2019s second strip in all white. It\u2019s a bit of a collector\u2019s item I\u2019d imagine - Le Coq Sportif may have done the best 80s kit (Hummels in with a shout too?)\u201c I love the Villa kits from that period, and I think LCS also made Everton\u2019s 84-85 classic. 62 min Croatia make the first change, Petkovic \u2013 who did well off the bench against the Dutch \u2013 for Pasalic. 61 min Perisic is running all over Navas and again he sticks a decent ball to the back post, this one curled flat rather than stood up, and Pasalic is up above Alba but can only direct his header into the side-netting. 59 min \u201cIsn\u2019t this match about more than just supporting the international game?\u201d wonders David Wall, \u201cperhaps because it\u2019s a new tournament, but the Nations League seems to me to be unfairly undervalued. After all, this is the one international competition where you can genuinely say that there are no easy games. The winners will have played against only top level opposition, first in the division A group, and then in the semi-final and final. Even in the World Cup and European Championships the level of teams competing is not so consistently high. If it lasts through its first few iterations and becomes established I can see this becoming as highly valued to win as those other tournaments. that said, you\u2019re right about the increasing encroachment into players\u2019 time off. perhaps the answer if for FIFPro to get stronger than on this. a serious threat of industrial action from the players might motivate organisers to sort out the playing calendar.\u201d As I say in the piece I link below, I think it\u2019s a really good innovation. It\u2019s hard to get too excited about it relative to the bigger competitions, but it\u2019s exponentially better than the friendlies we had previously. 57 min Pino releases Alba down the left and he stands up a cross, but Asensio is a fair way out and yanking beck behind ball to impart power, while behind him Gavi had a much better angle to run onto it and attack it properly. 56 min Again, Perisic blazes past Navas, but this time the man with the eyes comes back at him, Gavi also getting involved in the tussle to avert the potential danger. 55 min It\u2019s been a slow start to the second half, and I\u2019d expect Luis de la Fuente to do something about that because Croatia look the likelier. 54 min I do, though, remember Watford\u2019s Steve Sherwood looking resplendent in red through the mid-80s. 52 min \u201cShilton in white looks even more all wrong \u2013 a nightclub bouncer in a neglig\u00e9e,\u201d asserts Charles Antaki. \u201cAcceptable colours for a goalkeeper are, in increasing aesthetic order: lime green, orange, pink, yellow, green, black (but only if your name is Lev Yashin).\u201d As I recall, in England they almost all wore green until the start of the Premier League, when refs changed to that from black. 51 min Here comes Perisic down the left, chuckling a lollipop that seems him down the outside of Navas and allowing him to stand up a cross that Unai Simon comes for and misses! But picking up the ball on the right of the box, Juranovic can only drag a shot wide of the far post. That was a chance. 50 min \u201cTwo things are ridiculous here,\u201d reckons Paulo Biriani. \u201c1) Spain\u2019s high line 2) the Spanish manager\u2019s decision to wear white trainers with a black suit. Good game thus far.\u201d Yes, I\u2019d agree with that. I\u2019m of the opinion that trainers and flip-flops are the only footwear a person needs, but with a syoot, care needs taking. 48 min Something worth noting: Spain\u2019s bench options are by far the better. I\u2019d expect to see Olmo and Rodrigo if this stays goalless for much longer, especially if Croatia stay in the ascendancy. 47 min At half-time, Emma Hayes noted that Spain \u201ccan\u2019t access the central corridor\u201d because Croatia have a narrow three in front of their back four; I guess that\u2019s why they\u2019ve moved Ruiz up. 46 min \u201cYou mentioned Shilton wearing all-white in the 1970s,\u201d emails Matthew Vallance, retired Scottish sportswriter and former goalkeeper. \u201cI cannot say for sure he wore all-white, but, the legendary amateur goalkeeper Harry Sharratt wore a white jersey in one of Bishop Auckland\u2019s televised Amateur Cup wins in the 1950s.\u201d 46 min \u2026and we go again! Back come our teams\u2026 Half-time reading: on Father\u2019s Day, here\u2019s a piece about going the game with your dad. That wasn\u2019t bad, and there\u2019s fair prospect of an improvement after the break. 45 min \u2026and they make a total pig\u2019s posterior of it, Asensio and Gavi trying to work an angle but the latter playing for the former into trouble, and when Alba\u2019s ball eventually comes in, there\u2019s too much on it for Le Normand. 44 min Spain are improving, and Pino sways by Brozovic before Modric upends him 25 yards out, probably too far left of centre for a shot\u2026 41 min Spain have put Ruiz alongside Gavi behind Morata, looking to play into two men rather than one and give Croatia a call to make in terms of who picks him up. And they\u2019re knocking it about nicely now, trying to move their opponents around before springing into attack \u2026 and here we go, Alba collecting a pass, stamping on the gas and getting into a crossing position, Morata glancing a quarter-chance wide at the near post. 39 min Perisic is getting into some decent positions from left-back \u2013 Croatia must think there\u2019s a back-stick mismatch between him and Navas, which is true, there is. And again, he attacks a Modric ball in, this time a diag, but again, he\u2019s too far out to seriously trouble Simon with his header. 38 min Now it\u2019s Perisic over the top and Brozovic is in space down the right side of the box! He teases Gavi inside and out before snapping a low cross across the face, but there\u2019s no one on-hand to meet it. Spain can\u2019t play this high without pressure on the ball, this is Villas-Boas stuff from them so far. 36 min There\u2019s more intensity and conviction about Croatia\u2019s work; they expect something to happen whereas Spain are hoping it will. 35 min And a bit more on Saudi and Chelsea. Todd Boehly is a lucky, lucky man. 33 min \u201cMagnificent to see a European final being held at De Kuip again,\u201d reckons Jack Doxey, \u201cfor the first time in two decades. If I\u2019m not mistaken De Kuip has hosted more European finals than any stadium expect Wembley, and hopefully \u2013 if long-overdue renovations are carried out \u2013 soon it\u2019ll start hosting finals more frequently again. Also great to see that Croatia\u2019s fans are living up to the standard for atmosphere which Feyenoord set in that stadium.\u201d Can\u2019t argue with that, it\u2019s a proper football ground in a proper football city \u2013 although the moat around the perimeter means fans are further from the pitch than is ideal. 31 min But Croatia look the likelier, and when Modric teases in a free-kick from 35 yards out, sending it from right to left, Perisic charges into the box from very wide to send a header from distance towards the bottom corner \u2026 but Simon scrambles it away. 30 min A lull. Mainly, these teams are cancelling each other out, with neither midfield able to dictate. 28 min Spain look a bit shaky at the back. Croatia lack the class up front to properly punish them for that, but that\u2019s not their way, rather they find a moment or two which is generally all they need. 26 min \u201cWhite goalkeeper kits have been available for around 50 years,\u201d advises Andy Flintoff. Peter Shilton used to wear them for Leicester City in the 73-74 season.\u201d 25 min More from the Saudi league, and I\u2019d expect Chelsea to toss a few more players in that direction too. 24 min The corner comes to nowt but Croatia sustain the attack and Kramaric, now out on the right, crosses low, but Pasalci, sliding in, can\u2019t get enough on his shot and Simon fields easily enough. This is warming up a bit now. 23 min There\u2019s that ball over the top again! It\u2019s a long one from Erlic \u2013 I think \u2013 and Kramaric is in behind! But he doesn\u2019t have the pace to escape and Laporte recovers really well to extend a leg and push behind for a corner. Another warning for spain. 21 min Oh, Spain want a penalty when Gavi heads into Ivanusec\u2019s chest \u2013 it\u2019s no such thing \u2013 and when Croatia counter, Pino scythes into a hack which stops the attack. Somehow, he escapes a booking. 20 min Behind the Croatian goal, their supporters are bouncing away, flares glowing, but Morata wins a corner \u2026 which comes to nothing. 18 min \u201cThe Spain keeper is in an all-white kit, returns Charles Antaki. \u201cUnacceptable. All white is OK for the outfield players where you can make a case for silvery, mercurial slipperiness. Keeper has to be solid, steadfast &amp; highly visible. Uefa take action please.\u201d I can\u2019t argue with that, and in similar vein, I\u2019d also ban Raphael Varane for being more handsome than any centre-back, never mind one that good in the air, has any business being. 16 min I think Spain have more edge than Croatia, but Croatia look more settled into what they\u2019re doing. 14 min Modric lifts a ball over the top for Pasalic and the flag goes up, but nevertheless that\u2019s a warning for Spain because it was tight and Croatia have midfielders who can pick those kinds of passes. 12 min Here we go! Spain spring, Gavi robbing Kovacic just outside the box, advancing, and trying a Solskjaer-style finish dragged through the defenders leg seeking the near post. But he gets just too much angle on it, the ball scooshing wide. But what happened is worth remembering; I wonder if the plan is to get on the Chelsea man when he receives the ball off his back four. 11 min Townsend is good in co-comms, and he notes that in possession, Croatia have both full-backs high and wide, so if Spain can turn the ball over they\u2019ll have loads of space into which they can spring. 10 min Ruiz, who looks not unlike a lanky James Maddison, swings a cross out from the left, Livakovic makes a proper hash of catching it, and is relieved to see the flag go up, though Morata couldn\u2019t do much with the rebound. 8 min So where do we rank Modric? The greatest of his generation? As great as Busquets, Xavi and Iniesta? I guess, if you\u2019re pushing me, I\u2019m having him above the former and just below the latter two because they inspired a way of playing, but I\u2019d not question your parentage on the internet if your order was different. 7 min Croatia knock it around looking to draw Spain onto them; Spain aren\u2019t pressing them as they did Italy, preferring to engage if and when things develop. 5 min Of course, Modric is also a tough little expletive, more than capable of handling himself against whoever is unfortunate enough to be opposing him. 4 min In co-comms, Andros Townsend, who played with Modric at Spurs, says people were concerned as to whether he\u2019d cope with the physical side of the game in England, but he didn\u2019t get involved in it, cutting across defenders and such. Which reminds me of what Paul Scholes once said when asked about playing against Patrick Vieira: \u201cI just try and stay away from him.\u201d 2 min Croatia are in their Spain kit, which is not unlike Arsenal\u2019s away rendition from 1995-06. 1 min Immediately, Asensio weaves forward, winning a throw deep inside the Spain half and Morata, puling wide, drills a decent low cross. But that means he\u2019s not in the middle to knock it wide, so Croatia get the ball away easily enough. 1 min And away we go! Jesus Navas a thousand years from now. And the Croatian contingent are absolutely having theirs. Anthem time. The Spanish one is a banger. Our teams are tunnelled, and here they come! But not without an announcement telling the crowd who they\u2019re watching and in what context, in case it had escaped any of them. \u201cNo Busquets, then,\u201d notes Charles Antaki, \u201cfor the first time since time itself began, or at least since the glory days of 2008-10-12. Only Alba left from 2012; and he\u2019s apparently without a team now, so presumably \u2013 although probably captain tonight \u2013 his days are numbered. But anyway, by now it\u2019s hard to see much of a remnant of what defined the national team in those days and made it the best in the world. It was good \u2013 great \u2013 while it lasted.\u201d It was better than great, I\u2019d say. Not as much fun as I\u2019d have liked, but probably the hardest to beat, and three major tournaments on the spin is just ridiculous behaviour. Tonight\u2019s game, then. Obviously it\u2019s a battle of midfields, and I wonder if Spain\u2019s youthful physicality will tell. They\u2019ll be hoping the pace and directness of Pino, Gavi and Asensio makes a difference too, targeting the spaces between centre-back and full-back; Croatia will look to be patient and take whatever opportunity arises. Modric played 120 minutes the other night, and I wonder if he\u2019s able to go and go again because he didn\u2019t join Madrid, so didn\u2019t get onto the carousel of constant top-level football, until he was almost 27. He\u2019s done well to avoid injury too, and plays in a team that keeps rather than chases the ball, but I\u2019m sure his longevity is related to how long it took him to get his big move. I can\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t happen sooner though, because it\u2019s not as if his brilliance wasn\u2019t obvious well before. We\u2019re watching VT of Kramaric talking, and what he says is lovely: \u201cOne day I\u2019ll tell my children I played with Luka Modric \u2013 shared a dressing room, made memories together. He\u2019s one of the greatest of all time.\u201d I remember when Croatia knocked England out of Euro 2008, Slaven Bilic recalled Michael Owen saying none of his players would get in the England team. \u201cBut I have Modric,\u201d he giggled. Joselu update: \u201cTwo French-born centre backs for Spain,\u201d points out Kevin Wilson. \u201cLe Normand just got his Spanish citizenship after a fantastic season for Real Sociedad.\u201d Yup, and I was hoping to have another look at Zubimendi tonight, who also did. I\u2019ve always wondered whether anyone who uses this phrase knows what a superlative is. On which point, the Croatian fans were brilliant against the Netherlands. I\u2019m absolutely certain they\u2019ll the De Kuip on absolute flames tonight. \u201cHow does tiny Croatia keep reaching semis and finals, wonders Mary Waltz. \u201cI was informed by those who claim to know that they were too old years ago. Modric is amazing, he controls the tempo and always seems to know when to push and when to back off. They may not take home many trophies but they are definitely over-achievers.\u201d I don\u2019t totally agree that they\u2019re over-achieving because I don\u2019t believe in the term: generally speaking, teams get what they\u2019re worth and what they deserve. As for how they\u2019ve done it, Modric is probably the main on-pitch reason \u2013 though he\u2019d be a lot less without Kovacic and Brozovic alongside him \u2013 but I\u2019m certain that the pride in playing for a relatively new nation, and how completely the players and fans buy into that, is also crucial. It\u2019s not for me to decide which players need money and which don\u2019t, but I wrote on Twitter when PIF announced its ownership of all Saudi league clubs, that the direction of travel was clear: they were at the star hasbeen stage, and would soon be buying players at their peaks, and I\u2019d not be surprised were that to culminate in Champions League participation. That second step has come sooner than I expected, and my issue with it is the use of football by repressive regimes. Email! \u201cA little off-topic,\u201d begins David Wall, \u201cbut what do you make of Ruben Neves\u2019s transfer to play in Saudi Arabia? I find it really disheartening. He\u2019s in the prime of his career and has the ability to play for Champions League-level clubs (he\u2019s regularly reported as a transfer target for them, across Europe). It shows such a lack of ambition and, unlike when Oscar went to play in the Chinese league, he doesn\u2019t have the excuse of having extended family and communities that he has to support back home (as many players from South America do). Do you think many others will follow his example?\u201d I actually wrote about that the other day, previewing the Nations League festivities. On which point, it\u2019s June 18 and players are still playing, at the end of a stuffed season also featuring a World Cup. It\u2019s tricky as the international game needs to be supported, but that\u2019s not right. I\u2019m not surprised we\u2019re seeing on-pitch listlessness. Earlier today Italy \u201csecured\u201d third place by beating the Netherlands 3-2. Kuyt is saying the consensus in Holland is that the players didn\u2019t put enough sufficient effort. Channel 4 have gone for Emma Hayes and Dirk Kuyt as pundits. Each is wearing a jacket. Spain\u2019s winner against Italy was scored by Joselu, whose career has changed a little in his 30s. He appears to be leaving Epsnayol. Spain, meanwhile, make two alterations: at the base of midfield, Fabi\u00e1n Ru\u00edz replaces merino and on the right wing, Asensio comes in for Rodrigo. One change for Croatia following their 4-2 a.e.t. win over Netherlands, and it comes in the centre of defence: Erlic replacing Vida. I\u2019m slightly surprised by that as midweek, Vida played until the end whereas Sutalo was subbed. Croatia (4-3-3): Livakovic; Juranovic, Sutalo, Erli\u0107c, Perisic; Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic; Pasalic, Kramaric, Ivanusec. Subs: Labrovic, Ivusic, Stanisic, Barisic, Majer, Vlasic, Petkovic, Musa, Sosa, Beljo, Vida. Spain (4-2-3-1): Unai Simon; Jes\u00fas Navas, Le Normand, laporte, Alba; Rodrigo, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz; Asensio, Gavi, Pi\u00f1o; Morata. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Raya, Carvajal, Nacho, Zubimendi, Merino, Canales, Fati, Fran Garcia, Rodrigo, Joselu, Olmo. Referee: Felix Zwayer (Germany) There are certain words and phrases that you rarely hear in and around football these days \u2013 \u201cdubbin\u201d, \u201chospital pass\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d say. And \u201cschemer\u201d, which the Cambridge dictionary defines as \u201csomeone who makes clever, secret plans, often to deceive others\u201d, which in our context also encompasses imagination, dexterity and control \u2013 usually by someone physically diminutive. Which subtle segue brings us to Luka Modric, the schemer\u2019s schemer and perhaps the last of his type, a gorgeously inventive sprite with chammy feet, double-jointed hips and Mozart\u2019s mind. This might be the last time we see him in the international game, but what a run it\u2019s been, taking in a World Cup final, a World Cup third place \u2026 and tonight. Can Croatia finally take a debut title? Modric\u2019s performance in their semi-final win over the Netherlands was both staggering and humdrum, everything to which we\u2019ve become accustomed from that bears no resemblance to anything we\u2019ve seen from anyone else \u2013 and at the age of 37 too. The basic facts are obvious: he won a penalty and scored a penalty. But what really stood out was how easily he bossed the game with subtle touches and angles, cunning nips and duck \u2013 along with, of course, the booming outside-of-the-foot passes that make a mockery of both physics and every other player currently playing the game. Spain, though, will not simply hand him the send-off he deserves. Though they\u2019re nowhere near where they once were, their ability to retain possession \u2013 even in the absence of Pedri \u2013 means they\u2019re a brutal team to play, never mind beat. Like Croatia, they lack goalpower so assume their dominance will, at some point, lead to them scoring however many they need to get the job done \u2026 or, put another way, I\u2019d not be at all surprised to see extra time and penalties. Nor would I be if, at the end of things, the arch schemer revealed a clever, secret scheme to keep on scheming.

US Opens became mired in controversy long ago. From watering greens mid-round at Shinnecock Hills to Dustin Johnson\u2019s rules farrago at Oakmont and all manner of complaint about course set-up in between. This is a major that has carried the whiff of cordite as routine. In the background, the USGA is front and centre of a knotty situation regarding whether or not the distance golf balls fly should be rolled back. There is a debate to be had over LA Country Club as a suitable site for one of golf\u2019s prime events on the basis of exclusivity. Not allowing Hollywood A-stars as members is mildly amusing but more troublesome is the history in this area of discrimination against Jews, Catholics or others of a political standpoint that did not meet with club approval. Hillcrest Country Club was founded by the Jewish community in western Los Angeles in the 1920s as a direct response to being locked out elsewhere. LACC is infamously rigid and stuffy. It carries a $200,000 (\u00a3155,000) entry fee. Is it the right message, in terms of growing golf, to bring a US Open here? While Augusta National remains such a celebrated part of this sport, perhaps all bets are off. Golfers stay out of such conversations. There has, however, been no shortage of background noise to accompany the 123rd staging of this tournament. Take Wyndham Clark, who was irked at concluding his third round in the dark after teeing off post-3pm local time on the West Coast to accommodate television needs. Clark did birdie the 18th in fading light but produced a messy bogey on the preceding hole. Rickie Fowler, who was alongside Clark, bogeyed the last. \u201cIt was a little ridiculous that we teed off that late,\u201d said Clark. \u201cI would say right around hole 15 or 16 it started getting to where you couldn\u2019t see that well. We played twilight golf. I 100% think my bogey on 17 was because I couldn\u2019t see. I think Rickie\u2019s bogey on 18 was because he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us go off an hour and a half, two hours earlier. I\u2019m not trying to make an excuse, but it definitely was a challenge. My putt on 17, I literally couldn\u2019t see it, and we just played off of feel. How Rickie\u2019s putt came in, and then my putt on 18, same thing. So it\u2019s kind of tough and it\u2019s crazy to think that we\u2019re doing that on the last two holes of a major when we could have teed off two hours earlier.\u201d Indeed, Clark\u2019s point does raise questions about the integrity of the competition. Bryson DeChambeau branded the LACC test as \u201cdiabolical\u201d. It must be noted DeChambeau uses this word so often that he may not intend it to be as critical as appears in black and white. Brooks Koepka made plain his indifference towards the venue. So, too, did Matt Fitzpatrick. Viktor Hovland soon joined the chorus. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of this golf course, to be honest,\u201d said Hovland. \u201cI think there\u2019s some good holes. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great holes. I think there\u2019s a few bad holes.\u201d Talk about damned by faint praise. The Norwegian is hardly prone to caustic comment. Golfers moaning about venues is not a novel concept but Fitzpatrick, the 2022 champion, had a further swipe at the Californian atmosphere. \u201cVery poor,\u201d said Fitzpatrick. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing on the USGA side. They want a great tournament. From what I\u2019ve heard a lot of members bought tickets and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so many less people. Hopefully it\u2019s not the same for other US Opens going forward.\u201d In what looked like belated panic over the hare he had sent running, Fitzpatrick later took to social media to insist he was not being critical of the USGA. \u201cWe work with our host site to determine onsite access and availability of tickets,\u201d said a USGA statement on Sunday. Reports have suggested 23,000 tickets have been made available each day to the general public but only 9,000 of them did not involve hospitality. Ground passes routinely fetch more than $300 (\u00a3233) per day; one can join the dots about the price of those corporate passes. The USGA may argue a $3.6m (\u00a32.8m) prize for the winner has to be found somehow. Next year, the US Open will return to a quaint corner of North Carolina and Pinehurst. The course typically earns rave reviews. Light relief for the USGA? It would be unwise to bank on that."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94770", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/18/marcus-rashford-ends-qualifier-drought-before-old-trafford-clash", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Marcus Rashford ends qualifier drought before Old Trafford clash", "lead": "The forward came on against Malta, his first qualifier in over three years, with Gareth Southgate demanding \u2018commitment\u2019 before North Macedonia qualifier", "author": "Jamie Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 21:30:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548824", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/59fcf4feeaee1ad112beb3af8ff6a033ba151829/0_44_3156_1894/500.jpg", "body": "Here is an intriguing Marcus Rashford fact: the Manchester United forward\u2019s 30-minute cameo in the 4-0 win against Malta on Friday night was a first appearance in an England qualifier since scoring against Kosovo in November 2019. Covid postponing Euro 2020 for a year and a loss of form are factors but there is, too, a track record of pulling out of squads for various issues. He drew suspicion when flying to New York in March, having withdrawn because of injury before Gareth Southgate\u2019s side defeated Italy 2-1 in Naples. England\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifier on Monday, against North Macedonia, at Rashford\u2019s adored Old Trafford is one international he will not wish to miss and Southgate offers an interesting take when asked if it was important the player showed for this camp when nursing a hip problem. \u201cFor all the players,\u201d the manager says. \u201cThere was a possibility with the length of season that they\u2019ve had that we could have a lot of pull-outs but the only players that we\u2019ve lost are Lewis [Dunk] and Jude [Bellingham] who spent half the camp with us anyway. That\u2019s a good sign. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to the players about commitment being an important factor over the next 18 months. The more players that are here, they can hear the messages from the games that we play. Marcus is pleased that he has been able to work with our medical team and make a lot of progress in this period of time. We were always hoping this would be the case. \u201cA lot of players pull out during the season, almost ahead of a camp when you\u2019ve got two games and then you can be OK for the second game if everything aligns. Equally, during a season that\u2019s more complex because clubs have games coming up and the dynamic is a little bit different.\u201d Those who like to read between the lines may locate a message here to a footballer whose previous 10 appearances in an England jersey before Friday had been at a World Cup or European Championship. Bellingham joining, despite knowing a knee injury would rule him out, prompted a question regarding if the midfielder had set an example. The manager\u2019s answer was, again, to the point. \u201cYes, well he wouldn\u2019t be the first who has done that, others have,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIn fact, Marcus did it leading into the Euros [in March 2021] \u2013 there was a camp where he was just having treatment really. Part of being a team is the rest of your teammates recognising you are in on this. Just by spending time with them, you get better relationships and communication to create more of a feeling of togetherness. The spirit is a fundamental part of being a winning team.\u201d Southgate, too, shrugged off whether availability for previous camps affects his selection thinking. \u201cEverybody asks: \u2018Do you know your best team?\u2019 But we never have everybody available so it is also [about] what is your best team at any given moment because form can dictate that, level of fitness can dictate that. \u201cYou always have an idea of where you would like to go if everybody is available and everybody is playing well. We\u2019re fortunate that we have got some depth so that people have to keep delivering and have to keep producing because the best team in the last camp might not be the best team in the next one.\u201d Rashford is fresh from scoring 30 times for United and for England his record shows 13 goals in 22 starts and two in 30 when a replacement. \u201cI hadn\u2019t picked up on that to be fair,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to look back at what the rhythm of those games were, the stage when he came in. He\u2019s a good player as a sub, his mentality is always good, but nobody wants to be seen as a good sub, you want to start the games and he would be no different in that for sure.\u201d But Southgate was not as convinced when answering if Rashford could be Harry Kane\u2019s replacement as the England No 9. \u201cAt the moment I still think he\u2019s better from the left than as a nine but he\u2019s definitely made progress as a nine this year and had a bigger impact [so] that\u2019s possible. But, of course, we have Callum [Wilson], Ollie Watkins has had a good season, and Ivan Toney will be back as well. There are other players in the frame for that nine shirt. \u201cI know him [Rashford] as well as anybody is going to know him. He\u2019s not always easy to read. He does love playing for England, he\u2019s very proud to play for England and I\u2019m sure an England game at Old Trafford will be a special moment for him.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94771", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/keir-starmer-to-throw-everything-at-plan-to-get-uk-to-net-zero", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Keir Starmer to \u2018throw everything\u2019 at plan to get UK to net zero", "lead": "Labour leader will use speech in Scotland to lay out new green strategy for energy industry", "author": "Fiona Harvey and Severin Carrell in Edinburgh", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 21:30:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548844", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/51a913939206dd94d67464457357471898ae9528/0_140_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Keir Starmer will pledge to \u201cthrow everything\u201d at net zero and the overhaul of the UK\u2019s energy system and industries, promising new jobs in \u201cthe race of our lifetime\u201d to a low-carbon future. The Labour leader will seek to regain the initiative on his plan for green growth on Monday, having rowed back earlier this month on a pledge to invest \u00a328bn in a green industrial strategy, a figure that will not now be reached until the second half of a Labour parliament, as well as damaging rows with trade unions over the future of the North Sea. Announcing a package of policies designed to decarbonise the energy system and industry, Starmer will say: \u201cWe\u2019re going to throw everything at this: planning reform, procurement, long-term finance, R&amp;D, a strategic plan for skills and supply chains \u2026 Pulling together for a simple, unifying priority: British power for British jobs.\u201d Labour\u2019s plans include sweeping changes to the planning system that will allow onshore wind farms, electricity lines, transport links and other low-carbon infrastructure to be built quickly. All regulators will be given instructions to prioritise low-carbon projects, and companies will be given assurances on long-term policy to encourage investment. Speaking in Scotland, Starmer will contrast the opportunities for investing in a low-carbon economy with the devastation of the UK\u2019s industrial heartlands under Margaret Thatcher. \u201cThis cannot be a re-run of the 1980s,\u201d he will say. \u201cThis is the race of our lifetime, and the prize is real.\u201d Labour\u2019s plans for renewable energy, including a ban on new oil and gas exploration and development in the North Sea, have come under attack, from the Conservatives and trade unions. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, accused the Labour leader of being \u201cthe political wing\u201d of Just Stop Oil. Starmer will counter by arguing net zero is vital to the UK\u2019s safety. \u201cWe live in an increasingly volatile world. The twin risks of climate change and energy security now threaten the stability of nations,\u201d he will say. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to ground everything we do in a new insight \u2013 that clean energy is now essential for national security.\u201d His team also rebuffed suggestions of a U-turn on the North Sea oil ban. Rescinding permission for projects that have cleared all regulatory hurdles before the general election would be costly and legally complex, so the party\u2019s proposed ban on new oilfields will not cover projects that have achieved all three levels of consent, for exploration, development and production. It is unlikely that many of the more than 100 North Sea licences the government is mulling would fall into that category, though one of the biggest \u2013 the Rosebank oil and gas field \u2013 could clear the final regulatory hurdles soon. Labour\u2019s plans also include insulating 19 million homes, setting up a national energy company, decarbonising electricity supply by 2030 and a national wealth fund to invest in green infrastructure. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, told the Guardian the package would transform the UK\u2019s economy. \u201cThis is a transformative agenda to bring lower bills, more jobs, energy security and climate leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour is seizing the future, in stark contrast to the Tories, who have abandoned the pitch on this agenda.\u201d New analysis by Carbon Brief found less gas would be imported by 2030 under Labour\u2019s plans than under Tory policies, despite the proposed ban on new North Sea drilling. Planning policies for onshore wind and pylon construction are devolved to the Scottish and Welsh governments: in Wales, the Labour-led government is likely to be willing partners on this strategy. In Scotland, Labour needs to negotiate with the Scottish National party and Scottish Green government in Edinburgh, but would expect its support. Labour\u2019s plans met approval from Sam Richards, former Tory party adviser to Boris Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s great news that Keir Starmer has put reforming our broken planning system at the heart of Labour\u2019s plans to deliver the clean energy infrastructure that can cut our energy bills and create jobs,\u201d said Richards, the founder of the campaign group Britain Remade. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Labour have adopted many of the recommendations set out in [our March] report, from ending the senseless ban on new onshore wind farms to speeding up the time it takes to get offshore wind farms up and running.\u201d Starmer\u2019s choice of Edinburgh for the launch reflects Labour\u2019s need to win seats from the SNP as well as the Tories in England. A new Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times put the SNP and Labour neck and neck on 34%, suggesting Labour is on course to win 26 Westminster seats in Scotland. It currently holds one in Scotland. The headquarters of the new state-owned energy company GB Energy promised by Labour is to be based in Scotland, in a signal to Scottish voters the country would benefit directly from a UK Labour government. Starmer will say: \u201cNeither [SNP nor Tories] are truly invested in Scotland\u2019s success. For the SNP, any Scottish triumph in Britain is a threat to the ultimate prize. While the Tories welcome such division because they think it works for them, politically.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94772", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/18/luke-shaw-would-want-harry-kane-at-manchester-united-in-a-heartbeat", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Luke Shaw would want Harry Kane at Manchester United \u2018in a heartbeat\u2019", "lead": "Luke Shaw said: \u2018I can\u2019t lie, I\u2019d love a few of them to come to United,\u2019 as England prepare to play North Macedonia in a Euro 2024 qualifier", "author": "Aaron Bower", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 21:30:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548861", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/52a6f97ce9f678af79ad26c89abc6ab256ba978e/0_152_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Luke Shaw has admitted he has used England\u2019s end-of-season camp as an opportunity to try to convince some of his international teammates their futures at club level lie with him at Manchester United, saying he would take the likes of Harry Kane and Declan Rice at Old Trafford \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d. Kane and Rice are two of several players in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Euro 24 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia whose futures are under scrutiny this summer. Rice is increasingly likely to leave West Ham while speculation over Kane\u2019s future at Tottenham is again rife. The futures of fellow England internationals such as Jordan Pickford and Mason Mount have also come under discussion. Shaw added fuel to the fire on Saturday when he teased via Instagram that he had given Kane and Rice a tour of United\u2019s Carrington training complex. He admitted he was only \u201chalf-joking\u201d when posting that, largely because he has been pestering them over a move to join him at Old Trafford next season. \u201cBecause of the timing of the season and what\u2019s going on, there is a lot of talk,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t lie, I\u2019d love a few of them to come to United, I\u2019m not going to lie. I am speaking to them telling them how good Manchester is, because I know their qualities. \u201cThey\u2019re world-class players and they\u2019d add massive strength to us.

I was only half-joking [about his Instagram post], it\u2019s a bit of both. Like I said there, I know they\u2019re both world-class players. Of course I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with the situation at their clubs but if it was down to me, I\u2019d take them in a heartbeat. They\u2019d help us go on to what we want to achieve.\u201d Shaw also admitted that given England\u2019s players break for the summer after their game against North Macedonia at Old Trafford on Monday, the timing of their latest camp makes it increasingly difficult to avoid transfer speculation. He also said it was a great sign of England\u2019s strength as a squad that so many players in Southgate\u2019s group are being courted, with Jude Bellingham having already completed a transfer to Real Madrid. The 27-year-old said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to read it, it\u2019s everywhere. Everyone does read it but I think because of the situation and when this camp is, with people\u2019s contracts running down, there\u2019s much more talk this time. We read what\u2019s going on, we all talk, we\u2019re all really close and we have private conversations. You could pick anyone in this squad you\u2019d love to come to your team. The strength and depth we have here, the players we have are exceptional. Any player that leaves to go to another club next season is only going to make their team better and increase their strength.\u201d As the only specialist left-back in England\u2019s squad, Shaw is almost certain to win his 31st cap against North Macedonia. However, the rest of Southgate\u2019s starting lineup is far less certain, with the whole squad \u2013 including Bukayo Saka, who left the field on Friday \u2013 available, including the Manchester City quintet of John Stones, Jack Grealish, Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips and Phil Foden. Of that five, only Foden featured in the win in Malta but with extra recovery time following City\u2019s Champions League victory, they are now in contention to start against North Macedonia. So too is Trent Alexander-Arnold, who impressed in central midfield against Malta. \u201cIt\u2019s another option and it\u2019s an exciting one,\u201d Southgate said of the Liverpool player. \u201cWe know the outstanding qualities that he has. I thought he adapted really well to the role. It\u2019s certainly difficult to name a team because we\u2019ve got some depth and players who\u2019ve all trained well.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94773", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/18/joe-biden-flamin-hot-cheetos-eva-longoria", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Flamin\u2019 not?

So many of you, your ancestors left behind all that they knew to start a new life in the United States,\u201d Biden told the crowd, before the president gave the Desperate Housewives star a hug and made an incomprehensible joke about when she was 17 and he was 40. Longoria told the gathering that Monta\u00f1ez\u2019s story inspired her because during her career she has been told \u201cno\u201d \u2013 or that ideas don\u2019t come from people like her \u2013 and that she couldn\u2019t do certain jobs because she is a woman. First lady Jill Biden said Monta\u00f1ez helped change the way companies think about Latino customers, adding: \u201cThis film isn\u2019t just about Richard. It\u2019s about everyone who has been overlooked or underestimated.\u201d But the Disney+ film has now revived questions of whether Monta\u00f1ez actually came up with the spicy Cheetos Flamin\u2019 Hot recipe while working at a Frito-Lay plant in Rancho Cucamonga, California, in the late 1980s \u2013 he has claimed his idea was ripped off by company executives \u2013 or if the chilli-covered snack was the work of uncredited company workers for which he took credit. According to an LA Times story in 2021 and another last week, the janitor turned executive for Frito Lay didn\u2019t invent Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos. But he has built a lucrative second career out of telling the story as a paid corporate speaker at Target, Walmart, Harvard and the University of California, among others, and in two books, 2013\u2019s A Boy, a Burrito, and a Cookie: From Janitor to Executive and 2021\u2019s Flamin\u2019 Hot: The Incredible True Story of One Man\u2019s Rise from Janitor to Top Executive. Monta\u00f1ez, as he tells it, got some plain, unflavored Cheetos from the factory. He and wife Judy developed spicy seasoning, applied it to the Cheetos and sent samples to Frito-Lay executives. But the LA Times contradicted his claims, citing interviews with employees that pointed to the spicy snack originating in 1989 in Plano, Texas, before Monta\u00f1ez was an employee. It was another Frito-Lay employee, Lynne Greenfeld, who developed and named the product, the company said. In a statement to Eater last year, Frito-Lay \u2013 a US subsidiary of PepsiCo \u2013 said that \u201cspicy salty snacks have spiked in popularity in recent years with the category growing 12% in the last four years\u201d. According to surveys, the company added, over half (55%) of US consumers have tried Cheetos Flamin\u2019 Hot and 46% of Gen Z-ers say they love them. \u201cWe value Richard\u2019s many contributions to our company, especially his insights into Hispanic consumers, but we do not credit the creation of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos or any Flamin\u2019 Hot products to him,\u201d the company told the outlet. But it acknowledged that Monta\u00f1ez did work on a line of snacks for the company in the early 1990s dubbed Sabrositas. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to dispute that lady, because I don\u2019t know,\u201d he later told Variety. \u201cAll I can tell you is what I did. All I have is my history, what I did in my kitchen.\u201d Monta\u00f1ez also said that he\u2019d felt \u201cpushed out\u201d of the test marketing process. In another 2021 statement, he acknowledged that \u201cdifferent work streams tackling the same product without interacting occasionally occurred in the past, when divisions operated independently and were not the best at communicating\u201d. But by that time, Longoria was already working on Flamin\u2019 Hot and has said that the LA Times story \u201cnever affected us\u201d. \u201cFeels like LA Times would have better resources dedicated to more important things,\u201d she told the paper in March. \u201cWe never set out to tell the story of the Cheeto. We are telling Richard Monta\u00f1ez\u2019s story and we are telling his truth.\u201d Longoria added that she preferred to concentrate on Monta\u00f1ez\u2019s rise through the Frito-Lay ranks. \u201cHis genius was the fact that he knew the Hispanic market and he knew how to mobilize them,\u201d she said. But the LA Times returned to the disputed spicy Cheetos genesis account last week in the form of a review. And it may have kicked off the spicy controversy anew when columnist Gustavo Arellano wrote that \u201cthe details of history don\u2019t matter to Longoria; Mexican pride does\u201d. \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot is the type of feelgood treacle that high school teachers screened for their Mexican American students when I was coming of age in the 1990s to make us feel better about ourselves,\u201d Arellano wrote. \u201cTeachers today will no doubt do the same for their students. That\u2019s what makes Flamin\u2019 Hot not just pandering but pernicious.\u201d The White House later defended its decision to screen the film, with an anonymous official saying it was not a documentary but an opportunity for Americans from different backgrounds to see themselves reflected in film and celebrated by the president, according to the Associated Press. \u201cRichard Monta\u00f1ez disrupted the food industry in the \u201990s by channelling his Mexican American heritage to help turn Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos into a multibillion-dollar brand today and a cultural phenomenon,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cWe are telling a story that celebrates the American entrepreneurial dream without sidestepping the fact that the dream isn\u2019t available in the same way for everyone.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94774", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/18/church-of-england-vicars-demand-pay-rise-to-cope-with-cost-of-living-crisis", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Church of England vicars demand pay rise to cope with cost of living crisis", "lead": "C of E clergy and lay staff represented by Unite ask for 9.5% increase in first ever claim", "author": "Heather Stewart", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 21:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548897", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/183d5fef0552323bffdc0a91de54a9699d617075/467_822_3568_2141/500.jpg", "body": "Church of England vicars have become the latest group of workers to demand a pay rise in the face of the cost of living crisis, as Unite\u2019s general secretary, Sharon Graham, claimed they were among the \u201cworking poor\u201d. More than 2,000 clergy and lay staff represented by the union have submitted their first ever official pay claim, asking for a 9.5% rise in the annual stipend, which stands at \u00a326,794. The C of E\u2019s remuneration and conditions of service committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, and has invited Unite to make a submission about its members\u2019 pay and conditions for the first time, after lobbying by the union. Graham said: \u201cLike all workers, Church of England clergy are struggling with the cost of living crisis. While many will argue their work is a vocation, the simple truth is that on their current rewards they are among the working poor.\u201d The stipend is funded by contributions from congregations, but Unite is calling for additional central funding to be made available. It points out that the church commissioners\u2019 investment fund, which supports the work of the church, is worth more than \u00a310bn. Sam Macinnes, a vicar in Horsham and a Unite activist, said: \u201cThe whole principle of clergy remuneration is that you\u2019re given enough to be in a comfortable state where you can fully give yourself to your ministry and support and care for your communities, which more and more clergy households are unable to do at the moment. \u201cThe demands of pastoral ministry are getting ever greater, but if people are worrying about whether they can feed and clothe their families, how are they going to be able to give that support to others?\u201d Dioceses can set their own stipends above the minimum, which was increased by 5% in April. Vicars are also usually given a house to live in, though Macinnes points out that these can sometimes be draughty or poorly maintained. The remuneration committee will make a recommendation to the Archbishops\u2019 Council, which meets in September and will then make a final recommendation to the General Synod, the church\u2019s governing body. A review of clergy remuneration was carried out in 2020 and 2021, and found that the overall package \u2013 including a house and payment of bills such as council tax \u2013 amounted to about \u00a350,000. \u201cWe consider that this should be adequate for most clergy and is generally an appropriate level of remuneration,\u201d the report said. The church provided \u00a33m in extra funds to dioceses to make hardship payments to clergy last May, and another \u00a315m in October to help churches with energy bills. A Church of England spokesperson said: \u201cOur clergy provide unstinting spiritual, pastoral and practical support to their communities on a daily basis. \u201cWe know they make this huge contribution against a backdrop of a cost of living crisis both for them and those they minister to. \u201cWe are mindful of this, and of issues of affordability for dioceses, in the deliberations over the annual recommendations for the minimum and benchmark stipend levels.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94775", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/morning-mail-wilkinson-comments-exploited-to-oppose-voice-gas-project-backers-revealed-ashes-on-a-knife-edge", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Morning Mail: Wilkinson comments exploited to oppose voice, gas project backers revealed, Ashes on a knife edge", "lead": "Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has emailed supporters asking if they have heard about the attack on her in an effort to raise an \u2018urgent\u2019 $130,000 fund", "author": "Charlotte Graham-McLay", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 20:50:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548914", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a6e1dbc09754cc49df9169bdcca9648b03cd46ae/0_550_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning, everyone.

Happy Father\u2019s Day to you all you dads, pops and papas out there. Love to you all. I\u2019m sure Jos is feeling pretty pleased with the way his son went. 23 titles! That\u2019s a podium to rival any in the sport\u2019s history. Now for the anthems on the podium. The Dutch followed by the Austrian. When I was young I used to think the Italian anthem was just another verse of the German given how often the two were paired together. I wonder if any new fans to the sport have created a similar melding in their minds\u2026 \u201cMax Verstappen is the greatest race car driver in the world.\u201d Anyone want to argue with Kurt Perleberg? That\u2019s a full house now for Red Bull. Seven victories from seven races this season. Nine on the bounce and 100 overall. Dominance doesn\u2019t quite cut it. Needless to say, they\u2019re in command of the constructors title race: 1. Red Bull \u2013 287 2. Mercedes \u2013 152 3. Aston Martin \u2013 134 4. Ferarri \u2013 100 5. Alpine \u2013 40 6. McLaren \u2013 17 7. Haas \u2013 8 8. Alfa Romeo \u2013 8 9. AlphaTauri \u2013 2 10. Williams \u2013 1 Sometimes seventh can feel like a win: Verstappen now has a commanding lead on the championship. If he loses it, it\u2019d statistically be the biggest turnaround in F1 history. Don\u2019t bet on it: 1. Verstappen (Red Bull) \u2013 170 2. Perez (Red Bull) \u2013 117 3. Alonso (Aston Martin) \u2013 99 4. Hamilton (Mercedes) \u2013 87 5. Russell (Mercedes) \u2013 65 6. Sainz (Ferrari) \u2013 58 7. Leclerc (Ferrari) \u2013 42 8. Stroll (Aston Martin) \u2013 35 9. Ocon (Alpine) \u2013 25 10. Gasly (Alpine) \u2013 15 Rounding off the podium, here\u2019s Lewis Hamilton: It\u2019s honestly been a great weekend for us. We\u2019re slowly chipping away. The Astons took a little step ahead with their upgrades but we\u2019re hoping to bring a little more moving forwards. But to have this consistency in Montreal, such an incredible city, with such a great crowd every year here without fail, I just want to thank everyone here. It\u2019s an honour to be up there with two world champions. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t have the pace today. We knew this wouldn\u2019t be our strongest circuit because we struggle in the lower speed corners. That\u2019s really where I was losing to Fernando and to Max. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to add rear downforce and more efficiency. But we\u2019re chipping away and I do believe we\u2019ll get there. We\u2019re moving in the right direction. Now from a beaming Fernando Alonso who\u2019s asked if that was the race he expected: Probably. I think so. We were hoping to challenge a bit more the Red Bull. We lost a place at the start so had to fight with Lewis and the Mercedes. I didn\u2019t have one lap where I could relax. It was a lovely battle. It was tough. It was a very demanding race. [On his troubles. Was it brakes or fuel?] I don\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t tell me. Maybe it was to make me not worry too much. Hopefully that means we have more pace so we can put more pressure with the next one. Here\u2019s the race winner, Max Verstappen: I\u2019m very happy right now. It wasn\u2019t a straight forward race because the tyres were not getting in their window. It was very cold today compared to Friday. We were sliding around quite a bit. But we made it work. And to win again, the 100th grand prix for the team, is incredible. I never expected to get these kind of numbers. It\u2019s a great day again. I expected more or less what we had today [he\u2019s talking about the challenge from the other teams]. We just had to keep the grip in the tyres which was disappearing quickly. Overall we won that was the most important. Alexander Albon wins the race of the day. Started in ninth. Held on to seventh. I\u2019d have given it to Alonso but I\u2019m not going to write an angry letter after Albon gets the public\u2019s vote. Perez claims fastest lap! So that strategy worked a charm as the late tyre change for Perez allowed him to keep hold of sixth and steal the extra point from Mercedes. 1. Verstappen (Red Bull) 2. Alonso (Aston Martin) 3. Hamilton (Mercedes) 4. Leclerc (Ferrari) 5. Sainz (Ferarri) 6. Perez (Red Bull) 7. Albon (Williams) 8. Ocon (Alpine) 9. Stroll (Aston Martin) 10. Bottas (Alfa Romeo) It\u2019s two Canadian GP wins for Verstappen. Red Bull have their 100th F1 win and the young Dutchman with two world championships already now has as many wins as the great Brazilian Senna. Lap 70/70: Verstappen starts the final lap and will hand Red Bull their 100th race win. Hamilton still has the fastest lap and Norris has just been slammed with a five second penalty. He\u2019s in ninth but won\u2019t remain there. Lap 69/70: Only Norris can change the line-up and that is if he gets past Ocon. Perez in sixth pits in the hope he might come out and get a fastest lap to steal a point off Hamilton and Mercedes. Lap 68/70: That Ocon rear wing is wobbling a lot! A lot, a lot. The Alpine pit wall is willing him on. Lap 67/70: Alonso\u2019s rear brakes have won him second place here. And considering Verstappen\u2019s dominance that\u2019ll feel like a win. Ocon in eighth has a \u201cfloppy\u201d rear wing. Norris is complaining about it. It really is jiggling around to be fair. Lap 66/70: Verstappen almost crashes into the wall! He manages to laugh about it. Wow! Can you just imagine. Lap 65/70: Alonso no almost three seconds ahead of Hamilton. Has he done enough to grab second? Lap 64/70: Norris passes Bottas and holds off the counter. Excellent driving. Lap 63/70: Albon still holding onto seventh. Ocon, Bottas, Norris and Stroll in hot step. But Norris could be pinned with a five second penalty so he\u2019d lose 10th. Lap 63/70: Alonso has been given licence to put more in his rear brakes which has helped nudge a little extra breathing room between himself and Hamilton. Lap 62/70: This is a track that is best suited to Hamilton given his ability to brake late into the turn. Still, he\u2019s two seconds behind Alonso is starting to fish tail slightly in search of extra speed through the corner. Lap 61/70: Hamilton has caught Alonso. Nine laps to pass him. Lap 60/70: Albon is holding on to seventh with Ocon, Bottas, Norris and Stroll all in tight formation behind him. Lap 59/70: Hamilton has just recorded four consecutively faster laps than Alonso. Buckle up. Lap 58/70: Verstappen\u2019s lead up to eight seconds. Ferrari have pulled a rabbit out of the hat here. Looks like fourth and fifth will be theirs. Lap 57/70: Hamilton can now see Alonso in the distance. The gap is under two seconds. Not sure Alonso will be able to hold him off if caught. Lap 56/70: Russell\u2019s retirement means Norris is up to 10th. Hamilton has halved the gap to Alonso since they both pitted. Lap 55/70: Russell\u2019s race is over. Just as he was galloping up the field, it\u2019s a brake failure that does him in the end. He started 4th, hit a wall, began anew at the back, got up to 8th but now retires. Lap 54/70: Reminder that Verstappen will equal Ayrton Senna\u2019s career wins with victory today. Lap 53/70: Albon and Russell are on tyres that are 40 laps old. Ocon behind him is on a set of boots that are only 16 laps old. A bit of a train forming behind them. Bottas also in the mix. Lap 52/70: Ocon is eyeing up the slower moving Albon and Russell up ahead. Could have a three-way battle for seventh soon. Lap 51/70: Norris is facing a penalty for \u201cunsportsmanlike conduct\u201d. The Sky commentators aren\u2019t too sure what it\u2019s all about. Talk of trouble in the pit lane. He\u2019s in 11th. Lap 50/70: Alonso eases a bit of breathing room ahead of Hamilton. Absolutely loving their tussle. But Alonso might have to ease up before he runs out of fuel. Verstappen Alonso +5.8 Hamilton +3.4 Leclerc +3.4 Sainz +2.3 Perez +4.5 Albon +15.1 Russell +0.9 Acon +1.4 Lap 49/70: Russell is inches behind Albon in seventh. The Williams won\u2019t roll over. Lap 48/70: Verstappen has now led F1 for 202 consecutive laps. Hamilton is closing in on Alonso after the Spaniard ran wide and off the track. Lap 47/70: Alonso responds to Hamilton\u2019s fastest lap and sets one of his own. He\u2019s on the hard tyres. But Hamilton says, \u201cOh no,\u201d and takes it right back. They\u2019re racing, these two old war dogs, that\u2019s for sure. Lap 46/70: Albon also doing a fine job but will soon have Russell all over him in 7th. Hamilton on the mediums with the fastest lap. Lap 45/70: Russell is up to 8th! Started 4th but he hit the wall early on and has since done a superb job hauling his car into the points. Lap 44/70: Ooo. I did say the mediums looked quicker. Perez has the fastest lap now. He\u2019s chasing the Ferraris up ahead in 4th and 5th. Radio confirms that we won\u2019r expect a battle when he does eventually catch them. They\u2019re on different races. Lap 43/70: Verstappen pits now. He\u2019s shifted to the mediums which seem to be the quicker tyre now. He\u2019s 4.5 seconds ahead of Alonso in second. \u201cWho would have thought after all those years Alonso would still be battling it out with Lewis ? I remember them falling out at Maclaren because Alonso wanted to be the no 1 driver!\u201d It\u2019s brilliant, isn\u2019t it Anne Williams! Lap 42/70: Alonso pits for a second time from second place. He remains on the hard tyres. Sainz has just set the fastest lap. Whisper it quietly but Ferrari have perhaps done something that\u2019s worked. Lap 41/70: Hamilton pits and comes back on the mediums. Lap 40/70: Leclerc pits now. He\u2019s ahead of Sainz who is holding off Perez. The Ferraris are on hard tyres and now Perez is on the mediums. Lap 39/70: Sainz pits. He entered from 5th. He\u2019s in and out and on the hard tyres. Looks like he\u2019s retained his position. Turns out a good move from the Ferraris. Lap 38/70: Perez pits from 6th. He\u2019s down to 7th. Lap 37/70: Magnussen and Norris pit. Magnussen has had an eventful race. He started 13th and is now down to 19th. Ocon pits for a second time. Bottas pits as well and is down to 11th and has come out with a medium tyre. Lap 36/70: Safety car? Nope, Magnussen and Hulkenberg can get back on track after finding the run-off area and so the Ferraris stay out. There was movement in the garage. Lap 35/70: Verstappen was going through some tyre issues but those are clearly over now. A tangle at turn one leaves two drivers off the track as Magnussen and Hulkenberg have to reverse and re-enter the race at the back. Lap 34/70: Verstappen 5.3 seconds ahead of Alonso who is 3.1 ahead of Hamilton. That top three has calcified somewhat. Lap 33/70: Sainz is now seven seconds ahead of Perez. Remember, the Ferraris need about 19 if they\u2019re to hold their position after pitting. Lap 32/70: Russell has made some ground and is up to 17th. But he\u2019ll be annoyed that his race is over after smacking a wall with his wheel. Lap 31/70: Alonso still has the fastest lap but Verstappen is pulling away. Unless the world champion crashes he\u2019ll claim his 41st race win. Lap 30/70: Alonso has been outstanding. No many pre-race thought he\u2019d still be in the mix at this stage. Verstappen Alonso +4 Hamilton +2.6 Leclerc +2.8 Sainz +1.6 Perez +3.9 Ocon +6.8 Bottas +2.1 Norris +0.9 Piastri +2.8 Getting a bit of chat about nostalgia. \u201cIt was more exciting for me when it was on terrestrial TV, it\u2019s become a very elitist sport.\u201d That\u2019s from Anne Williams. Richard Hirst adds: \u201cIn reply to Gary Naylor, how about rugby union? More flowing and spectacular in the 1970s for example.\u201d Lap 29/70: Verstappen now 3.5 seconds in the lead. Alonso has dropped Hamilton after setting the fastest lap. That gap is now almost 2 seconds. Lap 28/70: Perez is having a great race. He\u2019s made six positions from the grid and will make another two once the Ferraris pit. He\u2019s in 6th. Lap 27/70: Bottas and Norris are battling for 8th. Leclerc and Sainz need at least 19 seconds to hold onto what they\u2019ve got. Perez is 4seconds behind them at present. Lap 26/70: The Ferraris are still out there. Leclerc in 4th and Sainz in 5th. Now the only drivers on the mediums. Lap 25/70: Verstappen disappearing. 3.5 seconds ahead of Alonso and Hamilton. Lap 24/70: Magnussen has backed up a long train behind him in 10th. Hamilton and Norris both let off the hook. Lap 23/70: Alonso passes Hamilton and holds off the counter. Brilliant driving from these two champions. Lap 22/70: Alonso is all over the back of Hamilton but just doesn\u2019t have the requisite grunt to pass him. Lap 21/70: Alonso now sets the fastest lap. Magnussen drops from 7th to 10th in a flash as first Ocon and then Bottas and Norris passes him. Lap 20/70: Albon passes Piastri to take 11th. Hamilton drifting to almost two seconds behind Verstappen. Lap 19/70: Verstappen has just set another fastest lap and has opened up a 1.5 second gap over Hamilton. Leclerc locks up his softer tyres. The Ferraris need to stay out there for a long time if this strategy not to pit under the safety car is to pay off. Lap 18/70: Race control has nailed Norris for an unsafe release. He might get a penalty. Not that he\u2019s worrying about that now. He\u2019s trying to keep his teammate, Piastri, at bay in 11th. Hamilton\u2019s release in front of Alonso also being looked at. Lap 17/70: Verstappen leads as the safety car ducks back in the pits. Alonso right on Hamilton\u2019s tail. Two Ferraris behind them. Haas is holding onto 7th. No incidents after the restart. Lap 16/70: Safety car remains out there. Perez, like the Ferraris, opted to stay out. Perez is on a hard tyre and will be able to stay out longer. He started in 12th but is now in contention for a podium. He\u2019ll be eying Alonso\u2019s third place at least. Safety car coming in after this lap. Hard to disagree with this. Lap 15/70: Only the Ferraris are on the mediums. Everyone else is on the hard compound. Russell is back out but is holding up the rear. Safety car still out. Top three of Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso all got in the pits. Could this work for the Ferraris? Or was this another blunder? Lap 14/70: Ooooh. Drama in the pit lane. Hamilton is released just in front of Alonso. The stewards might have a look at that. The Ferrari\u2019s didn\u2019t pit. Leclerc is up to 4th and Sainz is 5th. Bold. Perez has also made some ground. We\u2019ve still got a safety car. Here\u2019s the top 10 after those pits: Verstappen Hamilton Alonso Leclerc Sainz Perez Magnussen Bottas Ocon Piastri Lap 13/70: Russell went deep at the exit of the first part of the chicane and lost control. It\u2019s a big impact. Driver error and he apologises with some swear words on the team radio. Oh no! What\u2019s happened there. The Brit has clattered a wall and has broken the wheel rim. Safety car is in and he\u2019s limping to the pit lane. Lap 12/70: Hulkenberg pits so Norris, Leclerc and Albon move ahead into 7th, 8th and 9th. Russell has hit the wall! Lap 11/70: Hamilton apaprently complaining that the tyres are \u201ctoo hot\u201d. Gasly is the first to pit and whips off the softs. Top 5: Verstappen Hamilton Alonso Russell Ocon Lap 10/70: Hamilton holding up Alonso has now made an Aston Martin Sandwich with Mercedes serving as the bread. What I mean is Russell has caught the pair ahead of him and there\u2019s now a three way battle for second. Lap 9/70: Alonso shifts a little wide in search of some cool air as he\u2019s all over the back of Hamilton. Leclerc is on the charge behind Norris. Somehow Verstappen has stretched his lead to more than three seconds despite the virtual safety car in play. Big battle for seventh with Hulkenberg leading Norris and Leclerc. Lap 8/70: Virtual safety car in play as Sargeant\u2019s car is in a tricky spot at turn 6. Verstappen had just set the fastest lap time before that was called. Lap 7/70: Hulkenberg has dropped two spots and could have a problem. We\u2019ve got out first retirement as Sargeant\u2019s engine shuts down. Lap 6/70: Verstappen almost two seconds ahead of Hamilton. Alonso is now more than four seconds ahead of Russell. He\u2019s having a great race after a dodgy start. In fact, he\u2019s chasing down Hamilton. Top 10: Verstappen Hamilton Alonso Russell Ocon Hulkenberg Piastri Norris Leclerc Albon Lap 5/70: Russell isn\u2019s closing the gap on Alonso. Norris continues to keep Leclerc at bay. Lap 4/70: Hamilton is chasing Verstappen. He\u2019s over 1.5 seconds down the road. Lap 3/70: Alonso clips the wall and the Sky commentators are suggesting he might face some suspension issues. Will keep an eye on that. He\u2019s still in third. Lap 2/70: Perez is holding firm at 12th. He\u2019ll want to start climbing the ranks soon. Sainz almost screamed into the back of him. Lap 1/70: So Verstappen got away without a fuss. Alonso was easily passed by Hamilton. McLaren\u2019s Piastri and Norris are in 7th and 8th. Leclerc in the Ferari is up to 7th. Verstappen gets away cleanly and it\u2019s also a good start from Hamilton who squeezes past Alonso. Leclerc is away swiftly who goes wide and loses the place he nabbed from Perez. The drivers are in their cockpits and just about to get underway for the warm-up lap. Not long to go now. And before we get going, let me wish a happy Father\u2019s Day to all the dads out there. Whether you\u2019re raising a little one who shares your DNA or not, you\u2019re an absolute champion. \u201cIt was a good day but of course today is very different so we will see, there\u2019s very low grip, so throughout the race there will be a lot of rubber on the track which will also influence the tyres quite a bit, but we will see.\u201d So says Max Verstappen. I\u2019d genuinely love to know if he enjoys simply cantering away in the distance without any challenge. I\u2019m sure winning F1 races never gets old but surely, SURELY, a contest would be more fun? Just been told that the track is \u201cgreen\u201d which means it\u2019ll be slippery. First corner could be tasty. Not long to day? \u201cWe will rock you\u201d is blasting round the track? Ya\u2019ll ready for this? He\u2019s got some way to go \u2013 62 in fact \u2013 but Max Verstappen will one day surpass Lewis Hamilton\u2019s record of 103 F1 race wins. Hey, don\u2019t shoot the messenger. That\u2019s from the man who holds the record himself: Speaking of Ferarri\u2026 there\u2019s a problem with Charles Leclerc\u2019s car. There\u2019s an issue with the wooden plank under the machine. Vasseur doesn\u2019t seem too bothered though. Should be fine by the time they get going. Just what is going on at Ferarri? That\u2019s a question that has too many answers to unpack here. Not even Fred Vasseur, the team\u2019s F1 prinicapl, can pinpoint the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to understand and to fix it because it\u2019s not always the same problem,\u201d he said after Barcelona. What makes this conundrum more baffling is the success at Le Mans last week. How could that have gone so well when everything else is going so wrong with the flagship car? Just a reminder, after all those grid penalties, how the drivers will start today\u2019s race: Max Verstappen (Red Bull) Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin) Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) George Russell (Mercedes) Nico Hulkenberg \u2013 3 place penalty (Haas) Esteban Ocon (Alpine) Lando Norris (McLaren) Oscar Piastri (McLaren) Alex Albon (Williams) Charles Leclerc (Ferarri) Carlos Sainz \u2013 3 place penalty (Ferarri) Sergio Perez (Red Bull) Kevin Magnussen (Haas) Valterri Botas (Alfa Romeo) Pierre Gasly (Alpine) Lance Stroll \u2013 3 place penalty (Aston Martin) Nyck de Vries (AlphaTauri) Logan Sargeant (Williams) Yuki Tsunoda \u2013 3 place penalty (AlphaTauri) Zhou Guanyu (Alfa Romeo) There were four grid penalties after yesterday\u2019s practice. Haas driver Niko Hulkenberg should be starting on the front row but has been booted down to fifth after he was caught speeding under a red flag. Ferarri\u2019s Carlo Sainz drops from eighth to 11th after a problematic Q2 exit. Lance Stroll of Aston Martin starts 16th instead of 13th and AlphaTauri\u2019s double Q1 elimination becomes more depressing as Yuki Tsunoda goes from 16th to 19th. A win for Max Verstappen would take his career tally to 41. That would put him level with the Brazilian great Ayrton Senna. The flying Dutchman has needed a few more starts to get there \u2013 Senna needed 162 for his haul while this is Verstappen\u2019s 172nd race \u2013 but that would be some feat for the 25-year-old double world champion. He\u2019s got plenty left in the tank and will soon be hunting other titans of the sport. Alain Prost (51), Sebastian Vettel (53), Michael Schumacher (91) and Lewis Hamilton (103) will have Verstappen in their rearview mirrors eventually. Hello and welcome to Max Verstappen\u2019s victory parade in Montreal. Er, I mean the Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. But really, what\u2019s the difference? Formula 1 is a complicated sport, one with so many moving parts and technological innovations that it can be hard keeping track of what\u2019s what. But things get real simple when you stick an elite driver in a car that is streets ahead of the pack. Red Bull have been unstoppable this campaign. Verstappen has won five races so far (including three on the bounce) with his teammate Sergio Perez claiming the other two. The reigning world champion begins on pole \u2013 the 25th of his career \u2013 after beating out Niko Hulkenberg and Fernando Alonso in the lashing rain. Though Hulkenberg was one of four drivers slapped with a grid penalty and will instead start in fifth. Lewis Hamilton edged his Mercedes teammate, George Russell, to fourth \u2013 but will start third \u2013 while it was another tough day for the Ferraris. Carlos Sainz placed eighth but has been shunted back down to 11th after impeding Alpine\u2019s Pierre Gasly. We\u2019re not expecting much rain today but the famous Wall of Champions \u2013 a feature that makes this one of my favourite tracks on the calendar \u2013 will still pose problems for any driver who strays off his line. The smart money is on Verstappen getting to the first corner and staying in front for the rest of the race. But perhaps this is the day he finally puts a foot wrong. My name is Daniel and I\u2019m excited be serve as your safety car for this one. If you want to share something with the group then please do get in touch."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94777", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/18/canadian-f1-grand-prix-race-report", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Max Verstappen wins Canadian Grand Prix to secure Red Bull\u2019s 100th victory", "lead": "Verstappen equalled Ayrton Senna\u2019s 41 career race wins in a race where Fernando Alonso was second and Lewis Hamilton third", "author": "Giles Richards", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 20:05:21", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548948", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/15af6e6da442fe2abc74709ade06db0d9083c650/0_46_4562_2738/500.jpg", "body": "Untouchable and unchallenged, there is now a distinct sense of deja vu to Max Verstappen\u2019s victorious -performances this season, -exemplified once more by a flawless win at the Canadian Grand Prix. It was another consummate run and a personal milestone in matching Ayrton Senna\u2019s 41 race wins also marked an immense achievement by his Red Bull team in notching up a century of wins in style in Montreal. The debate over whether the Dutchman can be caught this season is over but he and Red Bull are surely set to clock up even bigger numbers. Behind him Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso enjoyed a decent scrap at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, with the Spaniard coming out on top in second for Aston and Hamilton third for Mercedes. It was something of a return to form for Aston Martin while Mercedes will once more be buoyed that their car was in the mix, as they had been at the last round in Spain. Mercedes had thought they may struggle in the slow corners in Canada, that they were up there will be hugely heartening for them in that their new upgrades have genuinely delivered an improvement across a range of tracks. They were very much in a battle of their own however, at the business end Verstappen was in a class of one. With his teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez managing only sixth the Dutchman now leads the world championship by 69 points after eight rounds. Indeed that Red Bull remains unbeaten this season is largely down to Verstappen who has taken six wins from eight. Mercedes and Aston Martin do appear to be moving closer but equally it must be considered that Verstappen is opening a comfortable gap \u2013 nine seconds from Alonso at the flag \u2013 and then merely maintaining it, not needing to flog his ride unnecessarily. It is impossible to ignore that he is now winning with absolutely disarming ease. Mad Max, the tempestuous, over-eager, charging youngster that roared up to F1 eight years ago is long gone. Now he is rather a diligent pupil, calmly, methodically delivering straight A\u2019s, week-in, week-out without seemingly having to try while behind him unruly, infuriated classmates hoot and holler of their dog and its homework munching predilection to no effect. Such was his dominance his interactions with other drivers were few and far between, only the local wildlife giving him any cause for concern as he reported he had been hit by a bird early in the race. So in control was he, the unlucky avian may have delivered a frisson of excitement to an otherwise uneventful day in the office. His radio messages to the team punctuations as much to express how much he was enjoying himself as anything else, riding kerbs and giggling about it to the team an ominous indication of the ease of his domination. There was great merit for the world champion in matching Senna but the more striking accomplishment to be acknowledged was that of his team. The victory is Red Bull\u2019s 100th; a remarkable milestone for the team which only joined F1 in 2005, taking over an ailing Jaguar team. In the relatively short time since they have developed into one of the biggest and most successful players in the sport. They took their first victory in China in 2009 and now only Williams, Mercedes, McLaren and Ferrari have more, while they have also taken six drivers\u2019 titles and five constructors\u2019, a tally that will certainly be added to this season. To have achieved so much, developing in size to compete at the very top and with aggressive scale to include now building their own engines, is a feat that should not be understated. Team principal Christian Horner was the youngest in the sport, aged 31, when he took on the role but has never shied away from grand ambition, not least in going after and securing designer Adrian Newey whose cars have been key to the success and who joined Verstappen on the podium in Canada. Derided in the past as a mere \u201cenergy drink manufacturer\u201d the team have laughed off such insults, instead playing up to their maverick image, racing hard and partying harder and stressing their irreverent and unconventional approach. It is a PR line that fits the brand, but a simplistic and erroneous summation of their prowess. As demonstrated again in Montreal, their abilities as a racing team have been exceptional, well-honed operationally with a professionalism that belies the public image. They are delivering in the factory and on track at a level older manufacturers recognise as the very top of the game and would dearly like to emulate. The race itself, as was the last in Spain, was decided at the first corner as Verstappen held his lead from pole. Hamilton had burst out of the blocks to pass Alonso for second place but while Alonso stayed with him, in front Verstappen was gone within a short six laps, two seconds clear with insouciant ease. Alonso passed back on lap 22 and in clean air the Aston had an advantage, opening a gap he held to the flag albeit way off a serene Verstappen. It was decent fare for Mercedes and Aston but they remain understudies this season however, as more victories are sure to follow for Red Bull and Verstappen and a clean sweep of wins remains within their remit. It is a feat no other team has ever accomplished to sit alongside what has been a meteoric ascent over the past 18 years. Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were in fourth and fifth for Ferrari, Alex Albon an excellent seventh for Williams, Esteban Ocon eighth for Alpine, Lance Stroll in ninth for Aston Martin and Valtteri Bottas in 10th for Alfa Romeo."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94778", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/18/england-and-bazball-are-here-to-save-test-cricket-maybe-australia-can-too-ashes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England and Bazball are here to save Test cricket.

We\u2019re here to save Test cricket. Dream bigger. Nothing is out of reach. Also, \u201cfuck off you fucking prick\u201d. The paradoxes of Bazball are already manifest, and indeed a huge part of the fun. Here we have the game of reinvention, where the only rule is to break all the rules. Play like it doesn\u2019t matter if you win or lose, because that\u2019s the best way to win. Dance like nobody\u2019s watching so everyone can see what a great dancer you are. Is this still maverick thinking? Probably. It is, at the very least, an utterly engrossing spectacle. As it was once again on a rain-shadowed third day at Edgbaston, midway through what is already an epic-scale Test. England and Australia managed a session and a bit here, on a day when another paradox presented itself. England are here to save Test cricket. In their own version of this story England are only ever the heroes. But what if they\u2019re not? One element missing so far from these Ashes is a genuine collision of old and new. What we haven\u2019t had yet is some proper needle. And make no mistake, Australia are desperate to beat this Bazball England. To the extent that a beating may not be enough. Maybe only a crushing will do. It is the only logical response to this thing, which feels from the outside like another version of the defining quality of most English sports teams, English exceptionalism, English self-mythology. \u201cEngland are pricks to lose to,\u201d Andrew Mehrtens famously pointed out, and English people have proved his point ever since by taking it as a compliment. In the Stokes era England\u2019s cricketers have found an even more annoying way to win. Now the English are trying to be the good guys. Not dry or cold. But fun and fiery and full of wonder. Imagine being told you\u2019re too uptight by the England cricket captain. There they are, those starchy scions of Jardine, out there having more fun than you, lounging insolently on sofas, undermining your foundational seriousness in a bucket hat. Another paradox: Bazball is modern and disruptive. But Bazball is also a very vivid recreation of the oldest kind of Englishness: the amateur spirit, the idea of effortless superiority, of aristo energy against the professionals, taking a bat out of the Lord\u2019s museum and scoring a hundred. Imagine losing to this. Not that Australia\u2019s current team are particularly old school. There are plenty of more stentorian voices back home who would see this iteration as soft or woke: climate change believers, betrayers of JL, too novel, too relatable, too nice, too Pat-ball. Still, though. You can only push it so far. \u201cOur vision as a team is far greater than just results,\u201d Paul Collingwood could be heard telling the press conference room on Saturday night, before moving on to England\u2019s wider mission to save Test cricket by making it more entertaining than you, the current world champions, have been able to manage. At some point this kind of stuff is going to become a provocation. There was a sense of phoney war in the first innings as Australia adjusted their fields and accommodated England\u2019s aggression. But on a third day sawn off at the midpoint there was still time for two wonderful passages of play that brought that basic tension a little closer to the surface. First England skittled Australia\u2019s lower order, taking four for 14 in 21 balls before lunch. It was a sequence begun by some blue-sky thinking from Ben Stokes; and also by Ollie Robinson telling the bloke who brought his daughter into the press conference on Saturday night that he\u2019s a fucking prick who should fuck off. Usman Khawaja was still at the crease on 141. Australia were 372 for six with thoughts of a significant lead. So England went with the U9s umbrella field, the kind of field that was banned a couple of years back by the Surrey county age groups, with an insistence teams must have proper fielders so the game looks proper. Well, here\u2019s the Ben Stokes and he says it\u2019s fine. England placed six fielders close in front of the wicket, crouched like matching inverted slip cordons. Robinson bowled an off-stump yorker. Khawaja reached, got an inside edge and sent his leg stump flying, drawing wild cheers and also that surprisingly pointless send-off (Khawaja is, on a point of fact, not a prick). But it was a brilliant moment, made just a little more real by something strangely, shamefully authentic in the middle of all this free jazz. Nathan Lyon was bounced out soon after playing his last remaining shot, the hook for six. Scott Boland was confronted with a very short silly mid-on and silly mid-off, taking guard like a pagan god worshipped by men in blue helmets. He prodded the ball straight up in the air. Pat Cummins was slow-bounced out by Robinson. It felt like a brilliant half-hour of captaincy, four wickets taken with innovative plans. At the same time it involved getting Lyon, Boland and Cummins out, rabbit pie Bazball. These are the paradoxes. It seems fair to err on the side of brilliance. It is easy to underestimate how exhausting it must be producing constant energy and field changes. Stokes basically did six hours of T20 captaincy on Saturday. To still have that freshness at the end of the next morning was highly impressive. There was more spice when England came out to bat. Australia bowled with real vim and dismissed both openers. There was whooping, loud appeals, aggression close in. No singles were offered. Words were exchanged. This felt, finally, like a front-on collision, one that might only reveal itself fully whenever Robinson next comes out to bat. Perhaps Australia can save Test cricket, too. Welcome, chaps, to the cause."}, {"_id": "649099f751ac331455c94779", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/18/australia-cloud-englands-mood-after-seeing-their-own-tail-washed-away", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia cloud England\u2019s mood after seeing their own tail washed away | Geoff Lemon", "lead": "Rain cut day three of the first Ashes Test short but it was the heavy skies that brought it that put paid to England\u2019s openers", "author": "Geoff Lemon at Edgbaston", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 19:24:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-19 20:09:59.548995", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/35a6c1972d96128016872128fc72c25473d40d6e/0_117_5030_3019/500.jpg", "body": "You learn as you go that cricket in England has moods. Like some figure from myth whose face changes with angle and light. The first day of the Edgbaston Ashes Test was one mood, the bucolic English summery kind that justifies the work of pastoral poets. On the second, jaunty scoring gave way to a half-overcast grind under high cloud. The third, after England had bowled to a seven\u2011run lead, a sudden darker mood flashed at the home side in a window before rain. Rain, cloud, darkness. Few sports make you think so much about light. All countries have sun, but there is a hard clear sunshine that only derives from an Australian summer, streams of photons hurtling on their long trip through space and smashing into cricket fields, bouncing back with such force that you\u2019d swear you can hear them ping like stones off glass. Turn on a television anywhere in the world and see Australia\u2019s summer, so bright it washes out the blue of sky and green of grass into variations of white. By contrast, England\u2019s proprietorial light is defined by absence. All countries have cloud, too, but when the massed ranks of grey bunch overhead like wet wool blankets, the product of a deluged military ration store, it\u2019s something else. See that on your television and you equally vividly know where you are. An attritional fight at a storied ground. In person, the elements are even more visceral, clouds heaving into vacant airspace like invading spaceships. Nowhere has that dimness, that dankness, while players blink and strain their eyes trying to pick up hints of dark red leather. One of cricket\u2019s accepted truths is that cloud creates swing. A report in 2000 from Nasa\u2019s experimental physics branch into cricket ball aerodynamics found no plausible reason that this should be the case. Maybe there is a factor that we haven\u2019t determined, maybe it\u2019s a collective delusion. And yet, from basic observation, players find it far more difficult to bat in those conditions. Perhaps the light is what really makes it so. Through a Test, moods make moments. Australia had one go decisively their way. After bowling 6.5 overs in which England scored comfortably, rain took them off for an hour and a half. When they returned in genuine gloom, it was for 22 deliveries before more rain. That included the wickets of both England openers, ending the day with the score on 28. It was a bonus for Australia, who earlier had let slip their grasp on the match. Usman Khawaja and Alex Carey had done superbly the previous day from five wickets down to get Australia\u2019s score into the same postcode as England\u2019s 393. When they resumed on the third morning, on 126 and 52 respectively, the chance was there to wipe off the remaining 82-run deficit and use the lower order to build some sort of lead. Instead, Carey was dropped in the first over of the day, nicked another ball for four, smacked two boundaries, then lost his stumps to Jimmy Anderson. Khawaja looked in supreme control but barely scored, adding 15 runs in nearly two hours, letting Pat Cummins outpace him by a distance. A ball good enough is inevitable eventually, and by the time Khawaja was bowled by Ollie Robinson, he hadn\u2019t moved the score along. Nathan Lyon loves to say that he can\u2019t bat, but that isn\u2019t really true, so his effort reached new levels of daftness. Six men out for the hook, six balls faced, five of them short, five pull shots, two hitting the body, one missing the ball, one top-edged safely to a gap, one into the hands of deep square leg. It was a surrender as cavalier as any Ben Stokes innovation. Scott Boland could not handle the short stuff more than a minute, and Cummins after a good 38 didn\u2019t trust Josh Hazlewood enough to resist trying to reach 44 in one hit. From looking at a lead, Australia\u2019s last four wickets fell for 14, and a long tail was exposed. Where Tests can turn on moments, England\u2019s current Stokes-McCullum method is about trying to create them. They did so with the reverse umbrella field to Khawaja that made him look to score through point, opening Robinson\u2019s path to the stumps. That let them wrap up the rest. That early finish though gave Australia their own moment. Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley ended up where they did not want to be. Cummins found his most dangerous line and length, and as a player who is remarked upon for never leaving the ball, Duckett was out once again playing what he didn\u2019t need to. Another Cameron Green stunner in the gully had no one questioning the replay. Crawley three balls later got a Boland special, that minuscule movement away from the right-hander from a hard length, a line he had to play, bat half behind pad but ball tapping edge on the way by. A few dicey shots from Joe Root later, and the day was done before 4pm. With two more days to go, it\u2019s a question of what sort of moods will strike, and when."}]
