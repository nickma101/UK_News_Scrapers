The move is the latest in a growing political spat between Abbott and the Biden administration, heightened by Republican attempts to scaremonger over immigration as the 2024 presidential election looms. The lawsuit filed by the federal government asks a court in Texas to force the state to remove the roughly 1,000ft line of bright orange, wrecking ball-sized buoys the Biden administration says raises humanitarian and environmental concerns. The suit also says Texas unlawfully installed the barrier without permission, near the border city of Eagle Pass. The suit was filed on Monday, after Abbott refused to comply with instructions to remove the barrier. \u201cTexas will fully utilise its constitutional authority to deal with the crisis you have caused,\u201d Greg Abbott wrote to Joe Biden in a letter reported by CNN and other outlets. \u201cTexas will see you in court, Mr President.\u201d It was the latest confrontational move by a governor who for more than two years has escalated measures to stop migrants entering the US, pushing legal boundaries along the 1,200-mile border with Mexico. Blowback over the tactics is widening, including from within Texas and particularly in light of a state trooper\u2019s account of razor wire leaving asylum seekers bloodied and officers denying migrants water in 100F (37.7C) heat and being told to push children into the river. Last week, the US justice department told Texas to remove the river barriers, citing federal laws against obstructing waterways and imposing a Monday deadline. On Monday, Abbott said that in refusing to comply, he was \u201cassert[ing] Texas\u2019s sovereign interest in protecting [its] borders\u201d in his role as the \u201ccommander-in-chief of [the] state\u2019s militia\u201d. Repeating a common Republican talking point, the governor also wrote to Biden: \u201cIf you truly care about human life, you must begin enforcing federal immigration laws. By doing so, you can help me stop migrants from wagering their lives in the waters of the Rio Grande.\u201d Saying migrants could attempt to use legitimate ports of entry, Abbott said: \u201cWhile I share the humanitarian concerns noted in your lawyers\u2019 letter, Mr President, your finger points in the wrong direction. Neither of us wants to see another death in the Rio Grande \u2026 Yet your open-border policies encourage migrants to risk their lives by crossing illegally through the water, instead of safely and legally at a port of entry. Nobody drowns on a bridge.\u201d A White House spokesperson said Abbott\u2019s behavior was \u201c making it hard for the men and women of border patrol to do their jobs of securing the border and putting both migrants and border agents in danger\u201d. Biden\u2019s border enforcement plan, the spokesperson added, had \u201cled to the lowest levels of unlawful border crossings in over two years. Governor Abbott\u2019s dangerous and unlawful actions are undermining that effective plan. \u201cIf Governor Abbott truly wanted to drive toward real solutions, he\u2019d be asking his Republican colleagues in Congress why they voted against President Biden\u2019s request to increase funding for the Department of Homeland Security and why they\u2019re blocking the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures that would finally fix our broken immigration system.\u201d The White House also said Republicans \u201chave no plan and are just playing political games\u201d. Criticism of Abbott is growing within his own state. Speaking to the Associated Press, David Donatti, an attorney for the Texas American Civil Liberties Union, said: \u201cThere are so many ways that what Texas is doing right now is just flagrantly illegal.\u201d Aron Thorn, a Texas Civil Rights Project attorney, described \u201ca very strong correlation\u201d between Abbott\u2019s border policy and \u201cthe Trump and post-Trump era in which most of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy was aggressive and extreme and very violative of people\u2019s rights and very focused on making the political point. \u201cThe design of this is the optics and the amount of things that they sacrifice for those optics now is quite extraordinary.\u201d In Eagle Pass, Jessie Fuentes, a kayaker, has filed his own lawsuit over work done on the river. On Monday that suit, Epi\u2019s Canoe &amp; Kayak Team v State of Texas, was cited in the suit filed by the federal government. Citing measures including floating barriers and shipping containers and razor wire placed along riverbanks cleared of vegetation, Fuentes recently told the Eagle Pass city council: \u201cThe river is a federally protected river by so many federal agencies, and I just don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d A member of the Eagles Pass council, Elias Diaz, told the AP: \u201cI feel like the state government has kind of bypassed local government \u2026 and so I felt powerless at times.\u201d Hugo Urbina, a farmer whose land abuts the river, said he supported efforts to reduce border crossings via the Rio Grande. But Urbina said Abbott and his administration \u201cdo whatever it is that they want \u2026 breaking the law and \u2026 making your citizens feel like they\u2019re second-hand citizens\u201d. The Texas land office has said it will permit \u201cvegetation management\u201d on the banks of the river as part of anti-migration efforts. The state military department has cleared out carrizo cane, which the land office has called an invasive plant. Environmental experts are concerned changes to the landscape will affect the flow of the river. Tom Vaughan, co-founder of the Rio Grande International Study Center, said: \u201cAs far as I know, if there\u2019s flooding in the river, it\u2019s much more severe in Piedras Negras\u201d \u2013 on the Mexican side \u2013 \u201cthan it is in Eagle Pass because that\u2019s the lower side of the river. \u201cAnd so next time the river really gets up, it\u2019s going to push a lot of water over on the Mexican side, it looks like to me.\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604daf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/dreaming-whilst-black-review-this-bafta-winning-show-is-ripping-up-the-rules-of-comedy", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dreaming Whilst Black review \u2013 this Bafta-winning show is ripping up the rules of comedy", "lead": "This hilarious, inventive sitcom about a Black film-maker struggling to make it feels totally new.

You sit down on a Sunday night to a big BBC period drama and know, roughly, the notes that it is going to hit. But occasionally a show like Dreaming Whilst Black comes along and quietly rips up the formula, finding a new path that feels fresh, exciting and very much its own. The series, co-created by and starring Adjani Salmon, emerges from the foundations of first a web series and then a Bafta-winning pilot. Salmon is Kwabena, an aspiring film-maker from a Jamaican family who is working in recruitment while dreaming of one day making it as a writer and director. Over six episodes, he navigates his way through various opportunities, funding schemes and mentoring programmes, while also trying to earn a living and pay rent. I find that the idea of art about art rarely appeals. Films about making films, or TV about making TV, or even songs about how hard it is to be a musician on the road etc can lack imaginative reach. But Dreaming Whilst Black makes it work, cleverly and casually. Kwabena is an outsider, because he is Black and also not wealthy. In trying to break into an industry stuffed with rich, white, middle-to-upper class people \u2013 a pretty accurate depiction of the TV world, in my experience \u2013 he has to work out what to sacrifice and what compromises to make. It\u2019s hard to drop everything for a sudden meeting when you have a day job to go to, for example, and it\u2019s hard to pay the rent when you don\u2019t go to your day job because you dropped everything for a sudden meeting. There are more philosophical questions, about what it means to \u201csell out\u201d, both as an individual and as part of a family and community. What is fair game for storytelling, and how much should this be tailored to an audience that might not appreciate it in its intended form? If this makes it sound dry, it\u2019s far more imaginative than that and funnier, and it is never self-indulgent. Kwabena is prone to daydreaming, and some scenes turn out to be figments of his imagination. It\u2019s not always clear which moments are real and which are things Kwabena wishes he had said or done, and this subtly wobbles the floor beneath it. There are surreal touches \u2013 a talking baby, a brief animated public information film, conversations between alter egos \u2013 which make it lively. The production company A24, behind Uncut Gems, Everything Everywhere All At Once and Midsommar, is on board as a partner, which makes complete sense when you see it. As a protagonist, Kwabena can be frustrating, deliberately so. His daydreams are of a more assertive man for whom things go well; things rarely work out for him in his ordinary life, right down to a bird doing its business on his lucky shirt. But it digs deep into his inner conflict, and towards the end of the series, places him in an intriguing moral bind: what will it cost him to play the game? The rest of the cast is strong and the supporting characters just as fully realised, particularly his best friend, Amy, (Dani Moseley), recently back from working in Lagos and up against the horrors of a UK production company who treat her as \u201cthe only black in the village\u201d, only asking her opinion as a \u201cperson of colour\u201d and promoting less experienced colleagues above her. Babirye Bukilwa is Kwabena\u2019s love interest, Vanessa, which adds a neat layer of romance to a series in which a romantic film is one of Kwabena\u2019s pitches, written off as not commercial enough. Dreaming Whilst Black is also very funny, though its humour is of the more excruciating variety. It might contain one of the most painful depictions of karaoke yet seen on screen. There is a pleasing stream of comedy cameos, from Jessica Hynes to Isy Suttie to Peter Serafinowicz. The first episode is the most straightforward, as it sets everything up, but the show gets more inventive and more imaginative as it goes along. While it is about Kwabena following his dreams to become a film-maker, it\u2019s about much more. It deals with family, ambition, money, being a good father, creativity, inspiration, love, class, race and identity. In a later episode, Kwabena daydreams a version of himself ranting about the kind of films that get made, the formulaic ones, the ones in which Britain defeats the Nazis over and over again. What Dreaming Whilst Black has done is write its own formula. I hope there\u2019s another series, and soon. \u2022 Dreaming Whilst Black is on BBC iPlayer"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604db0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/katarina-johnson-thompson-sets-sights-on-world-medal-then-olympic-gold", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Katarina Johnson-Thompson sets sights on world medal then Olympic gold", "lead": "British heptathlete was optimistic about her chances of a medal in Budapest after leaping to 6.60m in the long jump at the London Stadium", "author": "Ben Bloom", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 21:30:21", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.677655", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8655b531dc3ad10367a7c928bf9494261f99118f/0_224_6279_3767/500.jpg", "body": "With confidence growing and a smile becoming an increasingly regular presence, Katarina Johnson-Thompson believes the good times are back \u2013 and she intends to prove it by winning a world medal next month. The former world heptathlon champion has endured frequent misery in recent years since when winning a first global title in 2019. The pandemic robbed her of the chance of a quick follow-up at the Olympics before she sustained a serious achilles rupture at the end of 2020. Johnson-Thompson then failed to finish at the delayed Tokyo Games and aborted a new life in the US after just five months. Now settled back in Britain, the 30-year-old showed the fruits of her labours when leaping to a confidence-boosting best of 6.60m in the long jump at the London Stadium\u2019s Diamond League meeting on Sunday. Next up are the world championships in Budapest, where Johnson-Thompson hopes to make the podium ahead of an assault on gold at the Paris Olympics. \u201cI\u2019d just like to win a medal [in Budapest],\u201d she said. \u201cA medal is a great stepping stone from where I was last year and where I want to be next year. \u201cFor sure I want to be back to my best for the Olympics. I had a big dip in Covid year and achilles rupture year. Then there was last year. It\u2019s been going down, my performances have been dipping. But I feel like towards the end of last year and the start of this year I\u2019m slowly kicking back up, so hopefully Budapest can be a step in the right direction.\u201d Johnson-Thompson\u2019s 6.60m effort on Sunday was a huge 23cm further than she has managed since rupturing the achilles on her take-off foot. It also came despite many months of gruelling work in training under her new coach, Aston Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging,\u201d Johnson-Thompson said. \u201cThe long jump is one of the hardest things that I\u2019ve had to do post-achilles rupture so I\u2019m really, really encouraged to see 6.60m on the board. I\u2019ve been really tired for months and months now, just asking [Moore]: \u2018When\u2019s the taper?\u2019 And he\u2019s just not giving it to me. \u201cI\u2019ve had two days off this week for the first time in God knows how long and this [long jump] was a little glimmer of hopefully what I can do with fresh legs.

Addressing the upper chamber, Richard Denison hypothesised that AI services may soon be able to deliver his speeches in his own style and voice, \u201cwith no hesitation, repetition or deviation\u201d. He quoted the example to raise the wider issue of AI\u2019s potential effect on the UK jobs market. In May, IBM put the brakes on nearly 7,800 jobs that could be replaced by AI and automation over time, shortly before BT announced it would cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030, about 10,000 of which were predicted to be replaced by AI. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the jobs most likely to be affected by the impending \u201cAI revolution\u201d were in \u201chighly skilled\u201d professions such as law, medicine and finance. \u201cIs it an exciting or alarming prospect that your lordships might one day be replaced by peer bots with deeper knowledge, higher productivity and lower running costs?\u201d the independent crossbencher asked. \u201cYet this is the prospect for perhaps as many as 5 million workers in the UK over the next 10 years. \u201cI was briefly tempted to outsource my AI speech to a chatbot and to see if anybody noticed. I did in fact test out two large language models. In seconds, both delivered 500-word speeches which were credible, if somewhat generic.\u201d The crossbench peer Charles Colville, a freelance television producer, said that he had asked the AI programme ChatGPT to write a speech for him on the threat that AI poses to journalism. He said one of the paragraphs stated: \u201cAI, in its tireless efficiency, threatens to overshadow human journalism. News articles can be automated and editorials composed without a single thought, a single beating heart behind the words. \u201cMy fear is, we will descend into a landscape where news is stripped of the very human elements that make it relatable, understandable and ultimately impactful.\u201d He added: \u201cThe new AI technology is further exacerbating this financial threat to the whole industry; AI-generating companies able to scrape for free the information from news websites, which are already facing increasing costs of creating original journalistic content.\u201d Other peers noted additional potential threats, spanning bias and discrimination, privacy and security issues, and advised that humanity move forward with caution. The AI minister, Jonathan Berry, said: \u201cThese advances bring great opportunities, from improving diagnostics and healthcare to tackling climate change, but they also bring serious challenges, such as the threat of fraud and disinformation created by deepfakes. \u201cWe note the stark warnings from AI pioneers, however uncertain they may be about artificial general intelligence and AI biosecurity risks.

The news was another blow to Donald Trump, who last week caused a sensation when he said Smith had in a letter told him he was a target in the investigation, likely to face criminal charges. Smith and his team have been investigating the former president\u2019s role in the events of the January 6 insurrection. In early 2020, Trump pardoned Kerik for crimes including tax fraud and lying to investigators, for which Kerik had been sentenced to four years in jail. Later that year, Kerik worked with Giuliani on attempts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory, a push which culminated in the failed but deadly January 6 attack on Congress. Kerik long sought to withhold documents from investigators, citing privilege issues. But on Monday, Parlatore said Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign had reviewed the documents and cleared them for release to Smith. Kerik is set to be interviewed by the special counsel\u2019s office in August. Trump already faces 71 criminal charges: 34 in New York, over hush money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels, and 37 in the federal investigation of Trump\u2019s retention of classified records, an investigation also run by Smith. The former president was also ordered to pay around $5m to the writer E Jean Carroll, after being found liable for sexual abuse and defamation.

But the White House limited its criticism to calling the outcome \u201cunfortunate\u201d in a sign that the Biden administration is unlikely to impose any real costs on Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government for defying the president\u2019s calls to delay the vote and reach a compromise with his opponents. After seven months of fierce debate, the Israeli government on Monday voted to limit the court\u2019s ability to overturn laws and give politicians more control over judicial appointments. The changes have been denounced by critics as a transparent power grab that will erode democratic norms and aid Netanyahu\u2019s fight against graft charges, which he denies. Others have warned that the legislation is a step toward the desire of the ultranationalists in Netanyahu\u2019s government to annex some or all of the occupied territories. The American Jewish Committee, one of the oldest pro-Israel groups in the US, expressed \u201cprofound disappointment\u201d at the vote and said it is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d that it will deepen divisions in Israeli society amid huge demonstrations against the law, including in the military with thousands of military reservists threatening to refuse to report for duty. \u201cThe continued effort to press forward on judicial reform rather than seeking compromise has sown discord within the Israeli Defense Forces at a time of elevated threats to the Jewish homeland and has strained the vital relationship between Israel and diaspora Jewry,\u201d it said. The Israel Policy Forum, founded three decades ago to give support in the US to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, said it was \u201cdismayed\u201d at the vote and warned that it \u201cwill be damaging to Israeli democracy, Israel\u2019s international standing, the US-Israel alliance, and the relationship between Israel and American Jews\u201d. The New Israel Fund called it a \u201cdark day in the history of the state of Israel and the Jewish people\u201d. Some members of congress joined in the criticism. Representative Jerry Nadler, former chair of the House judiciary committee, condemned Netanyahu and \u201chis extremist coalition\u201d, calling the vote \u201ca dark day for Israeli democracy\u201d. In contrast, the Biden administration issued a brief statement that avoided direct criticism. \u201cAs a lifelong friend of Israel, President Biden has publicly and privately expressed his views that major changes in a democracy to be enduring must have as broad a consensus as possible. It is unfortunate that the vote today took place with the slimmest possible majority,\u201d it said. The \u201cpro-Israel, pro-peace\u201d group J Street pressed for the White House and Congress to go further. \u201cWhile the Netanyahu government fundamentally alters Israel\u2019s democratic character and plows ahead toward a more authoritarian and ethno-nationalist future, \u2018business as usual\u2019 from Congress and the White House is a recipe for terrible failure,\u201d it said. Debra Shushan, the group\u2019s director of policy, said Biden made \u201cimportant personal interventions\u201d in pressing Netanyahu to delay the vote but needs to take a firmer stand. \u201cWith the Israeli government crossing bright red lines, and advancing anti-democratic transformation in Israel, we need serious action from the administration. No more business as usual, and obviously something that goes beyond a comment about this being unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have Israeli protesters taking very strong actions in the street. A much stronger statement by the Biden administration would be very important for them. That\u2019s how the administration can show true support, significant support, for Israeli democracy and those who are fighting to uphold it.\u201d Shushan said Biden should make it clear to Netanyahu that he won\u2019t be invited to the White House while his government is taking actions that undermine Israeli democracy. Aaron David Miller, a US Middle East peace negotiator during several administrations, said he expects Biden to avoid a \u201cmessy, distracting and potentially politically costly\u201d public fight with Netanyahu. \u201cThere is nothing that I\u2019ve seen in eight months to back up the fact that this president will impose any real costs and consequences on Israel, certainly not over the judicial issue. In response to what is an annexation policy in everything but name, where are the costs and the consequences?\u201d he said. Miller said there is also domestic politics to consider. \u201cJoe Biden cannot do anything to undermine his capacity to deal with the most important major challenge that he faces \u2013 preventing the re-election of Donald Trump. The Republican party\u2019s emerged as the Israel-right-or-wrong party. Biden does not want to get caught between that and his own party, which is divided between progressives and mainstream Democrats who are very supportive still of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that would push them is if you ended up with a situation in the West Bank that was qualitatively and quantitatively beyond anything we\u2019ve seen. A major conflict which involves the disproportionate use of Israeli force and large numbers of Palestinian civilians are killed.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604db5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/australia-coach-mcdonald-denies-his-side-were-saved-by-the-rain-in-ashes", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australia coach McDonald denies his side were saved by the rain in Ashes", "lead": "The Australia head coach denied that his side were saved by rain at Old Trafford, saying: \u2018\u2018We still had batters to come.

As for the assumption that the weather had robbed England of a 2-2 scoreline before the fifth Test, McDonald says otherwise, with his team 60 runs behind with five wickets in hand. \u201cWe still had some batters to come. We could have shifted some pressure. So it feels as though we sit here and [say] it was a foregone conclusion that England were going to win the game \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that and that change room upstairs doesn\u2019t believe that.\u201d McDonald was frank, however, about how badly his team got outplayed across the match until that rain intervened. \u201cIt was a disappointing three days or so. We\u2019re not gonna shy away from that and we own that,\u201d he said. \u201cEngland put immense pressure on us. There\u2019s no doubt about that. I thought the surface on day one gave us an opportunity to put a few more runs on the board and when you sort of get behind a little bit, that can compound on you and I thought the way that Zak [Crawley] came out and put pressure on us, you\u2019ve got to give some credit to the opposition as well.\u201d More to the point was why that pressure became so effective, as Australia\u2019s bowling faded after Crawley initially rode his luck before an innings of 189 flourished, paving the way for a batting blitz through the order. \u201cBoth teams have probably had errors at critical times. It\u2019s hard to put your finger on that in a highly pressurised environment,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI think that pressure does bring out errors and dysfunction within the game and it\u2019s how you recover from those moments. We feel as though the first couple of Tests we were able to recover.\u201d Recovering will be the key from here, with a couple of days before the fifth Test that will decide whether Australia can attain a long-awaited series win in England. Team balance is a hot topic, after Australia played no spinner at Old Trafford and had no options when the seamers were hit around. Of those bowlers, Mitchell Marsh and Mitchell Starc have fitness issues and the captain, Pat Cummins, looked frazzled in the field after playing five Tests since the start of June. \u201cWe\u2019re all working on the Australian cricket team together, and it should never really come down to Pat as an individual, but unfortunately as a captain, sometimes you wear that,\u201d McDonald said of the criticism about tactics and approach that came Cummins\u2019s way after Old Trafford."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604db6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/barbie-oppenheimer-movie-release-box-office-ticket-sales", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Barbenheimer bonanza: how two films saved the summer box office", "lead": "Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan\u2019s vastly different summer offerings have opened to record-breaking numbers at a precarious time for the industry", "author": "Benjamin Lee", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 20:07:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.677800", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6b99320be29be989f42d3c8cbeaaaa5cc1c10c0d/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "The past weekend wasn\u2019t the first time that two major films had been released simultaneously but the big screen blitz of Barbie and Oppenheimer saw the first time audiences saw it less as a competition and more of a collaboration. Months ago, Barbie v Oppenheimer had been widely discarded for the cosier, Bennifer-adjacent Barbenheimer, the bomb-maker and the bombshell hand-in-hand, fans planning to watch them both rather than just one, an unprecedented event that had exhibitors and studios both geared up for a much-needed win. But even the most ambitious box office analysts couldn\u2019t have predicted just what a win that was going to be, the higher end of estimates now looking positively conservative, the two films combining to shatter records and create a genuine, online-to-offline pop culture phenomenon. Greta Gerwig\u2019s gently satirical Mattel comedy was the inevitable No 1 but with a weekend haul of $162m in the US, it also became the year\u2019s biggest opener to date as well as the highest-ever opening for a female director. Just as surprisingly, Christopher Nolan\u2019s dark period drama managed an $82m second place win, a staggering amount for something of that ilk, a talky, 3-hour awards movie treated by audiences like a superhero epic. Globally, the picture was similarly rosy, the two films combining to bring in over $500m between them, a much-needed boost to what had been a mostly troubling summer at the box office. While audiences had turned out en masse for superhero sequels Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 (although neither film has reached the magic $1bn global mark), they\u2019d mostly stayed away from other tentpole offerings. DC\u2019s beleaguered comic book mash-up The Flash sputtered out as the biggest superhero bomb of all time, set to lose $200m. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny looked unlikely to prove profitable thanks to an exorbitant $300m budget and a worldwide gross not that much higher. Tom Cruise\u2019s ultra-expensive Mission: Impossible sequel opened beneath projections and thanks to Barbenheimer, suffered a catastrophic second week drop. Animated adventures Elemental and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, came in way below expectations. Comedies such as Book Club: The Next Chapter, Joy Ride, The Blackening, The Machine and About My Father tanked in wide release. Before this weekend, ticket sales had been down 20% in comparison to the same point in 2019. The industry has still been in recovery from the darkest days of the pandemic when cinemas were shuttered or re-opened with caveats or shuttered again, forcing confused or concerned audiences to stay at home and the studios to reconfigure release strategies. The shortening of the window from theatrical to home viewing, at times reduced to nothing with day-and-date releases available on both big and small screen, has for many made the cinema seem like an unnecessary and overpriced relic of the past, helped by streamers such as Netflix and Amazon releasing blockbuster-sized movies with stars to match straight-to-smartphone. The great disruptors as they were once known have became the great destructors, the subscription model unable to ever prove quite as profitable as the model it was aiming to replace. But even in a year when the box office might be down, there were signs that it wasn\u2019t out. Oscar films such as The Fabelmans, Tar and Women Talking might have stumbled during the dying months of 2022 but 2023 kicked off with B-movie hits like M3gan and Cocaine Bear, luring audiences out with the promise of freakish sights unseen, like a carnival coming into town. There was more good news with acclaimed sequels to Creed, Scream and John Wick all bringing in franchise bests before The Super Mario Bros Movie became the first, and only, film to push past $1bn at the global box office. The audience was there, it just needed a reason to show up. So what did Barbenheimer do to achieve such a record turnout? When both films were announced to be sharing the same date, many saw it as a petty swipe from Warner Bros, positioning Barbie up against Nolan, their long-time director who had moved across to Universal for his latest (the Dark Knight film-maker, like many others had been displeased by the studio\u2019s Covid-era plan to release theatrical films simultaneously on streaming). Barbie had taken an almost 15-year long journey through various developments, with names such as Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer previously attached. It took Margot Robbie and her production company LuckyChap fresh off the success of Promising Young Woman to really get the wheels turning, approaching Gerwig post-Little Women who agreed on the proviso that her husband and collaborator Noah Baumbach could co-write. The two were seen as unconventional choices, their previous work closer to the arthouse than the multiplex, character rather than plot-led, not the most obvious fit for something set to become the first official Mattel Studios movie (future Mattel movies promise partnerships with JJ Abrams, Lena Dunham and Daniel Kaluuya). But their involvement, along with Robbie and a cast that eventually grew to include Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell and surprisingly diverse support from Issa Rae, Simu Liu, America Ferrera and Hari Nef, became early proof that this was not going to be your eldest sister\u2019s Barbie and those who might have otherwise turned their noses up at a toy-based tentpole were suddenly intrigued. Even without them, the Barbie brand continues to be big business. While it might have seen a slight drop from the year before, 2022 still saw Mattel make $1.49bn from Barbie products. That\u2019s staggering in-built IP, not just for new consumers but for those who have some attachment to the brand all the way back to its original release in 1959. While Gerwig and Baumbach might have taken a satirical look at Barbie, approaching topics such as patriarchy, capitalism and body image, the film was still launched with a poppy marketing campaign of bright pink everything, a soundtrack featuring Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and Charli XCX and brand partnerships totaling around 100, from Chevy to AirbnB. Its budget of $145m is believed to be doubled when marketing costs are added, a summer event movie with bite, but a summer event movie nonetheless. Barbie has been inescapable for the past few months but so has the excitement, leveled up by every new soundtrack release, every new clip, every new teasing piece of press from those involved (\u201cThis movie is crazy,\u201d Gerwig told the Observer earlier this month) and the meme-ification of its same-day release with a film that couldn\u2019t be any more opposed. While Gerwig\u2019s Barbie had the brand awareness of one of the biggest toys ever created to support her offbeat vision, Nolan had a rockier road ahead. Selling the story of J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, with a $100m budget at stake and a 3-hour, talk-heavy runtime at the height of summer felt like an unprecedented gamble, a heavy serving of vegetables in the middle of an all-you-can-eat fast food buffet. But Nolan, one of the few working directors who can draw a substantial audience by name alone, turned what could have been a dry history lesson into an IMAX spectacle thanks to a stacked starry cast (Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Rami Malek and Florence Pugh) and an extravagant marketing campaign that kicked off a year before release with a ticking clock and a brooding trailer. The campaign continued with class during a season often devoid of it with stars out at every available opportunity and Nolan taking on the Tom Cruise role of cinema savior, highlighting the importance of the theatrical experience. While audiences wouldn\u2019t know this upon buying a ticket, in order to secure the film with Universal, the director made them agree to a number of key terms, including a theatrical window of at least 100 days before any form of digital release and a three-week period before the studio releases another film. Universal had been one of the most open studios to a theatrical window reduction with some films available to watch digitally just 17 days after release. This decision should theoretically give the film better legs than most, allowing it to pull in audiences who might otherwise have waited for a home viewing. Last summer\u2019s biggest hit Top Gun: Maverick was similarly kept in cinemas for longer than what had become standard (it took three months for a rental release), as a result of Cruise\u2019s insistence, and topped out at just under $1.5bn (Barbie similarly has no planned digital release as of yet). One of the most interesting analytic tidbits over the weekend shows that, despite skewing older on paper, Oppenheimer\u2019s audience was surprisingly young, with 18- to 34-year-olds making up 66% of tickets sold. While older audiences are historically less likely to rush out on opening weekend in the same way, this still makes for a revealing result, its over-performing domestic debut (bigger than more commercially viable summer tentpoles like Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning: Part One, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Fast X) an important sign to studios that mass audiences will come out to watch films that prioritize words over action. Its success speaks to the rise of the world\u2019s biggest film-based social network Letterboxd and the cineaste culture that comes along with it, amplified by the pandemic where many were left at home to watch classics with nothing new coming out (Oppenheimer is already the 52nd highest-rated film ever on the platform). Barbie shares a vital similarity in that it also aimed to snag an audience often ignored during the warmer months: women. When studios have bothered to eventise films aimed at a female audience in the summer, it has tended to pay off. Just weeks after Iron Man kickstarted the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008, the first Sex and the City movie reached over $400m worldwide before Mamma Mia! made over $600m (both films beat out the same summer\u2019s more-hyped tentpoles The Incredible Hulk and Wanted). Since then, Bridesmaids ($306m), Sex and the City 2 ($294m) and Girls Trip ($140m) have shown the power of an underserved audience, but Hollywood has been reluctant to listen. The cultural moment shown in cinemas across the globe at the weekend \u2013 parties, costumes, sold out screenings, women making up a massive 71% of audiences \u2013 should hopefully be a reminder to pay better attention. Leading up to its release, the right had tried to engineer a culture war, enraged by its diversity and its perceived anti-man stance with the usual suspects trotting out tired rants about the evils of wokeness. But the same crowd, who love nothing more than to bask in the failure of a film with a diverse lead, such as Bros or The Little Mermaid, were noticeably quiet over the weekend as the numbers proved that yet again, audiences are more than willing to accept the things a small portion of loud voices are railing against. The unlikely combination of the two films, the creation of Barbenheimer, was a Twitter joke without studio backing that had a striking real world impact. In the US, at least 40,000 double-bill tickets had been sold by AMC while in the UK, Vue reported that a fifth of its visitors were also going to both. Celebrities, such as Quentin Tarantino, were even seen going from one to the other. What\u2019s telling about both films leading to such a craze is that both were given high marks by critics \u2013 Barbie at 91% and Oppenheimer at 94% \u2013 an ongoing trend of audiences willing to fork out for films that are worth the effort (both films were also handed an A CinemaScore from cinemagoers). With the rise of ticket prices making a trip to the multiplex that much harder to justify and the rise of online spaces where people can share opinions, studios have relied heavily on promoting a film\u2019s critical impact, including Rotten Tomatoes ratings in trailers and on streaming platforms. Sometimes the simplest answer is also the most relevant: both films did well because people like them. Barbenheimer has arrived not only at a worrying time for box office but at an even more worrying time for the industry at large. The ongoing writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes have paused major productions and added a question mark to those already in the can. The actors\u2019 strike prevents guild members from promoting studio work, its official start arriving just after the majority of Barbie and Oppenheimer press had taken place. But it carries a cloud over the rest of the year, obscuring the sunshine from the past weekend. This week\u2019s release of The Haunted Mansion, based on the Disney ride, has been hampered from a lack of star access with actors such as Lakeith Stanfield, Owen Wilson, Rosario Dawson and Jamie Lee Curtis unable to walk a red carpet or feature on a morning TV show to sell the film. Some later releases have already been yanked off the schedule such as A24 comedy Problemista and Zendaya-led love triangle drama Challengers, also pulled from a splashy premiere at the Venice film festival. With rumours that major films such as Dune 2, Aquaman 2 and The Color Purple may also move, it adds a bittersweet tang to the Barbenheimer success. It\u2019s proved that engaged and enthused audiences are out there, but with studios seemingly unwilling to compromise with unions, whether they\u2019ll have much to go see over the coming months is less sure."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604db7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/24/sinkhole-swallows-car-after-water-pipe-bursts-under-coventry-street", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sinkhole swallows car after water pipe bursts under Coventry street", "lead": "Seven Trent Water technicians working to repair \u2018one of our larger pipes\u2019 after car retrieved", "author": "Safi Bugel", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 20:05:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.677819", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/66ed6097c61412a5a3b27c3c26bd73d10686e8c5/0_135_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "A parked car was partially swallowed by a sinkhole that opened up on a Coventry road in the early hours of Monday morning.

The Twitter owner indicated that the design would be altered, tweeting that it \u201cprobably changes later, certainly will be refined\u201d. Twitter\u2019s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, confirmed the choice on Monday by tweeting the design and writing: \u201cX is here! Let\u2019s do this.\u201d Musk had appealed to his 149 million followers for design ideas and appears to have chosen a logo that he had flagged on Sunday via a flickering video pinned to the top of his Twitter feed. The \u201cX\u201d has long been an obsession of Musk\u2019s and is his name for an \u201ceverything app\u201d that he has pledged to launch at some point \u2013 with Twitter the likely vehicle. Shortly before buying Twitter in October, Musk described the social media platform as \u201can accelerant to creating X, the everything app\u201d. After taking over Twitter in October last year, Musk folded the company into an entity called X Corp, whose parent is X Holdings Corp. This month, the Tesla CEO announced that he was forming a new artificial intelligence company called xAI. The crowdsourced logo had been posted by Twitter user Sawyer Merritt, the co-founder of a sustainable clothing business, who tweeted that the font had been used for a discontinued podcast. The logo is taken from unicode, an international industrial standard for encoding text characters so that they can be displayed online. The Twitter logo is based on a unicode font called Blackboard bold, which leaves open questions about whether the logo can be copyrighted or protected as a trademark. \u201cCompanies usually spend large sums of money designing a unique logo to stand out from the crowd, so choosing a standard character that anyone else can use seems very peculiar,\u201d said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University. The X concept is modelled on WeChat, the Chinese platform that allows users to perform multiple functions, from messaging to ordering a taxi and paying bills. In June last year, Musk reportedly told Twitter staff: \u201cYou basically live on WeChat in China. If we can recreate that with Twitter, we\u2019ll be a great success.\u201d Yaccarino gave some details on Sunday of how she expected X to work, tweeting that the business would be AI-powered and \u201ccentred in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking\u201d. As of Monday morning, the desktop version of Twitter was displaying the new logo in place of its signature bird symbol, and the official Twitter account had been changed to the X brand. The rebrand has already begun at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, where the company has projected the X logo on and within the building and reportedly renamed conference rooms to words that include X. One analyst warned that the rebranding move was high-risk given the competitive outlook for Twitter, which is suffering financially from advertisers withholding spending and the emergence of a \u201cTwitter killer\u201d rival called Threads, launched by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta. \u201cBy changing Twitter\u2019s app name, Elon Musk will have singlehandedly wiped out over 15 years of a brand name that has secured its place in our cultural lexicon,\u201d said Mike Proulx, research director at the analysis firm Forrester. \u201cThis is an extremely risky move, because with \u2018X\u2019, Musk is essentially starting over while its competition is afoot.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604db9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jul/24/trump-trial-first-republican-debate-polls-us-politics-live", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Texas governor Greg Abbott rejects demand to remove floating barriers targeting migrants \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Republican governor sets up battle with Biden administration over Rio Grande buoys to prevent people crossing from Mexico", "author": "Chris Stein US politics live blogger  (now) and L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 20:03:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.677857", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bec45ab59dfe7d948c7d31a43352ce4b174d1549/0_26_5397_3242/500.jpg", "body": "Election day 2024 is still a long way off, but we\u2019re getting closer to 23 August, when Republican presidential candidates will have their first debate. Most of the big names have qualified, but Donald Trump says he might not attend, while his former vice-president, Mike Pence, is struggling to qualify, as are Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson. We\u2019ll see if these candidates can turn it around in the weeks to come. Meanwhile, the White House expressed alarm at the latest news from Israel, where the far-right government has won passage of a key part its judicial overhaul. Opponents of the move say it could threaten the country\u2019s democracy. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Texas\u2019s Republican governor has rejected a justice department demand that the state remove floating barriers intended to stop migrants entering from Mexico. Mitt Romney says donors should cut off support to Republican presidential contenders who have no hope of winning the nomination, in an effort to winnow the race to two candidates and defeat Trump. House Republicans may decide to hold Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in contempt. Special counsel Jack Smith has obtained documents from Bernie Kerik, who advised the Trump campaign\u2019s attempt to prove fraud in the 2020 election. Alabama Republicans are resisting a supreme court order to draw a second majority Black congressional district. Mitt Romney, the Utah senator who was the Republican nominee for president in 2012 but lost to Barack Obama, has proposed a strategy to unite the current crop of GOP contenders for the White House against Donald Trump. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Romney, one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken opponents in Congress, calls on donors backing Republican presidential candidates to withdraw their support once it becomes clear that their choice can\u2019t win. The goal is to winnow the field to a two-person race, in hopes the other candidate can keep Trump from returning to office. Here\u2019s more of what he has to say: Despite Donald Trump\u2019s apparent inevitability, a baker\u2019s dozen Republicans are hoping to become the party\u2019s 2024 nominee for president. That is possible for any of them if the field narrows to a two-person race before Mr. Trump has the nomination sewn up. For that to happen, Republican megadonors and influencers \u2013 large and small \u2013 are going to have to do something they didn\u2019t do in 2016: get candidates they support to agree to withdraw if and when their paths to the nomination are effectively closed. That decision day should be no later than, say, Feb 26, the Monday following the contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. There are incentives for no-hope candidates to overstay their prospects. Coming in behind first place may grease another run in four years or have market value of its own: Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum got paying gigs. And as former New Hampshire Gov John H Sununu has observed, \u2018It is fun running for president if you know you cannot win.\u2019 Left to their own inclinations, expect several of the contenders to stay in the race for a long time. They will split the non-Trump vote, giving him the prize. A plurality is all that is needed for winner-take-all primaries. \u2026 Our party and our country need a nominee with character, driven by something greater than revenge and ego, preferably from the next generation. Family, friends and campaign donors are the only people who can get a lost-cause candidate to exit the race. After Feb 26, they should start doing just that. CNN has reported new details of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn his 2022 election loss, including that Bernie Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner who worked with the Trump campaign to uncover fraud, has turned over a trove of documents to the prosecutor. The materials include research and witness statements produced by the team, which was led by Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani. CNN reports that Kerik will meet with Smith\u2019s prosecutors next month for an interview. Here\u2019s more from CNN\u2019s story: Former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik was part of the team led by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani trying to uncover fraud that would swing the election in favor of Trump. For months, Kerik had tried to shield some of the documents from investigators, citing privilege. But in recent weeks, Kerik gave the documents to the Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign to review. After that review, the campaign declined to assert privilege, according to Kerik\u2019s lawyer, Tim Parlatore, who turned over the documents to Smith\u2019s office on Sunday. \u201cI have shared all of these documents, approximately 600MB, mostly pdfs, with the Special Counsel and look forward to sitting down with them in about 2 weeks to discuss.\u201d Parlatore said. Kerik is scheduled to sit down for an interview with the special counsel\u2019s office next month, CNN has learned. Among the materials now in Smith\u2019s possession are witness statements, research and other documents produced by Giuliani\u2019s team. When the January 6 congressional committee subpoenaed Kerik for documents, he provided a log of his communications that he said he was withholding due to privilege. Those communications have never been disclosed publicly, as the committee did not challenge Kerik\u2019s privilege claims in court. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax authority today announced it would end the practice of sending its employees on unannounced visits of the homes of people who owed taxes. The IRS received a major infusion of funds to modernize its systems under last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, but wound up in the crosshairs of Republicans, who claimed, without evidence, that the money would pay for armed agents. In a statement, IRS commissioner Danny Werfel said the decision to end the decades-old practice of dispatching unnamed agents to homes and businesses was part of its modernization plan. \u201cWe are taking a fresh look at how the IRS operates to better serve taxpayers and the nation, and making this change is a common-sense step. Changing this long-standing procedure will increase confidence in our tax administration work and improve overall safety for taxpayers and IRS employees,\u201d Werfel said. The IRS added that the change in policy was supported by its employee union. In an interview with CNN, a top official with the NAACP civil rights group explains the problems with Alabama\u2019s new congressional maps: Nonetheless, the GOP-led state has gone ahead with maps that appear to violate a supreme court ruling ordering lawmakers to draw a second majority African-American congressional district. Israel\u2019s far-right government today won a battle in their case to reform the judiciary, but as the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal reports, American Jews opposed to the government\u2019s policies against Palestinians say they are feeling optimistic about changing minds in the United States: Mike Levinson has been pushing back for 40 years and finally thinks he might be getting somewhere. \u201cThere\u2019s a change and the politicians see it. I think it scares them,\u201d said Levinson, holding a sign demanding \u201cStop Israeli settler violence\u201d as he marched through New York on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous change going on in the American Jewish community. There are a lot of Jews, especially young people, who are not so quick to automatically and unconditionally support everything that Israel does. People are accepting the fact that it\u2019s OK to be Jewish and criticise Israel.\u201d Levinson, a Jewish New Yorker, began protesting against Israeli government policies during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon. It\u2019s been a long and often lonely road since then as he has sought to get his fellow Americans to pay attention to decades of Israeli occupation, military assaults on the West Bank and Gaza, and the unrelenting expansion of Jewish settlements. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was seen joining striking writers and actors on a picket line outside Netflix\u2019s Manhattan offices today. An overwhelming majority of voters in Ohio support a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee access to abortion in the state, according to a new poll. A new USA Today/Suffolk University poll showed 58% of Ohio voters backed the amendment enshrining abortion rights. Among those who backed the amendment included a third of Republicans and 85% of independent women. The proposed amendment states that: Every individual has a right to make and carry out one\u2019s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one\u2019s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion. Under this proposal, abortion could still be banned after \u201cfetal viability\u201d, or whether it can live outside the womb. Republican congressman of Florida Matt Gaetz has been defending his decision to introduce legislation to defund investigations into Donald Trump led by special counsel Jack Smith. Gaetz made the announcement last week, just hours after the former president said he had received a letter identifying him as a target of the justice department\u2019s investigation into the January 6 insurrection, led by Smith. In an interview with Newsmax, Gaetz said he didn\u2019t \u201cneed Jack Smith to tell me what happened on January 6\u201d. He said: I was there. I saw President Trump encourage people to peacefully and patriotically go into places where permits had been reserved with city government for lawful protest activity. A key group of Senate Democrats have urged the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, to pressure Senator Tommy Tuberville to end his \u201creckless, dangerous\u201d hold on military nominations. The letter, led by armed services committee member Senator Mazie Hirono and obtained by NBC, calls on McConnell to \u201cexercise your leadership to protect the readiness of our military\u201d. Tuberville, who for months has been blocking military nominations in protest of the Pentagon\u2019s policy to reimburse travel expenses for those seeking reproductive care, including abortions, across state lines, has been \u201cthreatening our national security\u201d, the letter says. It continues: We know you share our concerns about the consequences of this hold on our Armed Services, and as the leader of your conference, we urge you to take stronger action to resolve this situation. The Democratic signatories to the letter all serve on the Senate armed services committee with Tuberville. Election day 2024 is still a long way off, but we\u2019re getting closer to 23 August, when Republican presidential candidates will have their first debate. Most of the big names have qualified, but Donald Trump says he might not attend, while his former vice-president Mike Pence is struggling to qualify, as are Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson. We\u2019ll see if these candidates can turn it around in the weeks to come. Meanwhile, the White House has expressed alarm at the latest news from Israel, where the far-right government has won passage of a key part its judicial overhaul. Opponents of the move say it could threaten the country\u2019s democracy. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Texas\u2019s Republican governor has rejected a justice department demand that it remove floating barriers intended to stop migrants entering from Mexico. House Republicans may decide to hold Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in contempt. Alabama Republicans are resisting a supreme court order to draw a second majority Black congressional district. Republicans have hammered Joe Biden over migration at the southern border ever since he took office, but over the weekend, one GOP lawmaker said he believed both state and federal authorities had mishandled the crisis, the Guardian\u2019s Maya Yang reports: A Texas Republican representative, Tony Gonzales, has called the current tactics used to deter migrants at the US-Mexico border \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and urged the Biden administration and Congress to focus more heavily on legal immigration. In an interview with CBS\u2019s Face The Nation on Sunday, Gonzales, whose 23rd district in Texas includes 800 miles of the US-Mexico border, said that the border crisis \u201chas been anything but humane\u201d and called recent reports of Texas troopers allegedly pushing small children and nursing babies back into the Rio Grande \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable and it hasn\u2019t been acceptable for two years \u2026 Everything that is happening along the border is just adding fuel to the fire,\u201d Gonzales said. He went on to say that Texas\u2019s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, who has come under fire from human rights groups over his controversial Operation Lone Star border security program, \u201cis doing everything he can to secure the border\u201d. A battle is brewing in Texas between its Republican governor Greg Abbott and the Biden administration, which has demanded the state remove floating barriers placed in the Rio Grande to prevent people from crossing from Mexico. Today, Abbott vowed to defy the request from the justice department, potentially setting up a legal fight with the Democratic administration: As the Guardian\u2019s Maya Yang reported last week, the deployment of the floating barriers comes amid reports that Texas authorities are mistreating migrants who cross into the state from Mexico: Two pregnant migrant women who were trying to turn themselves in to US immigration authorities have alleged that Texas national guard soldiers refused to provide them with water. Speaking to CNN at a shelter in Eagle Pass, Texas, the two women, identified as Carmen from Honduras and Mar\u00eda from El Salvador, recounted their experiences at the border amid recent reports of \u201cinhumane\u201d behavior by American border authorities. \u201cThey told us it was a crime to cross into the US and that we should return to Mexico,\u201d Carmen, who said she is six months pregnant, told CNN. She added that she and her husband had initially tried to cross the Rio Grande on 12 July but were stopped by Texas national guard soldiers. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has weighed in on events in Israel, where today the far-right government won passage of a key part its judicial overhaul that opponents warn threaten its democracy. Here\u2019s what she had to say: As a lifelong friend of Israel, President Biden has publicly and privately expressed his views that major changes in a democracy to be enduring must have as broad a consensus as possible. It is unfortunate that the vote today took place with the slimmest possible majority. We understand talks are ongoing and likely to continue over the coming weeks and months to forge a broader compromise even with the Knesset in recess. The United States will continue to support the efforts of President Herzog and other Israeli leaders as they seek to build a broader consensus through political dialogue. Speaking of the House, Punchbowl News reports that Republicans may use the chamber\u2019s powers to hold in contempt \u2026 Mark Zuckerberg. There\u2019s no doubt that social networks like Facebook and Instagram, all of which are under Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta umbrella, play important roles in politics globally, but dragging Zuckerberg before Congress is a little unusual. As Punchbowl News reports, the dispute concerns Meta\u2019s cooperation with subpoenas issued by judiciary committee chair Jim Jordan, who has used his panel to launch a number of investigations intended to prove malfeasance by Democrats: The House Judiciary Committee is considering a vote this week to hold Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in contempt. While this is a mostly symbolic step for the House GOP majority, it would be a huge escalation of Republicans\u2019 war on Big Tech \u2014 if it happens. Judiciary Republicans claim Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, hasn\u2019t been cooperating with the panel\u2019s effort to investigate potential censorship by Big Tech, including the failure to hand over internal company documents. \u201cMeta has critical information that it has not turned over to the committee regarding federal government efforts to censor speech online and how Meta responded to those efforts,\u201d Russell Dye, spokesperson for Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told us. \u201cIt is imperative the committee get these materials and we will take whatever actions necessary to facilitate that end,\u201d Dye added. The committee is eyeing voting on the resolution Thursday, according to multiple sources. Last month, the conservative-dominated supreme court gave voting rights advocates \u2013 and Democrats hoping to retake the House of Representatives \u2013 a surprise victory when it struck down Alabama\u2019s congressional maps and ordered lawmakers to draw a second majority African-American district. But as the Associated Press reports, the state\u2019s Republican leaders are trying to defy the ruling: Alabama Republican lawmakers say they are trying to satisfy a landmark US supreme court order to draw a new district giving a voice to Black voters, but with hours to go before a court-ordered deadline on Friday, experts said proposals fell far short of what the law requires. The Republican-controlled state house and senate were scheduled to meet on Friday and could advance separate plans increasing the share of Black voters in Alabama\u2019s second congressional district. Legislative leaders say they intended to meet the deadline, meaning the two chambers must reach one plan. Both plans preserve the current Black majority of the seventh district. But neither plan comes close to creating a second Black majority district in a state that is 27% Black. Back on the campaign trail, the Washington Post has an incisive look at Mike Pence, who, as a former vice-president, should be running a strong race for the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination. Instead, Pence has yet to qualify for the 23 August GOP debate, and is struggling to raise enough funds, as was plain during the candidate\u2019s swing through New Hampshire. Here\u2019s more from the story: As he finished up his remarks at an outdoor garden party hosted by a former state senator, Mike Pence made one final request to prospective voters. \u201cEven one dollar, although I want to emphasize you can give a lot more, would be a help tonight, even before you go to bed tonight, go online, send us a buck or whatever,\u201d the former vice president said, dressed in a crisp light-blue button-down and navy slacks on a hot summer day in the Granite State. \u201cWe\u2019re working around-the-clock to make sure we get enough donors to be up on that debate stage and I\u2019ll see you all at the inauguration.\u201d One day later, nearly 80 miles away at the Wicwas Lake Grange in Meredith, N.H., state Sen. Timothy Lang Sr. stood alongside Pence at an evening town hall with a similar plea, encouraging attendees to grab a \u201cMike Pence for President\u201d card with a QR code: \u201cIf you want to donate just a dollar, it counts toward the 40,000.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Michael Sainato spoke to Sean O\u2019Brien, leader of the Teamsters union, whose UPS employees are threatening to embark on what could be a major strike starting next week: Sean O\u2019Brien has a long family legacy at the Teamsters: his great-grandfather, grandfather and father were all Teamster union members in Boston. O\u2019Brien joined the union after dropping out of college at age 19 to haul equipment on construction sites in 1991. Thirty-two years later, he is on the verge of leading the union in one of the biggest \u2013 and costliest \u2013 strikes at a single private employer in US history. The Teamsters has 1.2 million members, making it one of the largest unions in the world. Its membership is diverse, ranging from police to bakers, but it is most famous for representing freight drivers and warehouse workers. Shipping and logistics giant UPS is the single largest employer in the Teamsters Union. Under O\u2019Brien, the Teamster\u2019s general president, the contract negotiations between the two have become a test case for a union giant that is flexing its muscles after corporations have stonewalled nascent labor movements at Starbucks and Amazon with long delays toward a first contract. \u201cWe are going to set the tone \u2013 and we have \u2013 for how organized labor should deal with corporate America, with politicians, and how they should stand up and fight. We will set the example through this situation with UPS whether we get a deal or if UPS chooses not to do the right thing to strike themselves,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. Stepping away from the campaign trail for minute, we are about a week away from what will be one of the biggest single-employer strikes in US history, if UPS workers walk off the job on 1 August. The Guardian\u2019s Dharna Noor reports that intense heat \u2013 like much of the United States experienced last week \u2013 is one of the big sticking points in the ongoing talks: As a UPS delivery driver in Dallas, Texas, Seth Pacic is intimately familiar with the dangers of extreme heat. After a long day\u2019s work through record-breaking temperatures in summer 2011, he found himself dry heaving in the parking lot, incapable of driving home until he spent an hour and a half in the air-conditioned office. \u201cIt was one of the worst feelings I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I fully recovered for a couple of weeks.\u201d For some, the heat has had even more serious consequences. Last June, Pacic\u2019s friend and coworker had a heat stroke while driving home from work; he is still recuperating, Pacic said. That same summer, 24-year-old UPS driver Esteban Chavez collapsed and died in California as temperatures soared into the high 90s; his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and later settled with UPS. And the year before that, Jose Cruz Rodriguez Jr, 23, died of a heatstroke while driving a UPS truck in Waco, Texas. Whether or not Donald Trump shows up to the first debate of GOP presidential candidates, it\u2019s tough out there for his competitors. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith took a look at the fortunes of some of the other Republicans who have thrown their hats into the ring, and what he found was bleak: For Asa Hutchinson, former governor of Arkansas, there were boos and chants of \u201cTrump! Trump!\u201d. For Francis Suarez, mayor of Miami, there were jeers and cries of \u201cTraitor!\u201d And perhaps most tellingly, there was no Florida governor Ron DeSantis at all. The recent Turning Point USA conference brought thousands of young conservatives to Florida and there was no doubting the main attraction: former president Donald Trump, who made a glitzy entrance accompanied by giant stage sparklers. In a less than rigorous poll, 86% of attendees gave Trump as their first choice for president; DeSantis, who polled 19% last year, was down to 4%. Events and numbers like this are cause for sleepless nights among those Republican leaders and donors desperate to believe it would be different this time. The Never Trump forces bet heavily on DeSantis as the coming man and the premise that Trump\u2019s campaign would collapse under the weight of myriad legal problems. But what about Doug Burgum, Asa Hutchinson and, perhaps most surprisingly, Mike Pence? The three are considered among the major GOP presidential contenders, but Politico reports that none of them has qualified for the debate stage. It\u2019s a bit of a shock for Pence, since he was Trump\u2019s vice-president for four years, though has very publicly fallen out with him. Here\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t yet made the cut: Former Vice President Mike Pence has also hit the polling threshold. But unlike the other six candidates, it\u2019s not clear if he will meet the individual donor threshold \u2014 40,000 unique donors, with 200 donors in 20 different states or territories \u2014 that the others have. \u201cWe will qualify. Getting 40,000 donors in just a few short weeks is a challenge,\u201d Pence said on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on last week. \u201cWe\u2019re not offering gift cards, not offering kickbacks or tickets to soccer games, just traveling.\u201d The fates of Burgum and Hutchinson are less surprising. Burgum is the current governor of North Dakota and Hutchinson the former governor of Arkansas who also worked in George W Bush\u2019s administration, but neither is much of a household name. Both appear to have several obstacles ahead of them if they want to make the debate stage: Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is only one national poll away from meeting the polling threshold, after registering at 1 percent in the Fox Business Iowa poll and a second survey from the same outlet in South Carolina, also released on Sunday. But he still needs to amass 40,000 donors and was well short of that number at last count. Some long-shot candidates have rolled out outlandish schemes to try to meet the donor threshold. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, for example, has promised people who give him a buck $20 gift cards in return, and he said earlier this week he had hit his goal. Burgum \u2014 who has run millions of dollars worth of TV advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 is still in search of two national polls showing him at at least 1 percent, after meeting that threshold in Iowa and a previously-released survey from the University of New Hampshire in the Granite State. Donald Trump is a shoo-in for the first debate of GOP presidential candidates, scheduled for 23 August in Milwaukee. In order to qualify, the party requires candidates to pledge to support the eventual nominee, have at least 40,000 unique donors spread across a minimum of 20 states, and poll at least 1% in at least three national polls. The former president blows through all those criteria. He\u2019s been raking in cash and dominating polls ever since announcing a renewed White House campaign last year. But in typical Trump fashion, he says he\u2019s considering skipping the first debate. He told Reuters why in an interview last month: In a telephone interview with Reuters, Trump said \u201cpossibly not\u201d when asked if he would be at the debate, to be hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee on Aug. 23. The debate will be the first chance for voters to see the Republican presidential candidates square off against each other. Trump called Fox News, which he has criticized for not covering his campaign events, a \u201chostile network\u201d and said he saw little merit in debating candidates like former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who are far behind him in polling. \u201cWhy would I give them time to make statements? Why would I do that when I\u2019m leading them by 50 points and 60 points,\u201d Trump said. Good morning, US politics blog readers. One month from today, we will be digesting the aftermath of the first GOP presidential debate, which is set for 23 August in Milwaukee. Such events are a staple of the presidential nomination process, and two polls released over the weekend revealed the contours of the Republican race are largely the same as ever. Fox Business surveys of early voting states Iowa and South Carolina show Donald Trump with a big lead over all his competitors. In the former, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott are the distant runners-up for second and third place, respectively, while in the latter, it\u2019s former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and then DeSantis. But the polls are not all bad news for the Republicans aiming to oust Trump as the party\u2019s nominee. Six GOP candidates have qualified for the debate stage based on, among other things, their polling results, Politico reports. These include Trump, DeSantis, Haley and Scott, along with Chris Christie and Vivek Ramaswamy, and it\u2019s possible other candidates, such as Mike Pence, will qualify in the weeks to come. Debates can give candidates important opportunities to stand out in the field, but whether those who qualify show up is a different matter. We\u2019ll tell you more about that later today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening today: Joe Biden has no public events scheduled, but press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will brief reporters at 3.30pm eastern time. Remember Allen West? Or Scott Walker? They\u2019ll be among the ex-lawmakers speaking at the National Conservative Student Conference, which begins today in Washington DC. Ramaswamy, who is actually seeking office, is the sole presidential candidate billed to appear.

They can yield up to 100 steaks which \u2013 according to taste tests carried out with men and women in the street by co-presenter Michelle Ackerley \u2013 are remarkably fine substitutes for the real thing and at a fraction of the price. Could this be the answer to part of the cost of living crisis? Wallace takes three steaks from different donors to Michel Roux Jr at Le Gavroche to see if their provenance makes a difference to the quality. Is human terroir a thing? The third steak is by far the best, but that is part of a premium line, the details of which are still under wraps. Now, at some point in this description or when viewing the programme the penny will have dropped. It took a shamefully long time for me to work out what was going on, but I am never at my best when Wallace is on screen. I flinch, I cower, I basically experience him as some form of minor assault. But for anyone even more gullible than I am, and especially if they have read their Swift, the next twist leaves no room for doubt about what is \u2013 quite unexpectedly on a weekday evening from mischievous Channel 4 and writer Matt Edmonds \u2013 actually happening. The CEO of the company, Tamara Ennett takes him to the donor facilities, where fearful 67-year-old retired receptionist Gillian is being prepared for her extraction surgery. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d asks Wallace. \u201cIt\u2019s pain-subjective,\u201d replies Tamara before ushering him smoothly into the boardroom to reveal the secrets of their new premium line. Have you guessed it yet? Yes \u2013 it\u2019s babies. Well, under-sevens anyway. Tender, unstressed meat, there for the taking. Toddler tartare canapes are on the table. Wallace \u2013 uniquely, as far as I am aware, in the annals of television history \u2013 falls silent. And then asks quietly and uncertainly if they are expecting any moral objections to be made when the product goes public. \u201cIt\u2019s testing very positively,\u201d says Ennett. He is given a tour of the children\u2019s facilities (\u201cLike livestock on the way to the abattoir, any stress could affect the quality of their meat\u201d) and meets Gillian\u2019s grandson, who is about to make his contribution to the family finances, too. He is nervous, so Tamara crouches down to reassure him. \u201cHave you heard of inflation, Jimmy? Price spikes? The cost of living crisis means that decent people like you don\u2019t have many options. This is an amazing opportunity for you to do your bit and make your nana proud.\u201d No, Gregg Wallace: The British Miracle Meat is not subtle. And it gets even less so with Wallace\u2019s outro (\u201cNo wonder the state is behind their sacrifice 100%! The Trussell Trust says a future without food banks requires a benefits system that works for all and secure incomes so people can afford essentials. So it\u2019s no surprise eating children seems a more likely path for our country!\u201d) though it gains something from being delivered in his trademark bluff, mansplainy, unhinged tones. He was the right choice for the part. It is a neat idea, cleverly executed in the half hour and has the attraction and value of novelty. It could have been more pointed, more vicious, or packed more in to satiate those who are already aware of the issues it raises, but that isn\u2019t what it is aiming to do. Rather, it is a nice little curveball thrown into the schedule to capture the attention of a slightly different demographic, perhaps, those who wouldn\u2019t necessarily sit down to watch a documentary about the food crisis, or poverty or politics. I\u2019d just keep a close eye on any suggestions for solving the cost of living crisis that the Tories come up with in the next few months after broadcast, that\u2019s all. \u2022 Gregg Wallace: The British Miracle Meat is on Channel 4."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dbb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/elon-musk-twitter-x-rebrand", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "X marks ... what?

What does he mean by that? He, of course, has no idea. This is a man with a terrible, terrible history for naming things. At Tesla, Musk would insist on a model lineup that spelled out the word \u201csexy\u201d, even after there was no chance of Ford relinquishing their copyright on the Model E (so he ended up with Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y). At SpaceX, an uninventive moniker in itself, he named his rockets like an improv audience member shouting out random words to inspire a comedy scene: Grasshopper! Merlin! Starship! Musk\u2019s failure of a tunneling concern, the Boring Company, shows he also flair for lame puns that don\u2019t quite land. Bad names run in his family, too. X is how Musk referred to the son he had with the musician Grimes after the child\u2019s original name \u2013 X \u00c6 A-12 \u2013 was rejected for flouting a California law that limits birth certificates to \u201cthe 26 alphabetical letters of the English language\u201d. Grimes said the X took inspiration from algebra\u2019s \u201cunknown variable\u201d, while \u00c6 (a diphthong that echoes the long I in most English dialects) referred to the \u201celven spelling of Ai (love &amp;/or Artificial intelligence)\u201d. Musk tacked on the A-12, the label for Lockheed\u2019s mold-breaking spy plane (\u201cthe coolest plane ever,\u201d he gushed to Joe Rogan). Musk\u2019s love of the letter X is particularly uninspired. In the days of Descartes, X was the preferred letter to symbolize the ineffable \u2013 a kiss, a signature, the place on a map where treasure is buried or the eyes of the dead in drawings. But in the tech world, X has become a nothing letter, used to name everything from operating systems (Mac OS X) to gaming consoles (Xbox) to the telecom company Comcast, which changed names to Xfinity in hopes of escaping its overwhelmingly negative consumer reputation. (Time magazine called it one of the worst corporate rebrands of all time.) So it fits that the first letter companies turn to when they want to sound \u201cwith it\u201d is Musk\u2019s absolute favorite. Musk named his first company X.com, an online bank. In 2000, it merged with a competing software company co-founded by Peter Thiel \u2013 who promptly replaced Musk as the CEO of X.com and renamed the new conglomerate PayPal. (The rest is IPO history.) In 2017, Musk bought the X.com domain back from PayPal, hinting at bigger plans. Three months before purchasing Twitter, a user asked Musk if he had considered creating his own platform. \u201cX.com,\u201d was his reply. At a Tesla shareholder meeting that same month, he revealed \u201ca pretty grand vision\u201d for X that \u201cwould be very useful to the world\u201d, a one-stop shop to rival WeChat \u2013 China\u2019s all-in-one messaging, social media and mobile payment service. X was the name used in the three Delaware-registered holding companies Musk used to buy Twitter for $44bn. Today, the company is worth less than a third of that, proof that Musk isn\u2019t much better with numbers, either. Musk has had a considerable hand in immolating much of that equity \u2013 doing away with character limits, hate speech protections and other features that made Twitter special and safe. Reports say the conference rooms at Twitter HQ were changed on Monday to include the letter X. New names include \u201ceXposure\u201d, \u201ceXult\u201d and \u2013 once again \u2013 \u201cs3Xy\u201d. This latest change figures to have even more longtime Twitter users pulling up stakes for Threads, Spill and other new replacements. Musk may think himself clever by consolidating all his companies into one nice, neat \u201cBrand X\u201d. But the name reads more like the residue of too much time spent watching product comparison TV adverts than it does proof of genuine creativity. (Also: wasn\u2019t Brand X always the crappier option?) Still, credit where due: Musk picked the right letter to mark the death of a cartoon bird, Xs rolling in its eyes. He might not appreciate that irony until his app is itself dead and buried."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dbc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/nova-scotia-flooding-missing-people-canada", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nova Scotia: body found amid search for four missing after \u2018furious\u2019 flooding", "lead": "Two children among the missing when vehicles were submerged on road after more than 200m of rain pummeled some regions", "author": "Tracey Lindeman in Ottawa", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 19:47:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.677944", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/74eddc29fa73ef4a4bceecfd6925d660070ea5af/12_0_3488_2095/500.jpg", "body": "The body of a 52-year old man and other human remains have been discovered by emergency teams searching for four people who went missing in historic flooding after more than 200mm (7.87in) of rain pummeled some regions of Nova Scotia at the weekend. The man\u2019s body was found near West Hants in Nova Scotia, on the south-eastern coast of Canada, where search and rescue teams were looking for two children, a youth and a man who were in two vehicles which became submerged in flood water. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that human remains had also been found, adding that the force was working with the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner\u2019s Office to identify them. \u201cIt\u2019s a heartbreaking day for our province,\u201d premier Tim Houston told reporters. Cpl Guillaume Tremblay of the RCMP said earlier on Monday that other occupants in the two vehicles were able to escape before they were washed away. The RCMP is leading ongoing efforts to drain farm fields measuring close to 40 hectares (100 acres) in search of the missing people. Over the weekend, the RCMP underwater recovery team found the empty pickup truck in which the two children were believed to have been travelling. Abraham Zebian is the mayor of West Hants, the close-knit community home to the missing people. \u201cI know the families personally,\u201d he said, choking back emotion. \u201cThank God some of them managed to get to shore.\u201d Zebian said that industrial water pumps deployed to the fields have revealed vehicles that were washed off the nearby road. \u201cThere\u2019s a semi-truck that was washed completely off, and you know how big a semi is, and how heavy those things are. It was completely taken away,\u201d he said while surveying the damage in the area. Zebian said a house near the field was carried off its foundation. The news of the four missing people came as Nova Scotia declared a province-wide state of emergency following flooding not seen since 1971\u2019s Hurricane Beth, according to CBC\u2019s meteorologist, Ryan Snoddon. The rain began on 21 July, sweeping the southern Atlantic edge of the province before crossing over Halifax and hitting the interior. \u201cThis is a very serious event. This flooding has been fast and furious, and we are taking strong action to ensure Nova Scotians are protected,\u201d said John Lohr, minister responsible for the Emergency Management Office, in a news release over the weekend. The flooding comes less than two months after record-breaking wildfires ravaged more than 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of the province, including some of the same areas hit by torrential downpours in this latest bout of extreme weather. Extreme rainfall has become more common and more intense due to human-caused climate change across most of the world, because warmer air can hold more water vapour. One resident in the southern tip of the province told the local Annapolis Valley Register newspaper that she knew she had to evacuate her home of 48 years when daylight broke on Saturday. \u201cThe water was coming right up, almost ready to come inside,\u201d Eileen Barker told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had floods before but never like this.\u201d \u201cI look at this and I think this could be, you know, the new norm,\u201d another resident told CBC. On Saturday, the provincial premier, Tim Houston, said at a news conference that, \u201cWe have a scary, significant situation here,\u201d adding that the list of damaged infrastructure would only grow. The scale of the damage became apparent on Sunday as floodwaters began to recede. Bridges, roads, buildings, homes and a wastewater pumping station 20km (12 miles) from Halifax \u2013 the biggest city in the Maritimes \u2013 were laid to waste during the storm. The Halifax Water public utility said on Sunday night that the \u201cwastewater system in this area is no longer operating as designed and is now overflowing directly into the lake\u201d. West Hants mayor Zebian said there had been an outpouring of help, but was asking residents to stay away from the area being searched to avoid confusing the search dogs. He cautioned that while some roads may appear to be in decent condition, the water may have washed away underlying support. \u201cI know people want to help. Here in Hants county, people are quick to jump in front of a bullet for you \u2013 that\u2019s how close this community is,\u201d he said. \u201cI love people wanting to help \u2026 Just, we need to let the experts do what they do best and keep everybody else safe right now.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dbd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/freddy-ramirez-miami-dade-police-director-shot", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Head of Miami police shoots himself on busy highway after domestic dispute", "lead": "Alfredo \u2018Freddy\u2019 Ramirez in critical but stable condition after shooting following earlier altercation attended by Tampa officers", "author": "Richard Luscombe in Miami", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 19:26:30", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.677963", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0159e65701e73b648b42f563825c61239c652adc/0_82_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The head of Florida\u2019s largest police department was in critical condition at one of the state\u2019s hospitals on Monday after shooting himself on a busy interstate following a domestic dispute. Alfredo \u201cFreddy\u201d Ramirez, director of the Miami-Dade police department, and his wife, Jody, had earlier been asked to leave the JW Marriott hotel in Tampa\u2019s downtown, where he was attending a sheriffs\u2019 association conference. According to the Tampa police department, officers were called to the hotel to investigate a report of a couple arguing and a man pointing a gun at himself. A statement provided to the Guardian said officers identified the man as Ramirez, but after talking to him and a woman with him, determined there was \u201cno evidence of a crime or immediate danger\u201d and left. However, after leaving the hotel, the 52-year-old Ramirez pulled over on the side of interstate 75 and shot himself in the head. Chad Chronister, the sheriff of Hillsborough county, which includes Tampa, told reporters that Ramirez\u2019s wife was with him in their car and called 911. \u201cFrom what we can tell processing the evidence [and] interviews that were conducted \u2026 it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\u201d Chronister said, adding that Ramirez was expected to survive. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office stands united with a profound sense of compassion and concern for our colleague who has experienced such a traumatic event. Mental health knows no boundaries and I hope that director Ramirez and anyone in crisis receives the help they deserve.\u201d The Florida highway patrol, in a statement, separately said that its troopers joined officers from the state department of law enforcement to conduct an investigation into the shooting. \u201cDirector Ramirez suffered serious injuries and is hospitalized. No one else was injured. There is no threat to the community. Our investigation is active,\u201d the statement said. Ramirez underwent surgery early on Monday and was described as being in critical but stable condition, according to the mayor of Miami-Dade, Daniella Levine Cava. \u201cAll that matters right now is Chief Ramirez\u2019s wellbeing, and I join his family, his loved ones, and all his Miami-Dade police department and Miami-Dade county family in praying for his swift recovery,\u201d she said in a tweet. Cava\u2019s office said she was traveling to Tampa to support Ramirez and his family. The Miami Herald reported that Ramirez called Cava on Sunday night after the episode at the hotel. A spokesperson for the mayor confirmed the call had taken place but did not divulge what they discussed. The Herald saw an internal email from the Miami-Dade police department that urged officers not to make the 275-mile journey to show their own support. \u201cPlease continue to pray for his comfort and healing during these upcoming days,\u201d the email said. The shooting under investigation happened on the first day of the Florida Sheriffs Association\u2019s four-day summer conference at Tampa\u2019s JW Marriott hotel, which attracts more than 500 law enforcement leaders from around the country. Ramirez was appointed to direct the Miami-Dade police department in January 2020, and he also acts as the county\u2019s safety and emergency response chief. He has worked for the agency for 27 years. He has filed paperwork to run for sheriff when the county shakes up its law enforcement system next year to comply with new legislation. Miami-Dade has had no sheriff since a 1966 grand jury report found gross corruption and voters made the county\u2019s top police job an appointed position rather than an elected one. \u2022 In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 988 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

In the week since backlash to the song brewed online and amid fellow country artists, streams of Aldean\u2019s Try That in a Small Town have risen 999%, from 987,000 to 11.7m, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Sales of the song have also increased from 1,000 last week to 228,000, according to the music data company Luminate. Country Music Television (CMT) pulled the music video, which intersperses footage of protesters facing off against police with Aldean\u2019s performance at a Tennessee courthouse known for the 1927 lynching of a Black man, from its channel on Tuesday, with no explanation for the decision. It had about 350,000 views on Youtube at the time; now, views have topped 16m. Aldean released the song, which he did not write, in May, but the video premiered on 14 July. The video has been criticized for including images of violent anti-police protesters, promoting gun violence and taking aim at the Black Lives Matter movement. The song\u2019s lyrics include the lines: \u201cCuss out a cop, spit in his face / Stomp on the flag and light it up / Yeah, you think you\u2019re tough / Well, try that in a small town / See how far you make it down the road / Around here, we take care of our own.\u201d The lyrics also allude to a conspiracy theory that the US government plans to round up its citizens\u2019 guns: \u201cGot a gun that my granddad gave me / They say one day they\u2019re gonna round up / Well, that shit might fly in the city, good luck.\u201d Critics of the song include the musician Sheryl Crow, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m from a small town. Even people in small towns are sick of violence. There\u2019s nothing small-town or American about promoting violence. You should know that better than anyone having survived a mass shooting. This is not American or small town-like. It\u2019s just lame.\u201d Crow referred to the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, in which a gunman opened fire during Aldean\u2019s set at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October 2017. Sixty people were killed and 867 injured; Aldean and his band escaped unharmed. As backlash brewed, Aldean defended the song on Twitter, saying it \u201crefers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief\u201d. He also rebutted claims that it targeted the Black Lives Matter movement as \u201cnot only meritless, but dangerous. There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it.\u201d He doubled down while performing over the weekend, and partially blamed \u201ccancel culture\u201d. During a concert at Riverbend Music Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Friday, the 46-year-old singer reflected on his \u201clong-ass week\u201d: \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of stuff suggesting I\u2019m this, suggesting I\u2019m that. Here\u2019s the thing, here\u2019s one thing I feel: I feel like everybody\u2019s entitled to their opinion. You can think something all you want to, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true, right? \u201cWhat I am is a proud American,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be from here. I love our country, I want to see it restored to what it once was before all this bullshit started happening to us. I love our country, I love my family, and I will do anything to protect that. I can tell you that right now.\u201d To cheers and chants of \u201cUSA\u201d, Aldean also lamented \u201ccancel culture\u201d as being \u201csomething that, if people don\u2019t like what you say, they try to make sure they can cancel you, which means try to ruin your life, ruin everything\u201d. He added that \u201cone thing I saw this week was a bunch of country music fans that could see through a lot of the bullshit, all right? I saw country music fans rally like I\u2019ve never seen before and it was pretty badass to watch, I gotta say.\u201d Besides some country music fans, figures such as Donald Trump and Florida governor Ron DeSantis have voiced support for Aldean and the song."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dbf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/ben-stokes-brendon-mccullum-test-cricket-big-three-england-ashes-australia", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Stokes and McCullum want to save Test cricket but what about beyond Big Three? | Jonathan Liew", "lead": "A more equitable system of revenue distribution and guaranteed minimum games for nations is how you save Test cricket rather than focusing on the top", "author": "Jonathan Liew", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 19:00:18", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678002", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb16730090e3891d773c807f022749afccfb43c/0_114_3699_2219/500.jpg", "body": "Cancel the open-topped bus parade. Stash the MBEs back in the drawer. Slap a half-price sticker on the basket of bucket hats. Manchester woke on Monday morning to pale sunshine, a clearing mist, the fog of war lifting from the battlefield. There will be a fifth Ashes Test at the Oval this week, and it will be big. These things always are. But it will unfold in front of a traditional audience of the pre-enlisted. The hostilities continue. But English cricket\u2019s evangelical summer is over. \u201cIt is a massive game for us,\u201d Ben Stokes insisted. But no longer, really, for anybody else. And so it turns out that Test cricket was not saved. Of course it continues to flicker: as well as the Oval Test there are series of varying competitiveness unwinding in Trinidad, where India have just smashed 181 for two off 24 overs against West Indies, and in Colombo where Pakistan are replying to Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings at almost a run a ball. Indeed the Pakistan batter Shan Masood has referenced England as an inspiration for their own vividly attacking approach with the bat. Bazball: coming soon to a cinema near you. But peer a little closer and the revolution seems to be in a more gestational phase. The first giveaway is the empty seats: both stadiums are almost entirely deserted. On the homepage of Trinidad\u2019s Daily Express newspaper, the island\u2019s first Test in five years features just below a report about the national volleyball teams\u2019 performances in the Caribbean Zonal Championships. The Jamaica Gleaner relegates its West Indies coverage to an inside page. Did you not get the memo, guys? Stokes and Brendon McCullum are making this stuff good again. And of England\u2019s numerous ambitious claims for its new style of play, this was perhaps always the vaguest and most intractable. How exactly were you planning on luring Trinidadians to the Queen\u2019s Park Oval, or sparking a bidding war for Sri Lanka\u2019s broadcast rights? It\u2019s a facetious question, of course: they weren\u2019t. And even if you set aside the unintentional whiff of English exceptionalism to their mission, it is worth spending just a little time unpacking what exactly Stokes and McCullum mean when they talk about rescuing the game. Perhaps the closest Stokes has come to a manifesto was in his Players Tribune article ahead of this summer. \u201cCricketers have short careers and I know players are going to make decisions \u2026 based on financial security,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s natural. I really want boards across the world to get their heads around this, which they seem to be having a hard time doing.\u201d Obviously, he\u2019s not going to say the quiet part out loud. Yes, it\u2019s about excitement. It\u2019s about fun. It\u2019s about packed crowds and giving players the licence to express themselves. But it also quite a bit about revenue. Grow this thing, swell the pot, fill our pockets. Or we\u2019re going to America. At which point, the picture splinters a little. Because while playing in thrilling Ashes series and blockbuster Tests against India is terrifically good business for English and Australian and Indian cricketers, it\u2019s not immediately clear how it benefits anyone else. South Africa\u2019s brilliant fast bowler Anrich Nortje has accepted he will never reach 50 Tests because Cricket South Africa can no longer afford to play anything more than a bare minimum of Test cricket. The third-placed team in the most recent World Test Championship will go almost four years without playing a three-Test series. Jason Holder bemoans the fact that his West Indies team will never accumulate the sort of records and statistical milestones that Big Three players routinely celebrate. Angelo Mathews has complained that Sri Lanka only get to play five or six Tests a year. Meanwhile the latest four-year Future Tours Programme offers just 53 Tests to Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, most of them against each other. None of them is currently scheduled to host a Big Three nation in a Test, which is pretty much the only way of making money from the longest format. So again: how exactly does an Ashes series help save Test cricket? Let\u2019s go back to McCullum, speaking on his appointment as coach. \u201cIf Test cricket is to thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand,\u201d he said. This is great news for those four countries. Meanwhile Zimbabwe have not played England since 2003 and when they tried to schedule a one-off Test against Australia in 2022, Australia refused. And of course these are matters way beyond the remit of players or coaches, systemic and financial knots that will not be solved at the drop of a bucket hat. Stokes has been impressively vocal on issues like ticket prices or Test match venues, but it\u2019s a bit of a stretch expecting him to knock on the door of the England and Wales Cricket Board and demand a tour of Afghanistan. He is simply doing what he can. What this underlines, however, is that when the Big Three talk airily about the health of the game, it\u2019s worth interrogating which bits of the game in particular they\u2019re talking about. A more equitable system of revenue distribution, guaranteed minimum games for all nations, a commitment for everybody to play everybody: this is how you save Test cricket. Instead, we continue to indulge the baseless theory that the way of injecting interest into a sport is by shining exemplar, by creating as much revenue and attention at the top and hoping that it somehow filters all the way down. Well, England, Australia and India are scheduled to play each other 34 times between 2023 and 2027. Let\u2019s see if it works."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/trevor-francis-brian-clough-nottingham-forest-england", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Remember Trevor Francis for what he achieved, not what might have been | Jonathan Wilson", "lead": "Technically gifted forward did not meet early expectations, but who could have?

Although never a fastidious dresser himself, Clough looked him up and down and told him off for having his hands in his pockets. Francis, then at Birmingham City, was one of the most hyped players in English football at the time, but he meekly withdrew his hands and muttered: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Two months later, Clough made him the first million-pound British footballer by signing him for Nottingham Forest. Perhaps after a youth as gilded as Francis\u2019s had been, making his debut for Birmingham at the age of 16 and scoring 15 goals in his first 22 games, perhaps after setting a landmark fee, it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Perhaps the expectations were never realistic. Francis had a perfectly decent career. He won two European Cups (although he played in only one final). He won league cups in Scotland and England, as well as a Coppa Italia. He played 52 times for England, scoring a dozen goals. But there was a sense that he did not quite achieve the heights that seemed possible in that season of his debut. But then who could have? Clough was happy enough to boast about breaking the British transfer record but at the same time he seemed always slightly to regret having paid so much for Francis and was determined he shouldn\u2019t get above himself \u2013 not that that ever really seemed especially likely for somebody so resolutely down\u2011to\u2011earth. Clough gave Francis his Forest debut playing for the A-team on a park pitch in front of 40 fans and at half-time made him go and find a pair of shinpads, telling him he\u2019d paid a lot for his legs and didn\u2019t want them damaged. He\u2019d already berated Francis for bringing his own soap and towel to training, rather than using those provided by the club. Francis was cup-tied in the League Cup and ineligible until the semi-final of the European Cup, so for those games Clough made him brew the tea. Clough was concerned that Francis, having been showered with praise since the age of 16, having, as he saw it, never had to graft for his career, might lack the necessary hunger, so he would goad him, asking to see his medals. One arrived soon enough, Francis scoring the winner against Malm\u00f6 in the European Cup final. That goal at the Olympiastadion, the run to the back post to meet John Robertson\u2019s cross \u2013 the two elements of Clough\u2019s coaching combining: the rough diamond and the glamorous signing \u2013 the plunging header and the roll across the discus circle, turned out to be as good as it got. Francis, to Clough\u2019s fury, honoured a pre\u2011existing commitment to the Detroit Express in the NASL. He returned with a groin injury, at which point Clough refused to play him until the union stepped in. Clough, at his worst, could be petty and childish, and Francis often bore the brunt. On one occasion, during a European tie against \u00d6sters, Clough sent him to use a public toilet rather than admit him to the dressing room while he was speaking. On another, coming back from a cup tie at Ipswich, Francis had arranged for his car to be left in a lay-by en route to Nottingham. The car was not there but Clough put him off the bus as arranged, effectively leaving him stranded. Clough blamed Francis for defeat by Wolves in the 1980 League Cup final, sparking a row in which Francis demanded to be played at centre\u2011forward rather than on the right where Clough had taken to fielding him. As he excelled through the middle in the away leg of the European Cup quarter\u2011final against BFC Dynamo and then in the semi-final against Ajax, a more positive future began to seem possible but at the beginning of May he snapped an achilles against Crystal Palace. He was never quite the same again. Francis eventually left Forest early in 1981-82, joining Manchester City for \u00a31.2m but he had become a player who struggled constantly with injury and the following summer, in which he scored winners against Czechoslovakia and Kuwait at the World Cup, he was sold to Sampdoria. Only twice more did he manage more than 20 league games in a season. There was a golden finale as he helped second-division Sheffield Wednesday to secure victory against Manchester United in the 1991 League Cup final and then, as player-manager, led them to promotion the following season. There was a time when he seemed a possible future England manager, and he led Birmingham City to the playoffs and a League Cup final but, after a couple of seasons at Crystal Palace, his career ended in 2003. He was still only 49. There is a goal Francis scored against QPR for Birmingham in 1976, cutting in from the left, creating an angle as he beat two defenders before burying his shot at the near post, that showcases him at his best: technically gifted, spatially aware, explosive and imaginative. He was a player capable of doing things nobody else seemed to do. It\u2019s the curse of those who emerge early to live always in the shadow of an impossible trajectory of development and Francis\u2019s reputation suffered from that as much as from Clough\u2019s constant nagging. But players should be judged on what they did, rather than on their failure to achieve what was imagined for them. Francis was a very fine player and for all that injuries ruined the second half of his career, he\u2019ll always have that header in Munich. Clough may not have trusted him, but it was Francis who put the seal on the Clough legend."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/rishi-sunak-suggests-delay-or-abandon-green-net-zero-pledges", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rishi Sunak signals he could abandon green policies that cost consumers", "lead": "Conservative rightwingers push PM to create dividing line with Labour on environment after narrow byelection win in Uxbridge", "author": "Pippa Crerar and Helena Horton", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:37:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678039", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fde30cf7066bd3ccd4b013fd03ac27a76140eccd/0_125_4458_2675/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has signalled the government could delay or even abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers, as he comes under pressure from the Conservative right to create a dividing line with Labour at the next election. The prime minister said the drive to reach the UK\u2019s net zero targets should not \u201cunnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives\u201d as he rethinks his green agenda after last week\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection. Downing Street confirmed on Monday that the government would \u201ccontinually examine and scrutinise\u201d measures including a ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, phasing out gas boilers by 2035, energy efficiency targets for private rented homes and low-traffic neighbourhoods. However, environmental groups could challenge any decision to water down green policies in court as the government has a legal obligation to set out in detail how it will meet its net zero target by 2050 with clear carbon budgets for different sectors. The move to row back on some green measures comes after the Tories\u2019 opposition to the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) was credited for their narrow byelection victory in Boris Johnson\u2019s former seat on 20 July. Tory strategists believe they could replicate their win in other newly marginal seats across the country by creating clear dividing lines with Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour, which has its own internal tensions over environmental policy since the byelection. On a visit to the West Midlands, where he arrived by helicopter despite the journey only taking 90 minutes by train, Sunak was asked if he would stand up to Tories who are urging against net zero measures after Jacob Rees-Mogg said that \u201cgetting rid of unpopular, expensive green policies\u201d created a political opportunity. The former business secretary told GB News: \u201cI thought Uxbridge was a fundamentally important result for us. It shows that if you are on the side of voters and doing things to make their lives better, rather than worse, then lo and behold people will actually vote for you. \u201cLet other countries catch up and let us catch their breath. Let us move away from an ideological view of net zero and work with the environment in a way that is affordable.\u201d However, Sunak responded: \u201cWe\u2019re living through a time at the moment where inflation is high. That\u2019s having an impact on household and families\u2019 bills. I don\u2019t want to add that, I want to make it easier. \u201cSo yes, we\u2019re going to make progress towards net zero but we\u2019re going to do that in a proportionate and pragmatic way that doesn\u2019t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives \u2013 that\u2019s not what I\u2019m interested in and prepared to do.\u201d Sunak also faces pressure from more environmentally minded Tories. Chris Skidmore, the former net zero tsar, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a crusade, it is the only proportionate and pragmatic way in which the UK can avoid higher costs over time and to establish the industries of the future, rather than be stranded in the past. \u201cNet zero isn\u2019t about ideology, it is about delivering jobs and growth and investing in a transition that is going to happen. The UK has the choice of leading the change, or following, missing out in turn on the investment and jobs that could have been ours for the taking.\u201d Zac Goldsmith, the former environment minister who resigned last month accusing Sunak of being \u201cuninterested\u201d in green issues, urged the prime minister not to use criticism of Ulez as an excuse to backtrack on his net zero pledges. \u201cYou can make the case that it\u2019s a clumsy policy, that it\u2019s going to affect people who can least afford it. There are all kinds of arguments made about that and lots of policies relating to the environment and climate change,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe job of governments and politicians is to find the solutions that are going to be the least painful, most effective, and if that requires you to rethink individual policies then go for it. But what I think is not negotiable, is the overarching challenge that we face.\u201d Cameron Smith, of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \u201cThe lesson from the Uxbridge byelection is that environmental action is only popular if it\u2019s fair and affordable. Ulez expansion failed that test. But voters won\u2019t reward us for ditching popular net zero policies, which will lower people\u2019s bills, create jobs and win investment.\u201d Downing Street is believed to be considering whether to delay a ban on new petrol and diesel car sales beyond 2030. Sunak would only say \u201cof course net zero is important to me\u201d when asked about the policy, adding the approach must be \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d. Hours earlier, the development minister Andrew Mitchell refused to confirm that the ban would stay in place, telling the BBC that while it was policy for now, he could not predict the future. Nevertheless, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson added that while the government remained committed to the ban, it did not want to impose measures that were \u201cunfair on the public\u201d. Ministers are said to be considering whether an \u201cAston Martin exemption\u201d could be introduced to give smaller car manufacturers more time to switch to electric vehicles. The housing secretary, Michael Gove, has suggested the government should \u201crelax the pace\u201d on the deadline for landlords in the private rented sector to make energy improvements to their properties, warning against treating the environment \u201cas a religious crusade\u201d. No 10 said the government was \u201cconsidering the correct approach\u201d on energy efficiency targets for private rented homes. It said the commitment to phase out gas boilers from 2035 remained but that it was considering \u201chow technology evolves\u201d before the deadline. Sunak\u2019s spokesperson stressed that low-traffic neighbourhoods must \u201cwork for local people\u201d and involve \u201cextensive consultation\u201d following reports they were under threat. \u201cIt\u2019s right to listen to consumers and businesses as we progress towards these commitments and understand their concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are long-term commitments for a problem that has been around for a long time. It is right that we continually examine and scrutinise them to understand if they are proportionate and pragmatic.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/bbc-writes-to-farage-to-apologise-over-coutts-bank-account-report", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "BBC writes to Farage to apologise over Coutts bank account report", "lead": "Corporation admits information in story and headline about former Ukip leader \u2018turned out not to be accurate\u2019", "author": "Ben Quinn and Jim Waterson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:31:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678058", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0a88ae41fc63ca364e10a0a4492b2ece36e22577/0_117_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "The BBC has written to Nigel Farage to apologise for its reporting of the closure of the former Ukip leader\u2019s Coutts bank account. The broadcaster reported earlier this month that the private bank had closed the account because he was no longer sufficiently wealthy to hold one. Its headline read: \u201cNigel Farage bank account shut for falling below wealth limit,\u201d while the text of the story said this was what the BBC had \u201cbeen told\u201d \u2013 usually meaning the claim was from a source whose anonymity the broadcaster has chosen to protect. Farage had said he was lodging a formal complaint over the BBC\u2019s reporting. While he had initially focused on the political considerations he said were behind Coutts\u2019 decision to shut his account, the BBC\u2019s subsequent story shifted the spotlight on to his financial affairs. Using a subject access request, he later obtained evidence that suggested both factors were considered by the bank\u2019s bosses. In a statement issued on Monday, the BBC said: \u201cBecause of this evidence, we have since changed the headline and the copy on the original online article about his bank account being shut for falling below the wealth limit to reflect that the claim came from a source and added an update to recognise the story had changed. \u201cWe acknowledge that the information we reported \u2013 that Coutts\u2019 decision on Mr Farage\u2019s account did not involve considerations about his political views \u2013 turned out not to be accurate and have apologised to Mr Farage.\u201d The politician, who now works for GB News, told the channel on Monday that the BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, had sent him \u201can acknowledgment\u201d and that the BBC\u2019s chief executive, Deborah Turness, would be writing to him. Later in the day, the BBC\u2019s business editor, Simon Jack, tweeted: \u201cThe headline on the Farage story has been clarified and an update posted. It should have been clearer at the top that the reason for Mr Farage\u2019s account being closed was commercial was what a source told the BBC. That has been corrected. \u201cThe information on which we based our reporting on Nigel Farage and his bank accounts came from a trusted and senior source. However, the information turned out to be incomplete and inaccurate. Therefore I would like to apologise to Mr Farage.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest banks were due to be summoned to a meeting with the City minister after he raised \u201csignificant concern\u201d over the closure of Farage\u2019s bank account with Coutts. Andrew Griffith was due to send a letter to the bosses of 19 banks including Barclays, Lloyds and NatWest warning that the government was prepared to \u201ctake the action necessary\u201d to protect freedom of speech. He has asked for a roundtable discussion with the banks at the earliest opportunity for assurances that they would ensure customers \u201ccan access payment accounts without fear of being de-banked for their lawful expression\u201d. The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said there were now questions to be asked about the position of the head of NatWest, Alison Rose, who issued a public statement last week and wrote a letter to Farage apologising for the way Coutts, a NatWest subsidiary, had handled its decision to cut ties with the Brexit campaigner. \u201cIf you cannot trust your bank to keep your secret, who can you trust?\u201d said the MP, who referred to suggestions that Rose was the source of the BBC\u2019s reporting. \u201cEven public figures should be able to rely on their doctor and their banker to keep confidential the exchanges they have. If Dame Alison has broken this, she must go, and therefore she must answer the question: \u2018Was she the source for the BBC?\u2019 Has she in fact landed the BBC in the minestrone?\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/24/mps-sunak-attend-cop28-net-zero-all-party-group-climate", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs urge Sunak to attend Cop28 and stay true to net zero", "lead": "All-party climate group says backing away from green policies would be catastrophic for the economy", "author": "Fiona Harvey Environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:21:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678077", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/91f6ed1f504c932b735da5c8ae04d242eeb2499a/0_170_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "A cross-party group of influential politicians has urged Rishi Sunak to set an example by attending the UN climate summit this November, as both major parties come under pressure over their net-zero policies.

As the Office for Budget Responsibility advised, continuing to rely on gas at the current level will come at double the cost of transitioning to net zero. \u201cAs you were recently warned by top energy companies, backing away from green policies would be catastrophic for the economy.\u201d Zac Goldsmith, a former Tory minister who resigned last month, blaming Sunak for his failure to lead on green issues, is the most prominent Conservative among the 23 signatories, which also include the former Labour minister Hilary Benn, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Daisy Cooper, and the outgoing Green party MP Caroline Lucas. Lord Randall, the former environment advisor to Theresa May, is among the Tories signing, and there were two Scottish National party signatories. Sunak has faced calls from sections of his party and the media to row back on green commitments after the Tory victory in the Uxbridge byelection last Thursday, where concerns over the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) were judged to be a significant factor. The prime minister said on Monday that green policies must be \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has been urged not to retreat on his climate and environment proposals after pledging to \u201creflect\u201d after the Uxbridge result. The letter called on Sunak to reject the Rosebank oilfield in the North Sea, which experts have found would do almost nothing for the UK\u2019s energy security but would add substantially to greenhouse gas emissions. The letter also called for a reaffirmation of the government\u2019s commitment to halt deforestation by 2030. Benn, a former environment secretary under Gordon Brown, pointed to a recent report from the climate change committee that found the UK had lost its international leadership on the climate through a series of policy failures. \u201cThe journey to a net-zero Britain offers permanent energy affordability and new economic opportunities across our regions. The country is crying out for this type of change,\u201d Benn said. \u201cRishi Sunak must heed our advice and get on with the job.

Members of the LGBTQ+ community have also expressed unease over his actions, fearing that the episode risks further exacerbating the hostilities they face. \u201cHe gets to fly out of the country and not face the consequences, while our people have to face the brunt of what just happened,\u201d said the drag performer Carmen Rose, who described the speech as self-serving, adding that it risked undoing the work of activists. The British pop-rock singer was headlining the Good Vibes festival when he criticised the country\u2019s homophobic laws in a profanity-laden speech. He was holding what appeared to be a wine bottle and spat on the stage as he spoke. He said: \u201cUnfortunately you don\u2019t get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I\u2019m fucking furious. And that\u2019s not fair on you, because you\u2019re not representative of your government. Because you\u2019re young people, and I\u2019m sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\u201d The comment was met with some cheers from the audience. Healy then kissed the bass player Ross MacDonald as they played the song I Like America &amp; America Likes Me. About 30 minutes later the band walked off stage, with Healy announcing they were now banned. The following day, organisers of the festival announced that the entire weekend event had been cancelled. The government has also said it will tighten entry requirements for foreign artists to perform in Malaysia, according to local media. Dhia Rezki Rohaizad, the deputy president of Jejaka, a social support group for gay, bisexual and queer men in Malaysia, criticised the government\u2019s handling of the situation, citing Healy\u2019s right to freedom of expression. But he added that Healy\u2019s speech was not how many activists in the country would have wanted to highlight the issue. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on the ground, community organising, and having stakeholder meetings with local government agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing it at this scale, with a lot of people who are not aware of the discussions going around with regards to queer activism, that is what is harmful.\u201d Malaysia\u2019s federal penal code, first introduced during British colonial rule, punishes oral and anal sex with up to 20 years in prison. Each state and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya also have sharia codes that generally criminalise gay sex and gender nonconformity. Activists have warned of increased intolerance over recent years, citing in particular a raid on an LGBTQ+ Halloween party in Kuala Lumpur last year, when 20 people were arrested. \u201cFor people who live in Kuala Lumpur, the raid was a very scary night and I think that since then a lot of us do live in fear,\u201d said Mikhail Hanafi, a member of the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cIn a lot of other places in the world, queer nightlife is one of the places where at least a subset of queer people can feel safe and a sense of community.\u201d This was no longer the case in Malaysia, Hanafi said, adding that when the lights came on in a club at the end of the night, some friends immediately felt a sense of panic, fearing that this was the sign of another police raid. There was value in foreign performers speaking out, said Hanafi. But he added: \u201cThey need to be mindful of how they speak. They need to speak to the community beforehand.\u201d Activists are especially concerned that Healy\u2019s comments come just weeks before state elections. Campaigning often coincided with a rise in hate speech, said Thilaga Sulathireh, a founder of the group Justice for Sisters, which advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. On Monday, the national human rights commission of Malaysia said that while it \u201cadvocates equality for all and freedom of expression, it is important to stress that these rights must be practised responsibly and within any restrictions imposed by local laws and cultural considerations\u201d.

Tuberville is seeking to bring down a Department of Defense policy that allows service members based in states which restrict abortion rights to travel to ones where such healthcare remains available. The secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, has defended the policy. He has also said nearly 650 senior posts requiring Senate confirmation could be unfilled by the end of the year. Tuberville wants a Senate vote on the policy. Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said last week Democrats \u201cwould not object to\u201d a vote but added: \u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s up to the Republican leadership. They are risking our security, and it\u2019s up to them to fix it.\u201d In their Monday letter, the eight Democratic senators \u2013 led by Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and including Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), Tammy Duckworth (Illinois) and Jacky Rosen (Nevada) \u2013 expressed \u201cdeep concern for the stability of our armed services and national security and call on [McConnell] to exercise your leadership to protect the readiness of our military\u201d. Tuberville\u2019s block was \u201cthreatening our national security\u201d, the senators said, adding: \u201cWe know you share our concerns \u2026 and as the leader of your conference, we urge you to take stronger action to resolve this situation\u201d. McConnell has said he does not support Tuberville\u2019s protest but has not moved to end it. The senators added: \u201cAlthough there are numerous ways to legislatively change this policy, senator Tuberville has failed to convince a majority of the Senate to agree with his position. \u201cHe continues to try to force his personal beliefs on the women and men who volunteer to serve our country, creating unnecessary havoc and punishing service members for a policy they had no part in writing.\u201d Describing the effects on service members denied promotions, the senators said: \u201cFamilies who were ordered to move are now living in temporary family housing, children aren\u2019t able to ready themselves for new schools, and spouses are missing vital employment opportunities.\u201d Also on Monday, Tuberville took delivery of a petition from the Secure Families Initiative, an advocacy group for military families. It said: \u201cNo matter your political beliefs, we must agree that service members and military families will not be used as political leverage. It\u2019s time to end this political showmanship and recommit to respect the service and sacrifice of those who pledge to defend this nation.\u201d The petition was also sent to Schumer and McConnell. In his own petition last week, Tuberville claimed support from more than 5,000 military veterans. The eight Democrats who wrote to McConnell also said the Kentuckian, as Republican leader, should hold \u201ccolleagues accountable when they recklessly cross boundaries and upend senatorial order. \u201cSenator Tuberville\u2019s continuation of this stalemate is reckless, dangerous, and must end.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/travel-firms-rhodes-profiteering-alicia-kearns-tory-says", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Travel firms flying tourists to Rhodes are \u2018profiteering\u2019, senior Tory says", "lead": "Alicia Kearns backs calls for the government to advise against travel to the Greek island", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:13:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678137", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5adb34ef63a03106aa66201c0257c90725cf7f63/0_605_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "Travel firms that continue to fly tourists to Rhodes have been accused of \u201cprofiteering\u201d by a senior Conservative, as ministers faced pressure over official travel advice for the island, where 10,000 British tourists have been stranded. As flights rescuing holidaymakers began arriving in the UK on Monday, calls continued for a change in the Foreign Office\u2019s stance on the categorisation of Rhodes to enable tourists to get a refund for their trips through their travel insurance. Alicia Kearns, a Tory MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs select committee, backed calls for the government to advise the public against travel to Rhodes, but added that she understood it was reluctant to be an outlier. \u201cThe reality of the government\u2019s position is in line with our allies in Europe, because no one wants to compromise Greece\u2019s heavily tourism-dependent economy at this time,\u201d she said. She also drew a distinction between companies that had acted to cancel package holidays and others who had continued to operate flights. \u201cUltimately, we need companies to step up and recognise that people will not be able to have the holiday that was booked for them,\u201d she said. \u201cI know there is a statutory duty for the government to get British citizens home if they are in trouble, but travel companies have to live up to their obligations rather than making profits from flights carrying tourists out, and then stepping away and letting the government sort out how to get them home in some cases.\u201d Earlier on Monday, a Foreign Office minister declined to advise people not to travel, suggesting instead that they contact their tour operator, and stressing that the fires were confined to one part of the island. Andrew Mitchell also said evacuations were not taking place on Corfu, areas of which were also ablaze, as had been reported. He said this was because the fires there were not affecting tourist areas. While Mitchell said in the morning that his department had received 20 requests for assistance, a spokesperson later said it would \u201cnot be providing a running commentary\u201d on the number of British nationals asking for help. Meanwhile, there was pressure on the government from Labour MPs and the Liberal Democrats, who said that Rhodes should immediately be added to the \u201cred list\u201d of places to which the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel. \u201cMany families are unable to make a claim against their insurance \u2013 leaving them paying the penalty for deciding not to fly out to the island,\u201d said Layla Moran, the Lib Dems\u2019 foreign affairs spokesperson. Amid criticism over the length of time it took for the UK government to deploy a team of officials to the island to liaise with stranded British tourists, Stephen Doughty, a shadow foreign minister, wrote to the Foreign Office to ask when the decision to send the team was taken. He also asked that travel operators be urged to provide flexibility to those who have trips coming up to affected areas and want to avail themselves of alternatives. Mitchell had estimated the number of British tourist on Rhodes at between 7,000 and 10,000. When asked if the government was officially advising against more people travelling there on Monday, he said holidaymakers should contact their tour operator. \u201cThere were only 10 free beds on the whole island when I asked yesterday,\u201d he told Times Radio. \u201cBut we think something like 1,000 beds may well come back on stream today as others don\u2019t now come and therefore more beds are available.\u201d Mitchell said the government was not advising against travel to Rhodes because \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that only 10% of the island is affected by these fires, and therefore it is the tourist companies and the holiday experts who are best placed to give guidance on whether or not a family or individuals\u2019 holidays are going to be ruined by these events\u201d. Asked if he would personally go on holiday there at the moment, he said: \u201cI think I probably wouldn\u2019t. But the point is that if I had booked a holiday I would take advice and would take advice also from the tour operator.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-dies-aged-67", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "BBC newsreader George Alagiah dies aged 67", "lead": "Alagiah was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014 \u2013 for which he underwent 17 rounds of chemotherapy", "author": "Hannah J Davies and Jim Waterson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:12:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678156", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/efab17654df28dff5755dfd1a80ef1fb5f25b850/0_75_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "The BBC newsreader George Alagiah has died at the age of 67 after being diagnosed with bowel cancer nine years ago, his agent has said. One of the BBC\u2019s best-known journalists, he presented the BBC News at Six for two decades, having previously had a lengthy career as a foreign correspondent. Alagiah died peacefully on Monday morning \u201csurrounded by his family and loved ones\u201d, according to his agent, Mary Greenham. She said: \u201cGeorge fought until the bitter end but sadly that battle ended earlier today. George was deeply loved by everybody who knew him, whether it was a friend, a colleague or a member of the public. He simply was a wonderful human being. My thoughts are with [his wife] Fran, the boys and his wider family.\u201d Alagiah was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2014, for which he underwent 17 rounds of chemotherapy before returning to screens. He took breaks for further treatment as the cancer spread but always targeted a return to the newsroom. Alagiah stepped away from broadcasting duties for the final time last October, saying that working in the BBC newsroom had \u201cbeen such an important part of keeping energised and motivated\u201d. He told the Guardian in 2020 that he was happy with his life, despite the illness. \u201cOn being diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014, I constructed a pros and cons list of how my life had gone so far,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things that had gone well far outweighed the others, which brought me to a place of total contentment. \u201cWhen you\u2019re closer to your last day, you live each one with an intensity you couldn\u2019t have previously imagined. Of course I wish I never had this disease, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d give these six years back. With friends, family and colleagues I\u2019ve shared experiences and thoughts that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had.\u201d He also used his illness to raise awareness of bowel cancer and promote testing kits for the disease. Fellow newsreader Fiona Bruce paid tribute to Alagiah. She said: \u201cGeorge was that rare thing \u2013 a first-rate journalist and an all round lovely human being. Integrity and decency shone through him. That and a mischievous sense of humour with an endearing giggle. \u201cI remember his 60th birthday party, surrounded by his wonderful family and his glamorous sisters like so many birds of paradise. It was an intimate family affair and I know George counted his blessings to be there with the people he loved so much. \u201cHe fought with all he had to stay with them as long as he could. We loved him in the newsroom and we \u2013 I \u2013 miss him so much.\u201d Clive Myrie, presenting the BBC One O\u2019Clock News, told viewers: \u201cGeorge touched all of us here in the newsroom with his kindness and generosity, his warmth and good humour. We loved him here at BBC News and I loved him as a mentor, colleague and friend.\u201d His BBC colleague Naga Munchetty broke down in tears on air while reporting the news of Alagiah\u2019s death. Speaking to the listeners of her 5 Live show, she said: \u201cApologies for the emotion in my voice \u2013 he was so loved in our newsroom.\u201d She later added: \u201cHe was a voice we trusted and he was someone I can personally say I loved, he supported me greatly.\u201d Alagiah was born to a Tamil family in Colombo, Ceylon \u2013 now Sri Lanka. His parents moved to Ghana and then to England when was 11, where he would study politics at the University of Durham. He said he was thankful to have been rejected for a job by the BBC when he first tried to join the broadcaster. \u201c[They] turned me down three times at the start of my career, and I\u2019m grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cHad I joined then, I\u2019d have entered a very white world, dominated by people from a certain class and set of institutions. \u201cTaking a job at South magazine [where he was Africa editor] informed how I report on international affairs to this day. The globe looks different depending on where you\u2019re standing.\u201d After seven years in print journalism, he joined the BBC in 1989, initially working in London before a career as a correspondent in countries including South Africa, genocide-era Rwanda, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. Alagiah went on to helm news programmes for the corporation including the One O\u2019Clock News and Six O\u2019Clock News, and coverage of events including Hurricane Katrina. He was also a regular as the BBC\u2019s specialist on African politics, interviewing figures including Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. Alagiah was awarded an OBE in 2008 for services to journalism. He was the author of two nonfiction books. In 2019, he wrote a novel, The Burning Land, set in South Africa. In 2020, he said the cancer had spread to his lungs, liver and lymph nodes. In late 2022, it was announced he would step down from his presenting duties after a further spread of his illness. The BBC director general, Tim Davie, said: \u201cAcross the BBC, we are all incredibly sad to hear the news about George. We are thinking of his family at this time. George was one of the best and bravest journalists of his generation who reported fearlessly from across the world as well as presenting the news flawlessly. \u201cHe was more than just an outstanding journalist, audiences could sense his kindness, empathy and wonderful humanity. He was loved by all and we will miss him enormously.\u201d Alagiah is survived by his wife, Frances, and sons, Adam and Matthew."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/uk-tourists-rhodes-wildfires-luggage-hotels", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018A near-death experience\u2019: UK tourists describe escape from Rhodes wildfires", "lead": "Travellers say they faced \u2018absolute chaos\u2019 as they were forced to flee with luggage still at hotels", "author": "Jedidajah Otte", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:02:28", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678175", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b811224590f8d9b5a22e70dd6bb589f842266556/0_0_3227_1936/500.jpg", "body": "Dean Mason, 56, from Rothley in Leicestershire, described getting caught up in the Rhodes wildfires as a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d. Mason arrived at a hotel in Kiotari beach a week ago with his wife, daughter, and four-year-old granddaughter. \u201cIt was my granddaughter\u2019s first holiday abroad. By Tuesday morning, we could see large plumes of smoke coming up from the centre of the island,\u201d the IT project manager said. \u201cWe were led to believe everything was under control. Nobody seemed particularly concerned. \u201cOn Friday evening it was getting quite bad, there were bits of ash falling on us, but we were again assured by the hotel everything was OK. We spent Saturday morning in the pool. It was nice and very hot, and a lot windier than on previous days. \u201cBy 11.30am on Saturday I could see very large plumes of smoke suddenly looking not a million miles away from where we were. People started to look at one another. Not long after that you could see the sky was starting to fill with smoke. Within five minutes, I could see flames on the hillside around us. Then the hotel alarm went off.\u201d The family rushed back to their room to pack some hand luggage and grab their passports before fleeing to the beach. \u201cThere was just a lot of hotel staff going \u2018Get out, get out\u2019,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere was a complete lack of any structured support. There was a lot of hysteria. You were being coated in ash, the sun was completely covered by yellow smoke.\u201d The family was split up as local people took them to two different nearby communities on boats, before they were reunited a few hours later and dropped in the centre of Lindos. \u201cThere were just hundreds of coaches and thousands of people just desperate to go somewhere. It felt like the end of days,\u201d Mason said. Eventually, the family were able to secure seats on a plane back to the UK. \u201cWe got back to Birmingham early Sunday morning. Being asked to fill in a questionnaire [by a travel rep] after this near-death experience wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted to hear. Our belongings are still at the hotel, but I think we were incredibly fortunate to get out of there.\u201d Adam Walker, 33, a business analyst from Telford, flew to Rhodes on Friday night with his wife, mother-in-law and two young children, for a holiday in the popular beach resort of Pefkos on the east coast of the island. \u201cWe arrived at 2am on Saturday. When we were in the pool that afternoon we could see smoke in the distance, and a red glow on top of the hill. There was ash falling on us during dinner. At midnight on Saturday we were told by text message to leave our hotel and move to the beach. It was absolute chaos,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThere was mixed messaging about whether to take bags or not. After about half an hour we were told to walk about half a kilometre to the top of the hill with our bags, but there was no information from anyone about where we were going. Everyone was upset as they were trying to figure out where to send people as it was happening.\u201d Eventually, Walker said, buses came and took scores of holidaymakers to Rhodes town. \u201cWe were left at a school, where we got our towels and clothes out and lay on tiles. There were power cuts and at times no running water, with toilets overflowing.\u201d Walker was disappointed to find there was no direct support and communication from his travel operator during the evacuation. \u201cThere were no representatives anywhere. We were helped by local Greek volunteers, lots of students turned up at some point. There wasn\u2019t much sleeping going on.\u201d Walker said his family had no idea there were fires raging in the area before they set off from the UK. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen it at all on the news. It all kicked off properly the day we landed.\u201d The family spent all day at the school and were told on Sunday evening that they would be able to board a plane back to the UK free of charge. \u201cAt some point on Sunday, people were told they could go back to the resort [by the travel operator], which some people did before being evacuated again. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where the flights were going in the UK, and were asked to put down a preference for where we wanted to go.\u201d The family arrived back in Birmingham on Monday morning, with some of their belongings still at their hotel in Pefkos. Walker said he had yet to contact the travel company for a refund. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to pack everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you cannot plan for the fires, and understand this year\u2019s fires are extreme, but they could have had an evacuation plan in place in case something like this happened.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dc9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/which-green-policies-could-the-tories-ditch-after-uxbridge", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Which green policies could the Tories ditch after Uxbridge?", "lead": "Since the byelection fought over Ulez, party sources suggest some environmental measures may be on borrowed time", "author": "Helena Horton and Kiran Stacey", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 18:00:32", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678193", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3a1025348631d2ffa8a0ac6f06c8ec0c23c8bdff/0_287_5395_3237/500.jpg", "body": "The Tories\u2019 narrow victory over Labour at the Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection has triggered soul searching in both parties about the direction of their green policies. Voters rejected the Labour candidate, Danny Beales, after a campaign fought almost entirely over a single issue: Sadiq Khan\u2019s plans to extend the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) for cars. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has urged the London mayor to \u201creflect\u201d on the policy to extend Ulez, while Conservative sources have suggested a range of green initiatives could now be on the chopping block. Expanding fossil fuel production One of the clearest divisions between Labour and the Conservatives is now over what should happen to Britain\u2019s remaining fossil fuel reserves. Labour has promised not to issue any more oil or gas licences for the North Sea if it comes to power next year, a position for which the party has come under attack from both the Conservatives and some trade unions. This weekend, however, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, confirmed to the Financial Times that the government\u2019s policy was to \u201cmax out\u201d the North Sea\u2019s oil and gas stores. The Climate Change Committee\u2019s latest report says: \u201cExpansion of fossil fuel production is not in line with net zero. As well as pushing forward strongly with new low-carbon industries, net zero also makes it necessary to move away from high-carbon developments.\u201d 2030 petrol and diesel car ban Senior Conservatives responded to the Uxbridge byelection victory by urging Rishi Sunak to drop the government\u2019s commitment to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2030. When asked on Monday if he intended to stand by the policy, Sunak notably failed to answer the question. \u201cOf course net zero is important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yes, we\u2019re going to keep making progress towards our net zero ambitions and we\u2019re also going to strengthen our energy security.\u201d Downing Street later insisted the target had not changed. But in a hint that it could be removed in future, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cIt is right that if the situation changes and new technology evolves that we keep our approach under review and make sure that it is the right one. \u201cEqually at a time of global high inflation, which is hitting the public hard, we need to make sure that we\u2019re getting the balance right.\u201d LTN ban Low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTN) have become a highly sensitive political topic, feeding into a broader culture war over car use in cities. Under an array of schemes that were rolled out during the pandemic, motorists are restricted in driving on certain roads in the hope of reducing traffic flows in parts of towns and cities. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, recently called for a review of LTNs, but the national government is limited in how it can interfere with policies that are set by local authorities. The Times reported on Monday that ministers could refuse to grant access to the DVLA database to councils that want to impose new LTNs, which would make it impossible for them to monitor the schemes using numberplate recognition cameras. Downing Street said: \u201cThe government\u2019s view is that they need to work for local people [and] they need to involve extensive consultation. We\u2019ve seen some councils remove some LTNs where they don\u2019t work for people in the past.\u201d Landlords and insulation One important element of the government\u2019s push to hit its Paris climate targets is the insistence that all landlords should have a C energy efficiency rating by 2028. \u201cWe\u2019re asking too much too quickly,\u201d Gove told the Sunday Telegraph this weekend. \u201cWe do want to move towards greater energy efficiency, but just at this point, when landlords face so much, I think that we should relax the pace that\u2019s been set for people in the private rented sector.\u201d The UK\u2019s inefficient homes now account for 21% of all carbon emissions. According to research by the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations in England, England\u2019s 25m homes \u2013 which produce 58.5m tonnes of CO2 every year \u2013 emit the equivalent of the average annual use of 28m cars. Helen Clarkson, the chief executive of the Climate Group, said: \u201cAsking landlords to fix draughty flats will save far more than it costs. Instead of giving up on targets, options to better support smaller landlords, like tax incentives used in other countries, should be considered.\u201d Gas boiler ban in new-builds Under current policy, developers will not be allowed to fit new homes with gas boilers by 2025, with many expected to use heat pumps instead. Additionally ministers are proposing that manufacturers of fossil fuel boilers would have to install a certain number of heat pumps for every fossil fuel boiler they sell. That quota is due to come into force next year, but lobbyists have been pushing for this to be delayed to 2026. The energy minister, Martin Callanan, tweeted support for heat pumps on Monday, saying: \u201cGovernment policy remains that heat pumps will be the main solution for decarbonising heat in UK.\u201d Downing Street said the 2025 deadline \u201cremains our commitment\u201d. But a spokesperson added: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously right we consider how technology evolves over time as we progress towards 2035.\u201d However, the policy is subject to intense lobbying from the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Conservative MPs.

Toone is a different style of player, a very, very good one with bags of potential, but more box-to-box. Against Haiti, Toone had most success shifted to the left and struggled to make things happen down the middle. If Sarina Wiegman is not going to change the shape to make the midfield work most effectively with the sum of its parts, then Lauren James is the more natural successor to Kirby. Against Haiti, James coming on as a wide player, in place of Lauren Hemp, felt like a missed opportunity. Yes, Hemp was on a yellow card and perhaps it was a slightly precautionary move but James showed in the pre-tournament friendly against Portugal just how well-suited she is to the number 10 role. Be less predictable Without Kirby to find space where there is none, against teams who defend narrowly to block off that route England lose the unpredictability that made them so potent last summer. Part of the beauty and threat of the Euros-winning team was that it was difficult to know where the goals would come from. The Lionesses were a threat out wide and through the middle and that made them harder to defend against. There is no Leah Williamson to play out from the back, there is no Kirby to unlock the most stubborn defences, and so England\u2019s greatest threat is from their wide players, either coming inside or putting in crosses. That predictability could prove costly, particularly against lower-ranked sides who are less likely to play an expansive game that gives England options. Reorganise the defence England struggled defensively against Haiti and that is a concern. Wiegman has had five weeks to try to get her favoured backline in sync but it didn\u2019t quite click in Brisbane. Millie Bright is back but she was clearly rusty, having not played competitively since March. Giving her 90 minutes against Haiti will have presumably been in part to get as many minutes in the centre-back\u2019s legs as possible. Hopefully match action will have gelled the backline in ways they couldn\u2019t in training. Who partners Bright is also still an open question, with Jess Carter not overly convincing in the first game and Alex Greenwood\u2019s shift into the left-back position as a result not necessarily playing to her strengths. If Wiegman is going to persist with Alessia Russo up top then there is an argument to say that Rachel Daly should revert to her Euros starting position at left-back, with the option of shifting her forward later on. That would allow Greenwood to resume the partnership she established with Bright in the run-up to the Euros before Williamson\u2019s experiment in midfield was over. A backline of Lucy Bronze, Bright, Greenwood and Daly, three out of four of the European Championship winning back four, would be a strong one. Bench worries in hunt for goals The Lionesses need a goal from open play. They may all say they are unworried and it is creating chances that matter, but there can be no doubt there will be a wave of relief when they see the ball ripple the back of the net from open play for the first time since April. Russo was hugely impactful coming off the bench alongside Toone last year but in a starting role she has struggled to make the chances count. The goals will come, particularly if Wiegman solves the lack of creativity through the middle, but the bigger issue is that Daly and Bethany England are far less effective off the bench than Russo is. If anything, Russo did too good a job last summer. Against Haiti, the introduction of James and Daly had an impact but it was worlds away from the dynamism of Toone and Russo at the Euros. The question is whether Wiegman, who is known for sticking with a tried and tested starting XI, has decided she is already done with the testing and stays with the same formula. Take Earps\u2019 tips on handling pressure When Mary Earps spoke out over her failed fight to get England\u2019s goalkeeper shirt on sale to the public, she knew it heaped pressure on her to perform. \u201cIf we can be more successful, our voice can be more valuable,\u201d she said. Much as it is a \u201cdamaging message\u201d \u2013 in Earps\u2019s words \u2013 to be able to talk about issues only if you are successful, it is a reality that success helps. Earps shrugged off that pressure against Haiti, though, her fine saves making up for the team\u2019s defensive lapses. Earps\u2019s managing of the added pressure, of speaking out within days of doing so, was hugely impressive. Last year, in England\u2019s opening game of the Euros against Austria, the team looked a little hesitant under the fiercest of spotlights. They got the job done though, a 1-0 win kickstarting their run to the trophy. Against Haiti they looked similarly rusty. It is Denmark up next and if the rest of the squad need tips on managing the pressure, they should look at their No 1."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dcb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/aoc-hollywood-strike-new-york", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "AOC joins Hollywood picket line in New York: \u2018Solidarity is stronger than greed\u2019", "lead": "Congresswoman walks picket line and criticizes the wealth of studio executives as contract negotiations remain at loggerheads", "author": "Michael Sainato", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:58:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678233", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c485c52f15f4bb06dfdaa6eef18dd0a663010188/0_33_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the picket line of film and television actors and writers represented by Sag-Aftra and WGA in front of Netflix\u2019s New York City office on Monday.

The 30-year-old became Baroness Owen of Alderley Edge after being formally introduced to the upper chamber on Monday afternoon. Johnson nominated seven of his close allies to the Lords as part of his controversial resignation honours list, of which Owen was one of the last to take her seat. Three of those nominated were in their 30s, including Ross Kempsell, a 31-year-old former journalist, and Ben Houchen, the 36-year-old Tees Valley mayor. The former prime minister\u2019s decision to nominate Owen was criticised not only because of her age, but also because of her relatively junior role. She was an official in Downing Street under Johnson, but her exact role and length of tenure have been questioned. While her own LinkedIn profile states that she served as a No 10 special adviser from February 2021 until October 2022, she is not listed in the official government directory of special advisers published in June 2021. Owen graduated from the University of York in 2015 before working for the communications firm Portland. She was a constituency intern for the Tory MP William Wragg for one month and then worked for others in the party, including Chris Heaton-Harris, Alok Sharma and Jake Berry. Owen is not the only name on Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list to have prompted questions. Kulveer Ranger was nominated to the Lords after serving as director of transport policy while Johnson was London mayor. But he was also credited as having been a \u201cspecial adviser to the UK government on digital strategy\u201d \u2013 a role that does not appear on his LinkedIn profile. Houchen has been accused of \u201cindustrial-scale corruption\u201d over a redevelopment project at the former Redcar steelworks, something he has denied. The list also triggered upset among some of those whose names did not appear, including Nadine Dorries, who has threatened to quit as MP for Mid Bedfordshire after accusing Downing Street of having manoeuvred to make sure she would not receive a peerage.

In Manchester at least. In parts of Greece it was wildfires. For Rishi Sunak it was just a bonfire. A bonfire of green policy. The world was not quite warm enough. What the UK needed was a culture war. Who would have guessed that the result of one byelection in west London could have such far-reaching consequences? The message Labour took from Uxbridge was that maybe Sadiq Khan would like to rethink his Ulez scheme with a general election due in less than 18 months. When it should have maybe pointed out during the byelection campaign itself that the clean air scheme had actually been introduced by the Tories. And that the then transport secretary, Grant Shapps, had written to Khan to enforce it. Instead, Labour had tried to disown it entirely, hoping voters would ignore it. Go figure. Let the public die. For the Tories, Uxbridge was a clear opportunity. Labour had lost a byelection that it would otherwise have won on a single issue. A green issue. Therefore the message was clear. The environment was a vote-loser. So what better time to appease all the halfwits on the Conservative right and start ditching green policies? Hell, we\u2019d even drawn a crucial Test match because of the rain and Lee Anderson and the rest of the GB News team had spent the weekend inside, wrapped up in sweaters, trying to dodge the cold. Global warming? You must be having a laugh. Save that for your southern Europeans. Serve them right for staying in the EU. Their punishment for believing the climate science. Wish fulfilment and all that. All it took to stop global warming was not to believe in it. Simples. So over the weekend, briefings from Downing Street had been leaked to the media that Sunak\u2019s government was having second thoughts about its environmental agenda. No matter that polling has consistently found that green policies are popular \u2013 most of the country understands the climate crisis; the Conservatives were going to play devil\u2019s advocate. Drive a wedge between them and Labour. Attack Keir Starmer for misdirecting the nation\u2019s resources on preventing something that may never happen. They knew better than the scientists. Besides, it was all such a long way off so we didn\u2019t really need to think about it. Something like that. On Monday morning, Sunak was up in Birmingham on a pointless visit to promote a housing announcement that Michael Gove was making back in London. Understandably, the media were mainly interested in the changes to his net-zero targets. Rish! looked irritated. Partly because he always does when challenged. He hates criticism, believing himself to be right on all topics. But also because he is genuinely uninterested \u2013 incurious even \u2013 in green politics. It\u2019s a sideshow. All that matters is inflation and growth. \u201cNo,\u201d said Sunak. Nothing had changed. The government was still committed to doing the bare minimum that would cost virtually nothing. To prove his enthusiasm, he had even taken the helicopter. And it had been a hassle as his normal one had been double-booked. But it was important to make a point. That totally unnecessary air travel was totally necessary. Even if it took longer than the train. You couldn\u2019t expect a prime minister to take Avanti. You wouldn\u2019t believe the trash that travelled in first class these days. Imagine having to share a toilet with a stranger. And the coffee was filthy. Net zero must be pursued in a \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d manner, Rish! insisted. As in, disproportionate and unpragmatic. Because if the government was interested in a proportionate response, it would already be doing more. We\u2019re already doing far too little. And unpragmatic because by doing too little we risk making no discernible difference to climate collapse. So it\u2019s a waste of money and the planet gets trashed anyway. Or a win-win, as Sunak would probably call it. The way Rish! sees it is like this. Far better for the Tories to come up with an outside chance of winning the next election than to worry about something that might happen some time further into the future. What the world definitely needs is more Rish!. And if it gets that, everything will be fine. You can get too hung up on climate science. So doing less to prevent global warming makes total sense. Typical woke lefties, trying to make people care about something existential. Things would work out one way or the other. So southern Europe might have to adapt a bit. People might have to learn to live underground. Or just reverse their days. Sleep during the day and work all night. It certainly wasn\u2019t a problem for the UK. And if the Maldives disappeared under water, people would just have to find somewhere else to go on holiday. It was no biggie. What the world needed was for the UK to take a back seat. To do as little as possible while still pretending to give a shit. Having laid out his green credentials, Sunak went back to housing. The government was going to meet its promise of building 1m new homes in this parliament. Time was, the government doing what it said it was going to wouldn\u2019t merit an announcement. But these days it\u2019s a total outlier. Worthy of a lead item on the evening news. And any number of helicopter rides. Shame it wasn\u2019t one of Rish!\u2019s five vague aspirations. None of which look likely to happen. Sadly, Sunak was inadvertently also able to confirm that another of his housing policies \u2013 to build 300,000 new homes a year \u2013 was not going to happen. Unless you counted those homes that only existed in his imagination. Because 300,000 new homes a year equates to 1.5m over the parliament. A complete non-starter. No wonder Sunak thinks the UK could do with some more maths lessons. Starting with him. Down in London, Michael Gove was giving his big speech in King\u2019s Cross. Like most things the Govester does these days, he managed to sound bored and semi-detached throughout. Pining for the crack den on his department\u2019s roof, no doubt. Or just numbed by the realisation that his announcement didn\u2019t amount to much. Just a few policies reannounced with a few bits of wishful thinking thrown in. Let\u2019s face it, doubling the size of Cambridge in the foreseeable future just isn\u2019t going to happen. The Govester is sharp enough to know this. So he just goes through the motions barely making the effort to summon the pretence. His eye is mainly on what comes next: his future after government. He\u2019s not a man who wants to sit for long on the opposition benches. He can see this won\u2019t end well. That he\u2019s making promises in speeches he will never deliver. There\u2019s only so much futility the man can take."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dce", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/24/elon-musk-x-rebrand-twitter-tesla-everything-app", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Will Elon Musk\u2019s X rebrand help Twitter soar to new heights?", "lead": "Analysts question whether Tesla boss will manage to turn around platform with plans for \u2018everything app\u2019", "author": "Dan Milmo Global technology editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:47:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678292", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b7034a8fc68b6033b848290c748867e84bde1b02/0_98_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "When Elon Musk tweeted \u201cthe bird is freed\u201d as he bought Twitter last year, it was presumed he was referring to liberating the platform from its figurative shackles. Now he has booted the brand out of the nest altogether. Musk\u2019s announcement on Sunday that he was rebranding Twitter as X is the latest of many dramatic moves by the social media network\u2019s owner. If Twitter isn\u2019t worth the $44bn he paid for it in October, it is in danger of being worth even less now if it does away with its well-established brand name and avian logo (Musk said on Sunday it would soon be time to bid \u201cadieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds\u201d). But the emergence of X has long been in the works, no matter how rushed Sunday\u2019s events seemed, with the helter-skelter feel of the rebranding exercise underlined by the choice of a crowdsourced logo based on an international encoding standard. And such has been the resulting splash, the X brand has at least made a loud debut. Musk tweeted last year that buying Twitter was an \u201caccelerant to creating X, the everything app\u201d. The world\u2019s richest man has referred to the social media platform being converted into a product akin to WeChat, an enormously popular Chinese app that allows users to perform multiple functions from messaging to ordering a taxi and paying bills. \u201cYou basically live on WeChat in China. If we can re-create that with Twitter, we\u2019ll be a great success,\u201d he reportedly told Twitter staff last year. The idea of X has been hanging over the business for a while. Twitter as a company has already been folded into a corporate entity called X Corp, whose parent is X Holdings Corp. Linda Yaccarino, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, gave an outline of what an X app would look like, tweeting that it would be \u201ccentred in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking\u201d. Twitter has started the regulatory process of becoming a payments processor and Musk, who in 1999 co-founded online bank x.com, which later became PayPal, has raised the prospect of Twitter offering debit cards and loans. Advertising income, Twitter\u2019s main course of income historically, has been badly damaged by an advertiser boycott driven by concerns over moderation standards on the platform \u2013 Musk has admitted it is down by 50%. The company needs new revenue streams. One analyst said Twitter, or X, does not have the time, money or employees to pull off such a transformation. The company is heavily indebted due to a $13bn debt burden it was saddled with in the wake of Musk\u2019s takeover, whilemost of the workforce has been made redundant and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta has launched a copycat \u201cTwitter killer\u201d product called Threads. \u201cWhile Musk\u2019s vision is to turn X into an \u2018everything app\u2019, this takes time, money, and people \u2013 three things that the company no longer has,\u201d says Mike Proulx, research director at the analysis firm Forrester. \u201cDisenfranchised Twitter users will increasingly turn to Threads, while Musk\u2019s company continues to lose money. Simply put, X\u2019s runway is coming to an end.\u201d Shortly before announcing the X move, Musk said Twitter was still cashflow-negative \u2013 spending more to run the business than it takes in \u2013 and that the business needed to reach positive cashflow \u201cbefore we have the luxury of anything else\u201d. This is a difficult backdrop for achieving an overhaul of the platform\u2019s business model, even if it is owned by the world\u2019s richest man (who has sold a lot of Tesla shares already to fund the takeover). Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK digital marketing agency Accuracast, says a logo change will not bring back advertisers, but the creation of a plausible \u201ceverything app\u201d will. \u201cThe logo change marks the start of transitioning towards his vision of X. We\u2019re not recommending advertisers jump on to it just yet, but we are watching this space very closely.\u201d The popularity of Threads has waned after a strong start, so the threat to Twitter\u2019s main source of income has receded, even though Meta has said it had no immediate plans to launch ads anyway. But the announcement of the X rebranding shows that Musk is determined to move the business model elsewhere, with or without wings."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dcf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-spanish-election-a-good-day-when-voters-said-no-pasaran-to-the-far-right", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on the Spanish election: a good day when voters said \u2018\u00a1No pasar\u00e1n!\u2019 to the far right | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> After a series of European elections in which radical right parties gained national influence, Spain has bucked the trend", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:36:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678311", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/21b74b7d5ffab24a985ff9ad0219348d9ce02ed2/0_80_8450_5070/500.jpg", "body": "In the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s election in Spain, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, delivered a buoyant video message to supporters of the radical right Vox party. \u201cThe hour of the patriots has arrived,\u201d said Ms Meloni, ahead of a poll expected to deliver more evidence that authoritarian, xenophobic nationalism was becoming normalised in Europe\u2019s politics. It didn\u2019t happen. Instead, after a high turnout in searing summer heat, Vox lost 19 seats, as its share of the vote fell compared with its breakthrough election in 2019. The conservative People\u2019s party (PP), led by Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, won the most seats but failed to come close to winning a majority. The consequent parliamentary arithmetic means that a role for Vox as junior coalition partner, in an administration led by the PP, is a non-starter. The prospect of a radical right presence in national government, for the first time since the return of democracy to Spain in 1975, has thus receded. For progressives both inside and outside Spain, that is something to celebrate after a deeply unsettling period. A series of European elections has seen the radical right\u2019s agenda on issues such as irregular immigration, LGBTQ+ rights and net zero become embedded in the political mainstream. Centre-right parties, with their eyes on the prize of power, have enabled this through pacts and coalitions. At a local level, this has already happened in Spain, with PP-Vox coalitions formed in regions such as Castilla y Le\u00f3n. By calling a snap election after disastrous regional election results in May, the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, gambled that in a country where Franco\u2019s dictatorship is still within living memory, enough minds could be concentrated to see off the rising Vox threat on the national stage. He can claim to have been vindicated in that judgment. What comes next, however, is deeply uncertain. The election result may effectively scupper, for now, the possibility of a lurch to the nationalist right. But the numbers mean Mr S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialists \u2013 who came second to the PP \u2013 and their leftwing allies, Sumar, will need the assistance of a host of smaller parties to sustain their own majority. That means tricky negotiations with Catalonia\u2019s hardline pro-independence party, Junts, which will hope to use potential kingmaker status to revive a cause that had lost its edge \u2013 partly thanks to skilful manoeuvring by Mr S\u00e1nchez. The support of the pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu \u2013 whose historic links with the former terrorist group Eta cast a shadow over the last Socialist-led administration \u2013 would also be required. In such a fragmented and polarised political landscape, and after such an inconclusive result, there is a real possibility of stalemate and a new election \u2013 the sixth in eight years. The complexity of the Spanish context, and the distinctive issues around nationhood and nationalism that have emerged in the post-Franco era, mean that lessons for the rest of Europe should not be glibly drawn from Sunday\u2019s result. Nevertheless, having witnessed regional PP-Vox coalitions in action in recent months, and observed the illiberal consequences, on Sunday Spanish voters rejected the idea of installing something similar on a national scale. In a week when Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats, has endorsed the idea of local alliances with the far\u2011right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, that has to count as very welcome news indeed.

Today, seclusion from global events is not an indication of power but the world\u2019s indifference to Brexit Britain\u2019s inward turn. A decade ago, the UK would have been at the forefront of anti-poverty efforts. Now it offers the world neither money nor ideas. The upshot is that China, the EU and the US are part of the School Meals Coalition, led by developing nations to push for universal access to free school meals by 2030 as a response to rising hunger. Britain is nowhere to be seen. The coalition was at centre of debates at Monday\u2019s UN food summit in Rome. Rising global food prices have left much of the planet poorer. But the main UK parties avoid saying that the state can combat poverty. The Tory indifference to hardship in a cost of living crisis rests on spurious anti-government arguments. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s crippling electoral caution means he won\u2019t back universal free school meals for state primary schools in England. It is political arrogance to think that Labour has a right to the support of progressive voters regardless of what the party says and does. Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan knows what\u2019s at stake. The London mayor is offering the capital\u2019s primary-school children free school meals from this September. The British parliament is unplugged from global trends. This country, which imports about 45% of its food, is reshaping its farm sector via ruinous trade deals that will lower environmental standards. Many MPs don\u2019t seem to think it important that the US president, Joe Biden, wants a return to across-the-board free school meals following the policy\u2019s success during the pandemic. He thinks, correctly, that healthier school meals \u2013 with less sugar, more whole grains and lower sodium \u2013 will help to tackle rising obesity rates and recast his nation\u2019s agricultural base. This lesson has not been lost on developing nations struggling with obesity rates. The poor world is building up unpayable ecological debts due to extractive patterns of land use. Cheap food also comes at a cost; just ask sub-Saharan Africa, where a farm-based economy now imports 40% of its cereals \u2013 diverting $40bn in foreign exchange. School meals can help overhaul food systems that are failing people and the planet. Relying more on national farming rather than importing from abroad boosts incomes and creates jobs. No country, says the Sustainable Financing Initiative for School Health and Nutrition (SFI), better illustrates the transformative role of school meals than Brazil. Its government feeds 40 million children via a procurement policy that sees up to a third of state funding for school meals spent on produce supplied by local family farms, to encourage less intensive agriculture. With improvements to crop yields, reductions in food waste and changes in consumption patterns, 95% of people could live in countries that would be self-sufficient in food. A first step would be to back the SFI proposal to spend a $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) a year to extend free school meals for poor nations. Creative financing could seed some of the money. In May, creditors wrote off $1bn of Ecuador\u2019s debt in return for the country spending $12m annually to protect the Galap\u00e1gos Islands. If debt relief can be mobilised to save a precious ecosystem, then why not for potentially transformative school meal spending? In Westminster there would be a riposte, but the rest of the world is not listening."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dd1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/24/rishi-sunak-labour-housebuilding-michael-gove-uk-politics-live-latest-updates", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rishi Sunak says net zero strategy must be \u2018proportional and pragmatic\u2019 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection win has led to some Tories arguing green measures that drive up costs for people should be delayed or abandoned", "author": "Andrew Sparrow", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:17:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678347", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9e36fe48a74aef7f4944e4cd9ae8580b5cf7a8/162_0_2636_1582/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has signalled the government could delay or even abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers, as he comes under pressure from the Conservative right to create a dividing line with Labour at the next election. Labour has said that plans announced by Michael Gove today intended to boost housebuilding don\u2019t \u201ccome close to matching the scale of ambition needed to fix the housing crisis\u201d. (See 5.50pm.) The BBC has written to Nigel Farage to apologise for its reporting of the closure of the former UKIP leader\u2019s Coutts bank account. The Labour criticism of Michael Gove\u2019s housing plans (see 5.50pm) matches what the National Housing Federation said about them earlier (see 9.34am). Other specialists are similarly underwhelmed. Here are comments from three who have submitted reaction to the media. From Stuart Baillie, head of planning at Knight Frank, a property consultancy [The plan to make it easier for shops to be turned into homes] is unlikely to have meaningful impact on housing supply. It\u2019s likely that the output of this policy will only create hundreds of new homes, instead of the many thousands needed to make a real impact on the UK\u2019s significant housing shortage. This policy will only paper over the cracks, instead of getting to the heart of the issue facing the UK\u2019s overburdened and under-resourced planning system. In many instances, residential amenity would be compromised by a town centre location \u2013 particularly ground floor retail \u2013 meaning conversion or redevelopment would be limited to fringe and out-of-town areas. Local planning authorities will be very concerned that the proposals could create a loss of retail capacity, impact local retail amenity and reduce the vitality of already struggling town centres that have fallen victim to the rise of online shopping in recent years. From Victoria Du Croz, head of planning and a partner at Forsters, a law firm specialising in real estate A focus on inner cities makes sense, given the Conservative\u2019s aversion to delivering development on the green belt, but the reality of bringing more homes to the cities will mean building high in order to reach the necessary density. Neither brownfield sites or conversions of office to residential have delivered the number of new homes that are needed across the country to date. Re-focusing on these planning mechanisms, by expanding permitted development rights to shop and commercial conversions, is unlikely to boost housing numbers to the levels that are needed. From Oli Creasey, a property research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, a wealth management firm The government has today announced further changes to the planning system in an effort to boost house building and conversions, specifically aimed at urban regeneration. Unfortunately, like much of the housing policy that has come before, it is somewhat of a damp squib \u2026 We will await further details on the proposals, but our initial view is that this is unlikely to have a significant impact on the number of planning approvals, or the number of homes built. And while this policy isn\u2019t designed to line the pockets of the housebuilders, they do have an interest in these proposals and as such it is important to watch how their share prices reacted to the news. The fact that these share prices have been largely unchanged this morning tells you all you need to know \u2013 nothing will really change and the chronic shortfall of housing in the UK will continue. Turning back to housing, and Labour says the plans announced by Michael Gove today won\u2019t deliver the housing the country needs. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said: The government has never met its target to build 300,000 homes a year and today\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t come close to matching the scale of ambition needed to fix the housing crisis. Families and young people desperate to get on the housing ladder deserve to know what assessment the Government made of Rishi Sunak\u2019s reckless decision to scrap housing targets, which has pushed housebuilding off a cliff. Penny Mordaunt has said she does not believe the government has been dragging its feet on the issue of paying full compensation to those affected by the NHS infected blood scandal, PA Media reports. PA says: She was giving evidence to the infected blood inquiry, as bereaved relatives of victims of the scandal called on the government to pay wider compensation. The current Commons Leader, formerly the minister responsible for the infected blood inquiry as paymaster general between February 2020 and September 2021, insisted there was \u201cno let-up\u201d in her time in the role. But she also described how she had tried and failed to secure a meeting with then chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers about preparing for the possibility of paying compensation in 2020, with government bandwidth \u201cvery stretched\u201d by the pandemic. Mordaunt said the Covid pandemic had been an \u201call-consuming\u201d issue, and there was a \u201cpretty chaotic situation\u201d at the Treasury and Department of Health at the time. Concerns of delays in the government\u2019s approach to compensation were put to Ms Mordaunt, and she was asked if, hypothetically, the government was deliberately dragging its feet, whether that would be morally objectionable. Mordaunt replied saying \u201cyes\u201d, it would be, but added: \u201cThat has not been my experience in my current role.\u201d Elsewhere in her evidence, she said: \u201cI do not think there is any delay to moving as quickly as we can on these matters, and it would have been pointless to have set up this inquiry and the [compensation framework] study not to then proceed with making redress.\u201d Suella Braverman, the home secretary, acted unlawfully in failing to provide basic support to asylum seekers, including young children and pregnant women, a judge has ruled. Diane Taylor has the story here. Simon Jack, the BBC\u2019s respected business editor, has issued an apology to Nigel Farage on Twitter for his report saying that Farage\u2019s account at Coutts was closed because he did not have enough money in it and not, as Farage was claiming at the time, because of his political views. The information on which we based our reporting on Nigel Farage and his bank accounts came from a trusted and senior source. However the information turned out to be incomplete and inaccurate. Therefore I would like to apologise to Mr Farage. Jack issued his apology two days after Farage said he would be demanding an apology from the BBC. A personal apology of this kind from a senior BBC journalist is unusual, particularly when it involves good faith and accurate reporting of something said by a trusted source \u2013 which is what Jack says happened in this case. Deborah Turness, the BBC News CEO, has also written to Farage to say sorry, the BBC reports. Jack\u2019s original report made headlines because at the time Farage was saying he was having his account closed for political reasons by a bank he would not name, and no one was saying that that was not true. Jack said that the bank was Coutts, and that Farage\u2019s account was in fact being closed because he did not have enough money in it. Subsequently Farage used a subject access request to obtain information from Coutts showing that the bank did not want him as a customer because of his views and his values. By the time the account was closed it had fallen below the commercial criteria used by Coutts, but the documentation implies this was not the main reason for the account being closed. Jack\u2019s original report, which he said was based on information from \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d, said it was purely a commercial decison. On Friday last week Jack posted a message on Twitter saying the original story had been changed online to make it clear that, when it said Farage\u2019s account had been closed for commercial reasons, the BBC was quoting what had been said be a source. The headline on the Farage story has been clarified and an update posted. It should have been clearer at the top that the reason for Mr Farage\u2019s account being closed was commercial - was what a source told the BBC. That has been corrected. But that prompted rightwing papers to run stories about Jack \u201cfailing to apologise\u201d. As is customary for a journalist in receipt of confidential information, Jack has not revealed his source. But it has been widely reported that, the day before he ran his story, he sat next to Dame Alison Rose, chief executive of NatWest, which owns Coutts, at a charity dinner. Chris Venables, deputy political director at the Green Alliance thinktank, has criticised government and opposition leaders for suggesting they might scale back some green policies in the light of the Uxbridge byelection result, which has been widely attributed to voter backlash against the extension of the ultra-low emissions zone. Referring to the language Sunak used this morning (see 11.12am), Venables said: The only \u2018proportional and pragmatic\u2019 response to the climate crisis to pull every lever we can and use every weapon in our arsenal to get to net zero. It is disappointing to see the government and the opposition hesitate on this over the weekend, especially during a period of extreme weather, and in the face of all the evidence saying that acting now will save lives, rebuild our economy, and protect the future of the planet. Charlotte Owen, who was the youngest person on record to be nominated for a life peerage when when she was included in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list at the age of 29, has been introduced in the House of Lords. In accordance with the normal ceremony, a clerk read out a message from the king saying Owen was being elevated to the \u201cstate, degree, style, dignity, title and honour of Baroness Owen of Alderley Edge\u201d. Owen\u2019s peerage has attracted criticism partly because of her age and partly because of her lack of experience \u2013 she just spent a short time as a relatively junior aide in No 10. But Johnson also gave a seat in the Lords to Ross Kempsell, 31, who served as a No 10 aide and political director at CCHQ, and who now works as Johnson\u2019s press officer, and yet the Kempsell peerage has attracted considerably less media comment. As life peers Owen and Kempsell can claim \u00a3342 per day on the days when they attend the House of Lords for parliamentary work and it is sitting, and they will keep their peerages for life. In theory this means they could continue to vote on legislation for the next half century, or longer. But Labour says it wants to abolish the House of Lords, and so they could find their careers as legislators ending much earlier. Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor, another name on Johnson\u2019s honours list, also took his seat in the Lords this afternoon. At 36, he is not exactly an elder statesman either, but he has held his mayoral post since 2017. Rishi Sunak flew to Birmingham by helicopter for his visit to a housing project this morning, Pippa Crerar reports. Two thinktanks have welcomed Michael Gove\u2019s call for more \u201cdensification\u201d (his term) of housing in cities and urban areas. This is from Ant Breach, an analyst at the Centre for Cities A key part of the UK\u2019s housing troubles is that its most successful cities are too low-rise and they lack mid-rise apartment buildings, especially compared to their European counterparts. So it\u2019s encouraging to see the government take steps to change this across 20 different cities \u2013 both for the economy and for the environment. But densification won\u2019t solve all their problems. Cities will need to expand outwards too, and this means green belt reform is essential. Only by building both up and out of cities will we start to close the gap on England\u2019s 4.3m missing homes. And these are from Sebastian Payne, head of the centre-right thinktank Onward @michaelgove\u2019s speech on pragmatic but ambitious housebuilding this morning is much delayed and much welcomed. Greater urban density is something we\u2019ve long called for at @ukonward and we\u2019re delighted to see it front and centre of the planning agenda. Gove referenced Margaret Thatcher *and* Michael Heseltine, which speaks to the flexible ideology needed to resolve our housing crisis. The lessons from Docklands and Teesside development corporations is that it is vital to empower local communities to encourage investment. Some quarters accuse the Conservatives of abandoning the needs and opportunities of cities \u2013 Gove made it very clear this morning this is wrongheaded with his focus on boosting housing in London and Leeds, as well as Sheffield, Wolverhampton and Cambridge. Trade bodies covering housing seem unimpressed by Michael Gove\u2019s speech this morning. This is from Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, which represents SME building companies. A plan for more housing is very welcome and hopefully it will go some way to get housing numbers back on track. It\u2019s positive to see a focus on brownfield sites which are the mainstay of SME housebuilders, but the planning system also needs to be fixed to ensure that these developments become a reality. Too many SME housebuilders are stuck in planning purgatory which stops the delivery of housing and employment opportunities in their communities. And this is from Nathan Emerson, CEO of Propertymark, a body representing estate agents. The UK government\u2019s commitment to building more homes is disappointing. In order to provide the homes the country needs, plans need to be more ambitious and government must go faster and further to achieve this. Avoiding a fragmented approach is key, as well as having housing targets that are linked to tenure to meet the demand in different areas across the country. Housing reforms must also reflect societal change, help tackle the climate emergency, involve the tax system, meet the needs of older people and ultimately provide more affordable options, whilst protecting the green belt. Shelter, the homelessness charity, said the government\u2019s plan to make it easier for shops to be turned into flats and houses (see 2.07pm and 2.28pm) won\u2019t provide the genuinely affordable homes the country needs. In a statement Polly Neate, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, said: Converting takeaways and shops into homes and restricting building to city centres won\u2019t help. It could risk creating poor quality, unsafe homes that cause more harm than good. When we are losing more social housing than we build, the government must work with councils to deliver the quality homes local communities across the country need. The housing journalist Vicky Spratt has expressed concern about the government\u2019s plan to expand permitted development rights. (See 2.07pm.) The British Property Federation, which represents companies involved in real estate, has also warned that quality is important. In a statement its chief executive, Melanie Leech, said: The BPF has supported permitted development rights to accelerate the conversion of redundant retail and commercial space and revitalise high streets, but \u2018quality control\u2019 is critical. Not all commercial buildings are suitable for conversion to homes, and the priority must be to ensure that we are creating good quality homes where people want to live. Greater use of PDR must be just one element of an integrated strategy to create thriving town and city centres. The full text of Michael Gove\u2019s housing speech is now on the Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities\u2019 website. Vicky Spratt, the i\u2019s housing correspondent, says that allowing shops to be converted to homes, as the government is proposing in its plan today (see 9.12am), can result in people living in sub-standard accommodation. The Cambridge Labour party, which runs the city council, has said it is still unclear after Michael Gove\u2019s speech what the government\u2019s plan for Cambridge is. It is urging him to have a \u201cserious and open conversation\u201d with local leaders about the project. In a statement it says: The government must recognise the serious issues which we have consistently raised as we develop our emerging local plan, most notably the water crisis, lack of transport infrastructure, and a continuing housing shortage. We urgently need the government to commit to all necessary measures to resolve this. This includes measures to reduce domestic, industrial and agricultural abstraction of water use and investment to clean our rivers and chalk streams \u2026 Cambridge Labour has a vision for a sustainable and beautiful city, with enhanced green spaces, and good quality housing. While it\u2019s important that we unlock business potential, we need to ensure this benefits all residents in our fantastic city. Increasingly the Green party has been winning council seats, and votes, in rural areas where residents are concerned about the impact of housing developments. In response to Michael Gove\u2019s speech this morning, the Green co-leader Carla Denyer said she was glad the government recognised the importance of brownfield development. But she also said a \u201cmassive increase\u201d in social and council housing was needed. She said: Following our excellent showing in some Tory strongholds we are pleased to see that the government plans to prioritise building on brownfield sites. But [Michael Gove] utterly failed to push for the right homes at the right price. His speech comes on the same day an investigation reveals that there are now more than 1.2 million families on the waiting list for properties and that the majority of local authorities have failed to build a single council home in the past five years. Too often speculators and developers are building their profits rather than the houses local people actually need. What is required is a massive increase in local affordable social and council housing built to the highest environmental standards so they cut household energy bills and reduce carbon emissions. The Greens have set out their approach to housing in a right homes, right place, right price charter. And this is what was said at the Downing Street lobby briefing on other issues. Housing The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson (PMS) said the government had already delivered 70% of the 1m new homes promised this parliament in the 2019 Conservative manifesto. The target is for 1m new homes to be \u201cdelivered\u201d, the PMS said. But he refused to say exactly when the government would achieve its target of building 300,000 new homes a year. In their 2019 manifesto the Tories said they wanted to achieve this \u201cby the mid-2020s\u201d. The PMS said the government \u201cwants to continue the progress\u201d towards that commitment. Asked if that was the same as standing by the commitment, the PMS said it was. Asked what \u201cby the mid-2020s\u201d meant, the PMS said that had not been specified. He said on average 230,000 homes had been built a year since 2010. He said the government was looking \u201cwith urgency\u201d at the nutrient neutrality rules that are holding back some housing developments. He said the Cambridge delivery group (see 10.12am) would consider the water issue highlighted by the Tory MP Anthony Browne when he said the government\u2019s housebuilding plans for the city were doomed to fail (see 9.58am). Rhodes The PMS defended not discouraging Britons from going to Rhodes after it sent a Foreign Office team to help holidaymakers amid fires. The spokesperson said: Our advice is focused on the safety of British nationals and enabling people to make an informed decision about the situation on the ground. The current situation is impacting on a limited area in Rhodes, and whilst it\u2019s right to keep it under review and it\u2019s possible that the advice may change we do not want to act out of proportion to the situation on the ground. The PMS said there were \u201cnot currently\u201d plans to get the RAF to help people leave Rhodes. Horizon The PMS said the government was still discussing with the EU whether the UK will rejoin its Horizon science research programme. He said the government retained the option of using the Pioneer programme as an alternative. Barbie The PMS said he had not had a chance to ask the PM yet if he enjoyed Barbie. Sunak tweeted about going to see the movie with his family at the weekend. Government business The PMS also announced government business for today. As well as the Michael Gove speech, Gove and the Welsh secretary are at the Royal Welsh Show; DfE is announcing plans for new SEND schools; and DfT has announced a seafarers\u2019 charter. Here are the main lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing on green/net zero policies. No 10 remains committed to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson (PMS) said. (See 12.15pm.) The PMS also said the government remained committed to banning new gas boiler installations by 2035. \u201cThat remains our commitment,\u201d he said when asked about it. But he conceded that policy might change as technology developed. He said: It is right that we consider how technology evolves \u2026 as we progress towards 2035. And he suggested this was true of other net zero policies. He said: These are long-term commitments for a long-term problem. It is right, if the situation changes and technology evolves, we keep our position under review \u2026 Obviously we would update if there were any changes. The PMS dismissed suggestions that No 10\u2019s thinking on net zero policies had changed since the Uxbridge byelection. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any change in policy since [the byelection],\u201d he said. But the PMS confirmed that the timetable for the introduction of tighter energy-efficiency measures for landlords could be lengthened, allowing them more time to adapt. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, signalled this in an interview published yesterday. The PMS also did not rule out measures to limit the introduction of low traffic neighbourhoods. Asked if this would happen, the PMS replied: The government\u2019s view is that they need to work for local people. We have seen some councils remove LTNs when they don\u2019t work for people. The PMS denied claims that Sunak is not personally interested in net zero policies. When this was put to him, he said Sunak set up a new government department covering net zero. And the UK is showing leadership in this area, he claimed. No 10 in effect ruled out a referendum on net zero policies. Yesterday the Sunday Telegraph proposed one in a leader article. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip and Brexit party leader, has been campaigning for one too. Asked about the idea, the PMS said: I don\u2019t think there are any plans to have a referendum on our 2050 target. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. And No 10 remains committed to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said. Rishi Sunak was slightly evasive when asked about this in an interview this morning. (See 11.12am.) Asked if the government was still committed to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, the PMS said: \u201cThat remains our commitment.\u201d But the spokesperson did confirm what Sunak said this morning about the government wanting to implement net zero policies in a pragmatic way. I will post a full summary from the briefing shortly. The chaos at the top of the Conservatives caused delays in fulfilling plans to tackle Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination in the party, an independent reviewer has said. PA Media says: Prof Swaran Singh said the \u201cturmoil\u201d has affected the Tories\u2019 ability to undertake the reforms he called for in his original inquiry into the issue. The former equality and human rights commissioner\u2019s review, published this morning, found the implementation of some of his recommendations has been \u201cslow\u201d. Training at the local level is \u201cmixed\u201d, and the large amount of documentation in response to the investigation has not necessarily improved \u201cawareness or action on the ground\u201d. No formal process has been put in place to handle complaints of discriminatory behaviour involving the party\u2019s most senior members, the review found. Individuals coming forward with allegations were also said to need better care. \u201cPolitics is a rough business, but there is no reason why the complaints process should be indifferent or abrasive to the experience of individuals involved,\u201d the report said. The churn at the top of the Tories was said to have had an \u201cunavoidable impact on the day-to-day running\u201d of the party. Singh told the PA news agency: \u201cIt just took forever for them to focus on this.\u201d Since he completed his report in May 2021, Boris Johnson was forced out as prime minister, as was his immediate successor, Liz Truss, in a period of tumult. In the report, Singh wrote: \u201cThe two years since the publication of the report have seen considerable political upheaval in the UK. In that time, the Conservative party has had three leaders and seven chairs. This turmoil has impacted on the party\u2019s efforts to implement our recommendations.\u201d The Conservative chairman, Greg Hands, MP said: \u201cThe party has made significant progress on Prof Singh\u2019s recommendations with 25 complete and just six ongoing. There is however still work to be done and this is a process of continual improvement.\u201d The full text of the Michael Gove speech doesn\u2019t seem to be available yet on the Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities\u2019 website. But it has published a long summary of all the announcments it contained. In his pooled interview with broadcasters Rishi Sunak also played down the concerns expressed by the Tory MP Anthony Browne about the government\u2019s plans for more housing in Cambridge. (See 9.47am.) Asked about Browne\u2019s comments, Sunak said: No one is doing mass housebuilding in Cambridge. This is about adding a new urban quarter to Cambridge, which is something that local communities have spoken about and, of course, that will be done in dialogue with local communities. Rishi Sunak has said that government climate policies must be implemented \u201cin a proportionate and pragmatic way\u201d. He made the comment in a pooled interview with broadcasters this morning in which he stressed his overall commitment to the government\u2019s net zero agenda, while hinting that he understood why some Tories want it to be scaled back. The unexpected Conservative party victory in the Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection, which followed the Tories turning the contest in effect into a referendum on the extension of the ultra-low emissions charge (Ulez) into outer London, has led to some Tories arguing that green measures that drive up costs for people should be delayed or abandoned. Ulez (an air quality measure, rather than a carbon emissions measure) will lead to the owners of the most polluting cars in outer London having to pay an extra \u00a312.50 a day to drive. In his interview this morning, Sunak was asked whether he was still committed to introducing the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. He replied: Of course net zero is important to me. So, yes, we\u2019re going to keep making progress towards our net zero ambitions and we\u2019re also going to strengthen our energy security. I think the events over the last year or two have demonstrated the importance of investing more in home grown energy, whether that\u2019s more nuclear or offshore wind. I think that\u2019s what people want to see and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to deliver. But when he was asked if he would stand up to the Tory MPs opposed to net zero policies, Sunak replied: Actually I\u2019m standing up for the British people because I\u2019m also cognisant that we\u2019re living through a time at the moment where inflation is high. That\u2019s having an impact on household and families\u2019 bills. I don\u2019t want to add that, I want to make it easier. So, yes, we\u2019re going to make progress towards net zero but we\u2019re going to do that in a proportionate and pragmatic a way that doesn\u2019t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives \u2013 that\u2019s not what I\u2019m interested in and prepared to do. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, said the government commitment to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 was still in place. Asked if that would continue to be the case, Mitchell initially said he could not \u201cprophesise for the future\u201d before he eventually said it would \u201cremain in place\u201d. Mitchell is not responsible for policy in this area and his comments implied that he thought a future No 10 U-turn on this was not wholly impossible. Q: Do you support rent controls? No, said Gove. He said wherever they had been tried, they led to a constriction of the supply of rented accommodation. Q: You want city centres to be buzzing that. But do you accept they can only be buzzing if they have a vibrant nightlife? Gove joked that he was an enthusiastic supporter of nightclubs. And he said he sympathised with the point being made by the questioner. Q: [From the Eastern Powerhouse] Are you looking at the whole of the east of England, and not just Cambridge, in terms of making the east a silicon powerhouse. Gove said Cambridge was an exceptional place. But he said there were opportunities for other parts of the region too. Gove said there were plans to tighten energy efficiency standards for the private rental sector. There is a timetable for doing this. Gove said he thought this timetable should be relaxed. Further details would be published shortly, he said. Q: [From the National Residential Landlords Association] Do you believe that a private rental sector is needed? Yes, said Gove. He said a private rental sector was vital to the housing market. Q: Many people think GP services and schools are oversubscribed. Won\u2019t your plans make this worse? Gove said his housing plans incorporated the need for infrastructure like this. Gove said the government\u2019s decision to drop mandatory housebuilding targets for councils did not mean the government was not still committed to building 300,000 new homes a year. He claimed that had been misunderstood. Q: Are you committed to abolishing leasehold? Gove said the government wanted to ensure that leaseholders would, in effect, own their properties. Freehold would still exist in legal terms. But, in practical terms, \u201cleasehold will effectively be ended\u201d, he said. Q: Won\u2019t these plans only happen if you are willing to ignore local opposition? Gove said he believed in taking people with him. And he said he thought his plans would command support. In the past, people opposed housebuilding because the homes were not beautiful, because there was not enough infrastructure, because of concern for the environment, or because they thought the government was building homes, not neighbourhoods. Gove said he thought his plans addressed all these concerns. Gove said the government planned to bring forward the renters reform bill shortly. Q: How will you get your plans for Cambridge through if an MP like Anthony Browne says they are \u201cnonsense\u201d. Gove said Cambridge could not be held back. He said he looked forward to discussing them with the Cambridge MPs. Gove said he did not accept that Labour had an extensive plan for housebuilding. He said Labour has just committed to building on the green belt. In the past that has led to the erosion of environmenal assets, he said. He said he was proposing housbuilding on a \u201cHeseltinian\u201d scale. Q: Why should anyone believe you will build 300,000 homes a year when the government has not been doing that? Gove said he was someone who, when he made a promise, delivered on it. He said the government had already achieved the highest level of housebuilding for decades. Q: When will you meet the 300,000 homes a year target? \u201cAs soon as we possibly can\u201d, said Gove. Q: Are you committed to building 300,000 homes a year? Gove said he \u201ccompletely stands by\u201d the target of building 300,000 homes a year by the middel of the decade. Q: What is your response to the comments from Anthony Browne? Gove said he was sure Tory MPs would realise the plans were in the national interest once they have studied them. Michael Gove took questions at the end of his speech. Q: Are you focusing on building in cities because fewer Tory voters live there, and because your MPs are opposed to building in the countryside? Gove said many Tory voters live in cities, as the Uxbridge byelection result showed. But he said \u201cregenerating cities makes sense economically\u201d. He was promoting these plans because they would be good for the economy, he said. In his speech Michael Gove said he was appointing Peter Freeman, chair of Homes England, to lead a \u201cCambridge delivery group\u201d to explore how housing in the city can be expanded. He said Cambridge\u2019s prospects as a leading global research centre were being held back by the shortage of laboratory space. And he said the shortage of housing was making it harder for firms to recruit staff. He said the delivery group would come up with a vision for Cambridge\u2019s future. Talking about what this might involve, Gove said: Imagine a major new quarter for the city, built in a way that is in keeping with the beauty of the historic centre, shaped by the principles of high quality design, urban beauty and human scale \u2013 streetscapes emulating the scale and quality of neighbourhoods, such as Clifton in Bristol or Marylebone in London, with a high proportion of affordable homes, and other properties set aside for key workers and young academics. Then connect that new quarter to the rest of the city with a sustainable transport network that sees current congestion becoming a thing of the past. Peter Apps, deputy editor of Inside Housing, says that the government is on course to create 1m new homes over the course of this parliament, but that it is not meeting its pledge to build 300,000 a year. The Conservative MP Anthony Browne, who represents South Cambridgeshire, has posted a thread on Twitter explaining why he is opposed to more housebuilding in Cambridge. It starts here. Brown says there is not enough water available. Unless the government can address the water shortage, he says, the proposal for a new urban quarter in Cambridge will be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d, he says. Cambridge already has about the highest housebuilding in the country, and under the local plans that is set to double with 50,000 new homes by 2050, effectively doubling the size of Cambridge. But there is one major problem: we have run out of water. For the first time ever, the Environment Agency is systematically blocking all major new development around Cambridge because there is no water for them. We are the driest part of the country with the highest population growth. I have campaigned for a new reservoir, and there are now plans for two: one in the Fens and one in Lincolnshire. But they will take nearly 20 years to build. I have written to the water companies to speed up construction but they say they can\u2019t. Our rivers, streams and ponds already run dry. The wetland reserve at Fowlmere where I grew up now only has water in summer because the Environment Agency pumps it there. There is not enough water for existing housing; there is not enough for the major expansion of housing already planned; and there is not enough for any govt plans for a new quarter. As I say, unless the Govt can say where the water will come from, it\u2019s plans are dead on arrival In the news release issued overnight ahead of Gove\u2019s speech, the Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities said the government was planning \u201ca new urban quarter in Cambridge which will unlock the city\u2019s full potential as a source of innovation and talent\u201d. But this morning Anthony Browne, the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, has condemned the proposals as \u201cnonsense\u201d and vowed to do everything he can to stop them. I will do everything I can to stop the government\u2019s nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge, where all major developments are now blocked by the Environment Agency because we have quite literally run out of water. Our streams, rivers and ponds already run dry. The Browne tweet supports the claim made by Keir Starmer, when he announced Labour\u2019s housing plan, that the Conservatives cannot be the party of mass housebuilding because their MPs routinely block these initiatives on behalf of their \u201cnimby\u201d constituents. But the Tories point out that many Labour frontbenchers have also opposed building projects in their constituencies. Michael Gove is deliving his speech on housebuilding. He starts by joking that it is a pleasure to be \u201cGuardian-adjacent\u201d. He is speaking at King\u2019s Cross, near the Guardian\u2019s HQ. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, told the Today programme this morning that she was not impressed by what the government has briefed overnight about its plans to boost urban housebuilding. (See 9.12am.) Here are the main points from her interview. Henderson said a \u201cmuch bigger\u201d housebuilding plan was needed. She said that, although there were some positive features in the announcement, more ambition was needed. She said: From what we\u2019ve heard this morning, there\u2019s some ambition there to develop in cities, which is absolutely needed. And Michael Gove is very ambitious about housing and social housing in particular. But from what I\u2019ve seen today so far \u2026 this is relatively piecemeal. We have such a severe shortage of housing in this country, 4.2 million people are currently in need of a social home and 2 million children are living in overcrowding. So there\u2019s some positive signs today but this is nowhere near the scale of ambition that we need to meet housing need in this country \u2026. We need 90,000 socially rented homes each year, and last year, we built around 6,500. So against those key metrics, we need to have a much more ambitious plan \u2026 We need something much bigger \u2026 I mean, wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a long term plan that looked at ending children, families being stuck in temporary accommodation? Or ending children, families being stuck in overcrowding? She said that building new homes in urban areas was not enough, and that houses needed to be built in rural areas too. She said: I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t meet our housing need just by building in towns and cities. We will need to think about building in rural areas too. She called for the publication of the update to the national planning policy framework, which she said would make planning easier. Good morning. The Commons is in recess, but the government is not on holiday and this morning it is making a housing announcement that seems mostly intended as a swipe at Labour. The overnight press release is headlined: \u201cWe will fulfil promise to build 1m new homes, says the prime minister.\u201d Normally a government saying it will do what it promised \u2013 the 2019 manifesto said the Tories would \u201cbuild at least a million more homes, of all tenures, over the next parliament, in the areas that really need them\u201d \u2013 does not count as news, even in August. But given that last year, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, suggested the government was no longer committed to the target, also in the manifesto, of building 300,000 new homes a year, perhaps this is worth noting. But the meat of the briefing is in a quote from Rishi Sunak included in the news release. He said: Today I can confirm that we will meet our manifesto commitment to build 1m homes over this parliament. That\u2019s a beautiful new home for a million individual families in every corner of our country. We need to keep going because we want more people to realise the dream of owning their own home. We won\u2019t do that by concreting over the countryside \u2013 our plan is to build the right homes where there is the most need and where there is local support, in the heart of Britain\u2019s great cities. \u201cConcreting over the countryside\u201d is a reference to Labour\u2019s housing policy, which was unveiled by Keir Starmer earlier this year and which would involve some green belt development. Gove made the same argument in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph published yesterday, claiming Labour was the party of \u201csuburban sprawl\u201d that wants to \u201cdevour the green belt\u201d. To support its claim that it will be able to build 1m homes over the course of this parliament, the government is announcing moves to clear planning backlogs, as well confirming proposals, which have been floated before, to relax some of the rules holding back urban development. This is how it describes them. The government will also take steps to unblock the bottlenecks in the planning system that are choking and slowing down development, and stopping growth and investment by: - Immediately launching a \u00a324m planning skills delivery fund to clear backlogs and get the right skills in place. - Setting up a new \u201csuper-squad\u201d team of leading planners and other experts charged with working across the planning system to unblock major housing developments. The team will first be deployed in Cambridge to turbocharge our plans in the city. Developers will also be asked to contribute more through fees, to help support a higher quality more efficient planning service. New flexibilities to convert shops, takeaways and betting shops into homes will help to rejuvenate the high street. Meanwhile, red tape will be cut to enable barn conversions and the repurposing agricultural buildings and disused warehouses. New freedoms to extend homes, convert lofts and renovate new buildings will help to convert existing properties into new accommodation. A review into the extension of permitted development rights will make it easier for homeowners to build upwards and outwards \u2013 with new extensions and loft conversions - whilst ensuring neighbours\u2019 interests are protected. This morning Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, told the Today programme these plans contained \u201cnowhere near the scale of ambition that we need to meet housing need in this country\u201d. I will post more from her interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: 9.30am: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, gives a speech on housing. Morning: Rishi Sunak is on a visit in the West Midlands. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Charlotte Owen, the youngest person to be made a life peer, and Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor, are introduced as new peers in the House of Lords.

Legal action, a general strike and possible refusal from upwards of 10,000 military reservists to report for duty are now on the cards as Israel\u2019s largest ever domestic crisis enters a new chapter. What just happened? After seven months of debate, the government on Monday managed to scrap the \u201creasonableness\u201d clause that allows Israel\u2019s unelected supreme court to overrule government decisions, after a final vote of 64-0. Every member of the coalition voted in favour, while opposition lawmakers abandoned the Knesset plenum in protest. Earlier in the year, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared more willing to cut a deal with the opposition and temper the judicial proposals, but he was believed to be hostage to the demands of his far-right coalition partners, who could bring down the government if their demands are not met. In recent weeks, however, the prime minister has taken a more strident tone, promising that the judicial overhaul would go ahead and that it would \u201csafeguard, rather than endanger\u201d democracy. A former special forces captain, he seems particularly irked by what he views as insubordination in the military. Israel is now facing an unprecedented constitutional crisis in which the supreme court could strike down the legislation designed to curb its powers, and the government could choose not to comply. Other expected developments include stepped-up street protests and strike action, and a refusal to report for duty by upwards of 10,000 military reservists. What else is the government proposing? Among a range of far-reaching proposals from Netanyahu\u2019s government are plans to allow a simple majority of 61 in the 120-seat Knesset to override almost any supreme court rulings, and to allow politicians to appoint most of the justices to the bench. The changes are spearheaded not by the prime minister, but by his Likud party colleague Yariv Levin, the justice minister, and the Religious Zionist party lawmaker Simcha Rothman, who chairs the Knesset\u2019s law and justice committee. The measures could technically help Netanyahu evade prosecution in his corruption trial. He denies all charges. Levin and Rothman have a longstanding hatred of Israel\u2019s supreme court, which they see as too powerful and as biased against the settler movement, Israel\u2019s ultra-religious community, and the Mizrahi population, Jewish people of Middle Eastern origin. In particular, many on the Israeli right have never forgiven the court for decisions related to Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005. Why is this happening now? Netanyahu\u2019s trial triggered four years of political crisis in which Israel was split over whether he was fit to lead the country. After five elections since 2019, in which politicians on both sides failed to form stable governments, a bloc of extremist and religious parties headed by Netanyahu\u2019s Likud won a clear majority in elections last November, going on to form the most rightwing administration in Israel\u2019s history. Full annexation of the occupied West Bank, a rollback of pro-LGBTQ+ legislation, axing laws protecting women\u2019s rights and minority rights, and a loosening of the rules of engagement for Israeli police and soldiers are all on the coalition\u2019s agenda. What do critics of the measures say? Worries that the proposals will result in an erosion of democratic norms and the rule of law have sparked the biggest protest movement in Israeli history, with weekly demonstrations in Tel Aviv and many more outside the Knesset in Jerusalem. There have been several \u201cdays of disruption\u201d since January, in which protesters have blocked highways and Tel Aviv airport. As the months have worn on, the protests have become more violent, and hundreds of people have been arrested. The movement is largely leaderless, but significant pressure has come from members of the military, who fear the judicial overhaul will make Israelis more vulnerable to prosecution in international courts for war crimes. The tech sector has also been vocal, citing fears about foreign investment and the startup sector. The US president, Joe Biden, who has repeatedly described himself as a \u201ctrue friend of Israel\u201d, has been publicly critical of the plans, urging his Israeli counterpart to seek broad consensus for such momentous changes. What happens next? Months of compromise talks brokered by the president, Isaac Herzog, collapsed in June, and last-ditch efforts before Monday\u2019s vote ended in deadlock. Now that the \u201creasonableness\u201d clause has been scrapped, it is expected that the coalition will immediately move to reinstate as interior minister the disgraced Aryeh Deri, who was barred from holding a cabinet position by the supreme court, as well as introducing legislation permanently exempting ultra-Orthodox men from military service, and bills expanding Israeli settlement and control of the occupied West Bank. The current Knesset session expires at the end of July, and parliament will reconvene in October, after the Jewish high holidays."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dd3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/24/x-marks-the-spot-elon-musk-isnt-alone-in-loving-24th-letter-of-the-alphabet", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "X marks the spot: the many fellow fans of Elon Musk\u2019s favourite letter", "lead": "From The X-Files to X-Men, Xbox to Xerox, X is loved by brands in tech, media, music and more", "author": "Tom Ambrose and Tom Calverley", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:12:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678388", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2f17f53e47d8017e34b3d456053e462e9670e4/0_497_3000_1799/500.jpg", "body": "Elon Musk has replaced Twitter\u2019s longstanding bluebird logo with an \u201cX\u201d, reflecting the company\u2019s new name of X Holdings Corp and his vision of creating \u201cX, the everything app\u201d. The letter clearly holds some fascination for the world\u2019s richest man; one of his early online ventures was the bank X.com, which he co-founded in 1999. But Musk is far from alone in feeling that X marks the branding sweet spot. Ever since Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovered a new form of radiation in 1895, which he called X-radiation or X-rays, the letter has been associated with science and the future. It also recalls the dynamic words that start with the ex- prefix, such as extra, exciting and excess. Here we look at how brands from across the cultural spectrum have tried to give themselves a little of the X factor. Technology and media Twitter joins a long line of tech firms associated with the 24th letter of the alphabet, from the digital copying machine-maker Xerox to the American internet service provider Xfinity. Perhaps the most prominent X-product is Microsoft\u2019s Xbox, launched in the US in November 2001 as a rival to Sony\u2019s hit PlayStation games consoles, with early games including Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and Halo. The brand has since gone from strength to strength, launching the Xbox 360, Xbox One and Xbox X and S series, and selling tens of millions of units around the world. In the UK, the broadcaster ITV tacked an X on to the end of its name in the hopes of giving its streaming service a boost. The free ad-supported platform was rebranded as ITVX in December last year, having launched as ITV Player in 2008 and switched to ITV Hub in 2015. Film, television and comics Traditionally an X-rated film was one meant for adults only, but in recent years the letter is more likely to have been used to evoke mystery in the science fiction and action genres. Mulder and Scully enthralled 1990s TV audiences exploring the FBI\u2019s unsolved paranormal cases in The X-Files, while Vin Diesel enjoyed success in the cinema with his XXX series of films, in which he played spy Xander Cage. Since the 1950s, comic books have also been fond of characters with prominent Xs in their names, most markedly with the X-Men franchise. Now a hugely successful series of Hollywood films, books, video games and television shows, the team of superhero mutants began life in an eponymous Marvel comic in September 1963. Within the Marvel Universe, the X-Men take their name from their leader, Professor Charles Francis Xavier, better known as Professor X, who says that mutants \u201cpossess an extra power \u2026 one which ordinary humans do not!! That is why I call my students \u2026 X-Men, for EX-tra power!\u201d Music X is also a popular letter within the music industry, with radio stations such Radio X (formerly XFM) and BBC Radio 1Xtra playing music from artists including The xx, XTC, Xzibit and Lil Nas X. It was only four years ago that pop queen Madonna released her 14th studio album, Madame X, which she toured around the world. However, perhaps X\u2019s biggest impact on the charts was mid-00s reality TV behemoth The X Factor. Taking the drama and sob stories of previous singing talent contest Pop Idol to a whole new level, Simon Cowell\u2019s primetime show produced talents including Leona Lewis, Alexandra Burke \u2013 and Chico. \u2026 and Luxembourg The tiny country nestled between Belgium and the Netherlands is perhaps best known for being a tax haven, as well as having the highest GDP per capita in Europe. It\u2019s not a typical visitor destination, but its tourist board has embraced the \u201cX\u201d in its logo. According to its website, Luxembourg offers many different experiences, including hiking, water sports and historic palaces.

Franco, an outspoken defender of marginalised populations, was killed with her driver Anderson Gomes in a drive-by shooting in March 2018. Two former police officers accused of carrying out the murders were arrested a year later \u2013 but they are yet to stand trial by jury and an investigation into who ordered the assassination has dragged on slowly ever since. The former firefighter Maxwell Sim\u00f5es Corr\u00eaa, known as \u201cSuel\u201d, was arrested at his home in western Rio on Monday. Federal police also executed seven search and seizure warrants at addresses around Rio as part of the operation, named \u201cElpis\u201d after the spirit of hope in Greek mythology. Sim\u00f5es Corr\u00eaa was already under house arrest for obstruction of justice, but new evidence pointing to his deeper involvement in the murders led officers to detain him, the federal police chief, Andrei Rodrigues told reporters. According to investigators, Sim\u00f5es Corr\u00eaa gave logistical support to Ronnie Lessa and \u00c9lcio Vieira de Queiroz, the ex-police officers accused of firing the shots and driving the car used for the killings. The new suspect is alleged to have helped plan Franco\u2019s murder, as well as provided and disposed of the vehicle used for the crime. He has also given financial support to Queiroz\u2019s family since the ex-police officer was put behind bars, the prosecutor Eduardo Morais Martins said in a press conference in Rio. Monday\u2019s operation was carried out by the federal police, who in February launched their own investigation into Franco\u2019s murder and its motives, to assist a parallel state-led inquiry riddled with criticisms of inefficiency. This produced new evidence and a plea deal with Queiroz, the justice minister, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, said at the Bras\u00edlia press conference. Queiroz not only confessed to his role as the driver in the murders, but also implicated Lessa as the man who pulled the trigger and gave new details leading to Sim\u00f5es Corr\u00eaa\u2019s arrest. Remaining questions around the crime\u2019s execution have been cleared up and \u201can important phase of the investigation has been closed\u201d, said Dino, adding that the focus would now shift to finding out who ordered the murders. The minister confirmed speculation that paramilitary gangs known as militias \u2013 mafias that control large swathes of Rio state and are often made up of current or former state police officers \u2013 are implicated in the crime. \u201cI want to assure the victims\u2019 families and civil society that the investigation is moving forward and will produce new results,\u201d Dino said, adding that the latest developments are a sign of \u201ca state commitment to solving all crimes and fighting impunity\u201d. Dino had pledged to solve Franco\u2019s murder as \u201ca matter of state honour\u201d when the Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva government took office in January, in sharp contrast with the previous Jair Bolsonaro administration, which came under fierce criticism for its lack of commitment to resolving the case. Franco\u2019s sister Anielle, the current minister for racial equality, welcomed the news of the arrest. \u201cI reaffirm my trust in the federal police running the investigation and repeat the question I have been asking for the last five years: who ordered Marielle\u2019s killing and why?\u201d Anielle Franco wrote on Twitter."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dd5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/24/greece-fires-wildfires-rhodes-corfu-evia-latest-updates", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greece wildfires: climate crisis will \u2018manifest itself everywhere with greater disasters\u2019, says Greek PM \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Latest news: Kyriakos Mitsotakis tells parliament \u2018we are at war\u2019 as nearly 2,500 people evacuated from Corfu", "author": "Geneva Abdul (now); Kevin Rawlinson and Caroline Davies (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:02:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678425", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cb39ccad8214262286eef3128ec1a7deff284c98/0_328_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "That\u2019s all for today, thanks for following along. Here\u2019s a summary of the day as a heatwave spreads across north Africa and southern Europe, and efforts to contain wildfires across Greece continued for a seventh straight day. Firefighters in Greece were struggling to contain 82 wildfires across the country, 64 of which started on Sunday, the hottest day of the summer so far. As well as huge blazes on the island of Rhodes, which forced 19,000 people to flee, wildfires also broke out on the island of Corfu and in the northern Peloponnese region, triggering further evacuations. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told parliament: \u201cFor the next few weeks we must be on constant alert. We are at war, we will rebuild what we lost, we will compensate those who were hurt.\u201d \u201cThe climate crisis is already here, it will manifest itself everywhere in the Mediterranean with greater disasters,\u201d he said. Wildfires killed 25 people in the mountainous B\u00e9ja\u00efa and Bou\u00efra regions of Algeria on Monday, the interior ministry said, as a heatwave spreads across north Africa and southern Europe. Authorities evacuated nearly 2,500 people from the Greek island of Corfu on Monday as the prime minister warned the heat-hit country was \u201cat war\u201d with several wildfires. While wildfires raged on the Greek islands Rhodes and Corfu, with thousands of British tourists thought to be there, the UK government continued to refuse to advise against travel to the country. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister has said that a refund would be the \u201cproper approach\u201d for those who want to cancel their holidays in Greek regions affected by wildfires. The Liberal Democrats are calling on the Foreign Office to add Rhodes to to its \u201cred list\u201d \u2013 and advise British nationals against all but essential travel. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has contacted the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to offer additional assistance. The Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the situation on Rhodes was \u201cundoubtedly a wakeup call\u201d on the climate crisis. \u201cClimate change is real. It is now. And it is essential that the world combats it, and Britain is playing a leading role in doing that,\u201d he said. Rishi Sunak has signalled the UK government could delay or even abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers, as he comes under pressure from the Conservative right to create a dividing line with Labour at the next election. Tourists planning trips to the Mediterranean should see the Greek wildfires as a \u201cbig, big warning\u201d, with the climate crisis highly likely to fuel more severe blazes in future, one of the UK\u2019s leading climate scientists said. Up to 10,000 Britons are estimated to be on fire-ravaged Rhodes, with repatriation flights to rescue holidaymakers landing back in the UK. Three repatriation flights to return hundreds of holidaymakers from Rhodes are planned on Monday evening, Jet2 said. An easyJet spokesperson said the airline was doing all it could to help customers in Rhodes and invited those due to travel to or from the island until Saturday to change the date for free. Jet2, which has cancelled all flights and holidays due to depart to Rhodes up to and including Sunday, has \u201csignificantly increased\u201d the number of its staff on the island. A Tui spokesperson said all outbound flights to Rhodes up to and including Tuesday had been cancelled and passengers due to travel on these flights would receive full refunds. Emergency teams in Canada are still searching for four people who went missing in flooding after more than 200mm (7.87in) of rain fell in some parts of Nova Scotia at the weekend. Two children, a young person and a man were inside two vehicles when the road they were travelling on suddenly became submerged, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Nova Scotia.

Twenty-five people including 10 soldiers have been killed in forest fires in in the mountainous regions of B\u00e9ja\u00efa and Bou\u00efra, Algerian authorities have said, as a heatwave spreads across north Africa and southern Europe. About 7,500 firefighters were trying to bring the flames under control, authorities said. The interior ministry said it was continuing its firefighting operations in the Boumerd\u00e8s, Bou\u00efra, Tizi Ouzou, Jijel, B\u00e9ja\u00efa and Skikda regions, Reuters reports. About 1,500 people have been evacuated so far. A major heatwave is sweeping across north Africa, with temperatures of 49C (120F) recorded in some cities in neighbouring Tunisia. In Tunisia, wildfires swept through the border town of Melloula. Witnesses told Reuters that fires that had begun in mountainous areas had reached some people\u2019s homes in the town and forced hundreds of families to flee. A civil protection official said hundreds of people had been evacuated from the town by land, and and by sea in fishing and coastguard vessels. Fires appear to be raging out of control on the Greek island of Evia, with officials speaking of a \u201cnightmarish situation\u201d in the wooded villages above the coastal town of Karystos. Near-gale winds were propelling flames into inhabited areas, the Evia\u2019s vice-prefect, Giorgos Kelaiditis, told the state news agency in the last hour. \u201cThe situation is nightmarish for the villages of Platanistos and Potami because the fire has got into courtyards, it has burned livestock pens, and strong winds continue to push flames into residential areas.\u201d Media reported a livestock farmer missing. Famous for its honey and Greece\u2019s third largest Isle, Evia was the scene of some of the worst forest fires in living memory in 2021. Evacuation orders had been issued ahead if the flames barrelling towards residential areas. A couple from Norwich were forced to evacuate from a wedding party at which they were guests by the wildfires in Rhodes on Saturday. Dominic Doggett, 30, and his fiancee Hannah Dolman, 28, had to stay on the floor of an office in a hotel after the wedding do came to an \u201cabrupt end\u201d. After arriving at Gatwick airport, Doggett told PA Media: \u201cMid-afternoon at the wedding, we got a notification that said some areas were being evacuated. \u201cWith it being a wedding, we tried to keep the bride and groom unaware and stay as happy as possible. \u201cLater in the evening\u2026 we got a further notification on our phones from the alert system to say our area was also being evacuated. \u201cThe music cut and the lights came on and the staff said we needed to leave. The wedding was due to finish at 2am but it finished three hours early.\u201d Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister has said that a refund would be the \u201cproper approach\u201d for those who want to cancel their holidays in Greek regions affected by wildfires. The t\u00e1naiste and minister for foreign affairs, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said Irish embassies and his department had received a number of queries from citizens, and advised them to listen to the Greek authorities\u2019 advice. He said the department is \u201cincreasing capacity\u201d to reach Irish citizens affected by wildfires in Greece. Nearly 20,000 people, many of them tourists, are being evacuated from the island of Rhodes as large fires swept down from the mountains towards the south-western coastal resort towns. Warnings of similar wildfire threats in Corfu and Evia have also been issued. Climate experts have warned that extreme temperatures in the Mediterranean are more likely in the coming years due to greenhouse gases emitted by human activity heating the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Asked about the issue at the Curragh Camp in County Kildare on Monday, Martin advised Irish citizens to take advice from the Greek authorities. \u201cWe would say to people in the area, as we have been doing in the Department of Foreign Affairs, to contact your tour operator,\u201d he said. \u201cTake all advice from the authorities. Evacuate when you\u2019re asked to evacuate and don\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWe have received queries from a number of Irish nationals on the island and we\u2019re increasing our capacity to the region in terms of helping Irish citizens who are in challenging circumstances or in difficulties, and liaising with the authorities to facilitate Irish citizens.\u201d He said this included logistics and emergency passports where originals had been left in hotels during evacuations. Asked whether people should be compensated for choosing not to travel to regions due to wildfires, Martin said a \u201crefund would be the proper approach there\u201d. \u201cI think safety first, and we need to work with all stakeholders to make sure we prioritise taking decisions on the basis of safety and protection of human life,\u201d he said. Authorities evacuated nearly 2,500 people from the Greek island of Corfu on Monday as the prime minister warned that the heat-battered country was \u201cat war\u201d with several wildfires. Tens of thousands of people have already fled blazes on the island of Rhodes, with many frightened tourists scrambling to get home on evacuation flights, AFP reports. About 2,400 visitors and locals were evacuated from the Ionian island of Corfu from Sunday through until Monday, a fire service spokesperson said, adding that the departures were a precaution. \u201cWe are at war and are exclusively geared towards the fire front,\u201d the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told the parliament in Athens, warning that the nation faced \u201canother three difficult days ahead\u201d before high temperatures are forecast to ease. Greece has been sweltering under a lengthy spell of extreme heat that has increased wildfire risk and left visitors stranded in the peak tourist season. Because of the wildfires, an annual celebration on Monday to mark the 1974 restoration of democracy in Greece was cancelled. Firefighters in Greece were struggling to contain 82 wildfires across the country, 64 of which started on Sunday, the hottest day of the summer so far. As well as huge blazes on the island of Rhodes, which forced 19,000 people to flee, wildfires also broke out on the island of Corfu and in the northern Peloponnese region, triggering further evacuations. Guardian Australia asked seven leading climate scientists to describe how they felt as much of the northern hemisphere is engulfed by blistering heatwaves, and a number of global land and ocean climate records are broken. \u2018I am stunned by the ferocity\u2019 What is playing out all over the world right now is entirely consistent with what scientists expect. No one wants to be right about this. But if I\u2019m honest, I am stunned by the ferocity of the impacts we are currently experiencing. I am really dreading the devastation I know this El Ni\u00f1o will bring. As the situation deteriorates, it makes me wonder how I can be most helpful at a time like this. Do I keep trying to pursue my research career or devote even more of my time to warning the public? The pressure and anxiety of working through an escalating crisis is taking its toll on many of us. - Dr Jo\u00eblle Gergis, senior lecturer in climate science Fenner School of Environment and Society, associate investigator ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the Australian National University \u2018Even 1.2C of global warming isn\u2019t safe\u2019 We knew by the mid-1990s that lurking in the tails of our climate model projections were monsters: monstrous heatwaves, catastrophic extreme rainfall and floods, subcontinental-scale wildfires, rapid ice sheet collapse raising sea level metres within a century. We knew \u2013 just like we know gravity \u2013 that Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef could be one of the earliest victims of uncontained global warming. But as today\u2019s monstrous, deadly heatwaves overtake large parts of Asia, Europe and North America with temperatures the likes of which we have never experienced, we find even 1.2C of global warming isn\u2019t safe. - Bill Hare, physicist and climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics Read more here. A British court has dismissed a lawsuit that accuses Shell\u2019s leadership of mismanaging climate risks to the oil firm, but the activist investor group that brought it plans to appeal. Corporations have faced a growing number of climate-related lawsuits in recent years as they come under pressure to step up efforts to curb global warming. Shell was already ordered by a Dutch court in 2021 to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by the end of the decade after it was sued by environmental groups. This time, ClientEarth, an environmental law NGO and a minor Shell shareholder, filed in February a lawsuit in the high court of England and Wales against Shell bosses \u201cfor failing to manage the material and foreseeable risks posed to the company by climate change\u201d, AFP reports. But the judges dismissed the case, once in May and and again on Monday after a hearing earlier in July. ClientEarth said it was disappointed by the dismissal and plans to appeal. A Shell spokesperson said the dismissal was \u201cthe right outcome\u201d, adding that the court had reaffirmed its decision that the claim was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. The company said ClientEarth\u2019s claim \u201centirely\u201d ignored \u201chow directors of a business as large and complex as Shell must balance a range of competing considerations\u201d. At its annual shareholders meeting in May, Shell\u2019s management received majority backing even though there were disruptions and doubts expressed about its climate transition. The company later announced a change of plans: instead of gradually reducing oil output it would hold it steady until 2030. ClientEarth\u2019s senior lawyer Paul Benson said in statement: \u201cThe board\u2019s strategy to manage the risks of the energy transition was fundamentally flawed as it was. Now the board seems to be dropping even any pretence that it will take meaningful action.\u201d Shell said on Monday that decision reflected the fact it had already met its 2030 goal of reducing oil production by 26% from the 2019 level. ClientEarth says Shell\u2019s flawed climate strategy is inconsistent with the 2015 Paris agreement and jeopardises the company\u2019s future commercial success, and thus constitutes a breach of its legal duties under English company law. Benson said: \u201cThe board\u2019s refusal to take decisive action to prepare the company for the fast-advancing energy transition puts Shell\u2019s future commercial viability at risk.\u201d According to ClientEarth, this is the first time a company board has been targeted by a lawsuit for failing to properly handle the climate transition. Shell\u2019s first-quarter net profit surged 22% to $8.7bn (\u00a36.8bn) but has indicated its second quarter performance has been hit by a drop in gas sales. Rishi Sunak has signalled the UK government could delay or even abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers, as he comes under pressure from the Conservative right to create a dividing line with Labour at the next election. The prime minister said the drive to reach the UK\u2019s net zero targets should not \u201cunnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives\u201d, as he rethought his green agenda after the Tories won last week\u2019s Uxbridge and Ruislip byelection. His official spokesperson confirmed the government would \u201ccontinually examine and scrutinise\u201d measures including phasing out gas boilers by 2035, energy efficiency targets for private rented homes and low traffic neighbourhoods.

Thunberg, 20, admitted to the facts but denied guilt, saying the fight against the fossil fuel industry was a form of self-defence because of the existential and global threat of the climate crisis, AP reports. \u201cWe cannot save the world by playing by the rules,\u201d she told journalists after hearing the verdict, vowing she would \u201cdefinitely not\u201d back down. The court rejected her argument and fined her 2,500 kronor (about \u00a3190). Charges were brought against Thunberg and several other youth activists from the Reclaim the Future movement for refusing a police order to disperse after blocking road access to an oil terminal in Malm\u00f6 on 19 June. Irma Kjellstr\u00f6m, a spokesperson for Reclaim the Future, said: \u201cIf the court sees our actions of self-defence as a crime, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Kjellstr\u00f6m, who was also present at the June protest, added: \u201c[Activists] have to be exactly where the harm is being done.\u201d The sentencing appeared to have little effect on their determination \u2014 just a few hours later, Thunberg and Reclaim the Future activists returned to the oil terminal to stage to another roadblock. Adam Walker, 33, a business analyst from Telford, flew to Rhodes on Friday night with his wife, mother-in-law and two young children, for a holiday in the beach resort of Pefkos on the eastern coast of the island. \u201cWe arrived at 2am on Saturday. When we were in the pool that afternoon we could see smoke in the distance, and a red glow on top of the hill. There was ash falling on us during dinner. At midnight on Saturday, we were told by text message to leave our hotel and move to the beach. It was absolute chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was mixed messaging about whether to take bags or not. After about half an hour we were told to walk about half a kilometre to the top of the hill with our bags, but there was no information from anyone about where we were going. Everyone was upset as they were trying to figure out where to send people as it was happening.\u201d Eventually, Walker said, buses came and took scores of holidaymakers to Rhodes town. \u201cWe were left at a school, where we got our towels and clothes out and lay on tiles. There were power cuts and at times no running water, with toilets overflowing.\u201d Walker was disappointed to find that there was no direct support and communication from his travel operator during the evacuation. \u201cThere were no representatives anywhere. We were helped by local Greek volunteers, lots of students turned up at some point. There wasn\u2019t much sleeping going on,\u201d he said. Walker added that his family had no idea there were fires raging in the area before they set off from the UK: \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen it at all on the news. It all kicked off properly the day we landed.\u201d The family spent all day at the school and were told on Sunday evening that they would be able to board a plane back to the UK free of charge. \u201cAt some point on Sunday, people were told they could go back to the resort [by the travel operator], which some people did before being evacuated again,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where the flights were going in the UK, and were asked to put down a preference for where we wanted to go.\u201d The family arrived back in Birmingham on Monday morning, with some of their belongings still at the Lindia Thalassa hotel in Pefkos. Walker said he was yet to contact the travel company for a refund. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to pack everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you cannot plan for the fires, and understand this year\u2019s fires are extreme, but they could have had an evacuation plan in place in case something like this happened. \u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be more of these fires in future.\u201d A woman celebrating her honeymoon on Rhodes has spoken of her \u201ctraumatic\u201d experience after she and her husband were forced to evacuate their hotel on Saturday. Claire Jones, 36, and her husband, Paul, also 36, were evacuated by coach from the Village Rhodes beach resort near Lardos. They were driven to another beach, where they were placed on three different boats to escape from the wildfires. She told the PA news agency: It was really quite traumatic driving to where we went because you could see everyone fleeing their hotels, and people were walking along the beaches, walking along the roads, and they had babies and small children. Before the coaches arrived, Jones recalled: When we got to the car park and you could see the fires getting closer and closer and closer, and the coaches weren\u2019t turning up [...] that was really worrying. When we first got on the coach, that was the most scary, because I thought \u2018if that wind blows towards us, that fire is going to hit this coach\u2019. Jones added that she and her husband were \u201cvery lucky\u201d as they managed to flee to Faliraki in the north of the island, where they had planned to stay later in their trip. All Thomas Cook customers who had to leave their accommodation in Rhodes over the weekend are either returning home or staying in another hotel. The travel firm said about 50 customers were forced to evacuated because of the wildfires that have hit part of the island, PA reports. In a statement, it went on: We no longer have any customers in evacuation centres. We are in touch with customers who arrived on the island yesterday to areas unaffected by the fire and they are enjoying their holiday. We will continue to monitor the situation and work with our local partners and local authorities to ensure the safety of our customers. We are extending our policy for offering full and swift refunds to customers who are due to travel to Rhodes up to and including Wednesday 26 July and no longer wish to do so. The Liberal Democrats are calling on the Foreign Office to add Rhodes to to its \u201cred list\u201d - and advise British nationals against all but essential travel, the BBC reports. \u201cThanks to Conservative ministers\u2019 inaction, many families are unable to make a claim against their insurance \u2013 leaving them paying the penalty for deciding not to fly out to the island,\u201d the Lib Dems\u2019 foreign affairs spokesperson said in a statement. PA reports on the latest statements from airlines: An easyJet spokeswoman said the company is doing \u201call it can\u201d to help customers in Rhodes and invited those due to travel to or from the island until Saturday to change the date for free. A Tui spokeswoman said the firm\u2019s \u201cmain priority\u201d is customers\u2019 safety and its staff are doing \u201call they can\u201d to help those affected by the fires. The firm later said: \u201cWe appreciate how distressing and difficult it\u2019s been for those who have been evacuated and ask that they continue to follow the advice of the local authorities and keep in touch with the Tui reps who are present in all evacuation centres. Our teams will be contacting customers with any updates as soon as they can. \u201cWe have cancelled all outbound flights to Rhodes up to and including Tuesday, and passengers due to travel on these flights will receive full refunds. \u201cPassengers due to travel on Wednesday will be offered a fee-free amend to another holiday or the option to cancel for a full refund. We are still operating flights to bring those customers currently on holiday elsewhere in Rhodes home as planned.\u201d Jet2, which has cancelled all flights and holidays due to depart to Rhodes up to and including Sunday, has \u201csignificantly increased\u201d the number of its staff on the island.\u201d Greece is often hit by wildfires during the summer months but the climate crisis has led to more extreme heatwaves across southern Europe, raising concerns that tourists will stay away, Reuters reports. Tourism accounts for 18% of Greece\u2019s GDP and one in five jobs. On Rhodes and many other Greek islands, reliance on tourism is even greater. Civil Protection said practically every region of Greece was facing the threat of wildfires on Monday ranging from high, very high to state of alert. Temperatures over the past week have exceeded 40C (104F) in many parts of the country and were forecast to persist in the coming days. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has told parliament: \u201cFor the next few weeks we must be on constant alert. We are at war, we will rebuild what we lost, we will compensate those who were hurt,\u201d Reuters reports. He added: \u201cThe climate crisis is already here, it will manifest itself everywhere in the Mediterranean with greater disasters.\u201d Tour operators flew home nearly 1,500 holidaymakers at the start of a mass evacuation from wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes on Monday, Reuters said. Officials said the threat of further fires was high in almost every region of the country. Ryanair said its flights to and from Rhodes were operating as normal and it was monitoring the situation on Monday. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said Ryanair had not seen passengers seeking to cancel flights to Rhodes over the weekend, given fires were more in the south of the island and the airport and most resorts in the north. Up to 10,000 Britons are estimated to be on fire-ravaged Rhodes, with repatriation flights to rescue holidaymakers landing back in the UK. PA reported the Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said it was \u201cpeak holiday season\u201d, with between 7,000 and 10,000 Britons estimated to be on the island. He told Times Radio: What we\u2019re telling people to do is to keep in touch with their tourist company, and that is the right advice. There were only 10 free beds on the whole island when I asked yesterday. But we think that something like 1,000 beds may well come back on stream today as others don\u2019t now come and therefore more beds are available.\u201d In Greece, help has continued to arrive from the rest of the European Union and elsewhere, with Turkish firefighting planes joining the effort in Rhodes, where eight water-dropping planes and 10 helicopters buzzed over flames up to five meters (16 feet) tall despite low visibility, The Associated Press reports. \u201cThe risk of fire will be extreme in several areas of Greece today,\u201d a fire service spokesperson, Vassilis Vathrakogiannis ,said a day after temperatures on the southern Greek mainland hit 45C (113F). Wildfires killed 15 people in the mountainous Bejaia and Bouira regions of Algeria on Monday, the interior ministry said, as a heatwave spreads across north Africa and southern Europe, Reuters reports. About 7,500 firefighters were trying to bring the flames under control, authorities said. Firefighters were also at work in the Boumerd\u00e8s, Tizi Ouzou, Jijel and Skikda regions. About 1,500 people had been evacuated. A heatwave has hit north African countries, with temperatures reaching 49C (120F) in some Tunisian cities. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has contacted the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to offer additional assistance. \u201cI called Mitsotakis to express our full support for Greece, which is confronted with devastating forest fires and a heavy heat wave due to climate change,\u201d she tweeted. Dr Douglas Kelley, a land surface modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, said: It is too early to say if climate change has caused these wildfires. However, the fact there are now so many across the world, most recently in Greece and Canada, is a clear sign that climate change is causing an increase in the number of severe wildfires globally. Heatwaves such as the one in Greece are more likely under climate change. A heatwave dries out vegetation and dead plant material, which makes the fires more intense and spread much faster, especially with the recent high winds. While not uncommon in southern Europe, what was unusual about the fires in Rhodes was the intensity and the speed at which they spread. We predict there will be a global increase in these extreme fires of up 50% by the end of the century. There is a feedback loop where fires in ecosystems that store large amounts of carbon, such as forests, result in the release of vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This exacerbates global warming, which in turn increases the risk of wildfires. Even if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are likely to be more wildfire events by 2100 because global temperatures are continuing to rise and are expected to reach 1.5 to 2 degrees celsius higher than pre-industrial times. This means that communities in some regions will need to adapt to increases in burning.\u2019\u2019 Greek authorities say they have evacuated nearly 2,500 people from Corfu on Monday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Earlier, the UK\u2019s Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said no evacuations were taking place on the island on Monday morning. About 2,400 visitors and locals were evacuated from the Ionian island on Sunday and Monday, a local fire service spokesperson has said, adding that the departures are a precaution. \u201cWe are at war and are exclusively geared towards the fire front,\u201d the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told parliament, warning that the country faced \u201canother three difficult days ahead\u201d before high temperatures were forecast to ease. Downing Street has defended its decision not to discourage Britons from going to Rhodes, saying it does not want to \u201cact out of proportion to the situation on the ground\u201d. The government has sent a small Foreign Office team to help holidaymakers. Now, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson has said: Our advice is focused on the safety of British nationals and enabling people to make an informed decision about the situation on the ground. The current situation is impacting on a limited area in Rhodes and, whilst it\u2019s right to keep it under review and it\u2019s possible that the advice may change, we do not want to act out of proportion to the situation on the ground. He said there were \u201cnot currently\u201d plans to get the RAF to help people leave. Ludovica Gazze, an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick, says the pollution from the wildfires is likely to have an effect throughout Greece \u2013 and beyond. The economic costs of wildfires are substantial and widespread. There are the immediate and visible costs of healthcare and assistance, as well as forgone tourist income. There are also the invisible costs of the pollution caused by wildfires, which can travel hundreds of miles as we saw in the case of the Canada wildfires in June. Pollution worsens health, cognition, and productivity. Thankfully, these fires in Rhodes and Corfu seem more contained, but the costs will be borne by the whole country, and beyond in the case of pollution. The key here is prevention: we need to think about where and how we build homes and hotels. King agreed with other scientists, who have said that \u2013 while many wildfires are started by people, whether on purpose or by accident \u2013 rising temperatures and drier conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis mean fires can spread with lethal speed and ferocity. There\u2019s no coincidence at all that climate change has driven these higher temperatures, and the higher temperatures are causing the fires that are spreading. The only way to tackle this is deep and rapid emissions reductions. In terms of greenhouse gases, we have virtually doubled the amount of greenhouse gases compared to the pre-industrial level. Tourists planning trips to the Mediterranean should see the Greek wildfires as a \u201cbig, big warning\u201d, with the climate crisis highly likely to fuel more severe blazes in future, one of the UK\u2019s leading climate scientists says. Sir David King, a former UK chief scientific adviser and chair of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, has said many people will die from heat stress because of the relentless heatwaves over southern Europe, where millions of Britons travel on holiday each year. Speaking to the PA news agency from another Greek island, King warned tourists to take care in the heat, adding that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d the extreme temperatures were due to melting ice in the Arctic caused by greenhouse gases emitted by people heating the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. If you are in one of these very warm areas and you haven\u2019t got air conditioning indoors you could suffer terribly \u2013 many people will die from heat stress. You must have moving air \u2013 it makes an enormous difference. If there\u2019s a large fan, preferentially a roof fan, that is moving the air in the room ... because moving the air helps to remove the perspiration from your body and keeps you cooler. I wouldn\u2019t be too dogmatic about advice but, certainly, there\u2019s a big, big warning this summer. To anyone planning to go overseas for the summer, \u2018be very careful\u2019 would be my advice. Fires have broken out on the island of Corfu after Greek authorities called for the country\u2019s largest wildfire evacuation. At the time of writing, there are 82 wildfires burning across Greece, with evacuations taking place on the north-east side of the island of Corfu. If you\u2019ve been affected by wildfires on Corfu, or are working to combat them, we would like to hear from you. We are also interested in hearing from people who have changed their travel plans because of the fires. Some commentators have pointed to the potential for arson to be a cause of the wildfires as a form of \u201cgotcha\u201d to those warning wildfires are made more likely \u2013 and more deadly \u2013 by the climate emergency. Scientists have addressed this. While ignition may not be caused by a warming planet, the area being hotter and drier due to climate breakdown makes the development of a wildfire more likely. Prof Stefan Doerr, the director of the Centre for Wildfire Research, Swansea University, says: I have not heard about any specific causes of ignition for these fires. The media often focus on these, however, during times of extreme fire weather (very dry vegetation, very high temperatures, low air humidity and strong winds) any ignition can rapidly turn into a fast moving wildfire. That could be faulty power lines, small intentional fires to burn debris getting out of control, sparks from moving machinery or building activity, arson etc. Focusing mainly on ignition sources (there will always be some) distracts from the main issues which are more flammable landscapes due to insufficient management of vegetation and more extreme weather due to climate change. Dr Matthew Jones, from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of Environmental Sciences, UEA, added: Under climate change, what\u2019s changing is the frequency of the weather conditions that enable fires like this to break out, and also to burn so intensely and synchronously across the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean has seen a dramatic increase in the frequency of the hot, dry conditions that were considered extreme at the end of the last century, and these increases are expected to accelerate for each added degree of warming in future. To minimise the additional risk of events like these in future, we \u2013 that is, policymakers and wider society \u2013 must deliver on the ambition shown in Paris in 2015 to limit warming to no more than 2C. This is just one more example of how climate change can impact society in negative and costly ways, and why there is so much urgency to do something about it now. Three repatriation flights to return hundreds of holidaymakers from Rhodes are planned on Monday evening, Jet2 says. The holiday firm said a flight carrying 95 people landed at Leeds Bradford airport late on Sunday evening. In addition to more than 50 scheduled flights, one flight will depart for Manchester, another for Leeds Bradford and a third for Birmingham later on Monday. A spokesperson has said: We understand how difficult this experience has been for many, and our entire focus is on looking after our customers. We have a significantly expanded presence in Rhodes, with a huge team of experienced colleagues providing all the support we can for our customers, whether that is in affected areas or at Rhodes airport. We have also put on three repatriation flights to bring our customers home, which is on top of our scheduled programme of flights that will continue to operate from Rhodes to the UK this week. We are continuing to make decisions in the best interests of our customers, and we are keeping everything under constant review. Mitchell\u2019s comments about the importance of the climate crisis to the government come as the prime minister Rishi Sunak makes a somewhat more equivocal assessment. He has stressed that he wants to tackle the issue in what he calls a \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d way that does not unnecessarily impact people\u2019s lives. Asked whether he stands by the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 by broadcasters on a visit to a housing development in Worcestershire, the Sunak insisted: Of course net-zero is important to me. So yes we\u2019re going to keep making progress towards our net-zero ambitions and we\u2019re also going to strengthen our energy security. I think the events over the last year or two have demonstrated the importance of investing more in homegrown energy, whether that\u2019s more nuclear or offshore wind. I think that\u2019s what people want to see and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to deliver. Asked whether he will stand up to the MPs within his party who are urging against net-zero policies, Sunak said: Actually, I\u2019m standing up for the British people because I\u2019m also cognisant that we\u2019re living through a time at the moment where inflation is high. That\u2019s having an impact on household and families\u2019 bills. I don\u2019t want to add that, I want to make it easier. So yes we\u2019re going to make progress towards net-zero but we\u2019re going to do that in a proportionate and pragmatic a way that doesn\u2019t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives \u2013 that\u2019s not what I\u2019m interested in and prepared to do. The situation on Rhodes is \u201cundoubtedly a wakeup call\u201d on the climate crisis, Mitchell says. He has told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We had, just a couple of weeks ago, the hottest day, on Monday, that the world has ever experienced. Those temperatures were then exceeded on the Wednesday for a second weekly record. And then, on Thursday, the third record in one week. The highest temperatures the planet has ever seen. Climate change is real. It is now. And it is essential that the world combats it, and Britain is playing a leading role in doing that. Mitchell has claimed it is not the moment to \u201cspend too much time\u201d on whether the UK government should have acted sooner in providing support to people on holiday on Rhodes. Asked about reports that Conservative chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee Alicia Kearns said ministers should have acted sooner, Mitchell has told LBC radio: I think now probably is not the time to spend too much time on this. The important thing today is to make sure that we do everything we can to support those poor Brits who have been caught up in this. But Alicia is doing her job ... we must always be held to account in a transparent way in government. He told BBC Breakfast earlier: We deployed immediately a rapid forward team of six experts from the British Foreign Office, as well as four Red Cross operators as well. They are based at the airport. As of last night, they\u2019d had 20 people come to them for support, all of whom we have been able to support. But we are monitoring the situation hour by hour. While wildfires rage on the Greek islands Rhodes and Corfu, with thousands of British tourists thought to currently be there, the UK government continues to refuse to advise against travel to the country. The Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell told broadcasters this morning that \u201conly 10%\u201d of Rhodes is affected by the fires, meaning \u201cit is the tourist companies and the holiday experts who are best placed to give guidance on whether or not a family or individuals\u2019 holidays are going to be ruined by these events\u201d. We\u2019ll be following the news from Greece as it comes in throughout the day."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dd6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/tony-bennett-duets-frank-sinatra-lady-gaga", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "From Frank Sinatra to Lady Gaga: Tony Bennett\u2019s greatest duets", "lead": "The legendary singer\u2019s death leaves behind a career filled with captivating duets alongside contemporaries and younger stars", "author": "Rob LeDonne", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 17:00:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678444", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e33b721ae48d5cc315e914caa7b68b58cda2dc0/0_54_3500_2102/500.jpg", "body": "The death of Tony Bennett, one of the most beloved singers of all time, leaves behind a stacked discography of some of the greatest covers in the Great American Songbook. But while Bennett was no doubt a towering artist on his own, his expansive career was expertly accented by a penchant for collaboration. Whether through his two massively successful Duets albums which featured Bennett alongside a host of artists, or through his award-winning partnerships with everyone from Lady Gaga to Diana Krall as well as a spate of one-offs, Bennett clearly relished sharing the stage with mentors, mentees and contemporaries alike. Sifting through a seven-decade discography, here are a few of some of the icon\u2019s best duets throughout a gold standard career. I Left My Heart in San Francisco with Judy Garland Only a talent like Judy Garland can invigorate what would become a trademark tune of Bennett\u2019s career. By the time the two joined forces on I Left My Heart in San Francisco for a 1963 episode of The Judy Garland Show, the song was already a smash. In the hands of the two legends, it leapt into the stratosphere; a mutual respect apparent. \u201cOne of the best compliments I ever received was from Judy,\u201d Bennett wrote in his 2012 book Life is a Gift. \u201cShe said that I was the epitome of what entertainers were put on earth for.\u201d New York, New York with Frank Sinatra Frank Sinatra once called Tony Bennett his favorite entertainer, a stamp of approval that lasted for the entirety of Bennett\u2019s career. The two were indelibly linked: dynamite vocalists who exuded class, were larger than life and championed great music. While the two legends collaborated a variety of times (check out their swingin\u2019 version of the Chicago ode My Kind of Town) their most notable duet is on a song about another town they\u2019re both most linked to. Jersey-born Sinatra famously dreamt of the Big Apple and first shot to fame there, while Bennett was born in Queens and spent the majority of his life in Manhattan, over the years delivering memorable performances at both Carnegie Hall and Radio City (where he took his final bow in August 2021). That backstory makes the triumphant lyrics to the Theme from New York New York that much more meaningful. Cheek to Cheek with Lady Gaga It was a partnership that forever altered the career of the two musical icons. For Gaga, her association with Bennett gave her an air of gravitas, allowed her to explore an entirely new aspect to her artistry and helped prove she wasn\u2019t just a dance-pop act known for outrageous outfits. For Bennett, Gaga helped introduce the legend she so revered to a new generation of fans, and delivered one final triumphant chapter of a decades-spanning career. The bond the two shared has been oft-discussed, and it all started with this title track of their first album together of standards from the Great American Songbook Body and Soul with Amy Winehouse Four months before the tragic death of Amy Winehouse in July 2011, her final-ever recording session was with Bennett for his Duets II album. Winehouse grew up with a passion for crooners like Bennett and the aforementioned Sinatra, and the two enjoyed a mutual respect for each other. \u201cShe said she was nervous because she had never recorded a song with someone she considered one of her idols,\u201d Bennett later recalled. \u201cAfter running through a few bars, she said she hadn\u2019t recorded for a long time \u2013 her only reference to the problems she\u2019d been living through.\u201d The vocals Winehouse delivers, perhaps reminiscent of Billie Holiday, showcase that raw emotion. Love is Here to Stay with Diana Krall In the midst of the final decade of Bennett\u2019s life, the artist not only recorded with Gaga but enjoyed a fruitful collaboration and kinship with fellow jazz great Diana Krall. In 2018, the two teamed up for Love is Here to Stay; a tribute to the songwriting greats George and Ira Gershwin, with Bennett and Krall delivering a definitive version of the titular American standard. Clocking in at over four minutes, the two take their sweet time to equally delicious results, from its little-heard introduction to a brilliantly understated ending. What we wind up with is one of the greatest love songs ever written courtesy two artists at the top of their game. Young and Foolish with Bill Evans By the 1970s, Bennett experienced a sad lull; the sounds of swing and jazz simply weren\u2019t cool any more and Bennett\u2019s personal life was in disarray thanks to a crumbling marriage and a drug habit. One of the few bright spots of this era is his collaboration with the pianist Bill Evans; the two stripped away the sound of a large band and simply zeroed in on Bennett\u2019s voice and Evans\u2019s lush virtuosity on the piano. The pair recorded two exemplary albums, one of which included the standout Young and Foolish. It\u2019s a cover of a fluffy show tune from the obscure 50s-era musical Plain and Fancy, transformed here into an emotionally powerful musing. By 1980, Evans would be dead of a drug overdose; while Bennett would go on to pick up the pieces of his life and reinvent himself once more. Don\u2019t Get Around Much Anymore with Michael Bubl\u00e9 Aside from the aforementioned Gaga, Bennett influenced a host of modern singers; teaching them about his passion for the Great American Songbook and laying a blueprint as to how to navigate life as a classic crooner. One of his many disciples, Michael Bubl\u00e9 grew up listening to the legend, modeling much of his career after him. Their joint charisma shines on Don\u2019t Get Around Much Anymore, a song that while boasting melancholy lyrics, comes across downright joyful thanks to their vocal prowess. Smile with Barbra Streisand Known for her own string of duets, Barbra Streisand joined with Bennett to take on this Charlie Chaplin-written classic for his debut Duets album. Accompanied by glistening piano, Bennett starts out subtly before Streisand joins in on the second verse. By the last line when the two simultaneously sing \u201cWhen you just smile,\u201d you know you have just heard something special. How Do You Keep the Music Playing with Aretha Franklin From Bennett\u2019s second Duets album, How Do You Keep the Music Playing tells the tale of the smoldering embers of a long relationship; posing that all-too important question of how one makes it last. It\u2019s only fitting that he\u2019s alongside the Queen of Soul herself as the two trade their unmistakable vocals. Aside from the expert deliveries by the two late legends, if the lyrics sound painfully truthful perhaps that\u2019s also because they were written by the dynamic married songwriting duo: Alan and Marilyn Bergman. I\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin with Lady Gaga For what would become the final album Bennett recorded, he teamed up with Gaga for the Cole Porter-tribute Love for Sale on which the two energetically have a blast on the peppy I\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin, a song perhaps made most famous by Sinatra. For Bennett, the song and album turned out to be a perfect bow. By the time of his final-ever performance at Radio City Music Hall in August 2021, Bennett was in the midst of Alzheimer\u2019s and Gaga proved to be the perfect partner as he took the stage, and gracefully helped usher him off into the annals of music history."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dd7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/24/pound-economy-interest-rate-rises", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pound on worst run since March 2020 as weak economy curbs interest rate rises", "lead": "New report suggests British economy almost stalled in July as consumers limited spending", "author": "Larry Elliott Economics editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:48:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678463", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/69db5037f8d27ef7b32b3fa980ccabf2d17ff2c1/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The pound has suffered its longest stretch of daily falls since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic amid growing speculation in the currency markets that a weakening economy will limit further increases in UK interest rates. With a new report released on Monday saying the UK economy almost stalled in July, sterling lost ground for a seventh day in a row against the US dollar \u2013 its worst run since March 2020. The losing streak reflects the belief that the Bank of England will no longer need to raise official borrowing costs from 5% to more than 6% in order to tame inflation. Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee meets next week, when it is expected to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points in its 14th consecutive increase since December 2021. Higher interest rates tend to support currencies by offering investors a higher yield, but sentiment has turned against the pound in recent days, and in London trading it extended its fall against the dollar by a quarter of a cent to $1.281. Prior to its seven days of falls, sterling had stood at $1.314 \u2013 its highest level in 15 months. Fresh support for the notion that the Bank will not need to tighten policy as much as previously anticipated came from the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2013 a monthly snapshot of the state of the private sector produced by S&amp;P and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS). The report showed output falling from 52.8 in June to 50.7 in July \u2013 a level only slightly above the cutoff mark of 50 that separates a growing economy from one that is contracting. Activity in the service sector slipped from 53.7 to 51.5 while the recessionary conditions facing manufacturing worsened with output falling from 48.1 to 46.5. Despite signs that some firms were pushing up prices in response to higher wage bills, S&amp;P/CIPS said inflation across the private sector had fallen for five of the past six months and stood at its lowest level in more than two years. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cThe UK economy has come close to stalling in July which, combined with gloomy forward-looking indicators, reignites recession worries. \u201cJuly\u2019s flash PMI survey data revealed a deepening manufacturing downturn accompanied by a further cooling of the recent resurgence of growth in the service sector. \u201cRising interest rates and the higher cost of living appear to be taking an increased toll on households, dampening a post-pandemic rebound in spending on leisure activities. \u201cMeanwhile, manufacturers are cutting production in response to a worryingly severe downturn in orders, both from domestic and export markets.\u201d Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe survey strengthens the case for the MPC to revert to raising Bank rate by 0.25 points at next month\u2019s meeting, rather than unleash another 0.50 point hike. \u201cThe increase in interest rates delivered to date appears to be increasingly slowing the economy; the composite index fell to its lowest level since January, and to a level consistent with GDP merely holding steady.\u201d The PMI for the eurozone showed a similar picture to that in the UK, with a fall in activity across the combined manufacturing sectors falling from 49.9 in June to 48.9 in July pointing to a continuation of the recession in the 19 countries using the single currency."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dd8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/jim-powell-obituary", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jim Powell obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Writer and historian whose success as a novelist began when he was 61", "author": "Clare Sayce", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:46:25", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678481", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/aca1e885e4345bd0bbc9c3bf8d4a288993b58f18/0_272_960_576/500.jpg", "body": "My stepfather, Jim Powell, who has died aged 74 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, enjoyed a career in advertising and also ran his own pottery business for 20 years before achieving success as a novelist and historian later in life. On the publication of his first novel, The Breaking of Eggs, in 2010, when he was 61, he was selected as one of 12 Best New Novelists by BBC Two\u2019s Culture Show. He went on to write two more novels, Trading Futures (2016) and Things We Nearly Knew (2018). At the time of his death, he had just completed a fourth, While the Music Lasts, charting the past half century through interlocking lives of a group of acquaintances against the backdrop of the socio-political changes of the period. Born in London to James Powell, a solicitor, and his wife, Fiona (nee Michell-Clarke), Jim was educated at Charterhouse school in Surrey and studied history at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating in 1971. He narrowly missed becoming president of the Cambridge Union to Arianna Stassinopoulos, later co-founder of the Huffington Post. During one university vacation he worked as an office boy for the Beatles at their Apple offices in Savile Row, London. After Cambridge, he joined a London advertising agency, Wasey Campbell Ewald. There he managed lucrative accounts, including New Zealand lamb. Aged just 31 he was appointed managing director of the Michael Bungey agency. Jim had always said he would not remain in advertising for ever, and in the mid-1980s he set up a pottery business, Holdenby Designs, in Northamptonshire and Stoke-on-Trent, manufacturing ceramic tableware by designers including Suzanne Katkhuda, Carol Dunstan and Rachel Barker, and selling it in Europe and south-east Asia. Some of the designs are on display in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. He continued in the business until the early 2000s. Jim served for about 10 years as a Conservative member of Daventry district council, and he also joined the Samaritans. He helped his friend Francis Pym, the former foreign secretary, with his book The Politics of Consent (1984). In 1987 Jim stood as Conservative candidate for Coventry North West in the general election. In subsequent years, however, his disenchantment with the direction of Conservative party drove him leftwards. In 2012, Jim married the writer and editor Kay Sayce, gaining two step-daughters, Emma and me, and subsequently four step-grandchildren. The Powells divided their time between their home in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, and a farmhouse in south-west France. Jim\u2019s great-grandmother was the daughter of the novelist and poet Thomas Love Peacock. His research on her life led to the discovery of the family\u2019s involvement in the cotton trade in the 19th century; he turned his research into a PhD thesis, completed for Liverpool University in 2018 and a paper, Losing the Thread: Cotton, Liverpool and the American Civil War (Liverpool University Press, 2021), which was lauded by historians in the field. In addition to reading and writing, he enjoyed his four small grandchildren, cookery (especially rich puddings), researching his family history and generally being with people and making the most of life.

The police killing of Nahel, a 17-year-old of Algerian background, during a traffic stop last month triggered protest marches and six nights of disorder as young men clashed with police and set alight public buildings and cars. Many accused the government of allowing a culture of institutional racism in the police to fester. The officer who fired at Nahel has been charged with voluntary homicide and jailed awaiting trial. The French president used his first TV interview since the unrest to condemn what he called the \u201cindescribable violence\u201d of the clashes on the streets, including \u201cthe burning of schools, city halls, gyms and libraries\u201d and \u201cthe violence of looting\u201d. He said: \u201cThe lesson I draw from this is: order, order, order.\u201d Macron did not refer to concerns on the left and from rights groups that the rioting reflected longstanding anger over racism and discrimination in law enforcement. He instead took a hard line on the need for more authority, law and order, saying, \u201cOrder must prevail. There is no freedom without order.\u201d Macron repeated his suggestion that poor parenting, particularly by single parents, had contributed to teenagers as young as 16 taking to the streets against police. He said of those arrested: \u201cAn overwhelming majority have a fragile family framework, either because they come from a single-parent family or their family is on child support benefits.\u201d He said he would launch policies in the autumn to focus on parenting skills and supporting families. Macron also repeated his criticism over the role of social networks during the unrest and looting, saying: \u201cWe need to better protect our teenagers and young adults from screens.\u201d He said certain content should be removed when it was a call to violence and that \u201cpublic digital order\u201d was needed \u201cto stop excesses\u201d. Macron was also questioned about the growing controversy over the jailing of a police officer accused of violently assaulting a young man during clashes in Marseille. A 21-year-old man, named as Hedi, said he was beaten by four or five men, who he identified as police. Hedi\u2019s lawyer said he was also hit in the head by a blast ball fired by police, had to undergo surgery, and risks losing sight in an eye. Four Marseille police officers were charged last week over the incident, one of whom was remanded in custody awaiting trial. But France\u2019s national police chief, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Veaux, said in a newspaper interview that law enforcement officers under investigation should not be jailed like ordinary citizens. \u201cKnowing that he is in prison is stopping me from sleeping,\u201d Veaux told Le Parisien. \u201cIn general, I believe that ahead of a possible trial, a police officer should not be in prison, even if he may have committed serious faults or errors in the course of his work.\u201d The Paris police chief, Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, tweeted that he shared Veaux\u2019s opinion. Several hundred Marseille police officers have gone on sick leave in protest over the officer\u2019s detention. The French left reacted with fury, saying the police chief was essentially considering police officers to be above the law. Macron steered clear of giving a direct reaction, saying he understood the \u201cemotion\u201d of the police after the difficulties of tackling the recent unrest, but emphasised that \u201cno one in the republic is above the law\u201d. The Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely serious, the entire police hierarchy places itself above justice and the rules of pre-trial detention \u2026 What\u2019s at stake here is democracy and respect for the rule of law. Parliament must be reconvened urgently.\u201d C\u00e9cile Mamelin, the vice-president of the Union of Magistrates, said the comments by the national police chief were \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cextremely serious in a state of law\u201d. Macron\u2019s views on the urban disturbances were also criticised by opposition politicians. The left condemned him for pointing the finger at single parents, and Faure said of Macron\u2019s promise of \u201corder, order, order\u201d: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it to liberty, equality, fraternity, thank you.\u201d Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party said Macron had failed to establish a culture of law and order."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dda", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/tennessee-student-meme-lawsuit-free-speech", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": " US student sues over suspension for posting memes making fun of principal", "lead": "Tennessee student, 17, and advocates call the punishment a violation of the first amendment", "author": "Erum Salam", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:33:55", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678520", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8a7e10c30ea5d9bae4899676ef2b38d1d9e1c87b/0_346_4608_2765/500.jpg", "body": "A Tennessee student is suing his school district after he was suspended for posting memes making fun of his principal. The 17-year-old student shared three memes that he made and published online with the principal\u2019s face cut out on different backgrounds. One meme showed the principal as a cat in a french maid\u2019s outfit. The stunt resulted in a three-day, out-of-school suspension for the student. But the Tullahoma high school student and his advocates called the punishment a violation of the first amendment, the constitutional right to free speech. With support from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire), he recently filed a lawsuit demanding the removal of the suspension from his record and a halt to the policy that led to the punishment. The brewing case could be the latest to test the concept of free speech in schools. In a landmark 1969 decision, the US supreme court ruled in a case titled Tinker v Des Moines that students do not \u201cshed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate\u201d. Yet schools are generally understood to have the right to enforce reasonable rules which aim to limit disruptions on campus. In a complaint filed on 19 July, Fire asserted that \u201chigh schools cannot punish a student for satirizing the principal on social media when the satire occurs off campus and does not cause substantial disruption at school\u201d. \u201cA principal\u2019s pride is not an exception to the first amendment,\u201d the complaint added. Lead attorney Conor Fitzpatrick told the Guardian: \u201cOne of the main things we\u2019re trying to do here is cement the rights of American students to express themselves on social media, without fear of censorship, as long as what they\u2019re expressing doesn\u2019t disrupt the school day. The school has no business jumping in and acting as a censor. If something they post \u2026 might be inappropriate, that\u2019s a matter for their parents \u2013 not the government.\u201d Meanwhile, the Tullahoma high school maintains a social media policy which prohibits students from posting images that embarrass, humiliate or discredit staff members or other students. The policy reads: \u201cParticipation in activities, groups, and teams is a privilege at Tullahoma high school. Using social media by a student \u2018unbecoming of a Wildcat\u2019 may result in discipline, including suspension or removal from the activity, group, leadership position, or team.\u201d Fire countered that the policy \u2013 which refers to the Wildcats nickname used by Tullahoma\u2019s sports teams \u2013 is \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d. The student plaintiff argues that his memes \u2013 which he posted while off campus \u2013 did not cause any disruption at his school, and he intended for them to be interpreted as satire, which is a constitutionally protected form of free speech. Tullahoma city schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604ddb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/letter-richard-stokes-obituary", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Letter: Richard Stokes obituary", "lead": "<strong>Hugh Kerr writes:</strong> I got some very good advice and entertaining stories from Richard Stokes", "author": "Hugh Kerr", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:07:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678565", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cb197556e521872fe330b299a41ce161769e4c1b/0_409_2134_1279/500.jpg", "body": "As a social work student at the LSE in 1964 I was lucky enough to be given a placement in the personnel department at Glaxo in Greenford, Middlesex, where Richard Stokes was the director.

Mauricio Pochettino is determined to upgrade his midfield with Mois\u00e9s Caicedo but that move has stalled over Brighton\u2019s demand for Levi Colwill to be included in the deal. Brighton have set Caicedo\u2019s price at \u00a3100m and are taking a tough stance in talks over the midfielder after rejecting a \u00a370m bid last week. Negotiations are moving slowly and Chelsea have been informed their chances of signing Pochettino\u2019s top target will increase if they compromise on Colwill, who spent last season on loan at Brighton. Chelsea are determined not to lose Colwill and made that clear when they rejected a \u00a330m bid for the defender from Brighton last month. Pochettino has backed the 20-year-old to become one of the best centre-backs in England and is short of defensive options after selling Kalidou Koulibaly and losing Wesley Fofana to a serious knee injury. Brighton remain intent on signing Colwill \u2013 their move for the Fiorentina defender Igor is unlikely to alter their position \u2013 and have continued to bring up his name during talks over Caicedo. Roberto De Zerbi, Brighton\u2019s manager, spoke effusively about Colwill before facing Chelsea in a pre-season friendly last Saturday. The situation is understood to have reached an impasse and Chelsea\u2019s recruitment team must weigh up how best to continue the pursuit of Caicedo. Chelsea are reluctant to pay \u00a3100m for the Ecuador international, who wants to move to Stamford Bridge, but are expected to make a third bid for the 21-year-old soon. There is a feeling the deal is unlikely to be concluded swiftly, with Brighton prepared to let negotiations run until the end of the window and test Chelsea\u2019s determination to keep Colwill. The England Under-21 international is relaxed about his future and has held positive talks with Pochettino. Colwill\u2019s aim is to play regular football and boost his chances of being included in England\u2019s squad at Euro 2024. Chelsea, who want to hand Colwill a new long-term deal, will hope they do not have to look at alternatives to Caicedo. Pochettino is revamping his midfield after the departures of Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Mason Mount. Chelsea have embarked on a major clearout and there is increasing uncertainty over Gallagher\u2019s future. The midfielder has two years on his deal. Gallagher, who came through Chelsea\u2019s academy, has not made a final call on his future and has impressed during pre-season. However the 23-year-old has grown unsettled in recent months and is considering whether to leave. West Ham entered a bid of \u00a337m plus add-ons for Gallagher last week but that offer was rejected. The Hammers are targeting the Chelsea man after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal for \u00a3105m, while Spurs have considered him as a replacement for Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg, who is closing in on a move to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Newcastle have also targeted Gallagher, who could cost at least \u00a340m, but would need to sell a midfielder first. Chelsea are also hunting for additions in attacking midfield and are interested in Crystal Palace\u2019s Michael Olise, Lyon\u2019s Rayan Cherki, Celta Vigo\u2019s Gabri Veiga and Ajax\u2019s Mohammed Kudus. Olise, who is out for several months with a hamstring injury, has a \u00a335m buyout clause. Fulham are pushing to complete a deal for Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi. Lazio are interested in the winger, who has a year left on a deal worth about \u00a3120,000 a week, but Fulham remain in pole position. The 22-year-old is keen on moving to Craven Cottage and is waiting for Fulham to agree a fee. Hudson-Odoi, who spent last season on loan at Bayer Leverkusen, has been training with Chelsea\u2019s Under-21s. Fulham had their opening offer for Hudson-Odoi turned down last week and are looking for a compromise on a fee. Chelsea want to sell and are asking for about \u00a38m, whereas Fulham have looked at paying \u00a34m. Hudson-Odoi would compete with Willian for a place on the left wing at Fulham. Fulham are set to choose between Southampton\u2019s Mohammed Salisu and Calvin Bassey of Ajax after agreeing deals for both defenders.They have agreed to pay \u00a318m for Bassey and are also considering whether to press ahead with a \u00a315m move for Salisu. Gallagher is not the only Chelsea player on West Ham\u2019s radar. David Moyes wants a right-sided centre-back and the club have shortlisted Trevoh Chalobah. The 24-year-old also has interest from Internazionale, although Chalobah could be required to stay at Stamford Bridge because of Fofana\u2019s injury. West Ham have other options and have tried to sign Harry Maguire from Manchester United on loan. They have been working on a deal for the Manchester City centre-back Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who spent last season on loan at Burnley. West Ham intend to replace Rice with two midfielders and have held talks with Southampton over a deal for James Ward-Prowse. Southampton value Ward-Prowse at \u00a340m and the clubs are a long way apart on the 28-year-old\u2019s valuation. West Ham have had two bids rejected for Jo\u00e3o Palhinha and have cooled their interest in the Fulham midfielder after he sustained a shoulder injury during a friendly against Brentford. West Ham remain interested in Ajax\u2019s Edson \u00c1lvarez but the move has been held up by agent fees. Ajax could be persuaded to take \u00a335m for the Mexico midfielder, whose move to Borussia Dortmund collapsed over personal terms. West Ham are tracking United\u2019s Scott McTominay, Juventus\u2019s Denis Zakaria and Monaco\u2019s Youssouf Fofana."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604ddd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/24/tour-de-france-femmes-2023-riders-take-on-rolling-hills-to-mauriac-on-stage-two-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tour de France Femmes 2023: Liane Lippert wins stage two \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Liane Lippert of the Movistar team was victorious in a hilly stage two of the Tour de France Femmes that ended with a dramatic and wet finish", "author": "Amy Sedghi", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:07:09", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678602", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e425018d0171dc4e56824e4fd210b39af54f2556/0_0_4612_2767/500.jpg", "body": "Thanks for joining and following along on this dramatic, and damp, stage two of the Tour de France Femmes. Here\u2019s the stage two report: Liane Lippert of the Movistar team won stage two of the Tour de France Femmes in Mauriac, after the climbs of the Cantal proved as disruptive as predicted with multiple riders distanced in the 151.7km stage. Lippert, soaked to the skin, looks happy but shocked at her win today. She says she was glad when it started raining as she races well in wet conditions. Speaking after her win, she said: \u201cIt will stake a bit of time to realise it [she\u2019s won]. I\u2019m really happy. It\u2019s so special. I\u2019m really happy and proud of this [winning in her national jersey].\u201d The stage started with a crash. How did you manage to concentrate for the finish? \u201cI actually crashed twice: once in the neutral [start] and then on a climb. It was a bit of stress but the team did so well. Everybody was a big, big part of this. We came back after the crash and stayed calm in this rain. I always race well in the rain, so I was actually happy when it started.\u201d Did you think you were going to win? \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to win\u2026 I didn\u2019t believe it even when I crossed the line. I thought maybe there was a breakaway gone or something. I still need some time to realise. I\u2019ve been waiting so long for a win and to win at the Tour de France\u2026I couldn\u2019t wish for more.\u201d Kopecky has retained the maillot jeune and is still top placed for the points classification. She will be in the yellow jersey again tomorrow, while the second placed in points, Moolman Pasio will be in the green jersey. Kastelijn will be in the polka-dot jersey and C\u00e9drine Kerbaol will again wear the white jersey as top placed youth rider. Koster has been named most combative rider of stage two. Yellow: Lotte Kopecky (SD-Worx) 7hr 17min 36sec Green: Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance\u2013Soudal\u2013Quick-Step) 90pts Polka-dot: Yara Kastelijn (Fenix\u2013Deceuninck) 7pts White: C\u00e9drine Kerbaol (Ceratizit-WNT Pro Cycling) Here is the top five on stage two: 1. Liane Lippert (Movistar) 2. Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) 3. Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ) 4. Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal Quick-Step) 5. Christina Schweinberger (Fenix-Deceuninck) Liane Lippert (Team Movistar) comes out from behind Kopecky to take the win. Some might say Kopecky had a bit too much to do there, but happily for her, she retains the yellow jersey. 500m to go: Looks like Kopecky is being lined up for a second win by Vollering\u2026 1km to go: There are 25 riders at the front and Reusser attacks with 200m to the summit but Longo Borghini shuts it down. They all reach the top together. 2km to go: Told you it was raining\u2026 2km to go: The front group are ascending up the last climb of the day, the cat-three C\u00f4te de Tr\u00e9biac (3.4km at 5.8%). It\u2019s 1.5km to the summit now and the GC contenders are exchanging blows but no one has managed to get away yet. 3km to go: Niewiadoma and Moolman Pasio are in the front group with a roster of GC contendors, including Longo Borghini, van Vlueten and Demi Vollering. Kopecky is also present. 4km to go: Van Agt is the Jumbo-Visma rider who crashed on the downhill and into a barrier. It looked pretty nasty. Koster and Kastelijn are caught by Niewiadoma and Moolman Pasio. 6km to go: Crashes are happening all over the place in these grim conditions. An Uno-X rider went down and off into the pavement, while a Jumbo-Visma rider has crashed into a barrier. 9km to go: There\u2019s a very wet and horrible looking corner, which the lead trio managed to just navigate. Lauretta Hanson (Lidl-Trek) wasn\u2019t quite so lucky \u2013 she hit the deck and skidded for a little while. She\u2019s up and probably a bit bruised but looks to be getting back on to the bike. 10km to go: Interesting fact coming from Eurosport and being popped on here for you all: Van Agt, who is 26 years-old, only turned pro last year and comes from a background of field hockey. The final climb is coming up in around 5km. 14km to go: The weather must be bad\u2026Slappendel has taken off her sunnies. She doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying being on the back of a motorbike anymore \u2013 she says it\u2019s 10C and the roads are slippery. 16km to go: The breakaway group has gone back out to 50sec and it has started chucking it down. This could have a real impact on the finish. Ton has been caught and the GC teams are coming to the front of the bunch as they sense danger in these wet conditions. It looks like proper British weather\u2026 22km to go: Juliette Labous (DSM-Firmenich) attacks but Reusser shuts it down straightaway and it takes 30sec out of the breakaway\u2019s lead. Quinty Ton (Liv Racing Teqfind) is next to go and the peloton don\u2019t seem bothered as she has quite a big gap to bridge. Also, below are the results from the last climb. Kastelijn still leads the QOM standing with 7pts. Results at C\u00f4te de Merlhac: 1. Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), 2pts 2. Anouska Koster (Uno-X), 1pt 25km to go: The lead trio of Kastelijn, van Agt and Koster have a gap of around 47sec. The group behind the peloton, which includes Wiebes, are almost 5min behind. 34km to go: The riders have reached Mauriac. They now have a 36.7km loop and two categorised ascents before they wrap up for the day. 36km to go: Koster is first to cross the line at the intermediate sprint. Back in the bunch, Kopecky follows to take fourth place after the lead trio. Results of the intermediate sprint: 1. Anouska Koster (Uno-X), 25pts 2. Eva van Agt (Jumbo-Visma), 20pts 3. Yara Kastelein (Fenix-Deceuninck), 17pts 4. Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx), 15pts 5. Maria Confalonieri (Uno-X), 13pts 6. Eleonora Gasparrini (UAE Team ADQ), 11pts 7. Julia Borgstr\u00f6m (AG Insurance-Soudal Quick-Step), 10pts 8. Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx), 9pts 9. Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ), 8pts 10. Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance Soudal Quick-Step), 7pts 11. Lucinda Brand (Lidl-Trek), 6pts 12. Demi Vollering (SD Worx), 5pts 13. Romy Kasper (AG Insurance-Soudal Quick-Step), 4pts 14. Lauretta Hanson (Lidl-Trek), 3pts 15. Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), 2pts 37km to go: Kastelijn has been joined by Eva van Agt (Jumbo Visma) and Anouska Koster (Uno X). They have a gap of around 35sec. The intermediate sprint is coming up. 42km to go: So straight after the second-cat C\u00f4te des Plaines, the riders were treated to the cat-four C\u00f4te des Boissi\u00e8res. Kastelijn manages to hold on and is first over the top even after Marta Cavalli (FDJ-Suez) and Eva van Agt (Jumbo Visma) try to thwart her efforts. Here are the results from this latest categorised climb: Results at C\u00f4te des Plaines: 1. Julie Van de Velde (Fenix-Deceuninck), 5pts 2. Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), 3pts 3. Anouska Koster (Uno-X), 2pts 4. Magdeleine Vallieres (EF Education-Tibco-SVB), 1pt 44km to go: Van de Velde managed to hold on and take the points at the top of the C\u00f4te des Plaines but has now been caught. Her teammate Yara Kastelijn is at the front with Soraya Paladin (Canyon//Sram) and Anouska Koster (Uno-X). As predicted, these two climb have exploded the group. The peloton has fractured and riders are dropping off the back of the group as the peloton pace it up another climb. 46km to go: Last year\u2019s Tour de France Femmes winner, Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar Team) and Elisa Longo Borghini (Lidl-Trek) have been caught in a crash. Van Vleuten gets back up and has three of her teammates to help pace her back to the bunch quickly. Wiebes (SD Worx) has been dropped. 46km to go: Van de Velde goes again with a big effort. Riders are being dropped: Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) and Coryn Labecki (Jumbo-Visma) are among those off the back. 49km to go: Agnieszka Skalniak-Sojka (Canyon//Sram) attacks and \u00c9vita Muzic (FDJ-Suez) follows. Julie Van de Velde (Fenix-Deceuninck) goes also but Marlen Reusser (SD Worx) doesn\u2019t let her get away and the rest of the group are on them. 51km to go: Canadian national champion and Paris-Roubaix Femmes avec Zwift 2023 winner, Alison Jackson (EF Education-Tibco-SVB) has gone down with Dilyxine Miermont (St Michel-Mavic-Auber93) and Spela Kern (Cofidis). It looks like Jackson may have slipped on a greasy road and has a small cut on her arm. All three riders are up and back on their bikes. 54km to go: Williams and Ludwig have finally been caught by the peloton. As they see the bunch approaching, the two riders look at each other, smile and shake hands. The riders are all together now as they head towards the cat-two C\u00f4te des Plaines. It\u2019s a 4.5km climb with an average gradient of 5.5%. The riders will want to position themselves well going into this climb as it might well all kick off here. 56km to go: The peloton are speeding up ahead of the next \u2013 and hardest \u2013 climb of the day. Williams and Ludwig\u2019s gap is down to 10sec but it doesn\u2019t look like the peloton are actively trying to pull them in. It\u2019s more a case of the accelerating speed within the bunch naturally moving them closer to the breakaway. Arianna Fidanza (Jayco-Alula) crashed at the back of the bunch but is already back in the peloton. 60km to go: Some numbers have been crunched here by Le Tour Data. I\u2019ll pop it here for those of you who love analysing the stats. 62km to go: Here\u2019s an update from Slappendel on the back of the motorbike. She says the day started with a sunny 25C and the temperature has since dropped. \u201cThe first part of the race was pretty technical: climbing and descending. There\u2019s been rain showers so parts of the road are dry, some parts are wet. It\u2019s been challenging.\u201d She adds that it now seems like \u201can easier part of the day\u201d but the speeds are still testing and there is a nervousness in the bunch. 69km to go: The leading pair have been out front for 70km now. There\u2019s just under another 70km to go. Can they keep the gap going? It\u2019s dropped slightly to 1min 03sec. 75km to go: Williams and Ludwig have a gap of around 1min 30sec to the peloton. There\u2019s been some spots of rain and a couple of riders have reached for rain jackets from their team cars. It looks a bit grey and blustery in the coverage but not too wet. The women\u2019s peloton are being treated to quite different temperatures at the moment to what we saw in the men\u2019s race. It\u2019s about 18.4C out there, so it will be a bit chilly for the riders descending at their speeds. 84km to go: Ahead of today\u2019s stage Matt Stephens asked Iris Slappendel on Eurosport what she would say to the riders if she was a directeur sportif and wanted to beat the dominance of SD Worx. She says: \u201cThe strength is their depth of riders. I\u2019d say try to surprise them and try to isolate them.\u201d 88km to go: Taking a look at today\u2019s stage profile, it\u2019s a pretty lumpy one. Lots of ups and downs even without the categorised climbs. It\u2019s going to be a real test of the legs for these two time trialists. They\u2019re descending now but the hardest climb of the day is coming up next: the cat-two C\u00f4te des Plaines. It will be swiftly followed by the cat-four C\u00f4te des Boissi\u00e8res. 97km to go: Williams has swept up two more QOM points to place her one point ahead of Kopecky. Results at C\u00f4te de la St\u00e8le: 1. Georgia Williams (EF Education-Tibco-SVB), 2pts 2. Hannah Ludwig (Uno-X), 1pt 100km to go: Williams and Ludwig\u2019s gap has grown again and now stands at 50sec. It seems like the peloton aren\u2019t too worried about catching them at the moment. The riders are starting to climb the second categorised climb of today, the fourth-cat C\u00f4te de la St\u00e8le. It stretches for 1.8km, has an average gradient of 5.1% and with a summit at 1,250m. 105km to go: The peloton are gaining and the gap between them and the breakaway duo has been reduced to 25sec. I think we know which riders crested the C\u00f4te du Mont-Dore first, but here are the results anyway. Results at C\u00f4te de Mont-Dore: 1. Georgia Williams (EF Education-Tibco-SVB), 2pts 2. Hannah Ludwig (Uno-X), 1pt 107km to go: The gap to the breakaway pair has been reduced to 45sec. Interestingly, both Williams and Ludwig, who are out front, are time trial experts. Williams is a five-time New Zealand ITT champion, while Ludwig is a two-time U23 European ITT champ. I would love to see this pair time trial to the finish but I think that might be bit of a stretch\u2026 110km to go: The lead of 1min 35sec for Williams and Ludwig is remaining steady but they are about to hit the first categorised climb of the day. At 1.3km long, the cat-four C\u00f4te du Mont-Dore has an average gradient of 6.6% and tops out at 1,145m. 117km to go: Williams and Ludwig have grown their lead to 1min 35sec ahead of the peloton. Will they manage to stay away? There is still a very long way to go and in around 6-7km they\u2019ll start the first of the six categorised climbs of the day. 124km to go: Williams and Ludwig have seen their lead drop from slightly to just 1min. Kastelijn\u2019s attempt to get across to them has proved unsuccessful as she\u2019s been caught by the bunch. Wiebes, who had been dropped, is safely back in the peloton.A few riders have tried to get away from the peloton but the bunch are fast to react. 130km to go: Vos has made her way back into the bunch. Williams and Ludwig are still out front and Kastelijn carries on trying to bridge across. Elsewhere, Amandine Fouquenet (Arka) has had to abandon. Apparently, she started today\u2019s race with stomach issues but isn\u2019t feeling great and is unable to keep up. 134km to go: A group of around 40 riders, including Wiebes (I think), have managed to make it back to the bunch as the pace relents a little. 136km to go: Williams and Ludwig\u2019s lead has increased to 1min on the peloton. Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) is chasing and is 45sec behind the lead pair. 139km to go: Georgia Williams (EF Education-Tibco-SVB) and Hannah Ludwig (Uno-X) have opened a gap of around 255sec to the bunch. Vos is 20sec behind the peloton. Cycling commentator Hannah Walker is predicting fireworks on today\u2019s stage. What do you think? 140km to go: There\u2019s been a crash, which I don\u2019t have much detail on, but I hear that Margaux Vigi\u00e9 (Lifeplus Wahoo) and Elena Hartmann (Israel Premier Tech Roland) have quickly made their way back to the bunch. There is around a 20sec gap between the yellow jersey group and the grupetto. 141km to go: Earlier, during the neutralised zone, Liane Lippert (Movistar Team) crashed but got back on her bike. I\u2019ve now got the race tour radio blaring which is making me feel very much like I\u2019m riding in one of the official cars. 145km to go: As the road starts to rise, some riders are already starting to drop off. I\u2019m hearing that Christine Majerus (SD Worx) and Marianne Vos (Jumbo-Visma) are among the riders struggling with the pace at this time. 148km to go: The flag has been waved and the peloton are off! The first attack comes from the Polish national ITT champion Agnieszka Skalniak-Sojka (Canyon//Sram). Although other riders move to join her, the bunch quickly reacts. There are already splits forming in the bunch after a fast start. 152km to go: After a bit of a delay, the peloton have started rolling out. Today, 152 riders have started, with two abandons so far. They are Mireia Benito (AG Insurance-Soudal Quick-Step) who crashed out yesterday, and now Lara Viecelli (Israel Premier Tech), who is a non-starter due to \u201ca stomach issue\u201d. The update on Benito from her team is that she has suffered a concussion but there were no further complications. Kopecky is currently top in three classifications: the GC ranking, points and the mountains. Of course, she can only wear one jersey, so she will be in the maillot jaune today, while the second placed in points and mountain categories will wear the green sprinters jersey and polka-dot jersey, respectively. C\u00e9drine Kerbaol of Ceratizit-WNT Pro Cycling will be in the white jersey as top placed youth rider. Yellow: Lotte Kopecky (SD-Worx) 3hr 03min 59sec Green: Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance\u2013Soudal\u2013Quick-Step) 36pts Polka-dot: Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon\u2013SRAM) 2pts White: C\u00e9drine Kerbaol (Ceratizit-WNT Pro Cycling) The peloton was due to roll out at 1.05pm French time / 12.05pm UK time but are still making their to the start. Unfortunately, Eurosport\u2019s live coverage doesn\u2019t begin until 2pm UK, meaning we\u2019ll miss around 65km of racing. It\u2019s a bit rubbish but I will try my very best to bring you as many updates as I can via the live tracker and anything on social media until we have rolling TV coverage. Jeremy Whittle\u2019s Tour de France Femmes stage one report is here: Lotte Kopecky won the first stage of the 2023 Tour de France Femmes after a late solo breakaway to lead the overall standings by 45 seconds from her teammate Lorena Wiebes. On the third-category climb of the the C\u00f4te de Durtol, in the shadow of the Puy de D\u00f4me, Lotte Kopecky attacked yesterday to take the first Tour de France Femmes 2023 stage win, in Clermont-Ferrand. After attacking with 400m to the summit of the only real climb of the day, the Team SD Worx shot off to ride to victory, with the peloton failing to send any one after her. Teammate, Lorena Wiebes rolled in 45 seconds later to make it a one-two for SD Worx, while Charlotte Kool of Team DSM-Firmenich took third place. Today, the race shifts south for a hilly 148km from Clermont-Ferrand to Mauriac. Unlike yesterday\u2019s flat stage, today the riders face a mix of categorised climbs. There are six, in fact, with four cat-fours, one cat-three and one cat-two. The first categorised climb, the cat-four C\u00f4te du Mont-Dore arrives at 42.6km, while the final of the six categorised climbs, the C\u00f4tede Tr\u00e9biac offers up an uphill finish for the riders. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon\u2013SRAM) starts in polka-dots after placing second in the Queen of the Mountains classification behind Kopecky, who will be clad in the maillot jaune today. The day\u2019s solitary intermediate sprint comes at Mauriac after 112km. Yesterday\u2019s racing was speedy but cagey and we didn\u2019t see any successful attacks really until Kopecky\u2019s. With such a hilly stage, surely the peloton will fragment throughout the day but will we see any early attacks?

Now experts say an array of measures could help make towns and cities more friendly for the modern population, whose lives have become longer and waistlines larger. Among the proposed changes is an increase in the time given to people to cross the road. An Active Travel England (ATE) spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to enable millions more people to travel by walking, wheeling and cycling for short trips. A big part of that is being able to make sure crossing times are inclusive so that they give enough time for everyone to cross the road.\u201d According to 2019 guidance from the Department for Transport (DfT), the assumed speed at which people cross a road can be decreased from 1.2 metres a second to 1 metre a second where there is a large number of slower pedestrians, for example. Few councils, however, have adopted the change. The shift is expected to be incorporated into guidance from ATE and linked to council funding. While ATE said the guidance was still being finalised, it said changes to crossing times could be particularly beneficial for older people. A study published in 2012 by researchers at University College London found that among people aged 65 or older, 76% of men and 85% of women had a walking speed below the 1.2 metres per second needed to use a pedestrian crossing. \u201cCrossing times can be a challenge, particularly for elderly and disabled people, and a bad experience is enough to put someone off doing it,\u201d the ATE spokesperson said. Stephen Edwards, the chief executive of the charity Living Streets, said the shift to a lower assumed walking speed would be welcome, noting the current value was calculated in the 1950s and had not changed since. \u201cPeople walking and wheeling shouldn\u2019t have to race to get to safety. These updated guidelines are a step in the right direction,\u201d he said. The charity, which runs a number of campaigns to improve accessibility, is also calling for pedestrian crossings to stop the traffic more quickly, noting people were more likely to take risks when crossing roads if the delay was more than 30 seconds. Better walkways also matter, it notes, with the charity\u2019s research showing 31% of over-65s are prevented from walking on their local streets because of cracked pavements. Meanwhile, clutter-free pavements \u2013 cleared of badly parked scooters, wheelie bins and poorly placed signage \u2013 would improve safety by removing obstacles. Edwards said more public toilets and places to pause when walking would be another good outcome. \u201cPlaces to rest are incredibly important for people who can\u2019t walk long distances, including older people, those with chronic conditions or families with young children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to walk more of their everyday journeys to improve health and reduce congestion. However, if people don\u2019t have places to stop and rest or access to public bathrooms, they simply won\u2019t make the journey or will be forced into using less sustainable and less active ways to get around.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, also stressed the importance of such features for older people, adding good local amenities and public spaces also mattered. \u201cLiving a long fulfilling life is something we pretty much all aspire to, but one of the most important factors in helping us to live well for longer is our local environment,\u201d she said. With the number of people with dementia in the UK expected to rise from almost 900,000 in 2021 to 1.6 million in 2040, experts have also pointed to adaptations that could help those with such conditions. These include legible street signs, streets laid out in an irregular grid pattern, uncomplicated junctions, and distinctive features placed at decision points such as junctions. But experts say it is not only elderly people, or those with dementia, who should be kept in mind. Dr Rachel Colls at Durham University noted that there were also actions that could be taken to make urban spaces size-inclusive, such as making seating larger, that would also be beneficial for public transport. In this context having seats with movable arms, expandable seat belts and the capacity to book two seats if required would make these spaces more accessible, she said. But, Colls added, it was not just the built environment that needed to change, but also the social one. \u201cBeing a fat person in public space is difficult because attitudes towards fat people are so hostile,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what makes urban public spaces inaccessible: the fear of being judged, called names and being discriminated against.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604ddf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/24/ryanair-continues-flights-to-rhodes-despite-wildfires-as-profits-quadruple", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tui cancels flights to Rhodes as Ryanair continues despite wildfires", "lead": "Holiday firm offers refunds as Irish airline reports quarterly profits nearly quadrupled to \u20ac663m", "author": "Jasper Jolly and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:05:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678651", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d1bb2dc7c98a1da3a46533bde825b1df028231eb/0_169_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Tui has cancelled all outbound flights to Rhodes up to and including Friday 28 July, while Ryanair said it was business as usual despite the wildfires that have prompted large-scale evacuations of the Greek island.

All customers due to travel on these flights will receive full refunds. \u201cPassengers due to travel to areas not affected by fires on Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 July will be offered a fee free amend to another holiday or the option to cancel for a full refund,\u201d the travel company said. \u201cWe are still operating empty outbound flights to bring those customers currently on holiday elsewhere in Rhodes home as planned and working to get those in affected areas as soon as possible. The safety and wellbeing of our customers and teams remains our top priority.\u201d Meanwhile, Ryanair said its flights to Rhodes are operating as normal as it reported its profits had nearly quadrupled in the spring. The airline reported a rise in profits in the three months to the end of June to \u20ac663m (\u00a3572m) in marked contrast with the same period in 2022, when profits were \u20ac170m because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Ryanair said the jump was also down to a strong Easter and the extra bank holiday for King Charles\u2019s coronation. As demand for air travel soars, thousands of people were evacuated fromRhodesbecause of wildfires fanned by high winds and extreme heat. Between 7,000 and 10,000 British people were thought to be on the island as the wildfires spread, according to the Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell. Some wildfires have also broken out on the island of Corfu, off Greece\u2019s western coast. Ryanair said it continued to operate flights as usual to Rhodes airport \u2013 which is not in an area directly affected by the fires so far. The company operates flights to Rhodes from airports including London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Dublin. Despite the emergency evacuations and wildfires it said: \u201cRyanair flights to/from Rhodes and Corfu are currently operating as normal and unaffected by the forest fires.\u201d The company\u2019s Twitter accounts had not posted any information on the situation by Monday morning, instead posting a joke on Sunday night about Elon Musk\u2019s announcement that Twitter will change its name. Ryanair did say on its website that it was accepting temporary travel documentation issued by the Greek police for travellers who had lost their passports during the scramble to avoid wildfires. The consumer group Which? on Sunday said it would be \u201cunconscionable for holiday companies to cash in on travellers\u2019 sensible decision not to travel by not refunding or rebooking them\u201d if they decided not to travel to Rhodes. Some airlines have said they will allow passengers to rebook. The Jet2 airline said it would run four extra flights on Monday to bring customers back to the UK. The repatriation flights to Manchester, Leeds Bradford and Birmingham would bring home about 800 people. The airline, which said it was expecting its highest ever passenger numbers over the weekend, was already scheduled to operate 50 services from Rhodes to the UK this week. Tui said six additional planes had flown customers back to Hanover, Frankfurt and Stuttgart in Germany and to London Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester; another will fly to Billund in Denmark. The company said that it had about 39,000 guests on Rhodes on Sunday, of whom 7,800 were moved to other locations on the island. EasyJet said it would operate two repatriation flights on Monday from Rhodes to London Gatwick, in addition to scheduled flights, plus a third repatriation flight on Tuesday. Tui said on Sunday evening that all passengers due to travel to Rhodes, up to and including on Tuesday, would receive full refunds. Ryanair is operating its largest ever summer schedule, carrying as many as 600,000 passengers on 3,200 flights a day. The company said that \u201cEuropean short-haul capacity remains constrained this summer\u201d and that demand for the first half of the year is \u201crobust\u201d. However, its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said Ryanair would probably have to cut prices to attract passengers this winter, when it will have 25% more seats to fill than in 2019. At the same time, rising interest rates are gradually affecting more people, raising the costs for some mortgage borrowing and reducing disposable incomes. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of these macroeconomic trends,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in an analyst presentation on Monday. \u201cConsumer price inflation, higher interest rates, higher mortgage rates might affect consumer spending in the second half of the year.\u201d Ryanair shares were down by 6% on Monday, while the British Airways owner IAG dipped by 2%, easyJet was down by 4% and Tui fell by 3.5%."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/24/us-hollywood-actors-strike-premieres-promotion-red-carpet-barbie-oppenheimer", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018You need the glamour of a big opening\u2019: US actors\u2019 strike starts to bite on red carpet", "lead": "Blockbusters such as Barbie have weathered the absence of Hollywood stars from promotion \u2013 but behind-the-scenes workers are worried", "author": "Edward Helmore", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 16:02:34", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678684", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2e9b49d8f5f61c2ce19280b089bf2dba1e63244d/0_367_5500_3299/500.jpg", "body": "Margot Robbie\u2019s global tour of Barbie outfits didn\u2019t reach New York. A screening of Mattel\u2019s doll-inspired would-be mega-franchise stood in place of a premiere. With the actors on strike, it was a stiff in PR terms, but one that went unnoticed amid the year-long, $100m (\u00a380m), all-pink marketing drive leading up to the film\u2019s $155m US opening weekend. The same was true for Oppenheimer, whose US premiere was boycotted by its stars Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr, leaving director Christopher Nolan to walk a carpet to a screening \u201cto celebrate the crew and craftspeople who contributed to making this landmark film\u201d, according to Universal Pictures. Beyond the red carpet, the stars of the summer\u2019s box-office epics, including Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which opened a week before Barbie and Oppenheimer, are also not permitted under guidelines from the Screen Actors Guild/American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) to appear on TV shows, participate in interviews, or post about projects on social media while the strike is in effect, which could be until January. While the Barbie juggernaut sailed over the effects of the strike on its opening weekend, other films may not be so lucky. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damaging for everybody in terms of the big epics,\u201d says the London-based PR agent Mark Borkowski. \u201cIndiana Jones and Mission: Impossible just about got across the line. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting Barbie \u2013 in Leicester Square you can\u2019t walk anywhere without seeing lines of pink people.\u201d If the summer blockbusters are for now only lightly affected, that may be because the Hollywood studios and streamers, targeted by striking actors and writers over compensation and AI concerns, managed to delay the onset of the action by a few weeks, allowing Cannes to proceed and the studios\u2019 summer blockbusters to launch unaffected. Last week, Sag-Aftra leaders described how far along they were in talks with the companies when contract talks broke off. \u201cWe moved on some things, but from day one they wouldn\u2019t meaningfully engage on the most critical issues,\u201d they said. The studios, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), blamed Sag-Aftra for walking away first. But already many non-union workers in the creative fields, from set designers to stylists and hair and makeup artists, are feeling the effects of the production shutdown. Now Sag-Aftra has published guidelines for how social influencers, which it does not represent, should operate during the strike, including avoiding the promotion of studio projects. \u201cAny non-member seeking future membership in Sag-Aftra who performs covered work or services for a struck company during the strike will not be admitted into membership in Sag-Aftra,\u201d the guild said in an FAQ. For trades that typically work alongside actors and writers, the situation is also complex. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to do non-union and commercials, but everyone is so worried,\u201d says the New York hairstylist Alesha Oak, who had been working on a Ryan Murphy production until the strike. \u201cI\u2019m a single mum, so not working is not ideal. If we don\u2019t work, we don\u2019t contribute to health insurance, so a lot of people may lose their coverage.\u201d Ryan Brinkley, 45, a craftsman who had been building sets for a Netflix series until it was shut down on 9 June after the writers\u2019 strike kicked off, says he was initially unsure about the strikers\u2019 demands. \u201cAt first I thought there were too many writers and they want too much. Would they put down their pens and come out on the picket lines with us, the labour unions? But they haven\u2019t got a new contract in 40 or 60 years. They need royalties to survive between jobs. So I\u2019m supportive, but it still hurts a lot of the below-the-line people.\u201d The crunch, at least in terms of marketing, may come later in the summer. Last week, the Venice film festival director, Alberto Barbera, said the festival, which opens at the end of August, is working on a \u201cpan-European festival\u201d regardless of US film participation. \u201cWe are taking action to create an alternative programme,\u201d he reportedly told staff. The Toronto film festival, which takes place in September, is in wait-and-see mode as to whether it will be a season without movie stars. \u201cWe will continue planning for this year\u2019s festival with the hope of a swift resolution in the coming weeks,\u201d festival organisers told Deadline. In some ways, the effects of the strike on film production and marketing are akin to those of the pandemic \u2013 a paralysing mixture of shutdowns and workarounds accompanied by fears that a misstep could be a career-ender. \u201cYou need the glamour of an opening, so everyone is paralysed by this,\u201d says Borkowski. \u201cThe bottom line is whether people can market a film without the big opening and the stars turning out to create their moment.\u201d The Screen Actors Guild has granted approval to 39 independent productions to shoot during the strike. The list, according to Variety, includes Mother Mary, starring Anne Hathaway and Michaela Coel; Death of a Unicorn, starring Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega; The Rivals of Amziah King, starring Matthew McConaughey, and Flight Risk, starring Mark Wahlberg and directed by Mel Gibson. For some stars, the strikes may not immediately affect their income. The annual revenue of the global film industry as of 2022 was $77bn, or less than a quarter of the $270bn global luxury goods market. For many actors, a movie is a step to a beauty contract or ambassadorship from one of the French or Italian luxury houses. And under strike rules, actors appearing on network shows like soap operas, variety shows, talk shows, reality shows and gameshows are permitted to work. Crucially, Sag actors are still allowed to model or do commercials for fashion, beauty and lifestyle companies. For red-carpet stylists, and an actor\u2019s travelling team of hair and makeup artists on a press tour, the effects of the strike could be severe. \u201cThere\u2019s is a kind of love story between fashion and cinema,\u201d says the Italian Vogue stylist Rushka Bergman. \u201cAn actor cannot go on the red carpet without a stylist and a team, and if you do not have a red carpet because the actors are in the union, the stylists, makeup artists and hair have lost a job. But an actor can still work in the fashion industry as a model.\u201d A London-based fashion stylist said the strike would probably make it easier to book actors for shoots. According to an item published in Popbitch on Friday, GQ\u2019s annual GQ Heroes event at Soho Farmhouse, a semi-rural branch of the London members\u2019 club Soho House, was missing its anticipated stars Bryan Cranston, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Coolidge, who, the outlet said, had been \u201call lined up to give the whole affair a bit of A-list sparkle, at \u00a33,000 a ticket\u201d. There are signs that the Hollywood-focused movie industry is changing, as the music industry has, into an adjunct of the deep-pocketed luxury industry. The Kering-owned fashion house Saint Laurent recently launched an entire production studio and signed up the film-makers Pedro Almod\u00f3var and David Cronenberg for projects. Kering is also reported to be talks to buy CAA, the Hollywood talent agency, for $7bn. The deal, which is said to be at an advanced stage, would give the luxury conglomerate direct access to the movie and music stars paid to populate the front rows of runway shows. If that sounds like Hollywood studios are being challenged for deal-making, it\u2019s only because Hollywood and luxury fashion brands need stars more than the stars need them, at least in some cases. \u201cIt\u2019s about the brand, what you stand for, and how you use your channels accordingly,\u201d says Borkowski. \u201cSome of these channels, like Instagram, are so powerful that some people have more people following than the companies that need them on their red carpet or magazine cover.\u201d Attending fashion events could be an easy way for an actor to stay in the spotlight while the red carpet and talkshows are off-limits. But self-promotion while the rest of their industry is out of work comes with dangers, says one New York fashion agent. \u201cLuxury brands are focused on celebrities, so you\u2019ll still see them. But actors are loyal to their community, so for an actor to go out there now and front something for x amount of money would be tone-deaf. It\u2019s not going to do much for their profile or credibility.\u201d Borkowski says decisions on luxury brand work will be based on what else actors are doing in terms of image, how they manage their brand business opportunities, and who they support or are sponsored by. He says it is hard to get stars to participate on the red carpet anyway, especially in Europe, with its smaller, individual markets, where images do not require constant polish. \u201cThis strike may make people actually think: what is the point of red carpet? It may not be as necessary as people think.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/liane-lippert-wins-stage-two-of-tour-de-france-femmes-after-rainswept-drama", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Liane Lippert wins stage two of Tour de France Femmes after rainswept drama", "lead": "Movistar Team\u2019s Liane Lippert won stage two of the Tour de France Femmes in Mauriac as Lotte Kopecky of SD Worx kept the overall race lead", "author": "Jeremy Whittle in Mauriac", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:58:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678705", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1a091da649f84d68369e33fe2031b7bc0c7038c9/0_113_4048_2430/500.jpg", "body": "The game of cat and mouse between the two strongest teams in women\u2019s racing gathered pace in the Tour de France Femmes as the race leader, Lotte Kopecky, of Team SD Worx, was outsprinted in Mauriac by the German rider Liane Lippert, of Movistar.

It was only after the finish line that she realised she had a slow puncture. \u201cI took the last corner behind Demi and thought something was wrong,\u201d Kopecky said. \u201cDemi started the lead\u2011out and I kept sprinting to the line. But it was a very strong finish from Liane Lippert. She deserved the win.\u201d Behind the leaders, a battered peloton was counting the cost of multiple crashes in the closing kilometres. \u201cI\u2019m happy we finished safe,\u201d Vollering, who finished second to Van Vleuten in the 2022 Tour de France Femmes, said. \u201cWe saw Eva van Agt crash and it was chaos. It was very slippery. I saw a couple of riders off the road, on the ground, in the last descent. \u201cIt was pretty scary at that point. I was really careful. I\u2019d rather lose a few seconds than crash. I did the sprint for Lotte, but she only noticed afterwards that she had a flat tyre. If I\u2019d known that before, I would have done my own sprint to try and take the stage win myself.\u201d On the final climb, the C\u00f4te de Trebiac, first Katarzyna Niewiadoma, of Canyon-SRAM, and then Juliette Labous, of Team DSM-Firmenich, tested their rivals. The final move, from Marlen Reusser of Team SD Worx, was chased down by Elisa Longo Borghini, riding for Lidl-Trek, setting up a sprint finish. Vollering, tracked throughout by Van Vleuten, preferred to keep her powder dry. \u201cMaybe I would have won 10 seconds,\u201d she said of her decision not to attack, \u201cbut I\u2019d prefer to save my legs for Wednesday and Saturday.\u201d The rivalry between the two Dutch riders is intense. They are expected to shadow each other closely as the race develops, before a first showdown on Wednesday in the fourth stage from Cahors to Rodez, which includes five categorised climbs, and a pivotal battle on Saturday\u2019s gruelling Pyrenean stage to the Col du Tourmalet. Cooler temperatures and steady drizzle characterised much of a stage which included six categorised ascents and a 6km climb to the finish. But the climbs of the Cantal also proved as disruptive as predicted, with multiple riders distanced in the 151.7km stage. A series of attacks were contained until the back-to-back hauls up the C\u00f4tes des Plaines and Boissieres, which split the peloton into small groups and also led to Van Vleuten crashing in a tangle of bikes, with Longo Borghini also briefly delayed. However, it was the long drop leading to the final climb that did the most damage, with Van Agt, riding for Jumbo-Visma, crashing into roadside barriers on the fast descent. She was treated for concussion by medical staff but has abandoned the race."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/24/share-your-best-discoveries-in-france-you-could-win-a-holiday-voucher", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share your best discoveries in France \u2013 you could win a holiday voucher", "lead": "An endless bounty of riches awaits travellers in France.

David Harmes, 27, had only just been released from prison for grooming children online when he began offending again. His latest offences involved 39 victims in the UK and six in the US between July 2019 and February 2020. He was remanded in custody at Chester crown court on Monday following his guilty pleas and will be sentenced on 5 September. Harmes targeted children aged six to 15, all of whom except one were female. He would use a number of identities to lure his victims, including a model scout called Jess, who he claimed worked for major clothing outlets; and a boy called Alex or Jaden. After spotting a potential victim on YouTube or Instagram, he would then make contact. Cheshire police said his \u201cdeceit and manipulation was to fuel his twisted obsession\u201d. In May 2016, Harmes was sentenced to eight years in jail for child sex offences, but was released early on licence in February 2019, Cheshire police said. A year later he was recalled to prison for breaching his licence after detectives learned he had started offending again within months of his release. On 18 May 2023, while still in prison at HMP Risley, Harmes was served with a summons to appear in court to face the charges. These included possessing, making and distributing indecent images, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, sexual communication with a child and engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child. DS Simon Draco said: \u201cThis has been a complex and meticulous investigation with international-based victims that has resulted in the conviction of Harmes and will bring justice for the victims of his offending.\u201d Detectives pieced together his offending and identified him by his distinctive bedding in the images they found on his devices, as well as footage of him accidentally opening his laptop and filming his face for a few seconds. DS Mark Naylor, an investigating officer from the force\u2019s major crime directorate said: \u201cHaving received intelligence that Harmes was offending, his laptops, phones and other digital devices were seized in a warrant at his address, and Harmes was returned to prison for breaching his sex offender notification order on 8 February 2020 preventing him from committing further crimes.\u201d Draco added: \u201cCheshire constabulary has an investigation team dedicated to targeting those who sexually abuse and offend against children online and teams across the force work with partners to educate children, parents and carers about online predators, to safeguard children from potential harm. \u201cWe\u2019re really keen to drum home the message that parents and carers need to know what their children are doing online in order to protect them from predators like Harmes. \u201cWe all know that we need to teach children not to speak to strangers in the street, but we need to drive home that very same message for the online world too, to prevent people like Harmes taking advantage.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/football-daily-kylian-mbappe-al-hilal-psg", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football Daily | Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 gets caught between Scrooge McDuck money pits", "lead": "<strong>In today\u2019s Football Daily: </strong>A year-long sabbatical in Riyadh, big hitters impress at the World Cup, and RIP Trevor Francis", "author": "Barry Glendenning", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:48:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678762", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ef6da040497b3d544c4bebaff36b2c2c1f732a58/0_74_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "KYLIAN, IT WAS REALLY NOTHING Currently on a money-making summer jolly in Japan where they have pre-season kickabouts lined up with Al-Nassr, Cerezo Osaka and Inter, Paris Saint-Germain are hawking tickets for an open training session for just shy of \u00a320 apiece. All comers are welcome, as long as they pony up a score. Any wheelchair users wishing to attend can do so too, as long as they have the requisite ticket \u2026 which costs the exact same amount. While the previous business dealings of this state-owned Qatari clown show suggest it has apparently bottomless reserves of wealth, the brass neck of them charging anyone, let alone disabled fans, to watch their players jog half-heartedly around a pitch, stage a game of head-tennis and a few rondos before trooping back to the dressing-room, conveys the impression their Scrooge McDuck money pit might not be as overflowing with gold coins as we have been led to believe. But in the extremely unlikely event they have fallen on hard times, it would go a long way towards explaining why they are so desperate to sell Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to somebody \u2013 anybody! \u2013 before he does one from the French capital next summer to join Real Madrid on a free. Of course, anyone who pays to watch PSG training won\u2019t actually get to see said player tut-tutting his teammates for any misplaced passes. Mbapp\u00e9 has been left at home by members of a club hierarchy fed up with his steadfast refusal to activate a one-year contract extension that would enable them to kick this particular can of worms down the road for another 12 months. Imagine their unbridled delight, then, upon hearing that Al-Hilal, one of four Saudi clubs in which the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, PIF, recently acquired a 75% stake, have submitted a world-record bid for Mbapp\u00e9 believed to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3259m) and are willing take him for just one season, if that is what it takes to complete the deal marked \u201cFootball Eats Itself\u201d. To nobody\u2019s great surprise, PSG are ready to snap Al-Hilal\u2019s arm off at the shoulder for such a preposterous sum, except there\u2019s one small snag. The Saudi club have not yet held talks with their target and have no idea if Mbapp\u00e9 has any interest in debasing himself by playing in what has become the world\u2019s most high profile Sunday league, give or take a few big-name ringers. As well as Real Madrid and Al-Hilal, Mbapp\u00e9 is also believed to have admirers at Barcelona, Inter, Chelsea, Manchester United and \u2013 no tittering at the back, please \u2013 Tottenham Hotspur. He wouldn\u2019t be human if he didn\u2019t at least consider the Saudi\u2019s club\u2019s mega-money offer for a season-long sabbatical in Riyadh playing alongside R\u00faben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly and Aleksandar Mitrovic. TREVOR FRANCIS (1954-2023) The former England forward Trevor Francis, Britain\u2019s first \u00a31m player and the scorer of a European Cup-winning goal for Nottingham Forest, has died at the age of 69. We probably don\u2019t need to tell you that Francis was a beautifully balanced player who had a distinguished career that started with his Birmingham City debut at 16 \u2013 where he scored 133 goals in 280 appearances \u2013 and included spells with Forest, Manchester City, Sampdoria, Atalanta and Rangers before he went into management, initially as a player-manager. Francis played 52 times for England from 1977 to 1986, featuring at the 1982 World Cup, where he scored twice. Gary Lineker, a former England teammate, tweeted: \u201cDeeply saddened to hear that Trevor Francis has died. A wonderful footballer and lovely man. Was a pleasure to work alongside him both on the pitch and on the telly.

With the aid of water-dropping planes, authorities worked around the clock to tame numerous fires. While the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said it was clear the country was \u201cat war with fire\u201d, efforts were being concentrated on dousing blazes raging on the islands of Evia and Corfu, in addition to Rhodes. \u201cThis battle is uneven, and it will keep being like that for as long as the conditions remain hard,\u201d the centre-right leader told the Greek parliament. Warning that \u201cthree difficult days\u201d lay ahead with the prediction that temperatures would rise, he added: \u201cWe find ourselves at war with fire.\u201d As wind-whipped infernos raged across soil parched by searing heat, authorities also stepped up evacuations, ordering people to leave hotels and homes. Overnight, an estimated 2,466 citizens had fled dwellings in 17 villages along Corfu\u2019s northern coast, an area popular with villa-owning Britons, while hundreds had been forced to evacuate communities on Evia. The latest evacuations came days after incoming infernos around resort areas in the south-east of Rhodes forced what officials described as the biggest evacuation in Greek history, which saw 19,000 people \u2013 mostly tourists \u2013 moved to the island\u2019s north across land and sea. Holidaymakers recounted panic-stricken moments of being transported at the weekend in the middle of the night in army trucks to beaches before being placed on Greek navy ships. A common refrain was the shoddy treatment received at the hands of \u201cinvisible\u201d tour operators to whom they had paid thousands of pounds to stay in five-star hotels on the island. Many voiced shock that other British tourists had been flown into the island by travel companies as late as Saturday night when it was clear the fires were raging uncontrollably across a large swath of the island. Greece experienced the hottest temperatures in 50 years at the weekend, with the mercury reaching 45C in the central region of Thessaly. The hot, dry, windy conditions have been likened to \u201csuper food\u201d for fires. In the face of strong and erratic winds fanning flames, civil protection officials in Athens said they had been left with little choice other than to enact what they called a \u201cprecautionary\u201d operation to move tourists out of harm\u2019s way on Rhodes. \u201cOur priority will always be human life,\u201d Mitsotakis told MPs on Monday, invoking memories of the tragedy of the fires that tore through the seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, almost five years ago, incinerating 102 people in their homes and cars. \u201c[Since Mati,] we have learned to organise evacuations,\u201d he said. Government experts are scheduled to fly into Rhodes and other fire-hit regions in the coming days to assess the scale of the disaster \u2013 expected to be hugely costly \u2013 so that the process of compensatory payments can begin. Countless homes, businesses and plots of arable land are believed to have been lost to the flames. But for now the emphasis has been on salvaging the image of Greece as a tourist destination in the face of such disaster. Most of those evacuated from hotels in Rhodes had arrived from the UK \u2013 a market so buoyant, British tourists now account for the largest number of visitors to Greece. Given the sector\u2019s significance \u2013 tourism provides 25% of the country\u2019s GDP and one in five jobs \u2013 the country\u2019s tourism minister, Olga Kefalogianni, was at pains on Monday to insist that although fires had broken out on Corfu, the situation was not \u201calarming\u201d, while in Rhodes \u201conly a small part of the island\u201d had been affected. In what by late Sunday had become a large-scale military operation, Greek army transport planes worked through the night to transfer camp beds, sleeping bags and other vital supplies to Rhodes. Throughout the weekend, thousands had been forced to sleep rough, either at the island\u2019s airport or in other makeshift shelters including schools and conferences halls. \u201cThe hope is that what is being brought in will make life a little bit more comfortable for them before they go back home,\u201d one official said. Tourists stranded on Rhodes spoke of the kindness and generosity of locals, many of whom had offered to host evacuated families in their homes. By 6am on Monday, 1,489 tourists from the UK, Germany and Italy had been repatriated, Greek government sources said, adding that the departures had eased the chaotic scenes at the island\u2019s airport. The tour company Jet2 announced that it had scheduled an extra four flights for Monday evening to take Britons home. Firefighting forces from around the world have arrived in Greece to assist in the battle to bring the fires under control."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/we-share-blood-the-us-born-players-leading-the-philippines-world-cup-charge", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018We share blood\u2019: The US-born players leading the Philippines\u2019 World Cup charge", "lead": "Eighteen of the 23-woman Philippines squad in New Zealand were born in America.

Annis was coaching in the United States and she was at a professional combine helping out a friend she had met while playing in Iceland. One of the coaches at the event was Bruno Baltazar, who at the time was an assistant coach for the Philippines men\u2019s team. Baltazar suspected that Annis might be Filipino-American, she recalls, and after confirming as much he asked a simple question: \u201cDid you know that the Philippines has a women\u2019s team?\u201d No, Annis did not. She grew up in Zanesville, Ohio, a small city about 50 miles east of Columbus. There, she could count the number of Filipinos-Americans on her two hands, the family doctor among them. A Philippines women\u2019s soccer team? That was a world away. Annis now finds herself at the 2023 World Cup, the Philippines\u2019 first. The 34-year-old has frequently captained her team, one predominantly composed of players with Filipino roots who grew up in the United States. Teams making their debuts compose one-third of the expanded, 32-strong field at this tournament, a tangible sign of the growth of women\u2019s soccer. But the Philippines aren\u2019t just here to make up the numbers, Annis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to forget or overlook the fact that it is an historic moment for the country and the national team,\u201d she told the Guardian prior to the tournament. \u201cWhat an accomplishment that is. But also, we don\u2019t just want to participate. The coaching staff has made that a point since we qualified. It is an amazing accomplishment and something to relish, but it doesn\u2019t do us any justice just to show up and play. If we want to continue to grow the sport in the Philippines and bring more awareness, people want to watch us do well and compete.\u201d The Philippines players want to inspire their nation of roughly 117 million, and leave a legacy that propels women\u2019s soccer forward in the country. They are also fighting that battle largely from afar. Eighteen of the team\u2019s 23 World Cup players were born in the United States. Annis\u2019s story is like that of many of her teammates. After that fateful conversation in 2014, she went in search of information and opportunity. With little of the former, she left her temporary homebase in Connecticut, where she was coaching as her playing career hit roadblocks, and flew to California for an identification camp, where she met other Filipino-Americans. \u201cWe made the best out of it that we could,\u201d Annis said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting a whole lot because we didn\u2019t know what it was going to be like, and we didn\u2019t generally have a whole lot of background or information. We were going in hopeful and trying to keep an open mind, and here we are.\u201d Things went well for Annis on the field, but away from it matters were a little tougher. Repeated attempts to gain a Philippines passport in the US failed, with little explanation why, and she paused her dream for several years. Eventually, however, Annis realized she would need to go to the Philippines to obtain her birth certificate. Her first visit to the country was in 2018, as the team prepared for the Asian Cup, which doubled as World Cup qualification. This time, there was strength in numbers. The identification camps in California continued and there were more players in the same position as Annis by 2018. Each day until they found a resolution, that small group would go to training in Manila, then sit around together at the immigration office trying to plough through the necessary paperwork to obtain their passports. The Philippines missed the 2019 World Cup, but there was hope. They saw that they could compete. They needed regular training camps and committed coaching. They needed to increase the level of play. Camps in California continue to this day, with a particular focus on building up the country\u2019s youth teams. There is a sizeable population of Filipinos in various pockets of California, but the turnout comes from all parts of the US as word gets out through coaching networks and players come of age. \u201cThe World Cup is here and the whole idea of making the World Cup, we\u2019re trying to leave a legacy and trying to plan the future,\u201d said Philippines assistant Nahuel Arrarte, who helped run the most recent camps alongside the head coach, Alen Stajcic. \u201cHence, we\u2019re trying to create an alignment within the federation and the national teams, and it\u2019s all part of looking down the track and having a bit of a vision at what the national team space can look like in the next four, five years.\u201d Staff set up camp in greater Los Angeles earlier this year in addition to three others that evaluated a total of 400 young players, Arrarte said. Among the players identified in LA there was Isabella Pasion, who has just turned 17. The Texas-based midfielder has already made an impact with the U-20 team. She missed the final roster for the World Cup but stayed in New Zealand to train and get exposed to the environment, a decision the staff hope pays dividends in the future. Annis recalls an early conversation with Stajcic, who used to coach Australia, and his staff when they took over the job. They asked a few core players at the time what was needed to make the team more successful. \u201cWe need someone to stay,\u201d Annis told them. Coaching turnover had been frequent, making it impossible to build momentum. \u201cWe have players, we have the talent, we have the commitment of these girls, but no one has committed to us.\u201d Family values are intrinsic to Filipino culture. Tita and tito \u2013 aunt and uncle \u2013 are terms used loosely for good friends. Annis remembers from a young age having to ask her parents who was actually a relative at parties, because everyone got the same designation. Annis\u2019s mother \u2013 who came to the US four decades ago at age 14 \u2013 has family in Cleveland. As a child, Annis loved the short trip north to see them and immerse herself with Filipinos in a way she could not in her hometown. Now, the players see the welcoming aspects of Filipino culture on the road. In late 2022, they traveled to Chile for a pair of games as part of World Cup preparations. There, they found a welcoming group of Filipinos \u2013 as they do everywhere \u2013 who brought them treats like mangoes and turon, a deep-fried sweet treat. After learning players needed massages after their first match, thePhilippines fan who delivered the snacks said she knew just the people. The next day, Filipina masseuses showed up at the hotel. A sizeable Filipino community in New Zealand is also expected to turn up to support the team. It is that sense of connection that drives a team largely pulled together from outside the Philippines. Players do not hide from the obvious fact that most of the team was born in the United States. Among the connections to the US is defender Reina Bonta, whose father is the attorney general of California and whose mom is a California assemblywoman. A 2-0 loss to Switzerland in the the Philippines\u2019 World Cup debut was a difficult start but one with signs of encouragement. The Philippines are set up to defend well and frustrate opponents, before counter-attacking. Their draw into Group A was seen as a fortunate one, too. Norway and Switzerland are the least intimidating of the 12 European sides, and co-hosts New Zealand, who the Philippines face on Tuesday in Wellington, are by far the weakest of the eight seeded teams that headline each group. \u201cI feel like right from the start and always, any camp, anything we\u2019ve been through, we\u2019re a very tightknit group and it\u2019s very much like family,\u201d Annis said. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of an underlying knowing that everyone has. It really didn\u2019t matter how long anyone\u2019s been on the team, or if we grew up in the States or Manila; we have some girls that grew up in Canada and Norway. We\u2019re everywhere. Then, when we\u2019re together, it\u2019s not about where we grew up or where we live. Everyone knows we share the same blood and we\u2019re family. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you grew up in Manila or your family is in the States \u2026 That common goal is that we are playing for the country and for all the football players in the Philippines.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/britain-housing-crisis-towns-cities-countryside", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The answer to Britain\u2019s housing crisis lies in its towns and cities \u2013 not the countryside | Simon Jenkins", "lead": "The Conservatives are right about making urban areas denser, but their proposed planning reform is an undemocratic mess, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins", "author": "Simon Jenkins", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:30:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678821", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/66c5d9e18fad7d61e94c5571234833f738ed37bd/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Yes, Britain\u2019s housing market is in a mess. No, that does not mean 75 years of town planning should be torn up just to win the Tories a few more seats. Today\u2019s speeches on housebuilding by the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, and his boss, Rishi Sunak, are in part sensible, in part not. They are right that there is no \u201cneed\u201d for extensive new building over Britain\u2019s countryside. Just because party-donor developers prefer lucrative rural sites, this does not constitute a necessity. A green urban policy is now concentrated \u2013 as Sunak and Gove accept \u2013 on densifying existing built-up areas and infrastructure, not least in Britain\u2019s extensive suburban sprawl. Density is why the American urbanologist Edward Glaeser, in his 2011 book Triumph of the City, celebrated the unexpected green credentials of Manhattan. No one who travels through England\u2019s Midlands and north can have any doubt. There are miles of brownfield land, idle factories, warehouses and even streets of derelict houses, emptied by decades of economic policies that have tilted wealth towards the south-east. At the same time every tenet of ecological conservation preaches more green zones, nature corridors and open countryside. Meanwhile the debate on housing is obsessed with new building, its lobbyists shouting \u201ccrisis\u201d through every debate. New houses, especially on new sites, are inevitably expensive to build and service and are almost all for the well-off. They make a marginal impact on overall supply. The issue is demand and that is a function of price, which is currently falling well behind inflation. Indeed home ownership is a cultural rather than a welfare issue. Some of the richest European nations, such as Germany, Switzerland and Denmark, have the lowest percentage of homeowners. The highest percentage is in poorer nations, such as Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. The easiest way to increase housing supply is not through some national target. It is to encourage renting and thus use more efficiently the millions of houses that lie underoccupied (676,452 in England alone), unextended, unimproved and unlet, all through the poor regulation of Britain\u2019s housing market. These are the houses most likely to be lived in by poor people, and those at risk of homelessness, who should be the state\u2019s prime concern. These people need housing benefit and somewhere to rent, not a place in a queue for that rare bonanza, a new council house for life. \u201cThe existing stock of housing in England is not used particularly efficiently\u201d, a House of Lords report concluded in 2016, with disappointing figures for underoccupied homes. The government should study how the rest of Europe regulates its housing \u2013 notably Germany \u2013 and learn. Hence what was sadly absent from today\u2019s speeches was some indication of learning. There was no mention of higher but fairer property taxes, no mention of an end to stamp duty, which is a tax on downsizing. Nor was there any mention of removing VAT on conversions and improvements, effectively a 20% tax on the fastest route to new homes. As for planning reform, Sunak reasonably wants to ease controls on change of use. But who should decide this, central government or local communities? The David Cameron government\u2019s easing of such controls costs high streets dear. In the first quarter of this year, England and Wales lost 51 pubs every month, not because people have stopped drinking but often so developers can snap up key sites. Austerity has slashed numbers of planning staff, delaying decisions and destroying morale. Gove\u2019s cure for this is to send in \u201csuper-squads\u201d of his own planners to handle critical sites. For instance he wants to turn the booming city of Cambridge into a megacity. As levelling up secretary he should be boosting Manchester, already a regional science magnet and the only northern metropolis strong enough to rival London. Cambridge can look after itself. Sunak and Gove repeat the cliche that planning should be about \u201ccommunity support\u201d, but support is not the issue. The issue is control. It may not look much in a manifesto, but the character and fate of how and where we live is not for central politicians to decide. It is the very essence of local democracy.

When this tradition was abandoned, reporters and correspondents graduated to the anchor desk in the hope that those who came to the studio from the field would bring authority and knowledge to the coverage. George Alagiah, who has died aged 67, was the exemplar of someone who had seen first-hand events that they latterly recited from an Autocue. His two decades of news reading \u2013 across BBC One\u2019s 1pm, 10pm and 6pm slots, before making the teatime show his own since 2003 \u2013 were informed by having reported on Rwandan genocide, civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the democratisation of South Africa, the 9/11 attacks on the US and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. As the practice developed of the home-based host doing live \u201ctwo-ways\u201d with colleagues on the frontline, Alagiah was unusually able to conduct these conversations on equal terms. In addition to the broader perspective brought by his reporting, he also had a totally different background from many of his BBC colleagues. Born in Sri Lanka in 1955, he moved with his family to Ghana, aged six, and ultimately to England, where he attended school in Portsmouth and university at Durham. His three formative cultures were explored in two thoughtful memoirs: A Home From Home: Immigrant Boy to English Man (2006) and A Passage to Africa (2001). After starting in regional print journalism, when he joined the BBC Alagiah was always going to end up in television rather than on radio. Handsome and athletic, he was a rare example of a British newscaster who could have transferred to an American network without lengthy cosmetic and dental work. Looking as if he had stepped out of a drama series\u2019s casting process for a trusted newsreader, he appeared as one in the drama Silent Witness and the foreign correspondent comedy Taking the Flak. No one gets far in broadcasting without ego and ambition, but Alagiah was better at disguising them than most and was always a pleasant, even gentle, presence on screen. Although he worked for the BBC during a period when even one of its director generals, Greg Dyke, described the organisation as \u201chideously white\u201d, and no one of his generation could escape some racism, Alagiah was grateful not to be required to be a role model and pioneer in the way demanded of some politicians and sports performers. He was not the first person of colour to become one of the most recognisable faces in TV news. Sir Trevor McDonald was, for a long time, ITN\u2019s leading newsman and, even among the previous actor-announcer generation, Moira Stuart was a star personality. Alagiah, though, was the first BBC journalist of colour to equal the fame and popularity of McDonald. Having scrupulously followed the news rules of keeping himself out of the story, he made, across the last nine years of his life, a courageous and important exception. Diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2014, Alagiah reported on his progress through revolutionary life-extending treatments, remissions and recurrences \u2013 in articles, podcasts and interviews with BBC News colleagues. His illness having been discovered when he was 58 \u2013 and therefore too young for an NHS England screening scheme that starts at 60 \u2013 he campaigned to introduce the tests earlier. In addition to the journalistic expertise from his foreign reporting, he also brought to his work intellectual and cultural depth. He was a long-serving governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company, giving the theatre the rare benefit, when staging Shakespeare\u2019s many stories of war or political revolution, of a board member who had seen such things for real. During one of his absences from screen for cancer treatment, Alagiah wrote The Burning Land, a thriller set in South Africa, which, in common with all his work, was elegant, clever, informed and engaging. Alagiah, being the sort of man he was, would have felt uneasy about becoming a headline himself. But such was his illustrious contribution to news, both in the field and studio, that he fully deserves such coverage, and colleagues will be determined to tell his story as vividly and memorably as he told others."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604de9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/donald-trump-2024-election-final-battle", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Trump is gearing up for his \u2018final battle\u2019.

Recall the first rally of his 2024 election campaign on 25 March in Waco, Texas \u2013 exactly 30 years after a deadly siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians resulted in the deaths of more than 80 members of that religious cult and four federal agents. He opened with a choir of men imprisoned for their role in the January 6 insurrection singing \u201cJustice for All\u201d, intercut with the national anthem and with Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance with his hand on his heart. Behind, on big screens, was footage from the Capitol riot. Trump then repeated his bogus claim that the 2020 presidential election was \u201crigged\u201d. He praised the rioters of January 6. He raged against the prosecutors overseeing multiple investigations into his conduct as \u201cabsolute human scum\u201d. He told the crowd that \u201cthe thugs and criminals who are corrupting our justice system will be defeated, discredited and totally disgraced.\u201d He then declared: \u201cOur enemies are desperate to stop us and our opponents have done everything they can to crush our spirit and to break our will. But they failed. They\u2019ve only made us stronger. And 2024 is the final battle, it\u2019s going to be the big one. You put me back in the White House, their reign will be over and America will be a free nation once again.\u201d Since then, as indictments have piled up against him and his poll numbers among Republicans have risen, Trump\u2019s \u201cfinal battle\u201d comes into ever sharper focus: it is a battle against the rule of law and democracy. The mega indictment we have all been waiting for \u2013 the indictment against Trump for his attempted coup against the United States \u2013 will be announced very soon. Trump is prepared to use it in his final battle. Tuesday, on an Iowa radio show, he warned it would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d if Special Counsel Jack Smith put him in jail, since his supporters have \u201cmuch more passion than they had in 2020\u201d. Unfortunately for the nation, the Republican party is uniting behind Trump\u2019s side of this battle line. If not defending the January 6 rioters outright, Republican lawmakers are attacking Special Counsel Jack Smith, the justice department, the Manhattan district attorney, and other current and prospective prosecutors seeking to hold Trump accountable. A Trump indictment for attempting the overthrow of the constitutional order and the verdict of the electorate will guarantee that 2024 will be more of a referendum on Trump than a referendum on Biden, as was the 2020 election. It will make it harder for Republican candidates across the nation to focus on their fake nemeses \u2013 \u201cwoke\u201d teachers and corporations, trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants and \u201csocialism\u201d \u2013 and force them instead to defend Trump\u2019s side in the final battle. Trump and the Republicans will lose this battle. Even if they win Republican primaries, they will lose the general election. Recall that last November, virtually every 2020-election-denying Republican who sought office in a truly contested election went down to defeat. Those who care about democracy and the rule of law should welcome the battle, and not just because it will help Biden and the Democrats. It will also help clarify what\u2019s at stake for the nation in 2024 and beyond. It will show how eager Trump and the Republican party are to abandon democracy and the rule of law in order to gain power. It will show that the vast majority of Americans reject their position. Americans hold different views about many things, but most of us oppose authoritarianism. We reject fascism. We value the constitution and the Bill of Rights. We are committed to democracy, even with its many flaws. We support the rule of law. We want to live in a nation where no one is above the law. We want to be able to sleep at night without worrying that a president might unleash armed lackeys to drag us out of our homes because he considers us to be his enemy. The pustule of Trump has been growing since 2016, and the authoritarian impulses underlying this infection have been allowed to fester for decades. Folks, it is finally time to lance this boil. It is time to decidedly rescue democracy and the rule of law. It is time to defeat Trump and his enablers who are determined to defy the core values of America. Let the battle begin.

The way I\u2019ve sometimes depicted this is through Barbie dolls engaged in murder, cannibalism and torture. So I\u2019ve long been sceptical of the overall concept of Barbie as an image of achievable womanhood. But I had no expectations when it came to the movie. My first impression was that it was very elegantly done \u2013 and I was intrigued by the idea that, by the end, not even Barbie wants to be Barbie. I appreciated the way the film gently caricatured Mattel and their iron-fist insistence on keeping Barbie in her box. That said, I felt the boardroom scenes could have been more depressingly realistic. In life, a platoon of men still tend to make decisions that affect women. The differentiation between Barbieland and the real world would have been heightened had the Mattel executives not just stepped in from an episode of Benny Hill. Perhaps Mattel did not want an actual villain in the movie. Yet there could have been a better foil to Barbie\u2019s optimistic naivete. Still, my partner \u2013 who happens to be called Ken \u2013 and I were often crying with laughter. Especially at the Kens\u2019 epic beach-battle dance-off. And we loved the bit about the Kens trying to explain the brilliance of The Godfather to the Barbies. My Ken did that on our first date too. There were moments when it was a bit heavy-handed. The endless use of the word \u201cpatriarchy\u201d started to get on my nerves even though it was used as a comic abstract \u2013 and I think the adult themes may affect its accessibility for younger children. But it\u2019s good if young girls and boys ask questions. Hopefully the adults who take them to see the film will be up for answering them \u2013 and for explaining you don\u2019t need to be in a couple to find fulfilment. You can be just Barbie, or just Ken, without the box or accessories. And that is more than enough. \u2022 Mariel Clayton\u2019s work can be seen at Psycho Barbies and The Alley of the Dolls \u2018Ken\u2019s sexuality is always questionable\u2019 David J Mansour, Barbie collector I\u2019ve been an avid Barbie collector for 36 years, so I was highly anticipating the film. Afterwards, I had to process it. I lay awake and asked myself: \u201cGod, did I like that? What did I just watch?\u201d But in the morning I thought: \u201cYou know, I really liked it!\u201d I\u2019m very pleased. I loved Margot Robbie; she gave that doll heart and soul. And I loved Barbieland: seeing the dolls come alive and recognising so many pop culture references. But when it got to the buffoonish Mattel executives I was like: \u201cThe film\u2019s losing me here.\u201d I didn\u2019t think they were funny and I couldn\u2019t wait for them to be off screen. I was born the same year Mattel started producing Ken dolls \u2013 1961 \u2013 so I feel I have a special connection. My mom bought me Kens for birthday and Christmas presents. When I first heard Ryan Gosling had been cast, I thought: \u201cHe\u2019s a little old.\u201d I like him, don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a great actor and really easy on the eye. But even though everyone is now raving about his performance, while I was watching the film I thought: \u2018I still don\u2019t know about him as Ken.\u2019 And I was surprised he was portrayed as so generic; just this week Mattel brought out a Ken with a prosthetic leg. But since I saw the film, Gosling has grown on me. Now, I can\u2019t imagine anyone else in the role. I think teenage girls and gay men will like the film. We get that humour. And Ken\u2019s sexuality is always questionable \u2026 But it\u2019s weird to have your niche interest suddenly explode globally. When I started, I didn\u2019t know any other male collectors \u2013 and hardly any female ones, unless I went to doll shows. Now, on Instagram, lots of young men have Barbie collections and they\u2019re just going crazy. It\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s odd because I feel like I\u2019m kind of on the outside looking in. And buying Barbies is different now. You used to get them in bricks-and-mortar stores. Now it\u2019s all online and very competitive. The dolls from the film are hard to find. When Mattel released them on their website, they sold out in about two hours. I can\u2019t get Pink Western Barbie unless I pay three times what she was sold for when she came out last month. Now she\u2019s $150 on eBay. I\u2019m just waiting. Once the movie is played and done, maybe I\u2019ll get her for what she\u2019s worth. \u2022 David Mansour is the author of the forthcoming book Behold the Valley of the Dolls: A Barbie History in Portraits \u2018People now give me their heart instead of laughing in my face\u2019 Rachel Evans, \u2018human Barbie\u2019 I think it\u2019s a work of genius. It\u2019ll go down as one of the best movies of all time. It\u2019s exceptional. I love everything about it. It\u2019s finally made me feel validated. Some people have said the creation of Barbie didn\u2019t help feminism. I think it did, but it\u2019s just feminism batting your eyelashes rather than burning your bra. The misconception was that you couldn\u2019t be a human Barbie, as I am, because she\u2019s a toy who\u2019s flat and plastic and not multifaceted. Yet Margot Robbie brought that character to life and showed how she could be human. In the past, I\u2019ve had to explain the history of Barbie and how I relate to her personality; that that\u2019s why I dress like her and why I\u2019ve spent 18 years changing my facial aesthetics. People used to ridicule me and give me dirty looks on the train. They\u2019d look at me and smirk. Now I don\u2019t need to justify myself, and I feel an abundance of pure love. The movie did that for me, and it\u2019s such a gift. People smile and approach me. Men say: \u201cHi Barbie!\u201d Young girls tell me my dress is beautiful. I was going up the escalator in a shopping centre and a woman looked at me in awe. I just smiled and waved and her face lit up. To connect with people\u2019s hearts has always been my dream, and people are now giving me their heart instead of laughing in my face. It\u2019s been overwhelming and profound. Other people now treat me with respect, too: press and producers as well as the public. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to mean I can give up the day job. I work in a Mayfair fashion boutique as well as being a real-life Barbie; I juggle both. I\u2019ve always had different careers, just like Barbie! I\u2019ve seen the film twice now and I cried both times. When I saw the film on Saturday, I was sobbing. I was like: \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t cry that hard because my makeup is gonna look wrecked.\u201d But it was just so beautiful. \u2018There was clearly a diversity checklist at work\u2019 Jian Yang, owner of 12,000 Barbies I thought the film would be bad, because Barbie has never really had a narrative. She\u2019s always been something on to which little girls could project personalities and dreams, accents and cultural beliefs. So for me, as someone who lives in Singapore, my Barbie would take off her shoes at the dream house. And she wouldn\u2019t sound American; she would sound like my aunt. I think the Barbie brand has always allowed this flexibility, so giving her an actual voice seemed risky. But I really enjoyed it! The most approachable bits especially: the dance-offs, the choreographed blowout party, the fashion. And I thought the mother/daughter relationship was well-drawn. My niece is nine; when they pull away from you \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t hug me anymore!\u201d \u2013 you feel that hurt in your soul. Greta Gerwig had done her research. She was cognisant of the collector audience. I loved seeing the discontinued dolls: pregnant Midge, Skipper with the growing boobs, gay Ken, sugar daddy Ken. I liked the preachiness less. Singapore has always been a multiracial society; it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most racially harmonious countries. So having to listen to how a foreign culture has to deal with segregation and acceptance \u2013 it was a bit much. There was clearly a diversity checklist at work. And I thought it was quite sexist that it made all the men really dumb. To empower one gender, I don\u2019t think you need to disempower the other. It was partly Ryan Gosling\u2019s fault the men came across as really stupid, because he chose to play him that way. They should have allowed the Kens to also be more diverse. In fact there are a range of sizes within Ken dolls, but that was not represented in the film. Except for Allen, they were all perfectly symmetrical six-pack bodybuilders who didn\u2019t know how to run their own kingdom. Mattel have basically created a two-hour ad, that reinforces all the branding they\u2019ve been attempting since 2000. And I think they\u2019ve done it well, because it is an ad everyone wants to see. Everyone is obsessed with the brand at the moment, and the most fashionable thing to wear is the Barbie logo. But in three weeks it will be last season\u2019s fashion. What worries me is that when everyone stops wearing it and I continue, will I just look like last season\u2019s news? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lead to sustained interest in the brand. It\u2019s momentary nostalgia, after which Barbie will still be just that thing in a box in your attic. \u2018We didn\u2019t get what was so funny\u2019 Seven-year-old Barbie fans Romy, Penny and Ivy [Tim Jonze writes:] Romy, Penny and Ivy are looking forward to the Barbie movie. Their fandom ranges in fervour: Penny says she has so many Barbies that she\u2019s lost count, whereas Ivy thinks she has one doll \u201cbut I\u2019ve lost all of its clothes\u201d. Romy is looking forward to hearing Aqua\u2019s Barbie Girl, which is alarming as I have no idea if it\u2019s even in the film. In fact, I\u2019m rather worried they\u2019re going to be disappointed: they\u2019re expecting a bright-pink, wholesome kid\u2019s film about Barbie\u2019s adventures in Barbieland, but my film editor warns me that it\u2019s actually a feminist satire in which Barbie is preoccupied by thoughts of death. Still, it\u2019s definitely pink. We sit down to watch. All three girls seem fascinated by Barbie\u2019s daily routine \u2013 the heart-shaped french toast and walking about on tiptoes \u2013 but as the film progresses they seem less engaged with the meta jokes about capitalism and patriarchy. There are signs of restlessness towards the end but nobody asks to leave, which is good as I\u2019m rather enjoying it. So girls, did you like that? All: \u201cYes!!!\u201d Really? Romy: \u201cI liked it when Ken and the boys were doing funny dances.\u201d Ivy: \u201cI liked the beginning when Barbie was getting dressed.\u201d Romy: \u201cI wish my feet were the same shape as Barbie\u2019s \u2026 then I\u2019d be tallest in the class.\u201d So you weren\u2019t \u2026 bored? All: \u201cNoooo!\u201d Romy: \u201cIt was fun the whole way through. Although, sometimes everyone was laughing and we didn\u2019t know why.\u201d Penny: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get what was so funny. Also they kept saying these words that I didn\u2019t even know \u2013 they were so weird!\u201d Romy: \u201cIt was tricky to understand them all.\u201d What did you think the film was about? Romy: \u201cJust be yourself.\u201d Penny: \u201cYeah, find yourself.\u201d Ivy: \u201cWear fluff!\u201d Wear fluff? That\u2019s the meaning of the Barbie movie? Ivy: \u201cWear fluff if you want to. But if you don\u2019t want to then don\u2019t wear it.\u201d Penny: \u201cYeah!\u201d Romy: \u201cDon\u2019t let people stop you from wearing what you want to wear.\u201d Were there any bits you didn\u2019t like? Penny: \u201cBarbie was always crying.\u201d Romy: \u201cYeah, why was she crying all the time?\u201d Penny: \u201cAlso Ken said \u2018dude\u2019 too much. It was all \u2018dude\u2019 and \u2018horses\u2019. How many stars would you give it? Penny: \u201cFive stars!\u201d Ivy: \u201cI was going to say five stars but it wasn\u2019t as good as Mamma Mia! or Grease so I\u2019ll give it three stars.\u201d Romy: \u201cFour stars. I knocked a star off because Barbie was always crying.\u201d \u2018Its gender politics are baffling\u2019 Laura Snapes, Guardian deputy music editor / Greta Gerwig stan There has been persistent criticism that Barbie is just an advert to get us to buy stuff. No shit: it\u2019s a film about a toy doll. Also, all blockbusters are adverts now. That said, I can\u2019t figure out what exactly I\u2019d be compelled to cop after seeing this odd, muddled film. Even Barbie quits being Barbie in it, swapping her idealised life for a more complex reality. Although I\u2019m not the demographic for Barbie merch, I am a paid-up Greta Gerwig fan (I wouldn\u2019t hand over \u00a319 to see many other films on opening night in central London), and I was surprised and disappointed by how incoherent the film was. The tonal mismatch was jarring: parts were extremely funny and frantic, which came to feel completely at odds with Barbie\u2019s baseless existential crisis, and the dreary mother-daughter storyline (which was, again, oddly bad, given Gerwig made her name as a director with a film about that dynamic). The detail and individual gags were brilliant but the overall narrative was so existential as to become meaningless. And the blurry boundary between Barbieland and the real world was neither underpinned by dream logic nor logic-logic. Its politics were also baffling. The diverse casting stood in uneasy contrast to the film\u2019s dogged heterosexuality (bar a little innuendo about the Kens and Allan) and the gender essentialism. The idea that Ken is \u201cjust beach\u201d is very funny, but I felt conflicted about the film\u2019s unproductive attitude of, basically, \u201clol, men\u201d. Even the idea of a man playing his guitar \u201cat\u201d a woman feels straight out of 2010s tumblr feminism. America Ferrera\u2019s Gone Girl-style speech was equally dated, and the idea that women can just talk their way out of patriarchy, as the Barbies do to overthrow the Kendom, made me want to slide off my seat. I might worry about what kids would take from it, if I thought kids would be able to sit through it at all. Even though I strongly disliked Barbies as a kid I was ready to love this. The strength of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling\u2019s performances kept me invested. But I didn\u2019t buy it."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604deb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/talking-horses-ascot-trains-king-george-racing-tips", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Talking Horses: Train strike may hit Ascot hopes of bringing crowds back", "lead": "With attendances stuck below pre-pandemic levels, it is hard luck that a potential classic King George falls this Saturday", "author": "Greg Wood", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:15:38", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678912", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/35a892b107ecb0b112ce38ed0465eb0b1d239ba6/0_205_4256_2554/500.jpg", "body": "\u201cPoor old Ascot\u201d is not a phrase that sees much daylight given the track\u2019s historic wealth and prestige, but it is undoubtedly a very tough break for the royal racecourse that what promises to be one of the best renewals of the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes this century will coincide with a 24-hour strike on the train line from Waterloo this weekend. The unique possibility of three Derby winners lining up for the race has been scuppered by Adayar\u2019s poor run in the Princess of Wales\u2019s Stakes this month, but Auguste Rodin and King Of Steel, respectively first and second in the Epsom Classic last month, are among 15 possible runners on Saturday along with last year\u2019s Derby winner, Desert Crown. Hukum, who beat Desert Crown in the Brigadier Gerard at Sandown in May, is also in the likely field. As are the hugely popular Pyledriver, winner last year, and Emily Upjohn, the Coronation Cup winner, who will be Frankie Dettori\u2019s last King George ride at his favourite track. The half-dozen horses with the most obvious chance on Saturday are all priced at single-figure odds, and while the ground may well play a part in determining the eventual favourite, soft ground should not be an issue for any of the main players. High class and highly competitive are not always two sides of the same coin, but the 2023 King George promises to score exceptionally on both counts, making it all the more frustrating that the trains will not be running. Ascot, like most of Britain\u2019s major racecourses, has been struggling to return to its pre-pandemic attendance figures over the last season and a half. The course welcomed just 18,462 racegoers to last year\u2019s King George, which it bills, entirely fairly, as the country\u2019s \u201cmost prestigious open-age flat race\u201d. That is a long way short of the 26,408 who turned up in 2019, and not even halfway towards the post-2000 record crowd of 38,410 who saw Galileo beat Fantastic Light in 2001. The 2001 race was, admittedly, an exceptional renewal, with an unbeaten dual Derby winner taking on older horses for the first time in his career, but a crowd of between 26,000 and 30,000 remained the norm up until the pandemic. With both Auguste Rodin and King Of Steel among the expected runners this weekend and Dettori aboard a fancied runner on the latest stage of his farewell tour, there would surely have been hopes of a return to 20,000-plus in the stands were it not for the near-impossibility of getting to Ascot on public transport. Newbury\u2019s experience under similar conditions two days ago, when nearly 19,000 racegoers turned up to see the Super Sprint (and Tom Jones), offers some cause for optimism. And with all due respect to last weekend\u2019s feature race, the King George is a good deal more likely to be 2023\u2019s \u201cI was there\u201d moment. When compared to the great renewals of two decades ago, however, it still seems inevitable that the roar as the bell rings and the field turns for home will be a long way short of the noise that such an exceptional field deserves. Joorabchian chases Group One goal A first prize of \u00a3708,000 means that the King George has a significant role to play in several of the sport\u2019s subplots, and a win for Aidan O\u2019Brien in particular could prove to be a turning point in the race for the trainers\u2019 championship. Not least as Charlie Appleby, the champion for the last two seasons, does not have a runner in Saturday\u2019s race. A win for King Of Steel, meanwhile, would be a huge moment for the purple and white colours of Kia Joorabchian\u2019s Amo Racing operation, which have become increasingly familiar over the past five seasons. Amo is already in the top 10 in the owners\u2019 table and could jump into the top three if King Of Steel \u2013 a 7-2 joint-favourite \u2013 comes home in front this weekend, giving Amo a first win at Group One level in the process. The early years of the King George were dominated by landed owner-breeders, who were largely swept away by sovereign wealth from Dubai and the burgeoning Coolmore operation in Ireland from the late 1970s. One can only imagine how arch-traditionalists might react to news that the owner giving Godolphin, Shadwell, Coolmore and the rest a real run for their money this season is a football agent."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dec", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/24/george-alagiah-obituary", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "George Alagiah obituary", "lead": "Highly respected newsreader, foreign correspondent and author who had a passionate belief in the importance of the BBC", "author": "Torin Douglas", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:02:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678932", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b1266a6d5e7a8adb2731542cd288557ceb1dcdb7/0_268_3872_2324/500.jpg", "body": "The foreign correspondent and newsreader George Alagiah, who has died aged 67 of cancer, was one of Britain\u2019s most respected television journalists, with a reputation built up over many years of covering world events. In a business often seen as cut-throat, George was regarded by colleagues as likable and decent, a view shared by millions of viewers. For the BBC he reported on the famine and the US intervention in Somalia in the early 1990s, and on the genocide in Rwanda and its aftermath. He was one of the news team who in 1999 secured pictures of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, for which they won the Bafta for best news and current affairs journalism. George\u2019s reporting and analysis were always enhanced by personal experience. He observed Africa\u2019s \u201cwind of change\u201d at first hand, growing up in Ghana in the 60s when hopes were high for the newly independent states; and later, as a BBC foreign correspondent, reporting on the bloodshed, famine and disease as the African dream collapsed. At home, he was not afraid to comment on issues of race and multiculturalism in the UK, or on the role of the BBC itself. He was a migrant twice over, moving from Sri Lanka to Ghana at the age of six, and then to Britain when he was 11. Born in Colombo, he was the son of Therese (nee Santiapillai) and Donald Alagiah. \u201cMy parents moved us first to Africa and then to Britain, always in search of something better for their children,\u201d he wrote. His father was a civil engineer who decided to leave Sri Lanka after anti-Tamil riots. George arrived in Ghana as a boy in December 1961, four years after the country had gained its freedom from Britain. It was the era of African liberation. In his book A Passage to Africa (2001), Alagiah described how his father was interviewed for a job by the chief executive of Ghana\u2019s water department, noting it as a small sign of change: \u201cAn African was recruiting an Asian, with no white man mediating between his erstwhile charges. The new order was asserting itself over the old.\u201d \u201cFor me,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe earliest evidence of our new, elevated status was the acquisition of our first car in Ghana, a Mercedes-Benz, just days after setting foot on the continent. Seven years later, by the time I was sent to boarding school in England, I was calling Ghana my home. I sounded like a Ghanaian and thought like a Ghanaian.\u201d At St John\u2019s college in Portsmouth, Hampshire, a Catholic school, he was one of a handful of children of foreign parents. The boy from Sri Lanka wanted to fit in, as he had in Ghana. \u201cYou do this thing that the migrant does,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2004. \u201cYou are desperate to shed one skin and take on the skin of the place you are in, and subconsciously that is what I did.\u201d He gained a degree in politics from Durham University, where he met his future wife, Frances Robathan (they married in 1984), and then applied unsuccessfully to join the BBC\u2019s graduate trainee scheme. The rejection \u201churt a lot\u201d at the time, he said, but in retrospect he was glad of it, saying it gave him a breadth of experience that many BBC trainees did not have. Instead, in 1982, he joined South magazine, which covered the developing world with the philosophy that \u201can unequal world is an unstable world\u201d. He became its Africa editor, and in 1989 joined the BBC as a foreign correspondent, specialising in Africa and the developing world. Over the next few years, his reports on the famine in Somalia won awards from the Royal Television Society, Amnesty International, the Broadcasting Press Guild, the Monte Carlo TV festival and the James Cameron Memorial Trust. In 1994, George was nearly killed while covering the civil war in Afghanistan. About to knock on the door of a government official who lived near the place where he was staying, he remembered he had left something behind and turned back. Twenty seconds later, a rocket destroyed the official\u2019s house. He wrote later: \u201cThere were lots of times in Sierra Leone, Somalia, Liberia when I put on a bulletproof vest and mentally prepared myself for danger. But here, death would have come out of the blue. It was a very strange, destabilising thing.\u201d That year, he began a four-year posting as the BBC\u2019s southern Africa correspondent, based in Johannesburg, covering the genocide in Rwanda and the events that followed, including mass migration and cholera. \u201cTo be in Goma at this time was like being transported back to a scene from the Old Testament,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn less than a week, about a million people trudged across the border from Rwanda into Zaire [now Democratic Republic of the Congo].\u201d He found it the most challenging assignment that he had experienced. \u201cThe crux of the matter was whether to treat the exodus as primarily a humanitarian or a political problem,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCholera, that most indiscriminate of killers, was about to be unleashed on a population of a million people who had no means of escape. The genocide was forgotten and cholera became the story.\u201d Further afield, he covered the trade in human organs in India, street children in Brazil, the persecution of Kurds in Iraq and the Asian tsunami. In 1998, Alagiah was voted media personality of the year in the Ethnic Minority Media Awards. The following year saw his reports from Kosovo, a story in which he took pride. Shortly after, he gave up travelling to \u201cdon the sharp suits of the studio-based presenter\u201d, as he put it, first on the BBC News Channel, then on the One O\u2019Clock News. In 2002, when BBC4 was launched, he presented the BBC\u2019s first nightly news bulletin dedicated to foreign news. A year later, he joined the presenters of the BBC Six O\u2019Clock News. In 2008 he was appointed OBE. For seven years, he was a patron of the Fairtrade Foundation, a charity that lobbies governments to achieve a better deal for smallholder farmers in Africa and elsewhere. In 2009, despite his and the charity\u2019s protests, the BBC made him give up the role, citing a potential conflict of interest. He was about to present a BBC Two series called The Future of Food and there were fears his impartiality could be seen to be undermined. George took issue with the BBC\u2019s director general, Greg Dyke, when he described the BBC as \u201chideously white\u201d. Commenting in 2001 that the BBC\u2019s problem was one of culture, not race, George said that although the upper echelons were still \u201coverwhelmingly white, male and middle class\u201d, he saw the growing number of black and Asian reporters as a sign of progress. He said those he knew who had moved on from the corporation \u201cdid so for more money and better jobs, not because they find the place unwelcoming or racist\u201d. There was controversy when his book A Home from Home (2006) was serialised in the Daily Mail under the frontpage headline \u201cMy fears for apartheid UK\u201d. In one passage he wrote that multiculturalism was partly responsible for the emergence of segregated areas such as those \u201capartheid\u2019s social engineers dreamed of\u201d. Interviewed in the Guardian, he accepted the analogy was provocative but insisted he had been careful to limit it: \u201cWhereas in South Africa it was by design, here we appear to have blundered into it.\u201d His final book, The Burning Land (2019), was a political thriller based in post-apartheid South Africa. He was a passionate believer in the importance of the BBC. \u201cI\u2019ve been to places where they don\u2019t have a public service broadcaster, where they tune in to the BBC on the dot every day because they see something that is trustworthy and authoritative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a truly precious flower that we in Britain have got and I can\u2019t for the life of me understand why anyone would want to trample on it.\u201d His diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2014 led to an operation. He returned to work the next year, but further absences for treatment followed, and he stepped down from presenting late in 2022. He is survived by Frances and their sons, Adam and Matthew. \u2022 George Maxwell Alagiah, television journalist, born 22 November 1955; died 24 July 2023"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604ded", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jul/24/interest-rate-rises-uk-economy-twitter-x-travel-companies-rhodes-banks-natwest-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pound on worst run since March 2020 with UK economy \u2018close to stalling\u2019; some Gatwick strikes suspended \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "UK private sector growth slowed to six-month low this month, while DHL workers have cancelled Gatwick strikes and other strikes are suspended", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:00:20", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.678951", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dbfb82dd9f42a6b85a47b9afd6250edb90434984/0_224_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Time for a recap: The pound is heading for its seventh daily fall in a row \u2013 its worst run since March 2020 \u2013 as signs build that the UK economy is slowing. Sterling is down almost half a cent at $1.281, barely a week after hitting 15-month highs of $1.314 against the US dollar. The pound has weakened as City investors have cut their forecast for the peak in UK interest rates to around 5.75%, down from 6.5% expected earlier this month. Sterling came under more pressure after a survey of UK purchasing managers found that Britain\u2019s economy is close to stalling this month. Data provider S&amp;P Global found that rising interest rates, elevated inflation, and more caution among clients due to the uncertain economic outlook hit company growth. High interest rates are set to restrain the economy over the next few years, with economic forecasters at EY ITEM Club halving their 2024 growth forecast. Borrowers continue to face higher costs too, with two-year fixed mortgage rates rising again today. But with the UK economy weakening, the Bank of England could resist pressure for a large interest rate rise next month, and only plump for a quarter-point hike. The US economy is also slowing this month, while eurozone firms suffered a drop in activity. Elsewhere today\u2026 Some of the strikes planned by baggage handlers and other workers at airport Gatwick in the peak summer travel period have been suspended or cancelled. The Unite trade union has announced that staff were offered better pay deals, meaning some strikes are cancelled and others put on hold pending ballots. Rail passengers are facing further disruption over the summer holidays after train drivers announced another week-long overtime ban in a long-running dispute over pay. Elon Musk has revealed a new logo for Twitter, choosing a \u201cminimalist art deco\u201d X as part of a rebrand of the platform. Reaction from the social media platform\u2019s users has been mixed, if witty: Must has also indicated the design would be altered, tweeting that it \u201cprobably changes later, certainly will be refined\u201d. Financial regulators are to be summoned to parliament to explain how they prosecuted the case of a multimillion-pound pensions fraud whose victims have yet to receive compensation and which has not led to anyone serving prison time. Welsh whisky is to join its Scottish and Irish counterparts in being officially awarded protected origin status under the UK\u2019s post-Brexit regime. Factories in England and Wales are seeing a downward trend in the share of their trade going to the EU, an analysis from the manufacturers\u2019 trade body shows. Holiday company TUI has now said it had cancelled all its flights from Britain to the Greek island of Rhodes up to and including Friday due to the wildfires on the island. TUI also put on six extra planes today to fly customers from Germany and the UK back home. Ryanair has said its flights to Rhodes are operating as normal and are unaffected by forest fires that have prompted large-scale evacuations of the Greek island, as it reported a near quadrupling of profits in the spring. The venture capital industry has come under fire from MPs for its \u201cunacceptable failure\u201d to invest in businesses located outside London or south-east England, or those run by women and ethnic minorities. Holiday company TUI has now said it had cancelled all its flights from Britain to the Greek island of Rhodes up to and including Friday, due to the wildfires hitting the island, Reuters reports. TUI had previously cancelled all its trips there up to and including Tuesday. The company continues to operate repatriation flights to bring stranded holidaymakers back to the UK and other European countries, as flagged earlier today. Its statement on Monday added that it had also cancelled flights for holidaymakers heading to the hotels in Rhodes which have been affected by the fires up to and including Sunday. TUI adds: \u201cAll customers due to travel on these flights will receive full refunds.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on the pound\u2019s weakness: UK cinemas are celebrating their biggest weekend since 2019 as the dual offerings of Barbie and Oppenheimer lured punters in. Greta Gerwig\u2019s film about the Mattel doll, played by Margot Robbie, having an existential crisis and Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic about the \u201cfather\u201d of the atomic bomb, generated almost \u00a330m at the UK box office, according to the UK Cinema Association. Cinema chain Vue said a fifth of its customers had purchased tickets to see both films in a double bill dubbed by social media as Barbenheimer. More than 2,000 of Vue\u2019s Barbie screenings were sold out, according to the company. Newsflash: The US economic recocery is losing momentum this month as service sector growth slows, the latest survey of purchasing managers at American companies shows. S&amp;P Global\u2019s flash US PMI Composite Output has dropped to 52.0 in July, down from 53.2 in June, and nearer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. This is the slowest growth in five months, with output growth at services companies slowing and manufacturers reporting broadly unchanged levels of production this month. Total new order growth slowed this month, while export demand conditions for manufacturers worsened. Business optimism about the year-ahead outlook fell to its lowest level so far this year. The economic picture is darkening, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, adding: \u201cJuly is seeing an unwelcome combination of slower economic growth, weaker job creation, gloomier business confidence and sticky inflation. The overall rate of output growth, measured across manufacturing and services, is consistent with GDP expanding at an annualized quarterly rate of approximately 1.5% at the start of the third quarter. That\u2019s down from a 2% pace signalled by the survey in the second quarter. However, growth is being entirely driven by the service sector, and in particular rising spend from international clients, which is helping offset a becalmed manufacturing sector and increasingly subdued demand from US households and businesses. The US stock market has begun the new week with some small gains. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 92 points, or 0.25%, to 35,320, extending its recent strong run, while the broader S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4%. Holiday operator TUI says it has \u201cextended its support\u201d for holidaymakers caught up in the willdfires on the island of Rhodes. TUI says that early this morning, six of its additional planes flew its customers and other holidaymakers from Germany and the UK back home. The TUI planes brought holidaymakers safely back to Hanover, Frankfurt and Stuttgart and in the UK to London-Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester. In addition, another TUI flight will take Danish guests back to Billund, the company adds: America\u2019s economic growth has also weakened, mirroring the slowdown we\u2019ve seen in the UK and the eurozone already today. U.S. economic growth edged down slightly month-on-month in June, as production activity weakened, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago shows. The Chicago Fed National Activity Index decreased to -0.32 in June from -0.28 in May, suggesting that U.S. economic activity grew below its average historical trend last month. Measures of production, consumption and sales all fell, while there was a small increase in employment levels. More Gatwick strikes have been suspended, the Unite union, has just announced, easing the threat of holiday disruption this summer. Workers employed by DHL have accepted a 15% pay rise and an \u2018uplift in skills pay, meaning hourly rates will rise by between 15% and 31%. Plus, workers will get an extra shift premium of \u00a31.25 per hour for work between midnght and 4.59am. As a results, DHL staff will no longer strike from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, and also from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cThis is an excellent result secured by the steadfast position of our DHL members. Once again, workers are gaining real material benefits from Unite\u2019s absolute focus on improving jobs, pay and conditions.\u201d Almost 1,000 staff who work on roles at Gatwick including baggage handling and check-in desks at four companies, including DHL, voted to hold those eight days of strike action earlier this month. But the strikes could yet be called off, with ASC and Menzies workers currently balloting on improved offers. If the ASC workers reject the pay offer, they will go ahead with strike action scheduled between 28 July and 1 August as well as strikes between 4 August and 8 August, Unite says. Strikes by Menzies workers between 28 July and 1 August have been suspended, however if the offer is rejected, strikes between 4 August and 8 August will go ahead. Talks with GGS are \u201cprogressing in a positive direction\u201d, Unite adds, meaning that strike action by GGS workers scheduled between 28 July and 1 August has been suspended to allow negotiations to continue. However, strike action between 4 August and 8 August is still scheduled to go ahead if a satisfactory outcome is not reached in time. The \u201cX\u201d logo has long been an obsession of Elon Musk\u2019s and is his name for an \u201ceverything app\u201d that he has pledged to launch at some point \u2013 with Twitter the likely vehicle, our global technology editor Dan Milmo writes. Shortly before buying Twitter in October, Musk described the social media platform as \u201can accelerant to creating X, the everything app\u201d. After taking over Twitter in October last year, Musk folded the company into an entity called X Corp, whose parent is X Holdings Corp. This month, the Tesla CEO announced he was forming a new artificial intelligence company called xAI. The crowd-sourced logo had been posted by Twitter user Sawyer Merritt, co-founder of a sustainable clothing business, who tweeted that the font had been used for a discontinued podcast, although it also bears similarity with a font used by Indian dance music artist Kxlider. The old blue bird has vanished from the top of the Twitter home page, replaced by the new \u201cminimalist art deco\u201d X. There are concerns that Elon Musk is throwing away 15 years of brand recognition, by rebranding Twitter as X. Mike Proulx, Forrester VP research director, explains: \u201cBy changing Twitter\u2019s app name, Elon Musk will have singlehandedly wiped out over fifteen years of a brand name that has secured its place in our cultural lexicon. This is an extremely risky move because with \u2018X,\u2019 Musk is essentially starting over while its competition is afoot.\u201d The good news for Musk is that #TwitterX is trending in the UK this morning. Less encouragingly, I\u2019ve also seen #RIPTwitter popping up in the trends list too. Fashion retailer Matalan has reported a \u201cchallenging\u201d first quarter as the cost-of-living squeeze on spending. The slow transition to summer weather also weighed on the group\u2019s sales, with April\u2019s thundery showers and an unsettled May deterring people from buying new warm-weather clobber. Total revenues at the low-cost clothing and homeware chain fall by 8% to \u00a3264m in the three months to May 27, compared to \u00a3287m made in the same period last year. Matalan, which has 230 stores across the UK and 48 franchised shops overseas, said it had noticed an impact from shoppers spending less on non-essential items. Chief executive Jo Whitfield said: \u201cThe business had a challenging first quarter with cost of living pressure resulting in depressed consumer spending in discretionary categories. \u201cUnseasonal weather delayed a refresh of wardrobes for early spring creating a tough start to the season.\u201d Companies in the eurozone are also having a tough July. Eurozone business output fell at the fastest rate for eight months in July, according to the latest HCOB flash PMI survey data produced by S&amp;P Global, released this morning. The survey showed that demand conditions worsened across the board in the eurozone this month, with new business shrinking at the fastest rate since last November. The goods-producing sector saw one of the steepest declines in new orders since 2009, while services companies reported the first downturn in new orders for seven months. Inflationary pressures moderated, though, with \u201cgathering deflation in manufacturing\u201d and \u201cslower service sector inflation\u201d. The pound is on track for its longest losing run since early in the Covid-19 pandemic, as City traders dial down their forecast for UK interest rate rises. Sterling is down a quarter of a cent today at $1.281, its lowest level in a fortnight. This is its seventh daily drop in a row, as traders digest this morning\u2019s warning that UK private sector growth is weakening this month. That\u2019s the worst run since March 2020, when the pound fell for eight consecutive sessions. The selloff reflects growing expectations that UK interest rates will not rise as fast as previously feared, as the economy slows and inflation drops. The pound had surged to a 15-month high of around $1.314 on 13th July, after rising by six days in a row (the best run of 2023), but the mood has turned against the pound since. UK government bond prices are rallying this morning, pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on British debt. Five-year and 20-year gilt prices have jumped to six-week highs this morning, as this morning\u2019s weak survey of UK purchasing managers pulls down on expectations for UK interest rate rises. The yield on 20-year UK bonds has dropped to 4.38%, down from 4.47% on Friday night. Bond yields fall when prices rise. The slowdown across UK companies this month bolsters the case for the Bank of England to only raise interest rates by a quarter of one percent next week, argues Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe. That would take UK interest rates to 5.25%, up from 5% today. Harvey says: All in all, today\u2019s data once again confirms that the effects of the BoE\u2019s tightening cycle are now starting to have an impact on the real economy, and with services activity cooling specifically, this should provide further justification for the BoE to decelerate its hiking cycle with a 25bp hike in August. The Cty seems to share this view, with the chances of a 50-basis point (half a percentage point) hike now down to 32% today, having been odds-on earlier this month. July\u2019s weak PMI reading suggests the UK is suffering from \u201cfaltering economic resilience\u201d, says Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK. Pugh points to data last week showing a drop in consumer morale: The fall in the flash S&amp;P/CIPS Composite PMI to 50.7 in July, combined with the drop in the GfK measure of consumer confidence to -30, suggests that the economy is starting to buckle under the weight of the surge in interest rates and exceptionally high inflation. \u2018Admittedly, at 50.7 the composite PMI is consistent with flat GDP growth rather than a contraction. But July was the fourth consecutive fall in the PMI having peaked at 54.9 in April. What\u2019s more, the drop was broad based with both the services (53.0 to 51.5) and manufacturing (46.0 to 45.0) sectors falling. This suggests that momentum and resilience in the private sector is starting to falter, and it is not difficult to see the economy slipping into recession in early 2024 as the impact of interest rate hikes continue to feed through into the real economy. Dr John Glen, chief economist at CIPS, agreed that higher interest rates are hitting UK growth this month (as shown by today\u2019s PMI report). Dr Glen says: \u201cHigher borrowing costs are here to stay and the private sector knows it. Interest rate hikes are not just affecting new orders today but spending plans long into the future. The biggest concern is increasingly not if the UK economy will enter recession but for how long. More optimistically, though, he sees \u201cthe jigsaw pieces for a supply-led reduction in inflation\u201d falling into place: Global supply chains are returning to normal after years of pandemic shortages and rising costs. Stocks of unused goods built up to help manage Brexit, the pandemic and most recently global shipping disruption are finally being run down. Manufacturing input costs are falling and supplier performance is improving at the fastest rate we have ever seen. This renewed supply chain agility, combined with falling raw material and transportation costs, could not have come at a better time for business.\u201d Newsflash: growth at UK companies has slowed to its lowest level since January as higher interest rates slow the economy, a new survey shows. Data firm S&amp;P Global Insight repoorts that UK private sector output rose at its weakest rate for six months in July Companies reported that business activity was hit by rising interest rates, elevated inflation, and more caution among clients due to the uncertain economic outlook. That backs up EY ITEM Club\u2019s warning this morning that higher borrowing costs weigh on growth (see opening post). Growth slowed at service sector companies, while manufacturing output shrank at the fastest rate since last December. This pullsed S&amp;P\u2019s flash PMI Composite Output Index down to 50.7 for July, down from June\u2019s 52.8, and a 6-month low. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Several service sector firms blammed weaker residential property market conditions for weakening demand, while others cited cutbacks to discretionary business and consumer spending. Manufacturers cut their prices for the second month running, as they benefitted from a big improvement in suppliers\u2019 delivery times and falling cost pressures. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says rising interest rates are taking their toll on the economy. \u201cThe UK economy has come close to stalling in July which, combined with gloomy forward-looking indicators, reignites recession worries. July\u2019s flash PMI survey data revealed a deepening manufacturing downturn accompanied by a further cooling of the recent resurgence of growth in the service sector. Rising interest rates and the higher cost of living appear to be taking an increased toll on households, dampening a post-pandemic rebound in spending on leisure activities. Meanwhile, manufacturers are cutting production in response to a worryingly severe downturn in orders, both from domestic and export markets. \u201cForward-looking indicators, such as order book inflows, levels of work-in-hand and future business expectations, all point to growth weakening further in the months ahead, adding to a risk of GDP falling in the third quarter. UK short-term mortgage rates have risen a little higher today, despite last week\u2019s fall in inflation. Financial data provided Moneyfacts reports that the average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen to 6.81%, up from 6.80% on Friday. But the average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate was unchanged at 6.32%. Last week, the average rate on both types of mortgage fell for the first time since May, after the larger-than-expected fall in UK inflation to 7.9% in June. The money markets currently expect Bank of England base rate to peak at 5.75% next spring, down from forecasts of a peak of 6.5% earlier this month. Savings rates have crept a little higher today, Moneyfacts says: The average 1-year fixed savings rate today is 5.15%. This is up from an average rate of 5.14% on the previous working day. The average easy access savings rate today is 2.73%. This is up from an average rate of 2.70% on the previous working day. The average 1-year fixed Cash ISA rate today is 4.90%. This is up from an average rate of 4.89% on the previous working day. The average easy access ISA rate today is 2.83%. This is up from an average rate of 2.78% on the previous working day. Spain\u2019s stock market has dropped by over 1% this morning, after last weekend\u2019s general election left the country in political deadlock. Neither the left or right-wing political parties appear to have a clear path to power. Spain\u2019s opposition conservative party, the People\u2019s Party (or PP) secured the most number of seats, with 136, followed by the incumbent Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (or PSOE) with 122. The far-right Vox party took 33 seats \u2013 well down on the 52 they picked up in the last election \u2013 while the new, far-left Sumar alliance were in fourth place with 31 seats. Spain is in for weeks of negotiating and horse-trading as the rival camps explore their options for government. My colleague in Madrid, Sam Jones, explains: Negotiations by the two blocs to form governments will start after a new parliament convenes on 17 August. King Felipe VI will invite the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, to try to secure the prime ministership. In a similar situation in 2015, PP leader Mariano Rajoy declined the king\u2019s invitation, saying he could not muster the support. If Feijoo declines, the king may turn to the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, with the same request. The law does not set a deadline for the process but if no candidate secures a majority within two months of the first vote on the prime minister, new elections must be held. Back in the City, shares in digital advertising and marketing services business S4 Capital have tumbled by around a fifth after it cut its revenue and profit forecasts this morning. S4, founded by Sir Martin Sorrell five years ago, told shareholders that net revenue in the second quarter of this year had been \u201cbelow budget\u201d, which it blamed on challenging macroeconomic conditions. Clients, particularly in the tech sector, were cautious and very focussed on the short term, S4 said. It has slashed its forecast for like-for-like net revenue growth this year to a range of 2-4%, as opposed to 6-10% previously. The firm\u2019s operational EBITDA profit margin target has been cut to 14.5-15.5%, down from 15-16%. S4 added that its \u2018content\u2019 division, which creates adverts for brands, has had a \u2018difficult\u2019 first half of 2023, saying: Based on our preliminary review of the H1 results, Technology services continues to perform well, Data&amp;digital has seen growth slow compared to 2022, but is trading satisfactorily, while Content has had a more difficult period generating results below our budget. The new X logo is being displayed on Twitter\u2019s HQ tonight: With the old blue bird logo heading for the pigeon coop in the sky, tweets are now to be called \u201cx\u2019s\u201d, according to Elon Musk (we\u2019ll see how long it takes for that to catch on\u2026) Another take on the Twitter rebrand: Shares in travel companies have dipped this morning, after budget airline Ryanair cut its forecast for traffic growth this year. Ryanair reported a surge in earnings in the April-June quarter this morning, almost quadrupling its profits after tax to \u20ac663m, up from \u20ac170m a year ago (when the Ukraine war hit demand). Traffic rose 11% year-on-year to 50.4 million passengers in the quarter. But, Ryanair has also cut its forecast for travel for the full year to approximately 183.5m (a rise of 9%), down from the 185m originally expected. It blames delays to deliveries of new Boeing aircraft. But Ryanair also reported \u201ca softening\u201d in fares in late June and early July, which may indicate that demand is weakening. The airline also suggested that it may need to cut fares to fill its planes this coming Christmas and New Year, having added 25% more seats compared to pre-Covid levels. British Airway\u2019s parent company, IAG, are down 3% in early trading. EasyJet have dropped by 4.1%, while TUI are down 3.4%, as the airlines race to repatriate holidaymakers who have fled hotels due to the Greek wildfires. In the City, shares in Ocado have jumped by over 11% to their highest level since January, after it reached a deal with Norwegian robotics firm AutoStore over patent litigation claims. Under the deal, announced last weekend, AutoStore will pay \u00a3200m to Ocado. They will also have \u201ccomplete freedom\u201d to access and use technology covered by each other\u2019s pre-2020 patents, and can continue to use and market their own existing products without risk of infringing each other\u2019s post-2020 patents. This litigation has hung over Ocado since October 2020, when Autostore filed a case arguing the UK firm had infringed six of its patents relating to its use of robots to retrieve goods from warehouses. Today, Ocado CEO Tim Steiner says: \u201cI am pleased that we have worked together to resolve our differences and can now continue to focus on what we do best - innovating, developing and enabling partners to access world beating technology\u201d Some Twitter users are unimpressed by the X rebrand, and mourning the old blue bird logo (although it\u2019s still displayed at the top of the Twitter homepage at pixel time). There have also been some rather pointed suggestions for the new logo, reflecting concerns about Twitter\u2019s viability or its political leanings, which didn\u2019t make the cut: Elon Musk has changed his profile information on Twitter to read \u201cX.com,\u201d which now redirects to a user\u2019s homepage on twitter.com. Twitter appears to have changed its logo, ditching its signature blue bird in favour of a stylised X. Chief executive Linda Yaccarino has just tweeted the new logo, a day after owner Elon Musk invited his 149 million followers to suggest an X logo, and said the company would switch if a \u201cgood enough X logo\u201d were posted. Musk also indicated that the logo would probably be changed in future, and \u201ccertainly will be refined\u201d. The move to X is part of Musk\u2019s push to transform Twitter, which he bought for $44bn last year, into an everything app. And here is the new logo \u2013 described by Musk as \u201cminimalist art deco\u201d: Musk\u2019s rebranding of Twitter as X comes as he struggles to attract advertising and faces increased competition following the launch of Meta\u2019s Threads platform. Since buying Twitter, he has slashed the workforce and cut costs, and tried to cajole users into paying $8 per month for Twitter Blue. Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, confirmed the launch of the X brand on Sunday. She tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally rare thing \u2013 in life or in business \u2013 that you get a second chance to make another big impression. Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square.\u201d Yaccarino said X would be \u201ccentred in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking\u201d and would be a \u201cglobal marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities\u201d. She added: \u201cX will be the platform that can deliver, well \u2026 everything.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Rising interest rates are set to slow the UK economy next year, casting a pall over the country in a likely election year. The EY Item Club, the economic forecasting group, has halved its forecast for UK economic growth in 2024 to 0.8%, down from the 1.9% projected in April. The 2025 GDP growth forecast has also been downgraded, from 2.3% to 1.7%. These growth downgrades are due to the increase in UK interest rate over the last 20 months, from 0.1% in December 2021 to 5% today. EY ITEM Club predict two further interest rate rises from the Bank of England, in August and September, meaning Bank Rate peaks at 5.5%. That will further slow growth, and put more pressure on mortgage holders, with over one million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes to surging mortgage costs. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: \u201cThe inflation and interest rate outlook is a key risk for the forecast. Should inflation prove more stubborn than expected, the prospect of even more rate rises than we expect will come very much into play. On the other hand, the potential is there for inflation to fall faster than expected, as June\u2019s outturn demonstrated. But the good news is that the economy remains on course to avoid recession, with the UK economy is expected to grow 0.4% in 2023, up from the 0.2% growth seen three months ago. Beck explains: \u201cAt the moment, the boost from less expensive energy in particular means the EY ITEM Club doesn\u2019t believe recent interest rate rises will push the consumer sector or wider economy into recession. And although the current rate rising cycle doesn\u2019t appear to be over yet, current market expectations for Bank Rate to climb to around 6% seem unlikely to come to pass. That said, how the Bank of England perceives things will be key and, should it opt for a more hawkish stance, there is a real risk that interest rates could continue to ratchet up to a level where even the protection afforded by healthy household and business balance sheets isn\u2019t enough to prevent a recession. On that count, the next few months \u2013 and what they tell us about just how sticky inflation and strong pay growth are \u2013 will be crucial.\u201d The path for economic growth could influence Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision on when to call the next election, with senior Conservatives urging him to go to the polls in the spring. Also coming up today City minister Andrew Griffith is expected to write to the chief executives of 19 banks, building societies and digital challengers today, to warn them that regulations around politically exposed persons are \u201cbeing applied in a disproportionate manner by some financial institutions\u201d. Griffith will summon bank chiefs for a meeting to discuss how customers can be protected from \u201cbeing de-banked\u201d, following the row after Coutts cut ties with Nigel Farage. Travel firms and airlines are being urged to reimburse passengers who decide against flying to Rhodes as the Greek island is ravaged by wildfires. One leading consumer group arguing it would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d to withhold refunds. A string of travel companies have cancelled package holidays to Rhodes, and are now scrambling to repatriate thousands of tourists. Greek authorities have issued an evacuation order for parts of Corfu, after wildfires broke out on there too.

But the answer belied the seriousness with which the Matildas are taking the challenge posed by Nigeria. If Australia win, it will guarantee progression to the round of 16 \u2013 with one match to spare. The Matildas are not underestimating their opponents, though, who looked dangerous in a goalless opening encounter with Canada on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of training together, so I think we just need to stick to our process, our game plan, our tactics,\u201d Yallop said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be physical and fast \u2013 we\u2019ve prepared for it and [need to] make sure we stick to our game.\u201d Nigeria attackers Asisat Oshoala and Francisca Ordega troubled Canada\u2019s defence, while goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie saved a penalty from Christine Sinclair to keep the Super Falcons in the game. \u201cThere\u2019s an unpredictability to them, which makes it a little bit difficult,\u201d said Yallop. \u201cBut we\u2019ve trained for that in our prep. It\u2019s about being focused in every moment against them.\u201d Yallop is one of the few Matildas to have played Nigeria before, at the 2015 World Cup in Winnipeg, Canada. Kyah Simon scored twice to ensure a comfortable win for Australia. But Yallop expects a tougher challenge against the 11-times Africa Cup of Nations champions this time around. \u201cI think they\u2019ve changed a lot,\u201d said Yallop. \u201cI think it will be a very different game to 2015, but they still have all those qualities from before. I think it will be a very competitive football match and something we\u2019re not taking lightly.\u201d Matildas defender Charlotte Grant, recently named PFA Young Women\u2019s Footballer of the Year, identified Nigeria\u2019s wide players as the biggest threat Australia will face. \u201cYou saw in the Canadian game \u2013 they had some really good break-outs,\u201d said Grant. \u201cWe definitely need to be prepared for that. They have two of the fastest wingers probably in the tournament \u2013 so it\u2019s going to be a really exciting test, we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d The Matildas struggled to break down Ireland in their opening clash of the Women\u2019s World Cup, needing a penalty to secure victory at a sold-out Stadium Australia. Ireland\u2019s defensive strategy, with a back-five and two holding midfielders, stymied the Matildas\u2019 preferred counter-attacking style. But Grant was optimistic that Nigeria\u2019s attacking style could play into the Matildas\u2019 hands, even without captain Sam Kerr, who will miss the game due to a calf injury. \u201cHopefully that [style] opens up space for us \u2013 that\u2019s where we thrive, our wingers, our full-backs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you never know, maybe they\u2019ll change their game plan. We have to be ready for anything and stay disciplined whatever they throw at us.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s preparations for the World Cup have been plagued by pay disputes and a falling out between coach Randy Waldrum and the Nigerian Football Federation.

Victorians registered the highest level of support (44%), with Western Australians least likely to be in favour (36%).

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Outside sport, views on current events were a little more mixed. The wide-ranging poll shows Anthony Albanese\u2019s approval rating continues to drop \u2013 from 54% in May to 48% in July, with those who disapproved with the job he is doing as prime minister increasing from 35% to 41%. However his approval rating remains more than 10 points ahead of Peter Dutton. The opposition leader\u2019s rating has remained steady in the last two months (36% in May compared with 37% now). Dutton\u2019s disapproval rating has also remained fairly steady from 45% in May to 43% now.

Another 27% had heard of it, but did not know what it was about, while 40% had not heard about the issue. Awareness of the PwC scandal was highest among older people and those living in capital cities but there was no majority support for specific consultant reforms such as bans on external consultants providing government services. Support for a royal commission into the government\u2019s use of consultants was also mixed, with 24% in strong support, 26% in support and 34% neither in support or opposed. Another 10% strongly opposed a royal commission and 6% opposed. The Greens have vowed to continue to prosecute allegations against PwC, including using parliamentary process to investigate a Coalition government decision to award $33m to a PwC startup without a competitive process. Greens senator Barbara Pocock said the party would continue to push for more transparency when it came to the use of external consultants. \u201cI\u2019m sounding like a broken record here but I\u2019ll say it again, we need accountability and transparency in government, particularly when dealing with private sector suppliers and particularly when dealing with the big four consultants,\u201d she said.

McHugh, a Gamilaroi and Dhungutti woman, says without support some of these languages and dialects could die out and this cultural heritage would be lost forever.

McHugh said the Aboriginal languages week is an Australian first and comes as governments and advocates around the world are pushing to \u201cstop further language loss\u201d. The week, which will kick off with a free public festival in Sydney, will run every year during the week of 24 October to mark the date the Aboriginal Languages Act became law in NSW in 2017. The NSW Aboriginal affairs minister, David Harris, said the week will focus on teaching languages that remain across the state, particularly to children and young people. Harris on Monday visited the Gujaga preschool and La Perouse public school, where students have been learning Dharawal. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to accentuate the value of teaching and learning language across the community, particularly connecting young kids back to their culture,\u201d he said. Harris hoped the week would raise awareness and increase support for the revitalisation and reclamation of Aboriginal languages. \u201cLosing any language is a terrible shame. We\u2019ve got the opportunity to not just rediscover some of these languages but to actually grow their usage.\u201d People or organisations wishing to host an event or activity can apply for grants of up to $5,000 from a $250,000 pool to be administered by the Aboriginal Languages Trust.

The names, business names, phone numbers and emails of the participants in the survey were published on the parliament website in response to a question on notice from May\u2019s Budget estimates hearing. The research report from firm 89 Degrees East was developed as part of the cyber wardens pilot program launched in the wake of last year\u2019s Optus and Medibank cyber attacks, and was included in a bundle of responses about the program to answer a question from the shadow cyber security and home affairs minister, James Paterson. The program \u2013 which went on to receive $23.4m in the May budget \u2013 is aimed at training small businesses and the workforce to be \u201ccyber smart\u201d and aware of possible cyber threats. The Understanding Small Business and Cyber Security report which contained the personal information surveyed over 2,000 business owners and employees, and found 44% had experienced a cyber attack, with 29% saying they had experienced a cyber attack affecting their own personal information. Those who participated in the survey and indicated they wanted to hear more about the cyber wardens program were included in the information. The information was removed from the parliament website this week. Paterson said the department should be an exemplar of good cyber security practice and privacy protection. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply ironic this breach of personally identifiable information occurred in an answer to a question about improving cyber security for small businesses and from a department whose minister publicly attacked Optus when they had similar data stolen by a criminal gang,\u201d he said. \u201cAs bad Optus, Medibank and other recent data breaches have been, a loss of data on that scale by a government department or agency could be even worse given the sensitivity of the material involved.\u201d A spokesperson for home affairs said the department \u201cis aware of a potentially unintentional data release\u201d and sought the removal of the information from the internet. \u201cThe department will consider its obligations in accordance with the Privacy Act, including contacting impacted individuals.\u201d The cyber wardens program is a Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia initiative delivered by 89 Degrees East that runs as a free online education course for small businesses to train employers and employees to protect their businesses from cyber threats, with the aim to train 50,000 \u201ccyber wardens\u201d over three years. In June, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was questioned by the opposition about the $23m grants being awarded without tender, to COSBOA, which partnered with 89 Degrees East. The opposition had questioned whether there was a conflict of interest given 89 Degrees East lists the wife of the health minister, Mark Butler, as a senior consultant, when the money was approved by the expenditure review committee Butler sits on. In parliament at the start of June, Butler said he had made all appropriate declarations to the prime minister as required by the ministerial code, and his wife\u2019s contract had been mentioned, despite her contract having ended in 2021. He said that arrangements were in place to manage any potential conflicts of interest. Daniela Ritorto resumed working for the firm in February this year, but quit in May.

Its styles range from the sparse, economical prose of the experimental novella to an intricately plotted page-turner. And the six shortlisted writers include a debut novelist and a Miles Franklin veteran; just one is male-identifying. Iris by Fiona Kelly McGregor Iris is an impeccably researched biographical novel that brings to life Sydney\u2019s inner-city Darlinghurst and Surry Hills circa 1930s in a way reminiscent of Ruth Park. McGregor is the most experienced writer on the shortlist: Iris is her eighth book and her accolades include a Steele Rudd award and an Age book of the year (Indelible Ink). McGregor knows Sydney well \u2013 especially its convoluted history of colonialism, repression and disobedience. Her inspired decision to fictionalise the real-life Iris Webber (1906-1953) was no doubt influenced by the extraordinary photography archives of the Sydney Police (1912 to 1948). In Webber\u2019s daily struggle against the dark forces of law and order, the patriarchy, the heteronormative presents as a poetic victory for the queer, the poor and the lawless. The criminal hero is no stranger to Australian readers: mostly men. But McGregor\u2019s Webber, as \u201cbad\u201d and unforgiving as they come, is a welcome turn. Iris is a sophisticated queering of the archives. It\u2019s also an extraordinary recuperation of lower working-class Sydney\u2019s Depression-era vernacular, with much of its sexist, racist, homophobic implications intact. This is a novel full of sex, music, drugs, drink and laughter. I loved that about it. A lengthy book, there are some slow points in the long middle, and a vast cast of characters to keep in check. But its strengths are myriad. McGregor is a writer with vision, intellect, commitment and flair. Cold Enough for Snow by Jessica Au Jessica Au\u2019s debut was much anticipated: its manuscript won the inaugural international US$100,000 (A$149,000) the Novel prize, trumping 1,500 entries. It since won the Victorian premier\u2019s award for fiction, The Victorian prize for literature and the Readings prize for new Australian fiction. Au\u2019s mastery of the novella feels like a long, nourishing drink at the best kind of literary waterhole. Influenced by the autofiction of Rachel Cusk, Ben Lerner and Elizabeth Strout, it\u2019s not a plot-driven book. The Melbourne-based narrator and her ageing mother take a holiday to Japan: it\u2019s that simple. The setting is contemporary. The narrator\u2019s observations of the everyday aspects of the journey \u2013 negotiating transport, admiring design objects in speciality shops, a long walk through an unfamiliar landscape \u2013 accumulate with a hypnotic persistence. There is a subtle search for meaning, particularly regarding the nature of intergenerational relationships. But Au also nudges us to contemplate the personal impact of tourism, art, migration, settlement and resettlement \u2013 and some of the more subtle aspects of cultural difference. Ultimately, we\u2019re left with a slightly discomforting sense of the unknowability of the other, and light existential distress. It\u2019s a credit to Au that she lets the reader sit with this at the conclusion: nothing feels artificially resolved. For more: Cold Enough for Snow by Jessica Au review \u2013 a graceful novella about how we pay attention Limberlost by Robbie Arnott Robbie Arnott is the only one of these authors to have been shortlisted for the Miles Franklin before \u2013 for his second novel, The Rain Heron (2020), which won the Age book of the year award. Arnott is also the only male-identifying author on this shortlist and masculinity is a central theme. Ned, 14, the youngest of four children, lives on the family orchard on the banks of Tasmania\u2019s Tamar river, during the second world war. His mother is dead, his emotionally distant first world war-veteran father suffers PTSD and his older brothers have enlisted. When Ned\u2019s older sister returns home \u2013 suddenly and heartbroken \u2013 he does his best to win her approval. Set over a single summer, the plot is simple but satisfying. Arnott\u2019s capacity to bring the setting and characters vividly to life makes for a fully immersive reading experience. It\u2019s inspired in part by Arnott\u2019s grandfather, who grew up where the book is set. The book would make a good screenplay. I was slightly irritated by an overreliance on flashbacks to a particular childhood experience, its full details gradually drip-fed to the reader. Arnott\u2019s talent for plot and extraordinary skill for verisimilitude make the novel compelling enough on their own. For more: Limberlost by Robbie Arnott review \u2013 a sweet and moving song of man and landscape Hopeless Kingdom by Kgshak Akec Kgshak Akec, a creative writing student at Deakin University, is the youngest writer on this shortlist at 26. Super excited, she says she is \u201cstill processing\u201d the news. Akec\u2019s debut is inspired by her family\u2019s migration from South Sudan to Australia via Egypt, during the early 2000s. It\u2019s told interchangeably from the perspective of Akita, aged six and in her first year of school when we meet her, and her mother, Taresai, in Cairo. The novel opens with Taresai, sole proprieter of a successful bootleg liquor business, making hospital visits to sit with her premature fourth child. This manuscript won the Dorothy Hewitt award in 2021, after inaugural winner Josephine Wilson (2020) \u2013 who swept up the Miles Franklin the following year, for Extinctions. One of Akec\u2019s strengths is in rendering accomplished scenes that are active, tense, crowded and fast-moving. The book brims with authentic, memorable characters and relationships between family and friends that are complex and subtly complicated. Akito\u2019s big brother, Santo, older by two years, will live on in readers\u2019 memories: many will recognise this heartbreakingly fun risk-taker, who takes all who know him on the wildest of rides. The novel is a bit lopsided at times. Akito\u2019s point of view is consistently vivid, while Taresai\u2019s often lacks immersive sensory detail. I wish Akec\u2019s editors had worked harder to help correct this imbalance. But hers is a vivid, exciting new voice. The Lovers by Yumna Kassab The Lovers is this shortlist\u2019s most experimental work. Told through short vignettes that switch from one lover\u2019s point of view to the other, Kassab\u2019s technique allows plenty of space for the reader to fill in the gaps, and the freedom to imagine the fuller setting and its attendant complications. This novella\u2019s limited dramatic narrative scale permits the author a sophisticated attention to the poetics of representation: perhaps the book\u2019s key achievement. It\u2019s an accomplished, deeply feminist exploration of contemporary romance. Amir and Jamila, the lovers of the title, unite almost exclusively at night-time. In Jamila\u2019s rented room, in a city foreign to her, their mutual desire ignites and deepens. Amir has a failed marriage behind him, but remains committed to the institution. His means are limited by poverty and a government that can\u2019t be trusted; his choices reduced by a conservative, patriarchal culture. Jamila\u2019s privileges of class and foreign citizenship free her to come and go as she pleases. Marriage is a trap Jamila neither wants nor needs. She has seen what it does to other women. A tourist in her father\u2019s birth country, she stays longer than intended \u2013 partly to explore what her love affair might become. The lovers keenly feel their differences. Their possible futures are much contemplated: in the privacy of their bedroom and the seclusion of their own thoughts. A great deal hinges on what might happen next. The Lovers is Kassab\u2019s third novel. She artfully employs stories within stories: tiny parables that frame or commentate on the larger story of the lovers and their fate. Even the author\u2019s notes are unconventionally playful and poetic. I loved this honest, clever, powerful work. For more: Yumna Kassab on the Book It In podcast on how we imagine Australian in literature Chai Time at Cinnamon Gardens by Shankari Chandran Chai Time at Cinnamon Gardens is mostly set in a western Sydney nursing home, run by and for a Sri Lankan Tamil community. Shankari Chandran says the novel was inspired and informed by regular visits to her grandmother. \u201cAs she was walking, she\u2019d be talking, and telling us stories about her life, of her childhood, of her marriage, her migration.\u201d Chandran is a mid-career author whose achievements are gradually accumulating. Her debut novel, Song of the Sun God, was longlisted for the International Dublin literary award and shortlisted for Sri Lanka\u2019s Fairway national literary award. A lawyer, her interests lie in dispossession, erasure and connection. Accordingly, this novel reflects on racial violence, xenophobia, cultural erasure and truth-telling. The outer-suburban nursing home of the book\u2019s title at first conjures an idyllic suburban utopia, a \u201cnew\u201d Sri Lanka for Tamil residents in their final days. But uncomfortable truths about ethnic and race-based violence, xenophobia and misplaced investments in the myth of nationhood soon rupture the idyll. The struggle to peacefully coexist in a multi-ethnic community is the focus: both in contemporary Australia and the Sri Lanka many key characters have fled. Chandran gives us complex interiorities and a racing plot, relayed through multiple perspectives \u2013 bringing the emotional, physical and intergenerational impact of deliberate mass cultural erasure sharply into view. But I sometimes wished for a slower, simpler, less performative approach to plot, to give me more time to sit with the book\u2019s extraordinary characters and properly absorb its ideas.

Wilfried Zaha\u2019s emotional message posted on Instagram just after 10pm on Sunday finally signalled the end of a journey that began when he joined Palace\u2019s youth team more than 20 years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing the Palace shirt since I was eight years old, it\u2019s literally been my second skin and I always gave everything when I wore it,\u201d Zaha wrote. \u201cI grew up two roads away from the bright lights and loud crowds of Selhurst Park, having no idea that I would be at the centre of it all one day, and have the amazing journey I\u2019ve had with this amazing club. So I would say to my eight-year-old self, dream big and only you can kill your dream.\u201d After months of speculation about his future, Zaha\u2019s decision to join Galatasaray will have come as a surprise to most. But with the Turkish side poised to kick off their Champions League campaign against the Lithuanian side Zalgiris on Tuesday night in the second qualifying round, the Ivory Coast forward decided that a move to Istanbul, which was completed on Monday night, represented his best option of playing in Europe\u2019s elite club competition after nine years spent keeping his boyhood club afloat in the Premier League. Few at Palace would begrudge him that opportunity after serving them with such distinction. Born in Abidjan but raised in south London, Zaha was 17 when he made his debut as a substitute against Cardiff in March 2010. Palace survived relegation to League One on the final day of that season and were minutes away from liquidation when a consortium led by the current chairman, Steve Parish, stepped in the following month, so the supporters were in desperate need of a new local hero. Zaha proved to be their salvation, scoring the first of his 90 goals for Palace on his full debut against Leicester and eventually helping the club return to the Premier League for the first time in eight years in 2013. By then, he was on loan from Manchester United having become Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s last major signing for an initial \u00a310m a few months earlier, and had won two senior caps for England under Roy Hodgson, albeit in friendlies. Zaha failed to make a Premier League start under David Moyes and was welcomed back with open arms by Palace in August 2014 for an initial loan. His return to Selhurst Park became permanent a few months later and, almost another 300 appearances later to take his Palace total to 458, the rest is history. While the managers have come and gone as Palace bucked the trend of previous short-lived spells in the Premier League, Zaha \u2013 who switched allegiance to Ivory Coast in 2016 after being given no further chances by Hodgson and ignored by Gareth Southgate \u2013 has been the driving force behind the most sustained period of success in the club\u2019s history. Although Zaha was dogged by muscle injuries last season that restricted him to 28 appearances and forced him miss the end of last season, he will be hard to replace \u2013 and not just for his goalscoring. The 30-year-old\u2019s departure will leave an enormous void that Palace must act quickly to fill, especially with clubs circling for some of their other prized assets. Zaha\u2019s natural heir, Michael Olise, has attracted interest from Chelsea and Manchester City despite being sidelined for the start of the season with a hamstring injury, and Eberechi Eze is yet to agree to a contract extension having made his England debut in June. Serious offers for the coveted defenders Joachim Andersen and Marc Gu\u00e9hi could also arrive in the coming days, with Parish under pressure to spend as he attempts to finance construction of a new main stand. Palace\u2019s \u00a3200,000-a-week offer for four years to Zaha that would have taken him to within months of his 35th birthday was made in October. More talks are understood to have been held in recent days as he completed his recuperation from a hamstring injury at the training facilities despite his contract expiring at the end of June. Galatasaray\u2019s determination to sign him under the noses of their bitter rivals Fenerbahce proved decisive when Zaha concluded it was time to move on. He had rejected concerted attempts by Al-Nassr to persuade him to sign a contract worth significantly more than Palace had offered and join the exodus to the Saudi Pro League, while interest from Paris Saint\u2011Germain and Europe\u2019s other big hitters never came to anything concrete. Although he thanked Parish in his goodbye message to the Palace fans, there is understood to be some lingering irritation about what might have been after the club\u2019s handling of previous transfer windows in which significant offers from Arsenal and Everton, among others, were turned down. There are those on the Palace board who believe they should have taken the money, but Parish will feel it has been worth every penny. A mural of Zaha\u2019s most iconic celebrations \u2013 including the thrilling playoff semi-final victory against their bitter rivals Brighton when Zaha memorably scored twice at the Amex Stadium \u2013 was unveiled at the end of last season outside Selhurst Park and just around the corner from his childhood home in Rothesay Road. Walking past that will feel especially poignant for every Palace supporter before the first home game of the new campaign against Arsenal next month."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604df4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/25/embodied-emissions-measured-australia-carbon-infrastructure-construction-pollution", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Price, speed, quality \u2013 and now carbon.

The commonwealth and states and territories have endorsed a plan from the New South Wales government to decarbonise infrastructure projects, a key part of which is measuring and valuing embodied emissions. In construction, embodied emissions refers to the carbon emitted through the production and transportation of materials such as concrete and steel, as well as from a project\u2019s eventual decommissioning. Unlike emissions generated directly by a project\u2019s function \u2013 on a railway line, for example, the diesel or electricity used to power the rolling stock \u2013 embodied emissions have been notoriously difficult to measure and have largely not been factored into the bidding process. Industry and climate advocates have warned that construction companies have had little incentive to innovate their supply chain and design choices to minimise indirect emissions. These emissions are thought to account for up to 10% of Australia\u2019s total emissions, according to government estimates, and are considered important to address for the country and states to meet net zero commitments. NSW has been a frontrunner in planning to tackle embodied emissions, with the infrastructure minister in the former Coalition government, Rob Stokes, outlining a plan last year to reduce the emissions inpublic works by 2027. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The plan has been continued by the Labor government and transport minister, Jo Haylen. At a transport and infrastructure ministers\u2019 meeting in Perth last month, the commonwealth and states and territories endorsed NSW\u2019s model. NSW\u2019s now nationally backed framework will develop a consistent metric to quantify emissions, which will be brought to the ministers\u2019 meeting in mid-2024 for agreement. Haylen said it was time for governments both in NSW and around Australia \u201cto reassert their role as leaders in emissions reduction\u201d. \u201cAfter a decade in the slow lane, Australian governments are now on the fast track to greener infrastructure, with NSW leading the nation on this critical work,\u201d Haylen said. \u201cIndustry is crying out for certainty to allow them to make smart investment and procurement decisions, drive down costs and reduce environmental impacts,\u201d she said. The CEO of the Climateworks Centre, Anna Skarbek, welcomed the NSW model. \u201cThis recognises the life cycle of emissions has many steps in it,\u201d she said, suggesting that cost-benefit analysis decisions for governments to fund certain infrastructure projects may not stack up under the new model.\u201d The project manager of infrastructure at Climateworks Centre, Rebecca Powell, said Australia was \u201cbehind the ball\u201d on embodied emissions compared with Europe. She said the approach to value carbon was also significant. \u201cThe valuing question is, if you have measured the emissions, what value do you place on removing them? \u201cThere might be a situation where when you consider the lifecycle emissions to build a new road, the answer might be to build public transport instead,\u201d Powell said. The CEO of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, Adrian Dwyer, said that under the model, governments could set thresholds for projects to encourage better industry practices. Dwyer said this was important because there are no clear technology to improve concrete and steel production to be less emissions intensive \u2013 both materials which are \u201cubiquitous\u201d and difficult to replace in construction. \u201cIf you\u2019re measuring consistently you can compare across projects, so for example, a government could say we will only accept proposals of 700 units of carbon, and that might mean one bid changes its design to use a higher-strength concrete but less overall, or electric vehicles to be used more in production.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604df5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/toronto-film-festival-2023-hollywood-strike-kate-winslet-emily-blunt", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kate Winslet, Emily Blunt and Olivia Colman movies headed to Toronto film festival", "lead": "Despite the actors\u2019 strike limiting promotional activity, a bumper lineup of Oscar-tipped films is set to premiere in September", "author": "Benjamin Lee", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 15:00:14", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679104", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b590cf8ed945d207afb6c2b59efd3e7ff280f44f/0_0_2570_1542/500.jpg", "body": "Much-anticipated films starring Kate Winslet, Emily Blunt and Olivia Colman are set to premiere at this year\u2019s Toronto film festival. The annual gathering of A-list stars is set to be an unusual edition as a result of the ongoing actors\u2019 strike, which forbids members of the Screen Actors Guild from promoting certain films. But the lineup is dominated by work made independently outside of the system, with many sales titles that are as yet unaffiliated with a studio or streamer, technically allowing actors to attend premieres. One of the buzziest titles is Lee, still to be sold outside of the UK, starring Winslet as Lee Miller who went from a career as a Vogue model to a photographer working in the second world war. The cast also includes Marion Cotillard, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Andrea Riseborough. Winslet has called Miller \u201can inspiration of what you can achieve, and what you can bear, if you dare to take life firmly by the hands and live it at full throttle\u201d. Blunt, currently receiving positive notices for her role in Oppenheimer, will see her Netflix fact-based con drama Pain Hustlers hit the festival although the streamer association will prevent any form of promotional activity if the strike continues. She stars alongside Chris Evans as a woman involved in a pharmaceutical conspiracy with a tone likened to The Big Short. After one Oscar win and another two nominations, Colman is re-entering the Oscar race with a role alongside her fellow nominee and The Lost Daughter co-star Jessie Buckley in 1920s-set comedic mystery Wicked Little Letters. The pair play suburban women who team up to uncover who is behind a series of obscene letters. Colman and co-producer Ed Sinclair have called it \u201cas hilarious as it is unexpected with beautifully and affectionately drawn characters across the board\u201d. The festival will see Jamie Foxx and Tommy Lee Jones teaming up for the legal drama The Burial, based on a New Yorker article about a lawsuit filed against a funeral company. Ian McKellen, Lesley Manville and Gemma Arterton will also star in the Patrick Marber-scripted thriller The Critic, set in 1930s London focused on a dark web of secrets and lies involving an actor and a theatre critic. Fresh from winning a Tony award for her role in Prima Facie, Jodie Comer will be starring with Benedict Cumberbatch in apocalyptic thriller The End We Start From. She will play a mother trying to survive in the midst of floods that devastate London. Elliot Page will make his big screen comeback with Close to You, a drama from the Bafta-winning director Dominic Savage. He\u2019s referred to it as \u201ca very special and unique film about love, identity and family\u201d. The Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins also stars as the British humanitarian Nicholas Winton in the second world war drama One Life with Helena Bonham Carter. The festival will see a number of actors in the director\u2019s chair and given that the directors\u2019 guild is not on strike, it could technically allow them to promote their work as directors. The list includes films from Michael Keaton, Viggo Mortensen, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine and Ethan Hawke. Kristin Scott Thomas will also make her directorial debut with the comedy drama My Mother\u2019s Wedding starring Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Freida Pinto. Scott Thomas has said it was \u201cthrilling to create this fictional family using my own childhood memories as a springboard\u201d. Last week saw the Venice film festival, which takes place just before, announce that the previously confirmed opening film Challengers, starring Zendaya, would no longer be premiering as a result of the strike. Toronto film festival\u2019s CEO, Cameron Bailey, recently spoke about his concerns over the possible lack of big-name attendance. \u201cThe presence of actors and the excitement the stars generate is important,\u201d he said to Variety. \u201cIt\u2019s important to several stakeholders, including some of our public partners, who build their engagement with us around the presence of those stars. It\u2019s important to us because it\u2019s worth a considerable amount of our revenue every year, and that\u2019s under threat. That is a serious concern for us \u2026\u201d The festival is used as an important stop on the awards circuit for those hoping for Oscar glory with last year seeing premieres of Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Fabelmans and All Quiet on the Western Front."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604df6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/25/renting-rights-real-estate-agent-offshore-staff-australia-legal-philippines", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I\u2019m a renter.

Very shortly after the change in property management, things went downhill. The agent was calling on Sundays and turning up to the property unannounced. Concerned about this behaviour, I started doing some investigation about the agent. It turned out they are outsourcing the property management to a company overseas. The staff that would email me for things such as my invoices, or respond to my maintenance requests, are based in the Philippines. I don\u2019t know if these offshore staff have a real estate licence and they struggle to source trades to deal with urgent repairs because they\u2019re searching from not only outside the area, but the entire country. Not to mention the time difference and subsequent delay in replying to emails. How legal is this? \u2013 Worried Renter, NSW Kat George says: This sounds like a very stressful situation. Dr Chris Martin, a tenancy law expert at University of New South Wales\u2019s City Futures Research Centre suggests the first thing tenants should remember is: \u201cReal estate agents work for landlords, not tenants. \u201cSometimes people think agents somehow work for both, but no: they are the landlord\u2019s agent.\u201d While that may not sound great at first, there is an upside. \u201cBecause the agent acts for the landlord, wrongdoing by the agent is, in effect, wrongdoing by the landlord,\u201d Martin says. To address the first part of your question about the erratic and unexpected behaviour of your landlord\u2019s agent: in most jurisdictions in Australia, there is legislation that dictates when and how a landlord or agent can enter a tenant\u2019s property, and the procedure for doing so. In NSW you have the Residential Tenancies Act 2010, in Victoria, the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 and in Queensland the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008. In all these Acts, the landlord or their agent must provide written notice if they plan to enter your property. In Queensland and Victoria, this includes 24 hours written notice of an intention to carry out repairs and maintenance, or to show the premises to prospective tenants (except in the case of emergencies). NSW requires two days\u2019 written notice for repairs and maintenance, and in the case of inspections, at least 14 days\u2019 written notice for the first inspection, with subsequent inspections requiring at least 48 hours\u2019 written notice. In all jurisdictions, routine inspections require at least seven days written notice. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Acts also entitle you to (variously worded) reasonable peace and privacy. In NSW and Queensland, this is called \u201creasonable peace\u201d and in Victoria \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d. In short, this means that the landlord and their agent must allow you to enjoy the property without interference, other than in extreme circumstances (for instance when urgent repairs are needed to maintain your safety and ongoing enjoyment of the premises). Any interference with your reasonable peace is a breach of your tenancy agreement, which must be compliant with state law. And, Martin advises: \u201cIf an agent infringes your reasonable peace, comfort and privacy, or accesses the premises without the proper notice, these acts are as good as (or as bad as) the landlord doing them.\u201d To address the issues you\u2019re experiencing, Martin suggests putting the problems in writing to the agent or your landlord and informing them that they are in breach of your tenancy agreement. \u201cFor practical purposes it may be better to go directly to the landlord with this complaint, but if you don\u2019t have their contact details just notify the agent \u2013 this is as good as notifying the landlord,\u201d Martin says. If the behaviour doesn\u2019t stop, you should then \u201capply to your jurisdiction\u2019s tenancy tribunal for remedies against the landlord. These remedies might include compensation, orders that the agent stop interfering with you, or an order terminating the tenancy\u201d. As for the second part of your question, about whether hiring an offshore management company is legal, again, most Australian jurisdictions have legislation that requires property agents to be licensed. In NSW, this is the Property and Stock Agents Act 2002, in Victoria it\u2019s the Estate Agents Act 1980 and in Queensland, the Property Occupations Act 2014. These Acts apply to anyone acting as a property agent or as an assistant agent \u2013 including those undertaking property management. Even if someone is performing their property management role from an overseas location, they must be licensed or have a certificate of registration, according to the relevant Australian law. Martin suggests making a complaint about this to NSW Fair Trading, but says \u201cyou cannot be sure this will fix your real problem\u201d. He says going to the landlord is your best bet. \u201cUsually the better way for a tenant to deal with a bad agent is to make it the landlord\u2019s problem \u2013 because it is.\u201d If you\u2019d like further advice about tenancy issues and your rights, you can contact your local tenants advice and advocacy service.

Duggan, 54, a former US marine pilot who is now a naturalised Australian, was arrested in October at the request of the US government, which is seeking his extradition on charges of arms trafficking and money laundering arising from his alleged training of Chinese fighter pilots at a South African flight school more than a decade ago. The allegations have not been tested in court. Duggan, who has not been charged with a crime in Australia and has no criminal history anywhere in the world, denies the charges and is fighting his extradition from prison, a process that could take months or years to resolve. The father of six faces a potential 60-year prison term if convicted in the US. The flight school where he taught after resigning from the US Marines \u2013 the Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA) \u2013 says it has strict protocols and a code of conduct to ensure no information is shared that might be legally or operationally sensitive \u2013 or security classified. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cAll TFASA training materials have always been either open source or provided by clients. The syllabus of the course that Mr Duggan was part of delivering was in line with international standards and totally unclassified,\u201d a spokesperson for TFASA told Guardian Australia. Asked whether TFASA believed Duggan\u2019s fulfilment of his contract was in keeping with his, and the flight school\u2019s, legal obligations, a spokesperson said: \u201cYes. TFASA has always complied with its legal obligations and worked hard to ensure the same of any and all employees or contractors\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cTFASA has had no contact whatsoever with Mr Duggan since the conclusion of the single contract he undertook for the company 10 years ago.\u201d Duggan has been imprisoned for 277 days while he fights extradition and has faced significant isolation, having been classified as a high-risk prisoner. In March, Australia\u2019s inspector general of intelligence and security (IGIS) launched a formal investigation into Duggan\u2019s ongoing incarceration and the circumstances of his arrest, after allegations were raised by his legal team he may have been \u201clured\u201d back to Australia by intelligence officials before his arrest. Duggan\u2019s case returns to court on Tuesday. Barrister Bret Walker SC is expected to appear for Duggan and to argue extradition proceedings should be temporarily stayed while the IGIS investigation is under way. If that argument is successful, Duggan\u2019s legal team expects to make an application for him to be released on bail. Duggan told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 the allegations against him were false. \u201cI strenuously reject the indictment in its entirety\u2026 I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d He said the pilots he trained were not members of the Chinese military, but were \u201ccivilian test pilots\u201d. Duggan reiterated earlier statements he held little faith in the US justice system if he were extradited. US-born Duggan served more than a decade flying in the US Marine Corps, rising to the rank of major and working as a military tactical flight instructor. He left the military in 2002 and moved to Australia, becoming an Australian citizen in 2012 and renouncing his US citizenship in 2017. He has lived in Australia and China since leaving the US Marines. A 2017 US grand jury indictment alleges Duggan trained Chinese pilots to land fighter jets on aircraft carriers, in defiance of arms trafficking laws, and engaged in a conspiracy to launder money. The indictment details payments Duggan allegedly received in 2011 and 2012 for allegedly training Chinese fighter pilots at a test flight academy \u201cbased in South Africa with a presence in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. Duggan \u201cprovided military training to PRC pilots\u201d, according the indictment, including \u201cinstruction on the tactics, techniques and procedures associated with launching aircraft from, and landing aircraft on, a naval aircraft carrier\u201d. The indictment says he failed to obtain authorisation from the US state department\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to export defence services or providing training to Chinese nationals, as he had been instructed was required. Duggan\u2019s legal team has maintained the US extradition request was politically motivated and catalysed by the US\u2019s deepening geopolitical contest with China.

Last month Tracy Sorensen was preparing to launch her highly anticipated second book, The Vitals \u2013 a playful and unconventional cancer memoir/novel written from the viewpoint of her organs \u2013 while dealing with a niggling winter cough. The Miles Franklin-longlisted author and academic assumed she just had a chest infection. \u201cThey whacked me straight in for a chest X-ray and that was it, I was back in cancer land,\u201d she says from her home in Bathurst during downtime between infusions of chemotherapy and a targeted \u201cbiological agent\u201d to treat lung cancer. It\u2019s a recurrence of the advanced primary peritoneal cancer she had \u2013 and vanquished \u2013 in 2014. \u201cDespite everything I know about cancer, having written a whole book about it, having immersed myself in it, it still feels shocking,\u201d Sorensen says. \u201c[After] 8.5 of remission \u2026 it was absolutely the last thing I was expecting.\u201d She \u201cwould not\u201d, she jests darkly, \u201cadvise this as a publicity stunt\u201d. \u201cHaving the cancer recur right now is some sort of cosmic joke \u2026 But it goes with what I\u2019m saying in the book, which is that it\u2019s absolutely laughable that we think we\u2019re in control of our lives.\u201d As a carrier of the BRCA1 gene, Sorensen had years earlier undergone risk-reduction surgery (a double mastectomy and ovariectomy) to try to dodge the \u201cdeath sentence\u201d that has stalked so many of her family members. So her 2014 cancer diagnosis came as a shock to Sorensen. \u201cPrimary peritoneal cancer is the kind of ovarian cancer you can still get even if you\u2019ve had your ovaries removed,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd so I became this outlier \u2026 I\u2019m an extremely rare case.\u201d Surviving the ordeal \u2013 which she recounts in The Vitals in an action-packed piece of speculative nonfiction set inside the squishy confines of her peritoneal cavity \u2013 left her with fewer organs than she started with and gave her the \u201ckick up the bum\u201d she needed to finish her debut novel, which was published in 2018. The Lucky Galah, which she had been chipping away at for more than 15 years (the idea was already percolating when we worked together at a Sydney newspaper in 1999) was set in a remote Western Australian town during the 1969 moon landing and also features a non-human narrator: a flightless pet galah. The Lucky Galah soared, and was nominated for a slew of Australian literary prizes, including the 2019 Miles Franklin award. With cancer in the rear-view mirror, Sorensen pulled out the sack of life-sized woollen guts she had crocheted during her treatment in an effort to \u201cget to know\u201d her organs and began bringing them to life as characters on the page. It was a process, Sorensen says, of \u201cextreme anthropomorphising\u201d. Among The Vitals\u2019 cast is Peri the peritoneum, a ditzy conspiracy theorist loosely inspired by cancer fraudster Belle Gibson; a \u201cwandering womb\u201d named Ute who carts around two pet kelpies (ovaries) in her tray; a workaholic liver named Liv; a gluttonous stomach dubbed Gaster; and an anarcho-communist spleen named Rage who is seduced by an irresistible young tumour (and rampant capitalist) named Baby. \u201cThe comic possibilities were just everywhere for me,\u201d says Sorensen. \u201cAnd I had perfect licence to have fun with it because it was my own body. \u201cThese organs [are] just stumbling around \u2013 they\u2019ve got absolutely no idea what\u2019s really going on, but the reader knows what\u2019s going on, so you just keep playing with that, pushing it.\u201d The result is a rollicking ride, as if The Poseidon Adventure, The Famous Five and Animal Farm were dunked in a vat of Ken Done Australiana, steeped in the philosophy of eco-feminist Val Plumwood and translated into satirical medicalese. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In late 2019, as Sorensen struggled to transform a \u201cmountain of research\u201d and medical jargon into whimsical metaphors, opportunity came knocking: she was awarded the $100,000 Judy Harris writer-in-residence fellowship, an annual grant given by the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre to a writer exploring health-related themes (previous recipients include Emily Maguire and Sorensen\u2019s literary mentor Charlotte Wood). She was given her own office inside the medical research institute; the specialists down the hall were only too keen to jump into the \u201ccreative playpen\u201d with her. When the pandemic struck a few months into her residency, Sorensen hotfooted it home to Bathurst, from where she would watch the institute\u2019s scientific seminars. It was those video conferences that gave her the idea for the organs in her novel to meet regularly via Zoom \u201cas a metaphor \u2013 a way of conjuring the continuous communication between organs\u201d. \u201cThe cancer memoir is normally written from the point of view of the important suffering cancer patient. I\u2019m now a suffering cancer patient and I\u2019m trying to save my life, so I\u2019m not denigrating that. But there\u2019s always, always, always 50 million other points of view for every situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need different ways of seeing ourselves. If we just go on saying \u2018We are the most important thing no matter what\u2019, we will destroy this planet. I\u2019m writing [The Vitals] for people who are interested in radically new ways of seeing the world.\u201d Sorensen says she was determined to limit \u201cbattle\u201d tropes in The Vitals. \u201cThis idea that an ordinary person down the road who gets cancer caused it themselves and it\u2019s up to them to join the \u2018battle\u2019; and \u2018fight\u2019 and \u2018win\u2019 is really exhausting when you\u2019re ill \u2013 that\u2019s a lot to put on people,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the idea of homeostasis is a much nicer way of thinking about this than war and battle metaphors because actually something happens and the cells respond \u2026 Which I just find awe-inspiring.\u201d Sorensen also wanted to encourage readers to be curious about their anatomy and not ignore pesky symptoms. In The Vitals, Queen Bee \u2013 an avatar for Sorensen\u2019s brain \u2013 is too busy marking student papers to pay attention to her mutinous guts. \u201cBefore 2014, I couldn\u2019t have told you precisely where my pancreas was, I couldn\u2019t have told you where my spleen was, I had never heard the words \u2018greater omentum\u2019. All of this was a bag of mystery and it didn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all working fine, you don\u2019t particularly need to know.\u201d Another impetus for writing The Vitals was Sorensen\u2019s growing \u201cexasperation and fear around anti-science sentiment\u201d. Pseudoscience, she says, \u201coverlaps with climate scepticism \u2013 so it\u2019s just a terrifying bundle\u201d. \u201cThis is not a small thing for me; this is quite literally life-and-death,\u201d she says. \u201cAre we going to have wellness warriors using their beautiful young bodies as kind of assets on social media to monetise people\u2019s fears and bandy about absolute nonsense?\u201d Being treated for lung cancer as Covid spreads unchecked poses a new challenge. \u201cLast time [in 2014] I felt that all the problems were just coming from within, whereas now I\u2019m incredibly conscious that any kind of chest infection would be really, deeply problematic for me,\u201d she says. Still, says Sorensen, who turns 60 later this year, \u201cThe only thing I can do is to keep being incredibly philosophical. We all get a narrow band in history: that\u2019s our spot, so we come into it and go out of it in ways that we absolutely can\u2019t control.

Numerous opinion polls had suggested the PP and its potential allies in the far-right Vox party would comfortably win enough votes to topple the government of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) and its partners in the far-left Unidas Podemos alliance. The conservatives finished first with 136 seats in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress but found themselves up against a resurgent PSOE, which finished second with 122 seats. The Vox party, heavily touted as a kingmaker, suffered a crushing night with its seat count dropping from 52 to 33. The hung parliament means the left and right blocs are trying to put together coalition governments while S\u00e1nchez remains as acting prime minister. Between them, the PP and Vox won 169 seats \u2013 seven short of the threshold needed for an absolute majority in congress \u2013 while the PSOE and its allies in the new, far-left Sumar coalition won 153 seats between them. Although the right bloc has more seats, the left bloc has a greater chance of securing the support of smaller regional parties, many of which will be put off a potential PP government because of the party\u2019s recent coalition deals with Vox following May\u2019s regional and municipal elections. PSOE sources said the acting prime minister had told his party there was no need for another election because he was \u201csure that our democracy can find a formula for government\u201d. However, S\u00e1nchez \u2013 who is routinely accused by his critics of being far too reliant on the votes of Catalan and Basque separatists \u2013 looks likely to need the backing of Junts, a hardline Catalan pro-independence party. Junts is the party of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who fled Spain to avoid arrest after his unilateral attempts to secure Catalan independence failed six years ago \u2013 and who is no fan of S\u00e1nchez. Speaking on Monday, the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, admitted his party hadn\u2019t \u201clived up to our expectations\u201d but said he had already spoken to Vox and three regional parties \u2013 the Navarrese People\u2019s Union, the Canarian Coalition and the Basque Nationalist party \u2013 with a few to forming \u201ca stable government\u201d. Other senior PP members said the party had a clear mandate to rule and a duty to avoid the possibility of a repeat election later this year. The party\u2019s deputy organisational secretary, Miguel Tellado, told the state broadcaster TVE that \u201cdialogue, dialogue and dialogue is the challenge that lies ahead for us\u201d, adding: \u201cNo one wants a political impasse that could lead to another election.\u201d Cuca Gamarra, the PP\u2019s general secretary, said her party had won the elections in terms of seats and share of the vote and called on the socialists not to try to cut deals with Catalan separatists. \u201cYou can\u2019t try to pull off an investiture vote at any cost and using anyone\u2019s vote because you\u2019ll end up in the hands of Puigdemont, a fugitive from justice, and in the hands of parties that only want to push for independence,\u201d she told Telecinco on Monday. Gamarra said there were only two possible options when it came to the next government of Spain: \u201cEither the party that won the elections governs or we end up in a situation with an impasse and another Frankenstein [government].\u201d Junts has already signalled that its help in returning the socialists to power would have a price. It said it would like to see an amnesty for exiled Catalan politicians and a proper referendum on self-determination. S\u00e1nchez, however, has repeatedly said there will be no independence vote. \u201cWe won\u2019t make Pedro S\u00e1nchez PM in exchange for nothing,\u201d its leader, M\u00edriam Nogueras, warned on Sunday night. Puigdemont, meanwhile, said his party \u201cowes nothing to anyone but our voters\u201d, adding that it had never supported S\u00e1nchez\u2019s budgets, reforms or the \u201cfarce\u201d of his dialogue aimed at finding a solution to the question of Catalan independence. Puigdemont\u2019s suddenly acquired say over who governs Spain will come as a welcome boost to the bitterly divided and stalled regional independence movement. The two main pro-independence parties \u2013 Junts and the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) \u2013 suffered dismal results on Sunday. The Catalan branch of the socialist party came first, followed by Sumar. The ERC came third, losing six seats, followed by Junts, which lost one seat. The ERC, which belongs to the more moderate, pragmatic wing of the independence movement, has said it is prepared to support a new, socialist-led government to provide an alternative to a PP-Vox coalition. Negotiations are likely to be further complicated by a request from prosecutors for a Spanish supreme court judge to issue an arrest warrant for Puidgdemont over this role in the unsuccessful push for independence. Prosecutors have asked for a European arrest warrant to be issued in light of a decision three weeks ago by the general court of the European Union that dismissed Puigdemont\u2019s appeal to retain immunity from prosecution as a member of the European parliament. The former regional president\u2019s lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, accused the Spanish judicial authorities of playing politics. \u201cThe petition has come in the middle of the debate about the election results,\u201d said Boye. \u201cThey are trying to take part in the political debate.\u201d Puigdemont expressed similar sentiments in a tweet on Monday. \u201cOne day you are decisive in order to form a Spanish government, the next day Spain orders your arrest,\u201d he wrote."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dfa", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/vince-hill-obituary", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vince Hill obituary", "lead": "Popular singer and songwriter best known for his 1967 hit version of Edelweiss from The Sound of Music", "author": "Adam Sweeting", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 14:44:56", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679197", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/deaf6afd2147f9fb1a9f3b774c201cf1deecf58f/254_750_3073_1844/500.jpg", "body": "For many people, Edelweiss will be for ever associated with Christopher Plummer singing it while playing a guitar in the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s The Sound of Music, but for Vince Hill the song took on a more particular significance. His recording of it became his most successful release and the signature hit of his career, reaching No 2 on the UK singles chart in March 1967. His album of the same title also became a Top 30 hit. Hill, who has died aged 89, was already becoming a familiar name by the time of his success with Edelweiss. Having signed with EMI Columbia in 1965, he had reached No 13 in early 1966 with Take Me to Your Heart Again, then had a Top 30 hit with Heartaches and made the Top 40 with Merci Cherie. His successful streak brought him further hits in 1967 with Roses of Picardy (No 13) and Love Letters in the Sand (No 23), and he was back in the Top 40 with The Importance of Your Love (1968). His last appearance in the singles chart came with Look Around (And You\u2019ll Find Me There), which climbed to No 12 in 1971. He also released 10 studio albums under his EMI Columbia deal (and a further 15 for a variety of labels), making more recordings at EMI\u2019s Abbey Road studios than the Beatles. But Hill was not just a crooner and had several strings to his bow. He enjoyed considerable success as a songwriter, writing regularly with his musical director Ernie Dunstall. As well as providing material for his own albums and singles B-sides, the duo wrote Why Or Where Or When, which was taken to the top of the New Zealand charts in 1968 by Mr Lee Grant (real name Bogdan Kominowski). They also wrote the title song of the TV and Broadway star Robert Goulet\u2019s 1971 album I Never Did As I Was Told, which had featured on Hill\u2019s album of the same year The Singer\u2026 and the Songs. Keen to establish himself as an all-round entertainer, in 1973 Hill became the host of the BBC TV show They Sold a Million, which featured singers including Gene Pitney, the Hollies, Sacha Distel and Neil Sedaka. The following year Hill recorded Sing a Song of Sedaka, a selection of Sedaka\u2019s compositions. From 1975 to 1977, Hill hosted The Musical Time Machine on BBC Two, delving into popular recordings from the past and the stories behind them. The show featured a novelty gizmo called Eric (Electronic Recall Information Collator), a kind of primitive computer that supplied Hill with facts and figures about the featured songs. In 1988 ITV recruited him as the presenter of the daytime entertainment show Gas Street. Born in Holbrooks, Coventry, the son of a greengrocer, he attended Hen Lane secondary modern school, leaving at 15 to begin his musical career by singing in local pubs. After winning a talent contest while in Margate on holiday, he took singing lessons to make the most of his evident vocal talent \u2013 his voice would later be likened to \u201ccrushed velvet\u201d \u2013 and for a time worked as a coal miner at Coventry Colliery to pay the bills. Opportunity knocked when he saw an advertisement in Melody Maker, seeking a vocalist for the Band of the Royal Corps of Signals. He auditioned at the band\u2019s base at Catterick in North Yorkshire and was given the job, which enabled him to do his military national service while gaining priceless experience of performing in Europe and the Middle East. After being discharged, he toured in a production of Leslie Stuart\u2019s Edwardian musical Floradora, before joining Teddy Foster\u2019s big band as singer. He moved into a more pop-orientated direction with the Four Others and then the Raindrops, the latter giving him TV and radio exposure, in particular on BBC radio\u2019s Parade of the Pops. In 1959 he married Annie Davidson, a secretary to the London booking agent Tito Burns, whose clients included Cliff Richard and the Drifters. It was she who urged Hill to become a solo artist \u2013 \u201cif it hadn\u2019t been for her, I wouldn\u2019t have left the Raindrops,\u201d he confessed \u2013 and he notched up his first chart entry with The River\u2019s Run Dry, released on Piccadilly Records and which reached 41 in June 1962. The following year he became a regular guest on ITV\u2019s Stars and Garters, a variety show set in a fictional pub. Also in 1963 Hill bid to be the UK\u2019s entry for the Eurovision Song Contest with A Day at the Seaside, but was pipped by Ronnie Carroll singing Say Wonderful Things. Hill was featured on ITV\u2019s This Is Your Life in 1976, though by the 1980s his recording career had dwindled. He concentrated on performing live on cruise ships and at various prestigious venues including the London Palladium, the Royal Albert Hall and Sydney Opera House. In 1982 Hill and Dunstall teamed up with the playwright Alan Plater to write the musical drama Tolpuddle for BBC Radio 4, in which Hill played the leading role of George Loveless. In 1983 he wrote and performed the song It\u2019s Maggie for Me, in support of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s ultimately successful election campaign. From 1984 to 1993 he hosted Vince Hill\u2019s Solid Gold Music Show on BBC Radio 2, and in 1990 he took to the stage to play Ivor Novello in the musical My Dearest Ivor, prompting the album Vince Hill Sings the Ivor Novello Songbook. He published his autobiography, Another Hill to Climb, co-written with Nick Charles, in 2010. In 2014, his son (and only child) Athol died from a heroin overdose aged 42. At the time Hill was nursing his wife who had pulmonary fibrosis; she died in 2016. Hill had previously been successfully treated for prostate cancer and myeloid leukaemia, but from 2011 he suffered from macular degeneration, which caused the progressive deterioration of his eyesight. He donated the royalties from his 2017 compilation album Legacy: My Hits &amp; Rarities (1965-1974) to the Macular Society, of which he had become patron. \u2022 Vincent Hill, singer, songwriter and broadcaster, born 16 April 1934; died 21 July 2023"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dfb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/24/rsf-janjaweed-hemedti-out-to-finish-darfur-sudan-genocide-uk-cannot-stand-by", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The RSF are out to finish the genocide in Darfur they began as the Janjaweed.

The RSF is the Janjaweed rebranded, the \u201cdevils on horseback\u201d used by the Sudanese government from 2003 to implement widespread and systematic crimes against non-Arab communities across Darfur. The RSF was, and still is, commanded by Gen Mohamed Hamdan \u201cHemedti\u201d Dagalo. In recent weeks, what we knew was coming has been confirmed. Yale University\u2019s Conflict Observatory, which uses a combination of satellite imagery, Nasa thermal-detection data and open-source analysis, found evidence of the \u201ctargeted destruction of at least 26 communities\u201d by the RSF between 15 April and 10 July. Mass graves have been discovered, and satellite imagery shows entire urban neighbourhoods and villages have been burned down. Sexual violence is once again an evident component of RSF strategy. Facilities necessary for survival are being deliberately destroyed, from homes, schools and hospitals to water, electricity and communications infrastructure. This is what you do when you want to permanently remove a people. And terrible as this evidence is, the public reports and verified cases will still represent a massive undercount of what is actually taking place. This hellish trajectory will gather momentum, and there is a real risk the RSF will now take aim at larger targets, such as the town of El Fasher, where there are at least 600,000 displaced people now largely housed in three camps. The RSF appears to be taking advantage of an international response to the crisis that is prioritising resolution between the warring generals \u2013 Hemedti and Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of Sudan\u2019s armed forces \u2013 but so far is proving unable or unwilling to respond to the mass violence being unleashed across Darfur. From the second world war and the Holocaust to the wars of Yugoslav succession and genocide against Bosnia\u2019s Muslims, this deeply flawed assumption that ending armed conflict will also end campaigns of identity-based mass violence has meant catastrophic failures to protect vulnerable people and prevent massive losses of life. Failure to acknowledge these distinctions in Sudan will likewise be devastating for Darfur. The deliberate violence in Darfur requires an urgent response. However, doing so confers no legitimacy on Sudanese armed forces, which have been committing human rights violations elsewhere in Sudan in pursuit of reimposing Islamist authoritarian rule. What has been reported in Darfur should be seen as the first wave of a strategy that will become more extreme if left unchecked. The RSF command is watching what the world will do before it escalates. We have the narrowest of windows in which to act. The nature, intent and perpetrators of atrocities must be named and condemned. Last week the UK\u2019s development minister, Andrew Mitchell, said crimes against humanity was \u201centirely right\u201d to describe what is taking place. It is surprising that other countries \u2013 in particular the US, which has an established mechanism to do so \u2013 have yet to follow suit. Global condemnation can give perpetrators cause to hesitate; this buys time, which saves lives. The roles played by state leaders via back-channel diplomacy, and in leveraging bilateral and personal relationships, often make the greatest difference amid such delicate tipping points. Leadership from the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, along with Mitchell, in publicly condemning mass atrocities in the strongest possible terms \u2013 and getting on the phone to urge their counterparts to do the same \u2013 is therefore critical. The glare of the international spotlight allows perpetrators fewer places to conceal their crimes. As current president of the UN security council, the UK should be using every forum and mechanism to bring attention, investigation, documentation and media coverage. Impunity thrives in the shadows. The UK must listen far more to the people who know and understand this violence best. I told the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee last month that the UK made a catastrophic error in trusting the men with guns rather than listening to the people who were feeling increasingly unsafe. It would be a graver mistake still to assume now that designing protective strategies is the singular purview of military experts in western capitals. The UK needs to establish urgently an emergency communications channel between Whitehall and experts in Sudan, Darfur, Chad and the Darfuri community here in the UK, who will be among the first to know when the RSF advance or alters course. Ultimately, as the chairs of both the international development and foreign affairs select committees have repeated, a protective wedge must be placed between people at risk and the RSF. The full spectrum of protective options must be fully considered, including but not limited to the rapid deployment of high-level international observers, the presence of UN political and human rights experts as \u201ceyes and ears\u201d on the ground, and peacekeeping forces that can protect civilians. None of these options is easy \u2013 we know the UN security council is broken, and securing permission for access will be a diplomatic feat on its own \u2013 but difficulty cannot become an excuse not to persevere when any kind of international presence will help to pause attacks and buy time. We knew the spectre of identity-based mass violence was returning to Sudan. We knew it when Hemedti instigated a massacre in Khartoum after the people\u2019s revolution in 2019; we knew it when Burhan led the military coup in 2021. If the UK\u2019s policy is indeed \u201cto maximise our ability to take effective action to prevent and respond to atrocities\u201d, comprehensive action must be taken now. Otherwise, we will have to accept that we stood by 20 years after genocide began in Darfur, allowing the very same perpetrators to complete the crime. \u2022 Kate Ferguson is co-executive director of the charity Protection Approaches, which works to prevent identity-based violence"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dfc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/24/suella-braverman-acted-unlawfully-over-asylum-seekers-judge-rules", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Suella Braverman broke law by denying asylum seekers \u00a33 a week, judge rules", "lead": "Home secretary\u2019s withholding of payments for healthy food for children and pregnant women found to be unlawful", "author": "Diane Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 14:41:37", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679235", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/025cd4c1b79e90528c119422843d75e5dde52800/446_111_1360_816/500.jpg", "body": "The home secretary acted unlawfully in failing to provide basic support to asylum seekers, including young children and pregnant women, a judge has ruled. Suella Braverman must introduce changes that will benefit thousands of asylum seekers after five successfully challenged the home secretary in the high court. Three of the claimants brought proceedings over delays in providing financial support while two challenged over failures to provide cash payments to pregnant women and to children under three years old. In his ruling, Mr Justice Swift found that the home secretary broke the law in withholding payments of \u00a33 a week to provide healthy food for children aged one to three and to pregnant women. She must start making these payments to the thousands of pregnant women and people with children under three in hotels. The judge also found that the system the home secretary has been operating for dealing with asylum support payments was unlawful due to long delays in processing requests for these payments. Asylum seekers are not allowed to work for the first year that their claim is being considered and after that only those on the government\u2019s shortage occupation list are allowed to work. Many asylum seekers are entirely dependent on the Home Office for their survival in the form of payments of \u00a345 a week if they are in shared housing or \u00a39.10 a week if they are living in a hotel. The court heard evidence that the hotel food was pasta, rice, chips, mashed potato and dry sandwiches so it was not possible for the two people who brought the challenge over the lack of healthy food payments for pregnant women and small children to eat suitable food when relying solely on what the hotel provided. Among the cases in which the asylum seekers struggled to provide basics for their children owing to delays in support payments, the judge said one faced an existence \u201cwhich was in many ways wretched, particularly for a young child who went without on many occasions\u201d and in another suffered \u201cvery saddening circumstances\u201d where the parent was \u201creduced to asking in shops for leftover food\u201d and the children became \u201clethargic\u201d and \u201cvisibly thinner\u201d. In a third case involving an 82-year-old disabled woman who was unable to access accommodation and support in a timely way, the home secretary has been ordered to pay her compensation after accepting she had unlawfully failed in her legal duty to provide the woman with accommodation and support. Lawyers who represented the five asylum seekers welcomed the ruling. The associate solicitor at Leigh Day, John Crowley, who represented the three who challenged delays in support, said: \u201cThe court has found in no uncertain terms that the Home Office\u2019s current system for supporting asylum seekers is unlawful. \u201cIt is unacceptable that my clients, and so many others like them, had to go months and months without any form of support, forcing them into desperate and horrifying situations. It cannot be right that people legitimately seeking asylum are made to suffer such degrading treatment.\u201d Solicitors Sasha Rozansky and Ugo Hayter, from Deighton Pierce Glynn, representing the asylum seekers challenging the lack of financial support for pregnant asylum seekers and those with small children, said: \u201cThis is a victory for basic dignity and fundamental rights for people in hotels, which means that pregnant women and small children will get the additional payments which were unlawfully withheld from them.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are considering the court\u2019s findings and will respond in due course.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dfd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/shot-clock-and-red-card-review-system-to-be-used-in-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-games", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rugby World Cup warm-up matches to use shot clock and card review system", "lead": "The shot clock is intended to speed up conversions and penalty kicks, while Hawk-Eye technology and body cameras for referees are also in place", "author": "Ben Bloom", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 14:22:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679254", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e128ad0d31f819e8ac7cc3e1dfc75625c7fbd147/0_190_2799_1679/500.jpg", "body": "A shot clock to prevent time-wasting and a \u201cBunker\u201d review system for upgrading yellow cards to red are among innovations that will be in place for the upcoming Rugby World Cup warm-up matches this summer.

Gerwig\u2019s thoughtful track record as a film-maker suggested that she wouldn\u2019t take the gig unless she had something up her ruffled taffeta sleeve, leading many to theorize a meta element possibly sending Barbie into the real world, but nobody could have guessed the extent to which the director-co-writer has taken the concept and run with it. Even the trailers affirming that Barbie makes the interdimensional montage from her reality to ours with Ken in tow still conceal so much of the substance and atmosphere of a film with much more on its mind than the typical Hollywood product. Now that Gerwig\u2019s latest is out there painting multiplexes an eye-searing shade of pink, we can issue the strongest spoiler alert warning possible and pop Barbie\u2019s head off to see what\u2019s going on inside her cavernous neck hole. Read on for a discussion of the internal logic, the peppy pop politics, the cameos and everything else bundled with this shiny new cinematic playset: It\u2019s a Barbie world, with physics to match Following a Kubrick-aping prologue that introduces Barbie in the place of 2001: A Space Odyssey\u2019s monumental black obelisk, the film descends on Barbie Land, a soundstage fantasy of Dream Houses painted in hyper-saturated color. This realm is governed not by the laws of nature, but by the childlike illogic of playtime: Margot Robbie\u2019s Stereotypical Barbie drinks from an empty cup, bounces off of plastic water and floats from her top-floor bedroom down to her car on the street as if carried by an invisible hand. The chipper, blunt dialogue sounds like the internal monologue of an eight-year-old\u2019s imagination, declaring every day forever and ever to be the best day ever. When Ken (Ryan Gosling) hurts himself, Doctor Barbie heals him in the space of a single sentence. If Barbie and Ken were to kiss, one assumes they would do so by mashing their faces together at a diagonal. Every aspect of the first act\u2019s setting has been informed by the rituals and aesthetics of toys and their attendant media, harkening back to the brand-savvy of The Lego Movie. During an argument, Ken hurls Barbie\u2019s wardrobe out through the missing fourth wall of her home, and each outfit momentarily flattens into a display-fold with logo and caption while suspended in the air. An upbeat song by Lizzo delivers exposition like a commercial jingle, narrating each of Barbie\u2019s actions as she performs them. In this land of rictus smiles and relentless sunshine, imperfection is a cardinal sin; Barbie\u2019s existential crisis kicks into gear as she notices a small patch of cellulite on her thigh, and that her naturally high-heeled feet now stand flat on the ground. Horror of horrors \u2013 she\u2019s becoming a real woman. The big, bad patriarchy Her search for a cure directs her to the real world, where she\u2019s shocked to find that our Earth bears little resemblance to the estrogen-fueled paradise she left behind. As in their feminist Eden, Barbie and Ken came expecting a female president, female garbage-haulers, female Nobel laureates and a coterie of adoring, pliable men just grateful to share their presence. She\u2019s shattered to find that she isn\u2019t the inspirational role model she imagined herself to be, but he\u2019s delighted to discover a power structure that places him and his brethren on top, and carries this thrilling new ideology back to Barbie Land. Before you can say \u201cSimone de Beauvoir\u201d, he\u2019s instituted a full-blown patriarchy with all the once-empowered Barbies brainwashed into submissive, beer-serving pleasure slaves. With a little help from walking #NotAllMen counterpoint Allan (Michael Cera), Barbie must open her sisters\u2019 eyes to the reality that there\u2019s more middle ground to womanhood than being an accessory to a man or a flawless exemplar of femininity. The reactionary weirdoes decrying Barbie as peddling the \u201cwoke\u201d agenda haven\u2019t pulled much of a gotcha, accurately summarizing the textual substance of a film about one woman\u2019s sudden burst of institutional consciousness. Like a college freshman taking an intro class on gender \u2013 or perhaps like a high-schooler seeing a mass-market blockbuster with a developed political streak for the first time \u2013 Barbie becomes abruptly aware of the untenable societal pressures heaped upon womankind, released in a cathartic monologue by normal-person surrogate America Ferrera. She resolves the many contradictions of the male gaze by slicing through the Gordian knot, simply concluding that whatever women want is fine, so long as everyone lets them live their lives in peace. It\u2019s a pretty anodyne statement, though it accompanies an ending that effectively reduces men to pets. The steadfast refusal to coddle male ego may be the most unabashedly subversive notion in a project often conflicted about its opposing mandates as a critical work of art and a commercial good for sale. Stickin\u2019 it (kind of) to the suits Gerwig gets out in front of her decision to take a check from Mattel by centering her new corporate overlords in the film. Barbie and Ken\u2019s shenanigans in the real world draw the attention of the Mattel C-suite, portrayed as a conference table\u2019s worth of largely interchangeable men led by a CEO who requests to be called \u201cMother\u201d (Will Ferrell) and his CFO flunky (Jamie Demetriou). Being authority figures, they naturally assume the antagonist role as they race to get their star product back in her box, a literal display case binding her wrists and ankles positioned as metaphor for an attitude of silent compliance. Gerwig\u2019s revisionist outlook seeks to liberate the plastic and fantastic icon, allowing her a less orderly humanity in more than just a biological sense. Warhol\u2019s axiom about art being whatever you can get away with comes to mind in surprisingly off-brand moments such as the instant-classic punch line that ties a ribbon on the film. And yet for all the valid critique lodged by Gerwig \u2013 that this company marketing itself to little girls has entirely male management, that they profited for many years off of unattainable body standards, that they have hastily discontinued dolls like the pregnant Midge and the ambiguous Earring Magic Ken and anything else complicating their clean, hegemonic worldview \u2013 the film can\u2019t help its promotional origins in brand synergy. Ferrera\u2019s character pitches the CEO on a normal-person Barbie, a character unencumbered by the expectations to be an immaculately manicured beauty nor a successful career woman. Ferrell laughs this off as a non-starter until his CFO looks up from a calculator and suggests it would actually make them money, at which point the doll is put into immediate production. Gerwig\u2019s having a laugh at her own expense, conceding that all her subversions will be happily permitted so long as they agree with the profit margins. Everyone\u2019s invited to the party The first trailer revealed that Robbie-Barbie lives as one of many such Barbies populating Barbie Land, their rank a rainbow of demographic representation including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Sharon Rooney and Ana Cruz Kayne. (Featured soundtrack artist Dua Lipa even pops by as a trio of mermaid sisters to wobble her way through a few lines of dialogue, most of which are \u201cHi, Barbie!\u201d John Cena dons a wig of flowing blonde tresses as her Kenmaid counterpart.) Likewise, Gosling\u2019s Ken rolls with an entourage of backup Kens, though in keeping with the film\u2019s ladies-first doctrine, the second-stringer likes of Kingsley Ben-Adir and Ncuti Gatwa get slightly less to do than the ensemble Barbies. Odd man-boy out among the fellas is Cera\u2019s Allan, the less-macho Ken alternative initially marketed as a \u201cfriend\u201d and shown here to enjoy giving the guys foot massages. Perhaps he\u2019d get along with the briefly glimpsed Sugar Daddy Ken, played by a sporting Rob Brydon. Other casting choices hint at Gerwig\u2019s personal tastes seeping into the fabric of her film-making; the narration courtesy of Helen Mirren suggests a connected cinematic universe linking Barbie and the cult comedy series Documentary Now!. Barbie creator and Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler appears with a deified glow about her in the form of Rhea Perlman, the actor\u2019s presence a possible nod to her past gig on Cheers as sharp-tongued barmaid Carla Tortelli, the kind of flinty, funny, unapologetic woman that speaks to Gerwig. In one of the film\u2019s most unexpectedly poignant moments, Barbie shares a brief chat with an anonymous woman on a sidewalk bench, informing her that she\u2019s beautiful only for her to respond: \u201cI know.\u201d That woman is Ann Roth, legendary costume designer and frequent collaborator of Gerwig\u2019s husband and co-writer Noah Baumbach, her celebrated body of work across more than 50 years in the industry undoubtedly a point of admiration for the director. She\u2019s living proof that no dividing line separates fashion from high art, one of the guiding principles for the film\u2019s sartorial euphoria. The library of influences It\u2019s not hard to imagine the dead-souled version of Barbie that alienates its built-in fanbase with lowest-common-denominator laziness and creative indifference, more advertisement than entertainment. Gerwig has endeared herself to moviegoers in part for the care she\u2019s put into the making of her grand entr\u00e9e to the budgetary big leagues, much of it informed by her encyclopedia passion for cinema at large. She\u2019s spoken in interviews about the many Technicolor marvels of the past that contributed to the vivid palette of Barbie\u2019s blissfully non-real homeworld, everything from Golden Age musicals like The Wizard of Oz and Singin\u2019 in the Rain to transatlantic imports like The Red Shoes and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Her penchant for macro-scaled sight gags can be traced back to the oeuvres of Jacques Tati and Charlie Chaplin before him, masters of physical comedy relevant to actors mimicking the body language of posable playthings. Other reference points work on the conceptual level; Barbie\u2019s revelatory sight through her artificial status quo nods to The Matrix, The Truman Show, and the rest of the entries from the Onscreen Existentialism for Dummies canon. Every piece of the film speaks to some facet of Gerwig\u2019s cinephilia, a magpie collage of favorites befitting the doodling and locker-adorning of adolescent girls. A disco number nicks fashions from Saturday Night Fever, while the kooky absurdist humor has roots in Pee-Wee\u2019s Big Adventure. Eclectic as these picks may be, they\u2019re all organized under a single, fully formed sensibility. Mattel may have stamped their logo all over the film, but audiences have taken note and flocked in droves because in the auteurist sense, Gerwig has made it her own as well."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604dff", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/24/grayson-perry-smash-hits-review-english-self-mockery-without-insight-or-depth", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Grayson Perry: Smash Hits review \u2013 English self-mockery without insight or depth", "lead": "This is a show stuffed with clutter and haunted by Perry\u2019s teddy bear, with works that are too flip to land any satirical punches<br>", "author": "Jonathan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 14:09:29", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679292", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bb04dab86d1054c2efc309e426e8ab7087634865/0_140_3330_1999/500.jpg", "body": "Just once in his retrospective at the Royal Scottish Academy, Grayson Perry seems to speak from the heart. In his nearly three-metre-long woodcut print Reclining Artist, he stretches out nude on the sofa, with long fingernails against a slender thigh, his penis dangling over saggy balls, and plump female breasts. It is a synthesis of who he is and who he dreams of being: \u201ca fantasy version of myself, neither fully male nor fully female\u201d, as he notes in the caption. Yet if it is a fantasy, this 2017 vision is also the most authentic work of art in this entire assembly of Perry\u2019s \u201cSmash Hits\u201d. Here he is, he can be no other. He looks you dead in the eye, serious and for once not breaking out into the blokey laugh that\u2019s familiar to watchers of his TV shows. Perry is a manifestly talented artist who can draw detailed, precise, complex images. But his love of clutter wrecks almost every work in this exhibition. Even in Reclining Artist, there is a manic array of symbolic objects, including his childhood teddy bear Alan Measles. Wandering around the show, I started to feel sorry for poor Alan. Perry, as you can learn from his lengthy texts appended to every exhibit, constructed a private imaginary universe around this teddy when he was an unhappy child in 1960s Essex. It inhabits his art, like felt and fat haunt the sculptures of Josef Beuys \u2013 a mythological presence, whether in a recent bronze called Alan Healing the Wound in which he cradles Perry\u2019s \u201cinner child\u201d, or posing as a knight, or being transported in a glass carriage on the back of Perry\u2019s motorbike. Measles, who was given to Perry in the year he was born, is 63 now and surely deserves a rest. Or at least, some privacy. This particular childhood icon is so overshared in Perry\u2019s art \u2013 here he comes again, driving a racing car across a wasteland \u2013 that his symbolic power has long since evaporated. But then Perry doesn\u2019t present his obsession with Alan Measles as a serious monomania. It is more like a self-conscious parody of one. Measles is a jokey, intensity-free totem in the endlessly ironic and embarrassed apology for an artist\u2019s inner life that blares at you from all these pots, prints and tapestries. It is all very English \u2013 as Perry is so painfully aware. One wall here features a collection of objects that people gave him as he toured England in his recent Channel 4 series Grayson Perry\u2019s Full English. The random haul doesn\u2019t communicate much about England, although I found a football fan\u2019s flag bearing his late friend\u2019s name moving. Scots may enjoy Perry\u2019s own meditation on his national identity, a brown and yellow plate that parodies the clumsiness of early English slipware ceramics, decorated with a pair of gloves and the words \u201cEnglish Wanker\u201d. That apart, no explanation is offered for why an exhibition obsessed with Englishness is in the Scottish capital, or what Perry thinks makes England different from the other countries of the UK. Then again, clarity is not his forte \u2013 throwing out \u201cironic\u201d cliches is. Comfort Blanket is a tapestry that names the things he associates with a good, inclusive \u2013 as opposed to a narrow, Brexity \u2013 Englishness: fish and chips, The Archers, Eric and Ernie, a nice cuppa . All of which a Brexiter might like, too. As analyses of national identity go, it is not exactly George Orwell. I used to think Perry was a very clever man who wasn\u2019t much of an artist: great at curating and commenting, not so good at making pots. His increasingly scattergun outpourings on English identity are, however, making me wonder about the cleverness. There is no insight to his recitals of English attributes. The Vanity of Small Differences updates Hogarth\u2019s pictorial narrative The Rake\u2019s Progress to the 21st century with vague, random references to technology and social media: Hogarth\u2019s Tom Rakewell is now a tech billionaire (wow!) who dies in a road crash. But the busy, overelaborate tapestry scenes don\u2019t land any satirical punches: they just get lost in whimsy and empty quotation. Other artists, such as David Hockney and Yinka Shonibare, have done much better modern versions of The Rake\u2019s Progress. Perry does understand the English middle class, though. He has become popular, famous and beloved by sharing its ambivalence towards art. There is a national prejudice against people who \u201ctake themselves too seriously\u201d, especially artists. This exhibition is full of artworks that appeal to that suspicion by being flip. Perry constantly denies that he takes art seriously at all. He parodies modernism and even African religious art in pseudo-fetish sculptures he made for a show at the British Museum. It\u2019s not offensive, just pointless: how silly that anyone should believe art can be salvational or possess magic powers! Any hint of romance has to be undermined by a joke. And yet, there is not much hilarity here. It\u2019s all too bitter and twisted and \u2026 English. Perry has chosen to be a certain kind of middle-class entertainer, throwing away his talent on the vanity of small amusements. The lack of passion and courage in so many of these works is depressing. Quoting and mocking, in an art that relentlessly avoids poetry or depth, he is the philistine\u2019s Blake, the idiot\u2019s intellectual and the artist modern Britain has chosen for its own.

When we reach the denouement, the eponymous heroine \u2013 the mortal mistress of Jove, fatally tricked into demanding he cast off his human disguise and reveal himself in his full, cataclysmic divinity \u2013 is immured in a massive wicker effigy of her rival Juno, which goes up in flames as the chorus look on. It\u2019s a striking coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre in an otherwise somewhat lacklustre staging and a dour take on what is essentially a barbed Restoration comedy. Handel took as his text a libretto by William Congreve, previously set by John Eccles, about the relationship between desire, ambition and opportunism. Thomas, however, is thinking more in terms of emotional and sexual rebellion, and her Thebes becomes an anonymous modern landscape (it looks like scrubland), where Jo\u00e9lle Harvey\u2019s Semele, already pregnant by Stuart Jackson\u2019s Jove, longs to escape from both the prurient mockery of the community around her and the arranged marriage that her father Cadmus (Clive Bayley) is trying to force her into with Aryeh Nussbaum Cohen\u2019s Athamas. Mount Cithaeron, where Jove instals her as his mistress with her sister Ino (Stephanie Wake-Edwards) for company, is a bit more lush than Thebes (the grass is longer), albeit hardly, in this instance, the Arcadia evoked in both text and score. We soon, however, begin to understand the ennui that makes Semele an easy prey for the machinations of Juno (Jennifer Johnston) and Iris (male soprano Samuel Mari\u00f1o), though why the former is got up in what appears to be a traditional costume for Turandot, in an otherwise modern-dress production, is anyone\u2019s guess. The real problem here, however, is Thomas\u2019s frequent misjudgment of the work\u2019s tone: much of this is neither funny nor erotic, and until the mood sours in the final act it ideally needs to be both. Harvey, however, is impressive in the title role, pushed a bit perhaps in the coloratura of No, no, I\u2019ll take no less, though O sleep, why dost thou leave me is ravishing. Jackson\u2019s Jove, more calculating, less overtly besotted than some, sings Where\u2019er you walk with almost considered seductiveness. Both mezzos are outstanding, with Johnston\u2019s formidable hauteur superbly contrasted with Wake-Edwards\u2019s passionate intensity. Nussbaum Cohen sounds astonishingly beautiful as Athamas, though Mari\u00f1o disappoints, his voice too small for the venue. In the pit, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment play with impeccable style for V\u00e1clav Luks, though his conducting seems overly urgent at times, robbing the scene where Semele and Ino listen to the music of the spheres, for instance, of its sublimity. The choral singing, as one might expect, is sensational. \u2022 At Glyndebourne, East Sussex, until 26 August."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e01", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-516-of-the-invasion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 516 of the invasion", "lead": "Drones damage buildings in Moscow city centre; Russia attacks Odesa again, destroying a grain depot and injuring four port employees", "author": "Martin Belam, Guardian staff and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:54:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679332", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4fd1efd3cdc651a3dddb5713a424a6e0985297/0_433_6564_3938/500.jpg", "body": "Russia reserves the right to take \u201ctough retaliatory measures\u201d, the foreign ministry said on Monday, after it accused Ukraine of attacking Moscow and the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula with drones.

Officials said the drones hit non-residential buildings in the capital and that there were no casualties. The attack came one day after Kyiv vowed to \u201cretaliate\u201d for a Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa. \u201cA Kyiv regime attempt to carry out a terrorist act using two drones on objects on the territory of the city of Moscow was stopped,\u201d Russia\u2019s defence ministry said. \u201cTwo Ukrainian drones were suppressed and crashed. There are no casualties.\u201d Russian media reported a third drone crashed into a cemetery in the Moscow region. An ammunition depot was struck during a Ukrainian drone attack on Dzhankoi in Crimea early on Monday, with Russian air defence forces intercepting or suppressing 11 drones over the area, a Russian-installed official has said. Interfax reports train traffic in Crimea has begun moving again after a delay caused by the earlier drone attacks. The Russian Federation unilaterally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine claims to have recaptured a small amount of territory in the Bakhmut region, according to the latest operational briefing by the deputy defence minister. Tass reports that one civilian has been killed, and another injured, by Ukrainian shelling into occupied Kherson on the left-bank of the Dniepr River. The Kremlin on Monday accused Kyiv of carrying out a \u201cdeliberate attack on journalists\u201d in Ukraine\u2019s south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region after a reporter for the Russian state news agency RIA was killed. The war correspondent Rostislav Zhuravlev was killed in a Ukrainian cluster munition strike, according to RIA. He died from his wounds during an evacuation. Yevgeny Balitsky, head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, has posted to Telegram to claim that Ukraine is not actively attacking across the frontline in the region, and that \u201ctheir command is actively carrying out the delivery of personnel to positions, making up for losses.\u201d Russia attacked the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Odesa again and kept up a barrage that has damaged critical port infrastructure in southern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said. At least one person was killed and 22 wounded in the strike early on Sunday. An overnight drone attack then destroyed a grains depot and injured four port employees. The city has come under repeated attack since Moscow last week pulled out of a deal allowing the export of Ukrainian grain. Four children were among the wounded in the Odesa blasts, which severely damaged the historic Transfiguration Cathedral, a landmark Orthodox cathedral in the city, said Odesa\u2019s regional governor, Oleh Kiper. The cathedral\u2019s archdeacon, Andrii Palchuk, rued the \u201cenormous\u201d destruction of the church, which he said was caused by a direct hit from a Russian missile. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said that while Ukraine has recaptured about half the territory that Russia initially seized in its invasion, Kyiv faces \u201ca very hard fight\u201d to win back more. Russia\u2019s industry minister, Denis Manturov, said on Monday that the defence industry was producing more munitions a month than it did in the whole of 2022. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, said Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive \u201chas failed\u201d as he hosted Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, his close ally, for talks in St Petersburg. \u201cThere is no counteroffensive,\u201d Russian news agencies quoted Lukashenko as saying on Sunday, to which Putin replied: \u201cIt exists, but it has failed.\u201d Ukraine began its long-anticipated counteroffensive last month but has so far made only small gains. Lukashenko claimed Minsk was \u201ccontrolling\u201d the situation with fighters from the Wagner mercenary group and restricting them to staying in the centre of the country. Belarus is hosting Wagner fighters on its territory after brokering a deal after Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin ended a short-lived uprising last month in exchange for safe passage to exile in Belarus. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Kyiv and Warsaw will \u201calways stand united\u201d after Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko accused Poland of having territorial ambitions. \u201cPutin\u2019s attempts to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Warsaw are as futile as his failing invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Kuleba wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cUnlike Russia, Poland and Ukraine have learned from history and will always stand united against Russian imperialism and disrespect for international law.\u201d Ukraine alleged Russia shelled a cultural centre in the Donetsk region with cluster munitions on Sunday morning. The defence ministry said the centre in Chasiv Yar housed the \u201chumanitarian headquarters\u201d and was used as an aid distribution point for civilians. A meeting of a new Nato-Ukraine Council, expected to address Black Sea security, has been scheduled for Wednesday, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday.

The attacks, using Iranian-supplied drones, follow Russia\u2019s withdrawal this month from the Black Sea deal that allowed Ukraine to export its grain and threats by both Moscow and Kyiv to target civilian carriers visiting ports. Ukrainian officials said 15 Shahed-136 drones were launched against warehouses on the Danube River overnight and six people had been wounded on Monday. \u201cRussia hit another Ukrainian grain storage overnight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, wrote on Twitter, without identifying the location of the target. \u201cIt [Russia] tries to extract concessions by holding 400 million people hostage. I urge all nations, particularly those in Africa and Asia who are most affected by rising food prices, to mount a united global response to food terrorism.\u201d Commenting on the attacks, the governor of Ukraine\u2019s Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, told Ukrainian television: \u201cRussia is trying to fully block the export of our grain and make the world starve.\u201d The drone attacks follow a rise in Russian strikes on infrastructure associated with Ukrainian grain exports in the last week. There have been daily attacks since Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea deal, including on the key port facilities in Odesa, which had been central to the agreement. Video posted on social media showed large explosions in Reni port, which is about 3 miles (5km) from the border with Romania, a Nato member. \u201cWarehouses where grain crops were stored were destroyed, tanks for storing other types of cargo were damaged. There was a fire in one of the production premises, which was promptly extinguished,\u201d local police said. The grain deal, which required ships bound for Ukraine\u2019s ports to be inspected before docking, had permitted the safe shipment of grain from southern Ukraine after Russia ships had blockaded the ports, triggering global food crisis. Reni is situated by Lake Cahul, a few miles inland on the Danube, which has become the main shipping route for the export of grain from Ukraine since the collapse of the Black Sea deal on 17 July. The Danube has grown in importance during the Ukraine conflict but at best can only replace 50% of Odesa port\u2019s capacity, not least because of the shallower waterway. Moscow has increasingly tried to justify its departure from the Black Sea grain deal, claiming it had found remnants of explosives onboard a bulk carrier crossing the Black Sea, which had made a stop at a Ukrainian river port earlier this year. \u201cOn 22 July, in the hold of a foreign dry cargo ship en route from Turkey to the port of Rostov-on-Don to load grain crops, traces of explosives \u2013 dinitrotoluene and tetryl \u2013 were found,\u201d the FSB said on Monday. It alleged the ship had visited the Ukrainian river port of Kiliya, on the Danube. Apparently conscious of the profound impact of rising food prices in the developing world, Moscow has attempted to deflect blame, with Russia\u2019s ambassador to Kenya, Dmitry Maksimychev, writing an editorial for two of Kenya\u2019s largest newspapers blaming the US and EU for \u201cweaponising food\u201d. The Russian attempts to hinder export via the Danube route would leave only EU-backed \u201csolidarity lanes\u201d for grain export, rail and road transit through Moldova."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e03", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/rhodes-fires-britons-stranded-greece-island", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rhodes wildfires: up to 10,000 Britons stranded on Greek island", "lead": "No 10 says travel advice for the island may change, as Greece undertakes largest-ever evacuation effort", "author": "Ben Quinn and Kevin Rawlinson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:49:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679369", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/80193ff72caa7260809f72dcf97ffe5df4c51924/0_0_2808_1685/500.jpg", "body": "Up to 10,000 British tourists are stranded on the wildfire-stricken Greek island of Rhodes, according to the UK government, as a spokesperson said it was possible official travel advice would change.

Andrew Mitchell also said evacuations were not taking place on Corfu, parts of which were also ablaze, as had been reported. He said this was because the fires there were not affecting tourist areas.

The government was facing calls on Monday to change its stance on the categorisation of Rhodes, to enable tourists to get a refund for their trips under their travel insurance. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said she was also in favour of moving to advise against travel to Rhodes, but added that she understood why the government was reluctant. \u201cThe reality of the government\u2019s position is in line with our allies in Europe, because no one wants to compromise Greece\u2019s heavily tourism-dependent economy at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, we need companies to step up and recognise that people will not be able to have the holiday that was booked for them. I know there is a statutory duty for the government to get British citizens home if they are in trouble, but travel companies have to live up to their obligations rather than making profits from flights carrying tourists out, and then stepping away and letting the government sort out how to get them home in some cases.\u201d The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, said that Rhodes should immediately be added to the \u201cred list\u201d of places to which the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel. \u201cMany families are unable to make a claim against their insurance \u2013 leaving them paying the penalty for deciding not to fly out to the island,\u201d said the MP. On Sunday, Greece undertook its largest ever evacuation effort, moving 19,000 people \u2013 primarily tourists \u2013 from villages and resorts on Rhodes as wildfires fanned by high-speed winds raged for a sixth day. The British prime minister\u2019s spokesperson told reporters shortly before lunchtime on Monday: \u201cOur advice is focused on the safety of British nationals and enabling people to make an informed decision about the situation on the ground.\u201d \u201cThe current situation is impacting on a limited area in Rhodes and whilst it\u2019s right to keep it under review and it\u2019s possible that the advice may change, we do not want to act out of proportion to the situation on the ground.\u201d He said there are \u201cnot currently\u201d plans to get the RAF to help people leave. On Sunday, travel firms and airlines were being encouraged to reimburse passengers who had decided not to fly to Rhodes. Mitchell put his \u201cbest estimate\u201d of the number of British tourist on Rhodes at between 7,000 and 10,000. When asked if the government was officially advising against more people travelling there on Monday, Mitchell said holidaymakers should contact their tour operator. \u201cThere were only 10 free beds on the whole island when I asked yesterday. But we think something like 1,000 beds may well come back on stream today as others don\u2019t now come and therefore more beds are available,\u201d he told Times Radio. Mitchell said the government was not advising against travel to Rhodes because \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that only 10% of the island is affected by these fires, and therefore it is the tourist companies and the holiday experts who are best placed to give guidance on whether or not a family or individuals\u2019 holidays are going to be ruined by these events.\u201d Asked if he would personally go on holiday there at the moment, he said: \u201cI think I probably wouldn\u2019t. But the point is that if I had booked a holiday I would take advice and would take advice also from the tour operator.\u201d On Sunday night, local authorities ordered the evacuation of five small settlements on Corfu. However, Mitchell told BBC Breakfast on Monday morning: \u201cThe information I had one minute before this interview started is that there are not any evacuations from Corfu, there had been movement of people overnight within Corfu but this morning they have been sent back to their earlier accommodation. So I hope the situation is a little better and more stable than your reports suggests.\u201d Earlier Mitchell had told Sky News he was not sure how many UK citizens were on Corfu, adding: \u201cThe position on Corfu is very different. The fires are not taking place in residential areas or holiday areas.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e04", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/24/reverse-cowgirl-the-worlds-most-dangerous-sexual-position", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Reverse cowgirl: the world\u2019s most dangerous sexual position", "lead": "Want to avoid a penile fracture or an \u2018aubergine\u2019 deformity?

Age: Anybody\u2019s guess. Appearance: Like two people trying to elicit the answer \u201cTetris\u201d in a round of nude charades. So it\u2019s some type of adult game? Sort of. It\u2019s a sexual position. What kind of sexual position? The world\u2019s most dangerous sexual position, according to various reports. Describe it to me, so I don\u2019t end up doing it by accident. The man lies on his back with the woman sitting on top, facing away from him. Oh, that. I\u2019ve also heard it called: \u201cOK, but I\u2019m not missing The Bear for this.\u201d Evocative, but reverse cowgirl is shorter. I would have thought the most dangerous position involved the risk of falling out of a window or driving off a bridge. Nope. It\u2019s reverse cowgirl. But how can that mildly exotic arrangement possibly be dangerous for women? It\u2019s not. The reverse cowgirl is most perilous for the penetrating sexual partner, who is at risk of penile fracture. I don\u2019t want to talk about this any more. According to a viral TikTok video by Dr Karan Raj, the position was responsible for up to 50% of bedroom-related broken penises. I think I made it clear I was no longer interested in the subject. If the thrusting of the two sexual partners gets even a little out of sync, says Raj, it can lead to the male member slipping out and \u201cbeing crushed by the female pubic bone.\u201d I\u2019m just going to sit down for a minute. Of course, the human penis doesn\u2019t have any bones in it, so when we speak of a penile fracture we are really talking about a tear in the rubbery sheath of tissue known as the tunica albuginea. That doesn\u2019t make it any better. No, it doesn\u2019t. According to a 2021 study, such forcible bending of the erect penis can lead \u201cto haematoma formation and classical \u2018aubergine\u2019 deformity\u201d. My vision is going white at the edges. Are there no safe positions that would enable someone to have intercourse and watch television at the same time? Apparently not. A 2017 study from the International Journal of Impotence Research named doggy style as the most dangerous position, accounting for 41% of penile fracture cases. I guess it\u2019s missionary or nothing. The missionary position came second, with 26%. Have you got any advice for practising safer sex? Turn off the TV and concentrate on what you are doing. Do say: \u201cReverse cowgirls are for circuses.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHonestly, if we\u2019re going to do it this way, I think we should pull over.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e05", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/trevor-francis-dies-aged-69-nottingham-forest-england-1m-footballer", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Trevor Francis, Britain\u2019s first \u00a31m footballer, dies aged 69", "lead": "The former England forward Trevor Francis, who was the first player to be transferred in Britain for \u00a31m, has died at the age of 69", "author": "Ben Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:32:52", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679405", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/13b0dcb242932eac724514d6e8e42e7cadc8a15a/920_444_3839_2304/500.jpg", "body": "Tributes have been paid from across football to the former England forward Trevor Francis, Britain\u2019s first \u00a31m player and the scorer of a European Cup-winning goal for Nottingham Forest, after he died at the age of 69. Birmingham City, the club where Francis began his professional career and spent 15 years as a player and later a manager, described him as \u201cthe player everyone wanted to see\u201d. Forest called Francis a \u201ctrue legend who will never be forgotten\u201d. A statement on behalf of the Francis family said he had had a heart attack at home in Marbella on Monday morning. Francis, who went into management initially as a player\u2011manager, also had a base in Solihull. The statement on behalf of the family said: \u201cThis has come as a huge shock to everybody. We are all very upset. He was a legendary footballer but he was also an extremely nice person.\u201d John McGovern, who captained Forest to the European Cup on two occasions, said Francis was \u201cnot big-headed, despite his price tag\u201d. McGovern added: \u201cHe was one of the quickest players I have ever played with, he was in a different class. He was not an outspoken character. But if something needed to be said, he would say it. He would always speak up if he felt it was right.\u201d Peter Shilton, who played with Francis for Forest and England, described Francis as \u201ca wonderful gentleman\u201d and Gary Lineker, a former England teammate, said: \u201c[It]was a pleasure to work alongside him both on the pitch and on the telly.\u201d Chris Waddle, signed by Francis for Sheffield Wednesday, said: \u201cSo sorry to hear the sad news \u2026 he was a lovely man, such a great player and thank you so much for bringing me to SWFC.\u201d Nottingham Forest paid \u00a31.18m \u2013 more than double the previous British transfer record \u2013 to buy Francis from Birmingham in February 1979 but the Forest manager, Brian Clough, claimed the fee was \u00a3999,999 to take pressure off the player. \u201cWhen I get on the pitch, I just have to forget about it and get on with playing,\u201d Francis said at his unveiling. His goal against Malm\u00f6 secured the European Cup in his first season and he was part of the squad that retained the trophy a year later, although he was injured for the final. Born in Plymouth, Francis joined Birmingham as a 15-year-old and became the club\u2019s youngest debutant in 1970 aged 16 \u2013 a record eclipsed by the now Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham in August 2019. Francis, whose playing career took him to the US with Detroit Express, joined Manchester City from Forest. More than 10,000 City supporters travelled to Stoke City to witness him score twice on his debut in September 1981. Francis played in Italy for Sampdoria and Atalanta, then for Rangers before joining QPR, where he spent less than a year as a player before becoming player-manager. He had a stint as player-manager at Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 after a period there as a player \u2013 before he took full-time manager roles with Wednesday, Birmingham and Crystal Palace. He led Wednesday to an FA Cup and League Cup final, and Birmingham to a League Cup final. Nigel Pearson, the Bristol City manager who played with Francis at Wednesday, said: \u201cI still reference him when talking to players, with his mid-stride toe-poke finish. I played with him when he was 37 but he was still a class performer.\u201d Francis scored 119 goals in 280 league appearances for Birmingham before his historic move to Forest. He played 52 times for England from 1977 to 1986, featuring at the 1982 World Cup, where he scored twice. He retired in 1994, shortly before his 40th birthday, having made 632 appearances and scored 235 goals. He later worked as a pundit for Sky Sports and BT Sport. Birmingham\u2019s biggest rivals, Aston Villa, described Francis as \u201ca true legend of the game, especially in the Midlands but also across the football world\u201d. Chris Kamara, who worked with Francis at Sky, said: \u201cRIP Trevor the first [one] million-pound player who always looked a million dollars.\u201d The Football Association said it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d and would commemorate his career at an England fixture. Birmingham have opened a designated area at St Andrew\u2019s for tributes to be placed."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e06", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jul/24/brazil-v-panama-womens-world-cup-2023-live", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Brazil 4-0 Panama: Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Ary Borges scores hat-trick in utterly dominant Brazilian performance against debutants Panama", "author": "Sarah Rendell", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:29:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679423", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/33d3621cde8d326457ff6a79b24d44b77c2077dd/0_160_2285_1371/500.jpg", "body": "Well thank you for joining me for this match. Brazilian football always promises some magic and they definitely produced it, especially Ary Borges who scored a hat-trick on her World Cup debut. We will be back with more live coverage of the tournament tomorrow, for now you can recap the action: This feature is worth a read: This game sees the end of the first round of group games! You can click here to see where you team sits in the group tables. The second round of group matches gets underway tomorrow. Brazil\u2019s coach Pia Sundhage told ITV: \u201cWe\u2019re happy, it is the first game. It is always difficult. Four goals and we played quite well. Ary is happy scoring a hat-trick.\u201d There have been two other games today, here is a recap of the action from those: This goal is already getting shouts for goal of the tournament, what do you think? (The clip is from ITV so not everyone may have access): Ary Borges now sits on top of the Golden Boot race, overtaking the US\u2019 Sophia Smith. Brazil run riot as they give Panama a welcome to the World Cup in a 4-0 thrashing. Panama showed glimpses of brilliance but they did not have enough time on the ball to really put a good attack together. Ary Borges shines but Brazil have top class players throughout. 90 + 9 min: Brazil continue to push for a fifth, the team do not even look like they have dropped their fitness levels. 90 + 7 min: Another powerful shot from Brazil, they are looking so strong and slick today. 90 + 5 min: Tanner has a great chance and forces Leticia to make a save! She has had a great impact on this Panama side. They keep coming and they win their first corner of the game, Castillo takes the set piece but Tanner\u2019s resulting chance is over the bar. 90 + 4 min: Marta takes the free kick but it is straight at Bailey who collects. 90 + 3 min: Brazil win a free kick on the edge of the area as Natis fouls Nunes. Pinzon takes a long time getting to her feet as she is challenged before the set piece is taken but she is okay to continue. 90 + 1 min: There will be nine added minutes as Brazil line-up for another corner. They take it short but it eventually comes in and Tanner clears. 90 min: Brazil win a corner and Marta will ping it in. It\u2019s a good delivery but none of her teammates can collect it. 89 min: Duda takes it and it is a beautiful delivery but Natis heads out for a corner. It\u2019s in and Geyse tries a bicycle kick but it doesn\u2019t come off. 88 min: The pace has slowed in these closing stages but the job is done here. Geyse draws a foul and Brazil have a free kick. 86 min: Duda gives away the ball but Brazil are able to recover, Panama have a shot though through Cedeno but it\u2019s blocked. Panama win a free kick in a great spot, Castillo will take it. It\u2019s in but it\u2019s headed away. 84 min: Adriana pops it into the box but it is over the head over everyone. Panama make another change as Montenegro comes on for Vargas. 82 min: Duda passes to Nunes, who takes a beautiful touch but she lays it off. Nunez is then taken down in the box by Vargas, Brazil appeal for a penalty but nothing is given. Another Brazil chance as Geyse puts it just wide. They are absolutely relentless. 80 min: Panama make a change as Cox is off for Cedeno. Tamires attempts an ambitious pass but it is out of play. 78 min: Lovely bit of build-up play but Kerolin attempts a long range effort which is way wide. Panama\u2019s Cox battles well to get the side a chance but Castillo\u2019s shot is over the bar. 76 min: Brazil make two changes with Ary Borges and Luana off for Marta and Duda Sampaio. Marta is on for her SIXTH World Cup. 75 min: The crowd go wild as Marta gets ready to come on \u2013 4-0 up and able to bring on Marta, incredible. Gonzalez is down with an injury, she looks in a bit of pain but she is quickly back to her feet. 74 min: Pinzon is fouled and Brazil are able to clear. Kerolin fires another shot but it is blocked. Panama\u2019s game has been brighter in this second half but Brazil\u2019s brilliance is stamping it out. 72 min: Ary Borges is the first Brazilian player to score a hat-trick on their World Cup debut! That\u2019s the hat-trick! Geyse crosses a lovely ball in and Ary Borges heads home. 70 min: Tamires crosses in but Bailey clears. Geyse has a loose pass which gifts Panama the ball but then Tanner loses out. 68 min: Kerolin is so close to adding Brazil\u2019s fourth! She makes a great run, takes a touch around a defender but her shot is wide. 66 min: Quintero has been taken off as a concussion sub. Brazil have a corner and it comes to Rafaelle and Bailey saves! 66 min: Natis clearly shoves a Brazilian player there but no foul and Panama are off on an attack. Tanner finds herself in a one-on-one with Leticia but the keeper comes out to make contact. She does enough to quell the threat and after a VAR check is cleared for a potential dangerous tackle. 64 min: Luana is quickly back to her feet but Quintero needs more attention. I think she is okay to continue also, great news. The play is back underway. 62 min: Geyse makes a great first touch and run to get Brazil into the box but Bruninha\u2019s shot is way over the bar. A nasty clash of heads here between Quintero and Luana. A break in play as they receive treatment. 60 min: Panama get in a great position and Baltrip-Reyes rallies off a shot, it\u2019s on target but Leticia collects. Brazil make a triple change with Geyse, Nunez and Bruninha are on for Debinha, Zaneratto and Antonia off. 58 min: Adriana heads wide and then a loose pass from Pinzon almost sees Brazil pounce but the shot it wide. 56 min: Brazil continue to pull all the strings. In other news, water is wet. 54 min: Tamires is a constant threat, she gets it into the box again but it just skims her teammates. Kerolin gets a great chip over the top but Zaneratto\u2019s shot is wide. Panama make two changes with Riley and Mills off for Tanner and Cedeno. 52 min: The corner is played short but booted in, Panama manage to head away. 52 min: The only criticism of Brazil\u2019s game in the first half was that they could have scored more and they seem to have taken the message onboard. Brazil have a corner, it comes in and Box sees it out for another corner. 50 min: Brazil so calm and collected in front of goal, a frantic Panama defence just allows their opposition to take their time and convert. Tamires gets a cross in and it comes to Ary Borges, she lays it off to Zaneratto who smashes it home. 47 min: Brazil start the second half just as they first, completely dominant. The second 45 minutes is underway! Panama have made a change with Jaen off for Natis. Brace for more goals \u2026 Will Brazil just keep scoring in this? And will Marta get on for some of the action? Let me know your thoughts. Here is the report from Germany Morocco played earlier today: Apologies for that scattered end to the first half, my TV\u2019s signal went poof! But I have the stream on and I will be all over it in the second half. Panama kept Brazil at bay until the 19th minute when Ary Borges struck and while the goals have not flooded in, Ary Borges cemented the team\u2019s momentum with a second before the break. Will this become the biggest loss at the tournament so far? That stands at 6-0 from the earlier game between Germany and Morocco. 45 min: My TV is in and out right now, I\u2019m switching to ITVX for the second half! But Brazil are still on top on this encounter \u2013 Bailey thwarting another chance before half-time. 44 min: Panama win a free kick inside their own half so they will have to build from deep but the chance is quickly closed down. 42 min: Bailey gets her team out of danger, the keeper is having a good game so far. Kari has got in touch and said: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Brazilian profligacy, they would be four or five up. After being pleasantly surprised by the evenness of the contests so far, this match and Germany\u2019s 6-0 victory feels like a resetting of expectations.\u201d I think the goals will just keep coming in this one, Brazil not taking their foot of the gas one bit. It\u2019s Ary Borges again! She hits it in after a pinpoint cross. 38 min: It\u2019s pinged in but Panama again read it well, the set pieces aren\u2019t quite coming off for Brazil yet. It is not long until Brazil are back on the front foot and it just sails over the head of Ary Borges. 36 min: Brazil have a free kick in another good position, Tamires is over the ball and it comes to Debinha who tries a bicycle kick. It comes back out but Brazil cannot convert, it is out for a corner though. 34 min: Leticia, the Brazilian keeper, has touched the ball twice so far this game. Debinha took a knock but she looks okay to continue \u2013 she has been such a threat so far. 32 min: My TV has decided to not pick up a signal so bare with as I deal with technical difficulties! I am back up and running! Brazil have a corner and they take it short again bit Panama have the read of these set pieces and deal with it well. 30 min: A pass to Antonia is out of play and Panama can relieve some pressure for a few seconds. Brazil immediately get the ball back but they\u2019re shot is off target. Panama need to be more concise and get closer to Brazil, they need to smother the attack. 28 min: Bailey concedes a corner and Ary Borges takes it. They take it short again but Quintero does really well to shepherd it out of play for a goal kick. 26 min: The Panama goal is being peppered with chances, how it is still 1-0 I do not know. Brazil can stretch the ball from one end to the other in a matter of seconds, it will be a long afternoon for the debutants. 24 min: Debinha is tackled on the edge of the area but it is clean challenge, Brazil\u2019s ball recovery is currently seven seconds. What a stat! 23 min: Now will this just set the scoring underway or can Panama find a way into this game? Their first goal should be to keep the ball longer than a few passes, Brazil are making it impossible for them at the moment. Another shot comes in from Ary Borges but Bailey does well to handle it. 21 min: I think that is the sixth or seventh goal consecutively scored with a header at this World Cup. It was coming and there it is. So much space and Ary Borges hits it home. 18 min: Debinha takes the free kick, Panama commit six to the wall, but it\u2019s wide. 17 min: Ary Borges takes the corner short but it eventually gets popped into the box but it has too much on it. Brazil now win a free kick on the edge of the box, this could be the opener here. 16 min: Brazil are definitely the team in control but they aren\u2019t being as clinical as they would want, some loose passes and misplaced shots. The crowd come to life as Panama look to break but Brazil close them down quickly. Adriana makes a great run and cross but her teammates can\u2019t leap to convert but they do win a corner. 14 min: Cox looked in a bit of trouble there after a tackle but she is okay to continue. Brazil are still in full control and Debinha almost gets on the end of a good ball in the box. 12 min: Debinha makes a great run but doesn\u2019t pull the trigger fast enough and Panama manage to close down the chance. Bailey confidently takes the ball with another Brazil chance. The longer Panama cane keep Brazil from scoring the better. 10 min: A foul from Vargas allows Brazil to set up once again, the opening goal feels inevitable it\u2019s just a question of when. Zaneratto has a lovely one two and then rattles off a shot which is just over the bar. 8 min: Panama have not been allowed any time on the ball yet, Brazil are looking lethal. An uncharacteristic loose pass and Panama will have a throw in but they quickly lose out. 6 min: Brazil are being allowed too much space and they can take time forming their game. A cross came in but Debinha can\u2019t keep her shot on target. Brazil are back on the charge quickly and it comes to Antonia but her shot is over the bar. 4 min: Brazil are forming an attack again, they have been relentless in these early stages. This time it is sent out for a goal kick. 3 min: The corner is taken short but it is deflected out for another corner. Ary Borges sends it in again and Zaneratto gets a touch to it but Bailey saves again. A lively start! 2 min: Brazil have never lost an opening game at a World Cup and they almost got a perfect start but Bailey saves! A corner to come. Will Panama cause problems for Brazil? Or will Brazil storm to a dominant victory? We will soon find out \u2026 Some emotional scenes as the Panama anthem is played for the first time at a women\u2019s World Cup. We are just a few minutes away. This is the first time Brazil and Panama have faced one another in football! The players have made their way out for the anthems, we are about to get underway. Marta starts on the bench and if she comes on today she will win her 187th cap for Brazil! She is such an icon. If she manages to score, she will have scored at six World Cups. Legend.

Catch up with all the action: And on Brazil\u2019s rising star: \u201cAt 17 years old, Aline Gomes has a huge future. The attacking midfielder has explosive physicality, serious dribbling skills and speed. She came through the ranks at Ferrovi\u00e1ria and made her international debut against England at Wembley.\u201d Read the full guide: Here\u2019s some info on Panama\u2019s star player Marta Cox: \u201cThe midfielder was introduced to football by her aunt Raiza Gutierrez, who was captain of the national team in the late 1990s, and made her debut for Panama\u2019s under-20 team aged just 14. She has gone on to win the league title with Chorrillo FC and CD Universitario, and became the first Panamanian player to win the Costa Rica women\u2019s league when with Alajuelense. In 2021 she became the first Panamanian to play in the Mexican Women\u2019s MX League with Club Le\u00f3n and in 2022 the first Panamanian to play for Pachuca Femenil, where she shares a dressing room with elite players such as Spain\u2019s Jenni Hermoso. Cox is an idol for girls from poor neighborhoods who see in her an inspiration that it is possible to travel the world and play football regardless of social class.\u201d Read the full guide: The Golden Boot race is on with Alexandra Popp putting herself within a chance of lifting it, have a read of the live tracker: If you were a manager of a general team and could choose any striker who would you choose? Alexandra Popp? Sophia Smith? Alessia Russo? Let me know via Twitter and email. Germany are ahead against Morocco, that game is still ongoing, thanks goals from Alexandra Popp, a score from Klara Buhl and an own goal. The scores mean Popp has scored in her last six matches at major tournaments. She scored in every Euros game she played in (Popp didn\u2019t appear in the final because of injury): Brazil starting XI: Leticia, Antonia, Rafaelle, Lauren, Tamires, Luana, Adriana, Ary Borges, Kerolin, Bia Zaneratto, Debinha The Panama team news is in! Starting XI: Bailey, Jaen, Castillo, Pinzon, Gonzalez, Riley, cox, Mills, Vargas, Quintero, Baltrip Reyes. I\u2019m still tracking down the Brazil team news. The referee for today\u2019s match is Cheryl Foster, the first Welsh person to referee a World Cup match since Clive Thomas in 1978! Team news to follow shortly. We have come to the final game of day four at this World Cup and what a match it will be with Brazil taking on Panama. It is football giants against tournament debutants and while many may expect a huge Brazil win, this World Cup has proved the underdogs can hold their ground. Brazil will definitely hold the favourites tag in the encounter. They have qualified for every World Cup and made it to the final in 2007 but they were beaten by Germany. Marta was the top scorer in that tournament and she still remains in the Brazil team \u2013 a talisman of the sport. Panama will have the goal of getting out of the group \u2013 which also includes Jamaica and France \u2013 after winning seven qualifiers and only losing two. But as Jamaica displayed yesterday, it is possible to get something out of a game many predict you\u2019ll lose. The game will get underway in an hour\u2019s time but the countries will release their team news shortly.

What is bowel cancer? Bowel cancer is cancer found anywhere in the large bowel, which includes the colon and rectum. The large bowel is part of your digestive system. It helps absorb water from your food and removes food waste from your body. How common is bowel cancer? Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer type worldwide. In 2020, almost 2m cases were diagnosed. Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death, leading to almost 1 million deaths each year. What causes bowel cancer? Several things may increase the risk of bowel cancer, although they cannot explain every case. These include a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre, being overweight or obese, not taking enough exercise and drinking too much alcohol. Being a smoker and having a family history of the disease can also push up the risk. Some people also have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another long-term condition, such as extensive ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease. What are the signs of bowel cancer? The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are having persistent blood in the stools, a change in bowel habit such as needing to go more often or experiencing the runs and persistent lower abdominal pain, bloating or discomfort. A loss of appetite may also occur, or somebody may suffer significant, unintentional weight loss. Tummy pain, bloating and feeling very tired for no reason are also among the symptoms. Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the general advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks. How serious is bowel cancer? It depends on how big the cancer is, if the cancer has spread, and the state of your general health. Alagiah was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2014, which is the most advanced stage. What is the treatment for bowel cancer? Bowel cancer can be more difficult to treat in its later stages. But in the early stages, tumours can often be removed through surgery. About 90% of patients with stage one bowel cancer will survive their cancer for five years or more after they\u2019re diagnosed, according to Cancer Research UK. The main treatments for bowel cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted drugs, which depend on the genetic makeup of the tumour. After Alagiah\u2019s initial cancer diagnosis in 2014, the disease spread to his liver and lymph nodes, which needed chemotherapy and several operations, including one to remove most of his liver. He revealed in October 2022 that it had spread further. Is screening available for bowel cancer? Yes. In the UK, screening is widely offered to people aged 60 to 74 who are sent a home stool kit every two years. Those aged 75 and over can ask for a kit every two years by phoning the free bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 60 60. In the United States, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults age 45 to 75 be screened for bowel cancer. It says the decision to be screened between ages 76 and 85 should be made on an individual basis. In Australia, eligible people aged 50 to 74 are sent a free test which can be performed at home every two years."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e08", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/24/train-drivers-announce-new-week-long-overtime-ban-in-england", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Train drivers announce new week-long overtime ban in England", "lead": "Aslef members to take action in week starting 7 August, as DHL workers suspend Gatwick strike", "author": "Joe Middleton", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:25:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679460", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/65b46bcb16d257262d8e8d44f75b6eca1adbaa7f/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Rail passengers are facing further disruption over the summer holidays after train drivers announced another week-long overtime ban in a long-running dispute over pay. Members of the drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, will refuse to work extra hours from Monday 7 August to Saturday 12 August. The industrial action, which affects lines served by 15 train companies in England and some cross-border routes into Wales and Scotland, will be the fifth week-long ban on working overtime since May. The latest ban ended on Saturday, with another due from 31 July to 5 August. Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take this action \u2013 because we don\u2019t want people to be inconvenienced \u2013 but the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, have forced us into this place because they refuse to sit down and talk to us and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years \u2013 since 2019 \u2013 while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%.\u201d Network Rail has urged passengers to check before they travel on strike days as services could start later and finish earlier. The impact of the ban will vary across the country, with some train operators putting in place an amended timetable during the industrial action. The train companies affected are: Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; Cross Country; East Midlands Railway; Greater Anglia; Great Western Railway; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Island Line; LNER; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway main line; TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains. Train staff belonging to the RMT union staged two strikes last week and will take further industrial action on Saturday, in their own long-running row with train operators over pay, jobs and conditions. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), representing train operators, said: \u201cAslef\u2019s leadership continues to disrupt customers\u2019 travel plans. They rejected a fair and affordable offer without putting it to their members, which would take average driver base salaries for a four-day week without overtime from \u00a360,000 to nearly \u00a365,000 by the end of 2023 pay awards. \u201cTrain companies will work hard to minimise the impact of the overtime ban that will affect the level of cancellations and the punctuality of some services. Customers are advised to plan their journey in advance and check the latest travel information before they travel. \u201cWe ask Aslef to recognise the very real financial challenge the industry is facing and work with us to deliver a better, more reliable railway with a strong long-term future.\u201d The announcement came after planned London Underground strikes this week were called off by RMT and Aslef after a breakthrough in talks. In other developments, more strikes at Gatwick airport have been suspended after DHL workers accepted a 15% pay rise, easing fears of disruption over the busy summer holiday period. As well as the pay increase, workers at DHL will get an uplift in skills pay, meaning hourly rates will rise by between 15% and 31%. Plus, workers will get an extra shift premium of \u00a31.25 an hour for work between midnight and 4.59am, said their union, Unite. Earlier this month, the union said about 950 staff who work in roles including baggage handling and check-in desks for ASC, Menzies, GGS and DHL, would hold eight days of strike action. As a result of the pay deal about 600 DHL workers will no longer strike from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, and also from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August. ASC and Menzies workers are being balloting on improved pay offers and talks are progressing with GGS, the union said."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e09", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/24/met-police-refer-arrest-woman-bus-fare-child-iopc", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Met police handcuffed woman over bus fare in front of crying child", "lead": "Footage of incident, in which woman\u2019s child becomes distressed, has circulated on social media", "author": "Tobi Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:21:42", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679480", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd757d0bc13678aaceea20c81acbc1e1ee9cebd/866_748_4298_2578/500.jpg", "body": "The police watchdog is reviewing an incident in which a woman was arrested and detained by Metropolitan police officers in Croydon after she was falsely accused of not paying her bus fare. Video footage that circulated on social media on Saturday showed the woman being arrested and handcuffed by two male Met officers in front of her child, who was distressed and crying. The woman is heard asking one of the officers to let go, adding: \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d while a member of the public films what is happening and asks why she is being arrested. The police said in a statement that the woman was asked to provide her ticket but failed to do so, and was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and handcuffed. The woman was later de-arrested when it was confirmed that she had paid for her ticket. In a statement, the Met\u2019s assistant commissioner Matt Twist confirmed that the incident, which took place on Friday, has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), saying: \u201cAn initial review of the officers\u2019 actions did not identify any conduct matters but we will reflect on it carefully, in discussion with communities locally, to urgently identify any opportunities to do things differently. \u201cGiven the level of community concern generated we believe it is in the public interest to voluntarily refer the matter to the IOPC to review.\u201d Det Ch Supt Christina Jessah said: \u201cWe know that this is a distressing video to watch, even more so as a child is seen to be visibly upset by the way in which his mother has been apprehended. We regret the upset that has been caused to the child. \u201cA PCSO [police community support officer] can be seen comforting the child; however, we know that this does not take away from the impact that this will have on him.

Barred from standing to be Labour\u2019s candidate in the inaugural north-east mayoral elections \u2013 despite being the party\u2019s sitting mayor of the smaller North of Tyne region and a member since 1985 \u2013 he announced he was quitting the party. He tweeted the news, promising to run as an independent next May if he raised \u00a325,000 by the end of August. A week later, his fighting fund stands at more than \u00a3114,000. More than 5,300 people have donated, mostly fivers and tenners, decrying the \u201cundemocratic decision\u201d to bar Driscoll from the selection contest. \u201cYou didn\u2019t leave the Labour party, Jamie. The Labour party left you. And me!\u201d was a typical comment. Five Labour councillors in the region have quit Labour to campaign for Driscoll, with one saying: \u201cThe party was a broad church that allowed for a range of views. A party of fairness, a party of equality, a safe place for my political views. Unfortunately, this once safe place no longer feels like home.\u201d Quitting has propelled Driscoll to the top of the news bulletins in a way few of his mayoral policies ever did. Talking to people in the north-east constituencies of Blyth Valley and Wansbeck in recent days, his treatment seems to have cut through. \u201cThe reason Keir Starmer doesn\u2019t want [Driscoll] in is because he\u2019s going to show him up, because he\u2019s doing a better job than him and he doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d said Dan Snowden, a dog walker who was exercising eight of his charges on Cambois beach in Wansbeck. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a great chance. Like any great progressive leader, he is offering hope and change and everyone wants that. What was it Wes Streeting said the other day? \u2018No hope is better than false hope\u2019. Unbelievable to hear something like that coming from a Labour MP\u2019s mouth. Plus in the north-east, the one thing we won\u2019t tolerate is injustice and that\u2019s the overarching feeling with what\u2019s happened with Labour.\u201d Lifelong Labour voter Kevin, having a coffee in Blyth, said Driscoll\u2019s treatment was \u201cdisgusting. But to be honest, I don\u2019t think the Labour party is the Labour party any more. Keir Starmer is more Conservative than the Conservatives are. It\u2019s just disgraceful.\u201d Starmer, Kevin said, \u201cruns the party like a dictatorship \u2026 he will purge anybody who disagrees with him.\u201d It was a drizzly day in Blyth but Driscoll was full of sunshine. A confident man who is not above shoehorning his former membership of Mensa \u2013 or his black belt in jiu-jitsu \u2013 into conversation, even he seemed taken aback by the support he was getting. \u201cThe reaction has been genuinely unbelievable,\u201d he said, giving the Guardian a whistlestop tour of projects he has funded in the \u201cred wall\u201d constituency, from dredging a dock at the Port of Blyth to decontaminating brownfield land for a new housing estate. \u201cI\u2019ve had Tories get in touch and say \u2018I\u2019ll vote for you\u2019. One of them was a Tory MP!\u201d He declined to name names. It is a surreal situation for a man who was widely viewed to be \u201ctoo leftwing\u201d for Starmer\u2019s Labour party, hence, people believe, the controversial decision by the party to bar him from standing as its north-east mayoral candidate last month. Driscoll wears his socialist credentials with pride, turning up at pickets and giving the impression of saying what he actually thinks, rather than what a focus group might want him to say. Even when showing us around Nu-castle, a youth club affiliated with Newcastle United FC and built with \u00a32.5m of his mayoral money, he happily dismisses Saudi Arabia \u2013 whose sovereign wealth fund bought the Premier League club in 2021 \u2013 as \u201ca murderous regime which starts illegal wars\u201d. The only public explanation for his blacklisting came from the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, who suggested it was because Driscoll had hosted an event with Ken Loach earlier this year, discussing Loach\u2019s films. The film-maker was suspended by Labour in 2021 for supporting Labour Against the Witchhunt, which claimed allegations of Labour antisemitism were \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. The move has not gone down well among many Labour supporters in the north-east, with 11 out of 22 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) in the region refusing to endorse any mayoral candidate in protest. Mary Murphy was one of a number of Labour councillors to quit the party in solidarity, pledging to campaign for Driscoll instead of Labour\u2019s chosen candidate, the Northumberland police and crime commissioner, Kim McGuinness. Murphy, a Northumberland county councillor, thinks Labour will come to regret blocking Driscoll\u2019s candidacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s a complete misreading of the strength of feeling in the north-east of England with regard to democracy within the party, and our respect for our incumbent mayor. None of this is anti-Kim. It\u2019s very much about the process. I think they\u2019ve just totally underestimated this all.\u201d Ian Mearns, the Labour MP for Gateshead, picks his words carefully: \u201cThe decision to exclude Jamie Driscoll from the longlist wasn\u2019t done with a great deal of openness and transparency. If there was a good reason to block him, they [Labour\u2019s national executive committee] should say what it was.\u201d Mearns has not yet heard of any of his local members quitting as a result, but with membership already down two-fifths on the Corbyn era, he cannot afford to lose many more. \u201cIf you have a membership who are at all uneasy about the process by which candidates are selected it doesn\u2019t exactly motivate people to go out and campaign. The danger is that apathy reigns.\u201d None of the other 16 Labour MPs in the north-east would go on the record about the selection shenanigans. But Driscoll\u2019s Tory rival from 2019 was happy to talk. Charlie Hoult came second, polling 45,494 first-round votes to Driscoll\u2019s 62,034. He described Driscoll as an \u201cintellectual ideologue\u201d and criticised his \u201clack of profile in a cheerleading role\u201d for the region, compared with the Tees Valley Conservative mayor, Ben Houchen, a Downing Street darling. Nonetheless, he thinks his old rival stands a chance of victory: \u201cHe\u2019s got a good length of time to build his support.\u201d But Hoult hopes Driscoll will split the Labour vote and make a Tory victory more likely. \u201cThe more candidates there are, the more splits there are.\u201d He believes he may have won in 2019 had it not been for the presence of an independent candidate, John McCabe, a well-respected business figure who is now chief executive of the north-east chamber of commerce. McCabe won 31,507 first-round votes before being eliminated. Stuart Murray, who until earlier this year was media officer of Blyth Valley Labour party, resigned his party membership last week and predicts a \u201clandslide\u201d victory for Driscoll. \u201cHe\u2019s competent, he\u2019s got a proven track record. And I think they\u2019re just scared. [Labour are] scared of the damage that he could do to them because he wouldn\u2019t just be a yes man. Everybody in our area that has been imposed on us have been people who will nod their heads to other decision-makers rather than the electorate that they\u2019ve been tasked to represent.\u201d McGuinness, he said, \u201cis a candidate that will agree to whatever her paymasters tell her, and her paymasters are the London Labour office\u201d. It is a suggestion that clearly riles McGuinness. \u201cI\u2019m nobody else\u2019s candidate \u2026 I am a woman who wants to represent the region that I live in,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it is as simple as that. I have my own ideas. I have my own brain. I have my own decision-making capacity, surprise, surprise \u2013 imagine!\u201d McGuinness says her No 1 priority is to end child poverty, describing Starmer\u2019s decision to retain the two-child cap on child benefit as \u201ca really disappointing position, but it\u2019s where we have been left by the government and I understand that\u201d. She refuses to answer any questions about Driscoll. Wouldn\u2019t she rather have beaten him fair and square? She answers a different question. \u201cI just have got a vision for the north-east, I have put myself forward because it is something that I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time. And it\u2019s something that I\u2019m doing because I really want to improve our area. I don\u2019t want to spend the next nine months talking about a man. You know, there\u2019s one woman mayor in this country [Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire]. And there\u2019s two called Andy. And we need more women in these positions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e0b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/24/the-open-golf-major-championships", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Blink and you\u2019ll miss it: golf\u2019s major squeeze is hindering game\u2019s growth", "lead": "The Open marks the end of a stunted, 16-week major championship season that hurts both prestige and popularity", "author": "Ewan Murray", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:13:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679517", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/faf4a757f5fc28dafc6badd18c64e4012823ac17/365_118_4028_2416/500.jpg", "body": "It is perhaps just as well Brian Harman collected the Claret Jug in front of a few hardy souls holding umbrellas, against a light backdrop more akin to November than July and having refused to let excitement get in the way of the final round of the Open Championship. Anybody gripped by an alternative scene would soon have been struck by the harsh realisation that more than 260 days will pass until the next major championship ball is struck in anger. Jon Rahm was crowned as the Masters champion on 9 April. Harman\u2019s finest hour arrived on 23 July. In between, Brooks Koepka took delivery of the US PGA Championship and Wyndham Clark won the US Open. If one supposed benefit of this brief major run is to develop a seasonal theme, Hercule Poirot is required to determine it. At face value, nothing links the 2023 majors at all besides a desire to get them out of the way as promptly as possible. The delay between final putts dropping at Royal Liverpool and opening drives being struck at Augusta National is great for the Masters, which will benefit from fevered anticipation. It surely cannot be regarded as much use to anybody else. Eyeballs have been drawn to golf due to the advances of LIV and associated chaos. Yet the Open demonstrated the ongoing challenges this sport has, despite hugely positive participation figures, to capture hearts and minds beyond dedicated supporters. The lead\u2011up is dominated by Wimbledon. The clash with a key Ashes Test \u2013 a concern of the Open\u2019s organisers a decade ago \u2013 and the beginning of the Women\u2019s World Cup was hardly helpful. The R&amp;A is not to blame for the BBC\u2019s shocking indifference towards golf but the paywalled nature of live Open coverage in the UK is clearly problematic when placed against the visibility of Wimbledon. A Rory McIlroy victory or an epic stumble from Harman over the closing stretch at Hoylake would have elevated the tournament but neither transpired. The R&amp;A will be correct to hail an Open attendance in excess of 260,000 but these are golf fans; sometimes you need more than that. More than a decade ago, Open champions and the R&amp;A would return to the venue on Monday morning to reflect on the week\u2019s events. Darren Clarke and Royal St George\u2019s is a particular classic of this genre. Winners of the Claret Jug duly decided they had better things to be doing and R&amp;A executives felt they were being needlessly placed in stocks so the follow-up stopped. On Sunday Harman delivered exceptional golf under pressure before offering details of his new tractor. This is all lovely stuff for a golfer who had not won since 2017 but it was difficult to see how it resonated more widely. The scheduling of tournaments \u2013 an eternally complex affair \u2013 has to factor in the PGA Tour\u2019s desire for its FedEx Cup playoff series to be afforded prime billing before the NFL season starts, the wish for a meaningful tournament run on the DP World Tour, golf\u2019s return to the Olympics and the fact that in years where Europe do not face off with the US, there is a Presidents Cup. Golfing bodies jostle for relevance. Yet at a time when the traditional system has kissed and made up with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, a model must be delivered that elongates the majors beyond a measly 16 weeks. Three of the four were played inside 10. Blink and you missed them. It currently looks as if the switching of the US PGA from August to May was an error. As \u201cGlory\u2019s Last Shot\u201d that tournament had a calling card. However proximity to the Open \u2013 in 2014, McIlroy won at Hoylake on 20 July and Valhalla on 10 August \u2013 never felt satisfactory, either. In isolation, this year\u2019s US PGA at Oak Hill was actually a terrific tournament. More intriguing was a hastily aborted plan to play the PGA outside the US. Australia, for example, would offer a captive audience and new date ranges. Golf likes to present itself as a global sport and in so many ways it is; but three out of four majors in one country undermines the claim. Next year, the Open returns to Royal Troon. In 2016 this was the site of Henrik Stenson\u2019s jaw\u2011dropping battle with Phil Mickelson. Another Valhalla US PGA stop automatically creates a storyline around McIlroy. Pinehurst, where the US Open will take place, is one of the finest traditional courses in that country. The trouble is, by the time everyone packs up and leaves the Ayrshire coast another painful break will ensue. The remainder of 2023 in men\u2019s elite golf is at least boosted by the Ryder Cup. Without that, we would be staring at barren lands. After the deluge that overshadowed round four, the sun split the skies over Royal Liverpool on Monday morning. It is not in the power of the R&amp;A to organise the weather for its marquee championship. There must, though, be a more collaborative approach to ensure majors gain the wider credence they deserve. The present wham-bam configuration does them all a disservice."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e0c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/24/how-edward-enninful-vogue-changed-british-culture", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How Edward Enninful\u2019s Vogue changed British culture", "lead": "The magazine has become less white, but remained as grand and elitist in its aesthetic vision as it ever was", "author": "Jess Cartner-Morley", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:10:40", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679535", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5910cdf7e32205f25854423571ef476f156c2d2f/0_211_3333_2000/500.jpg", "body": "Edward Enninful\u2019s Vogue has changed what Britain looks like in a way that goes beyond clothes.

The April 2023 magazine, with the coverline The New Supers, starred three models \u2013 all non-white, all non-sample size, all photographed full-length rather than in the zoomed-in closeup that fashion traditionally chooses for non-skinny models. People of all genders and all skin colours, disabled bodies, bigger bodies, octogenarians alongside teens, are included in the aspirational vision of the country\u2019s premier glossy magazine. Why does this matter? Because Vogue is the paper of record for the beautiful people. Vogue has always been not just about fashion, but about status and visibility. Vogue is the top table of what glamour looks like. Diversity has become a non-negotiable aspect of that guest list \u2013 and this has a knock-on effect on worlds adjacent to fashion. Say, for example, that you are the person in charge of throwing a high-profile party to celebrate the opening of a venue that is angling to become the latest place to be, or putting together a lineup of influencer-ambassadors to represent your new beauty or wellness brand. The trickledown effect from Vogue is that the optics will look way off \u2013 hopelessly unfashionable, embarrassingly out of touch \u2013 if the lineup of faces fails to embrace diversity. Tokenism is no longer enough. If, however, you have got the impression that Enninful has made Vogue a utopian, egalitarian world that reflects the real lives of ordinary people, think again. To flick through Vogue, you would think the cost of living crisis had never happened. The first five dresses shown in the editorial pages of the July edition of the magazine \u2013 by Valentino, Dior, Tom Ford and Rick Owens \u2013 had an average price of \u00a34,771. Vogue has become more narrowly luxury-oriented under Enninful\u2019s watch. It has always showcased eye-wateringly expensive clothes, but previous iterations of the magazine tempered this with a judicious sprinkling of affordable buys. Fashion editors would come back from the Paris haute couture shows with a list of fabulous ballgowns that simply must be featured this season, but they would also return from a lunch break having spotted a great pair of sandals in Marks &amp; Spencer, and those would also make their way into the pages of the magazine. Now, not so much. During the pandemic, the July 2020 edition of Vogue celebrated three keyworkers as joint cover stars, but there is very little in the magazine that a midwife, train driver or supermarket assistant could ever hope to wear. The narrowing of economic accessibility is an interesting counterpoint to the ways in which Vogue has become more diverse, because it has challenged lazy prejudice around fashion and race. For many years, black faces in fashion were siloed into streetwear. There was an unspoken assumption that the role of black voices in the industry was to talk about what people wore on the street, or to play sport \u2013 in other words, that they would represent areas of culture in which blackness was already visible. Black models tended to be booked to wear stretchy minidresses to wear on the dancefloor, not trousersuits to wear in a boardroom. This correlation no longer holds. Vogue has become less white, but remained as grand and elitist in its aesthetic vision as it ever was. This can make Vogue in its current form a frustrating read. As a student in the days before the internet, when fashion content was much less widely available, I knew the publication dates by heart and would be waiting outside my local branch of WH Smith when it opened on \u201cVogue day\u201d each month. I would read every word of the small print, memorising names of photographers and designers and stylists, but also on the lookout for clothes my budget could stretch to. It is a little exasperating to find that as a 50-year-old woman I am now less likely to be able to afford anything in Vogue than I was as an impoverished student. There is some justification for this. Sustainability has rightly refocused the narrative of fashion around the principle of investment dressing for pieces you will treasure for ever, rather than grazing on fast fashion items once or twice a month. Vogue, however, takes this to extremes. A shoot in the current issue features the same Saint Laurent chocolate leather jacket in all six shots, instead of using different clothes on each page as is traditional. Anok Yai, an American model of Sudanese heritage \u2013 who in 2018 was the first black model to open a Prada show since Naomi Campbell 11 years previously \u2013 wears the jacket over a lemon Givenchy evening dress outside the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles. In another, she wears it over Miu Miu cashmere leggings, striding a pavement with her sister, Alim, a financial consultant. In a third, her toddler nephew, Zane, is wrapped in the jacket. \u201cThe jacket becomes a modern heirloom,\u201d the blurb notes. At a price of about \u00a35,000, one would frankly very much hope so. Vogue is still very much a rarefied world for a clique of the beautiful people. But those beautiful people look different now."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e0d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/24/british-vogue-editor-in-chief-edward-enninful-says-march-issue-will-be-his-last", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful says March issue will be his last", "lead": "Enninful makes announcement almost two months after saying he would step down from role he has held since 2017", "author": "Ellie Violet Bramley", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 13:08:16", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679554", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4a429508ee7092776d0268ae405e14879f7d1988/0_0_3384_2030/500.jpg", "body": "Almost two months after announcing that he would step down from his role as editor-in-chief of British Vogue next year, Edward Enninful has confirmed that the March 2024 issue, which will come out in February, will be his last. Enninful made the announcement on Instagram, saying: \u201cWith just seven issues left at @BritishVogue, I would love to know which issue was your favourite. March 2024 is my last @BritishVogue as EIC so set your clocks. With my final issues I\u2019m in planning mode for sure with lots on my mind. The power of brilliant global change makers! The unbeatable creativity of the UK! And above all FASHION! More than anything, I am just so excited for what is still to come in the next seven months.\u201d Enninful may be leaving his current position, but he will stay on at Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he has worked in one guise or another for 25 years, to become Vogue\u2019s global creative and cultural adviser and editorial adviser at British Vogue. When he first announced he would be leaving, he reportedly told staff that his new position meant he would \u201ccontinue to contribute to the creative and cultural success of the Vogue brand globally while having the freedom to take on broader creative projects\u201d. A successor has not yet been named. Enninful has been at the helm of British Vogue since 2017, when he took over from Alexandra Shulman and brought in supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and film director Steve McQueen as contributing editors. His appointment made him the first man, and the first black editor, to hold the title. In December 2020 he was promoted to European editorial director of Vogue. He is a former model and was a contributing editor at US, Japanese and Italian Vogue, and creative and fashion director at W magazine. During his time, he has worked with the Duchess of Sussex on a guest-edited issue of the magazine, secured a rare interview with Beyonc\u00e9 and featured Rihanna, A$AP Rocky and their baby son on the cover \u2013 probably the first time a nappy has ever had such a prime spot. His cover stars have included big names in pop culture, such as Zendaya, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa, as well as supermodels Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Iman. Enninful has made representation a key tenet of his time at British Vogue by giving the cover to activists ranging from Marcus Rashford to Prof Angela Davis and Reni Eddo Lodge. In May of this year he put what was described as \u201ca new vanguard of disabled talent\u201d, including the CEO of the accessibility consultancy Tilting the Lens, Sin\u00e9ad Burke, on the cover of an issue for which Vogue published its first ever braille edition. For the June 2020 issue, Enninful put Judi Dench on the cover, making her Vogue\u2019s oldest cover star at 85 years old. He was awarded an OBE for services to diversity in fashion in 2016 and has previously said that diversity should be a \u201ccontinuous conversation\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be an issue as far as I\u2019m concerned.

The nicest rejection letter I got was from Quincy Jones: \u201cGreat horns, great arrangements, pass owing to time commitments.\u201d I\u2019d started the band as a nine-piece to play my own music, which wasn\u2019t very economically viable. We got it down to five and decided we\u2019d try to make the band sound as big as possible using electronics. We were very conscious of the way technology was changing everything. Einstein a Go-Go was one of my first attempts at writing a tune to be played on a Lyricon \u2013 an electronic wind instrument that has a six-octave range. We actually demonstrated it on Tomorrow\u2019s World. For Einstein a Go-Go, I programmed a simple drumbeat on a Dr Rhythm drum machine, then came up with the hook based on the jazz tunes I used to write in school. We\u2019d always been instrumental, but I\u2019d met Ian Dury on the pub circuit and been really inspired by the way he combined a big band with spoken-word lyrics, which had taken him from a cult act to No 1. My initial concept for the song was a joke based on the fact that Einstein played violin: \u201cDon\u2019t you know anything about time, Albert?\u201d I\u2019d read his biography and was also thinking about his famous quote that \u201cGod does not play dice\u201d with the universe. But when I took the tune to Richard he said: \u201cNo, let\u2019s make it about someone who idolises Einstein but is actually a nuclear terrorist.\u201d The phone calls in the intro are genuine ones to the Kremlin and the White House. When we asked \u201cCan we speak to President Carter?\u201d they played for time so they could trace the call. Then we called the Iranian embassy: \u201cCan we speak to the Ayatollah?\u201d If you did all that today they\u2019d send a Swat team, but we had a sign in the studio reading \u201cNo compromise\u201d. We felt that the record company was going to drop us anyway so we might as well go for it. Richard James Burgess, songwriter, vocals, electronics I knew there was no way we\u2019d have success with another instrumental album, but we also felt that bringing in a singer with a big ego could upset the chemistry and friendships we\u2019d built up while doing over 200 gigs a year. So we decided to do it ourselves. I\u2019d written lyrics in bands since my teens, so I ended up on vocals. The hot topic at the time was how the UK would have five minutes\u2019 warning if the Soviet Union launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. We bounced that idea around and came up with a more cartoon Einstein reference: \u201cAlbert says that E = MC squared.\u201d Superficially it\u2019s a jokey, nothing song but it\u2019s actually about the very scary subject of religious fundamentalism. Hence the line \u201cBible says we must pay. I am the judge for the judgment day.\u201d We\u2019d been out to Peter Gabriel\u2019s place in Bath to borrow his Fairlight [synthesiser and sampler] and he\u2019d played us his new song, Intruder. I was really struck by its idea of a malevolent presence, and made our song about a fundamentalist terrorist. We did all the pre-production in my house in Camberwell, then went into a proper studio to do vocals, guitar overdubs and such. Programming everything on a Roland MicroComposer was a very laborious process and if there was a power cut you lost everything. I\u2019d been going to the Blitz club and realised the New Romantic scene was developing. After I played our stuff to Spandau Ballet\u2019s Gary Kemp, he asked me to produce them, and I think the wind behind Spandau helped us. Also, the video was critically important to Einstein a Go-Go becoming a hit. We used dancers from [dance troupe] Shock, drums that looked like human faces and we had [trombonist] Pete Thoms\u2019 disembodied head saying \u201cEinstein a Go-Go.\u201d The record stalled at No 32, but having played drums on Top of the Pops before with the Buggles, I knew that whenever a booked live act got stuck in fog at the airport, the BBC would more than likely replace them with a video. I told our manager to get down there with the video and that\u2019s exactly what happened, which helped the song into the Top 5. Einstein a Go-Go always felt a bit ahead of its time. We actually held it back for a few months because we felt it would get more attention in 1981 than 1980.

The long crack in my wall. Braids. Into a net. The difference between. A real voice and the other kind. The way its air vibrates. Through you. The way air. Vibrates. The violence. In your middle ear. Kaveh Akbar, poet and novelist, was born in Tehran in 1989, and was taken to the United States at the age of two. You can read an interesting personal response to his work in the journal Ploughshares, including some thoughts about his most recent collection Pilgrim Bell \u2013 in which you can find this poem of the week. In an epigraph, Akbar cites a quotation from Hadith 4: 438, in which Al-Harith bin Hisham asks the Prophet how divine inspiration is revealed to him. The Prophet replies: \u201cSometimes it is like the ringing of a bell.\u201d The poet-pilgrim\u2019s winding quest across internal landscapes neither wholly secular nor sacred, is punctuated at intervals by six eponymous but different poems. Each chime of the bell seems both to record a sharpening and a complication of the pilgrim\u2019s vision. The particular Pilgrim Bell poem I\u2019ve chosen seems particularly encrusted with contradictions. Even the securely holy concept \u201cMy savior\u201d is called in for questioning. The lower-case s rules out the Christian meaning of \u201csavior\u201d: nor is it one of the Names of Allah as usually enumerated. The implication might be that the speaker\u2019s \u201csavior\u201d is some earthly benefactor. The latter could still, of course, be posited as a medium of divine inspiration, and the poem a meditation on the nature of Allah and the human self, the poet-speaker-pilgrim. Studded with full-stops, the poem refuses to mean what the hasty reader might think it means. It may even be a parable about the way the human mind constructs the deity and the texts which define \u201chis\u201d activity. Simple answers soon become questions. Has the deity been \u201cconvinced\u201d to use their powers, are they a \u201cno-call no-show\u201d, or, somehow, both of these? Who is the cat and who the mouse in the playing-killing allegory? Thanks to the full-stop after \u201cwing\u201d in line six, Savior is now capitalised. But the surrounding images hardly settle this being who is \u201cYounger than./ I pretend to be. Almost everyone is./ Younger than I pretend to be\u2026\u201d The stop-start device works uncannily well if the line \u201cI pretend to be. Almost everyone is.\u201d stands alone as a pair of existential statements. Against the constant breaking of syntax the reader does instinctive repair-work, building little bridges of convenient logic. Oppositions can meet, and may form an ebullient relationship: \u201cI live in a great mosque./ Built on top of a flagpole.\u201d But the constant narrative resistance in the poem signifies the difficulty not so much of making sense of a multilayered reality, as that of making sense of mystical experience. A bell doesn\u2019t have grammar. To distinguish between a \u201creal voice and the other kind\u201d the mystic might have to force themselves to be innocent of language altogether, linguistic skill being no help in interpreting the unspeakable. One of the clearest statements, \u201cAll day I hammer the distance\u201d, might indicate the auditory and metaphysical effects of the repeated full-stopping. In another poem, the speaker concludes \u201cGod\u2019s word is a melody, and melody requires repetition./ God\u2019s word is a melody I sang once then forgot.\u201d The re-creation of the melody might seem far from the current poem\u2019s procedure. Nevertheless, it succeeds, through vibration and violence, in squeezing a chime from the bell\u2019s \u201creal voice\u201d \u2013 a voice which, independent of the logic of English grammar, begins to encrypt the renewed idea of divine contact."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e10", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/santa-barbara-news-press-bankruptcy", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Longest-running southern California newspaper closes after 168 years", "lead": "Controversial owner Wendy McCaw has shut down Santa Barbara News-Press, which won Pulitzer prize in 1962", "author": "Michael Sainato", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 12:36:36", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679610", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9f47dbab2082e788ce4efad36b3cd9c1ac1ae8/0_140_5715_3427/500.jpg", "body": "The longest-running newspaper in southern California has ceased publication after filing for bankruptcy.

The managing editor, Dave Mason, broke the news about the paper\u2019s closure to its staff in an email, the Santa Barbara Independent reported. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d the email read. \u201cWendy filed for bankruptcy on Friday.

The newspaper won a Pulitzer prize in 1962 for editorials that outed members of the far-right John Birch Society. It was previously owned by the New York Times before Wendy McCaw, ex-wife of the billionaire wireless pioneer Craig McCaw, bought the paper in 2000 for $110m. McCaw\u2019s control over the publication included turmoil in 2006 over complaints from journalists about her and her managers\u2019 imposition of their opinions into reporting. Several staff were fired or resigned. The American Journalism Review wrote in 2006, \u201cWhen she put the editorial page editor in charge of the newsroom, then left with the restaurant critic on a month-long Mediterranean cruise aboard her multimillion-dollar yacht, the editors figured it couldn\u2019t get much worse.\u201d The AJR noted McCaw was a libertarian who, former employees claimed, began imposing her views and interfering in reporting when she took over the paper. Joshua Molina of Noozhawk, a Santa Barbara-based online news outlet, claimed credit for breaking the story of the bankruptcy filing and ceasing of publication by the paper on Twitter, according to the Los Angeles Times. The bankruptcy filing noted a bankruptcy meeting of the company\u2019s creditors, between 200 and 999, is scheduled for 1 September.

Friedrich Merz\u2019s remarks triggered cries of protest from his own party and raised concerns about the firewall between German conservatives and the far right. In an interview with the state broadcaster ZDF on Sunday, Merz categorically ruled out joining a coalition with the AfD at a national level but said such a taboo should not apply to local politics. \u201cOf course we are obliged to accept democratic votes,\u201d Merz said. \u201cAnd if the head of a district authority or a mayor is voted in who belongs to the AfD, then of course you find ways to continue to work in that town.\u201d German politicians from across the spectrum \u2013 including within Merz\u2019s own camp \u2013 reacted with outrage, leading the CDU leader to backpedal. \u201cTo clarify it once again, and I never said it differently: the CDU resolution is valid. There will be no CDU cooperation on the local level with the AfD,\u201d Merz tweeted on Monday. Fears however lingered that Merz could in future be open to breaching a fundamental taboo in Germany\u2019s politics since the second world war. The AfD won its first German district council in the eastern state of Thuringia last month, and secured its first mayoral post, in Saxony-Anhalt, at the start of July. Recent polls show the rightwing populist outfit at 20-22% of the vote, behind the CDU on 26-28% \u2013 both ahead of the three centre-left, green and liberal parties that form Germany\u2019s government. The CDU mayor of Berlin, Kai Wegner, strongly distanced himself from the party leader\u2019s comments on Sunday evening. \u201cWhat cooperation is there to be had?\u201d Wegner said in a tweet. \u201cThe CDU cannot, does not want and won\u2019t work with a party whose business model is hatred, division and exclusion.\u201d The MP Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who ran against Merz for the party leadership, warned on Sunday that the AfD \u201cknowingly admits and invites extremist forces into the party\u201d and called it unacceptable for the CDU to work with it \u201con any level\u201d. Across Europe, several conservative parties have in recent years retreated from a prohibitive stance on working with the far right. In Sweden, the nationalist Sweden Democrats function as a support party for the centre-right government, while Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular has formed regional coalition governments with the far-right Vox, and could attempt to form a power-sharing pact after Sunday\u2019s national vote. In Germany, the firewall between the CDU and AfD was fiercely protected under the leadership of Angela Merkel. In 2020, her designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, stepped down as party leader when she appeared to lack authority to stop Christian Democrat delegates in Thuringia from voting with the AfD to oust the state\u2019s leftwing premier. Sharing news of Merz\u2019s earlier comments in a tweet, the co-leader of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla, appeared to hail them as the start of the end of the firewall stance that stopped the centre-right from cooperating or deliberately voting with the far right. \u201cTogether we will tear down this wall in the states and at federal level,\u201d Chrupalla said. Merz\u2019s interview followed a series of comments that seemed to relax the CDU\u2019s strict condemnation of the AfD, which was founded on an anti-euro ticket in 2013 but has progressively tacked harder right since. After the AfD\u2019s district council triumph last month, Merz designated the governing Green party and not the far right as the CDU\u2019s \u201cmain enemy\u201d, and on Friday he described his own party as the \u201cAlternative f\u00fcr Deutschland of substance\u201d."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e12", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/popps-double-helps-germany-ruin-moroccos-womens-world-cup-debut-match-report", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Popp\u2019s double helps Germany ruin Morocco\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup debut", "lead": "Alexandra Popp scored twice as Germany began their Women\u2019s World Cup campaign with a 6-0 win against Morocco in Melbourne", "author": "Jo Khan at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 12:22:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679646", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e2bd76bc882697e5fc4093fb09d48eb73c0cdadf/0_67_4421_2652/500.jpg", "body": "After an opening-night upset and some unexpectedly close games so far in the Women\u2019s World Cup, there was an open, albeit optimistic question as to whether Morocco could give Germany a scare. But it was evident from the first whistle that Morocco were not going to be able to keep a clean sheet for long and after a slower first half, the Euro 2022 runners-up brushed the debutants aside with an emphatic 6-0 victory in the Group H opener. The divide between the world No 2 and No 72 was just too big and it took 11 minutes for Germany\u2019s captain, Alexandra Popp, to find the back of the net, heading in Kathrin Hendrich\u2019s cross from the left. Morocco\u2019s goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi and a defender came out to meet the ball but both misjudged it, leaving Popp with an open goal. Crosses proved to be the biggest issue for the Atlas Lionesses, the first Arab nation to qualify for the tournament. Popp secured her second goal from a corner in the 39th minute even though it appeared she was facing the wrong way. The fact Germany were only two up by half-time was thanks to some solid interceptions and tackles from Zineb Redouani and Sarah Kassi. The Moroccan forwards did expose some shakiness in Germany\u2019s defence, which was missing Marina Hegering, something Colombia and South Korea, the other teams in Group H, will be better placed to take advantage of. The Morocco captain, Ghizlane Chebbak, and Rosella Ayane made promising runs forward, linking up nicely and forcing Germany\u2019s goalkeeper, Merle Frohms, into action, but were unable to convert their chances. In the second half the rain arrived in Melbourne, along with the start of a German onslaught. Just seconds into the half, a cross from Klara B\u00fchl was sent into an upright by Lina Magull, the rebound going back to B\u00fchl, who fired it past Er-Rmichi for Germany\u2019s third. In reply, the pressure from Ayane, Anissa Lahmari and Chebbak up front continued to cause problems for Germany\u2019s back line, who at times were forced to scramble back. There was a glimmer of hope for the Atlas Lionesses after a lovely flick back from Ayane to Chebbak just outside the area, over to Lahmari, whose resulting goal was ruled offside. Two own goals in the 54th and 79th minutes, from Hanane A\u00eft El Haj and Yasmin Mrabet, put the result even further beyond doubt, and added insult to injury for a Morocco team showing glimpses of creativity on their World Cup debut. A sixth goal, this time from the substitute Lea Sch\u00fcller, in the final minute of regular time showed Germany\u2019s determination to make their mark. Morocco\u2019s debut at the Women\u2019s World Cup brought with it more than one first: the first Arabic nation, the first from north Africa, and for a first encounter with the team ranked second in the world their performance was far from embarrassing. They will be able to take positives from their performance \u2013 in particular the pace and pressure in the midfield forcing errors from Germany \u2013 as well as finding much room for improvement."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e13", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/oppenheimer-biopic-sex-scene-scared-text-angers-india-hindu-rightwing-bjp", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Oppenheimer\u2019s use of sacred text in sex scene angers Hindu right wing in India", "lead": "Members of BJP government say use of Bhagavad Gita is \u2018attack on Hinduism\u2019 and call for scene to be deleted", "author": "Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Delhi", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 12:20:23", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679664", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ba8b8d338572728c19df5f1255a97725c08d1204/0_102_3074_1845/500.jpg", "body": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic Oppenheimer has prompted outrage among the Hindu right wing in India, who have alleged that a sex scene featuring a sacred text has offended religious sentiments. The blockbuster tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb and includes a sex scene in which the tortured physicist, played by Cillian Murphy, reads the Bhagavad Gita to his lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh. The words he reads aloud, which he translates from Sanskrit, are those of the god Krishna \u2013 \u201cI am become death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d \u2013 a quote the real Oppenheimer recalled after the first detonation of the atomic bomb he had invented. Oppenheimer taught himself Sanskrit and during his life, he spoke of drawing from the Hindu text. The presence of the Bhagavad Gita in the middle of the sex scene prompted a member of India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government to call the film an \u201cattack on Hinduism\u201d. In an open letter, Uday Mahurkar, an information commissioner, said the scene was \u201ca direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\u201d. He alleged it amounted to \u201cwaging a war on the Hindu community\u201d and almost appeared to be part of a \u201clarger conspiracy by anti-Hindu forces\u201d. Anurag Thakur, the information and culture minister, was among those to demand that the scene be removed and called for action to be taken against India\u2019s Central Board of Film Certification. The film was rated U/A, which recommends parental guidance for viewers aged under 12. Oppenheimer has proved popular with Indian audiences, taking \u00a31.2m on the first day alone, the biggest box office opening day for a Hollywood film in India this year. The blockbuster is not the first to fall afoul of rightwing Hindu groups since the BJP government came to power. The BBC/Netflix television adaptation of A Suitable Boy was also accused of hurting religious sentiments by senior BJP ministers and subjected to police complaints for a scene of a Hindu girl and Muslim boy kissing near a temple. Tandav, an Amazon series, was forced to delete several scenes after its creators faced charges in court and were summoned by the BJP government for allegedly insulting Hindu gods and the office of the prime minister."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e14", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/tory-mp-anthony-browne-michael-gove-cambridge-housing-development-planning", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Gove\u2019s Cambridge housing development plans \u2018nonsense\u2019, says Tory MP", "lead": "Anthony Browne says he will oppose housing secretary\u2019s proposals for new urban quarter", "author": "Kiran Stacey Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 12:18:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679683", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c9857b3458041bb4e0a6b9bc860c4e1777983931/0_148_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Michael Gove\u2019s proposals for a redevelopment in Cambridge have triggered an angry response from a local Tory MP, who has promised to stand in the way of what he calls the housing secretary\u2019s \u201cnonsense plans\u201d. Gove told an audience in central London on Monday that he viewed the plans for a new urban quarter in Cambridge as his top priority on a list of similar schemes to kickstart housebuilding in urban areas. The plans are the centrepiece of the Conservatives\u2019 commitment to build 1m homes during the course of this parliament, and formed a large part of Gove\u2019s most significant speech on housing since taking over at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. But ministers\u2019 lack of powers to force through schemes in the face of local opposition were highlighted by resistance from Anthony Browne, the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire. Just half an hour before Gove was due to speak, Browne tweeted: \u201cI will do everything I can to stop the government\u2019s nonsense plans to impose mass housebuilding on Cambridge, where all major developments are now blocked by the Environment Agency because we have quite literally run out of water. Our streams, rivers and ponds already run dry.\u201d Asked about Browne\u2019s comments, Gove said he believed he could convince the Tory backbencher of the scheme\u2019s benefits. But he refused to say he would force through the plans even if local policymakers oppose them. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a compelling way forward. We can\u2019t have Cambridge \u2013 an exceptional city \u2013 being held back. \u201cThe members of parliament for Cambridgeshire, all of whom are friends of mine, I\u2019m looking forward to discussing our plans with [them] in order to make sure that we can have the maximum level of consensus and support for the work.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe in taking people with us and I believe that the vision that we\u2019ve outlined is one that will command support.\u201d Gove has put the regeneration of Cambridge city centre at the heart of his vision for housing in England. But the government remains well behind its target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s \u2013 a target that Gove changed last year to make it easier for councils not to comply. Labour is promising widespread planning changes should the party win the election that is likely to take place next year, including making it easier for councils to build on the green belt. Gove, however, has rejected that vision, prioritising urban development instead. His plans include spending an extra \u00a324m to help accelerate planning approvals, as well as another \u00a313m for a new team to help solve planning difficulties for major projects. That team will first be deployed to Cambridge. He said: \u201cThere is a distinction between the approach that Labour takes \u2013 which would be to add to those pressures without an answer on infrastructure \u2013 and the approach that we\u2019re taking, whereby when we\u2019re thinking about urban regeneration and the creation of new urban quarters, we\u2019re thinking about them with GP surgeries, primary schools, other services, and urban parkland and green spaces built in from the beginning.\u201d Critics point out that there are barriers to new urban housebuilding plans, not least the changes Gove brought in last year that make it easier for local authorities to reject development plans. Stewart Baseley, the executive chair of the Home Builders Federation, said: \u201cWhilst welcoming the recognition from government that it needs to act if we are to build more homes, the proposals do little to address the major reasons why housing supply is falling.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government needs to focus on why the planning process is collapsing and reverse the proposals to weaken the planning system that have now seen 59 local authorities withdraw their housing plans.\u201d In a wide-ranging speech focusing heavily on policy, Gove also gave updates on a range of other promises, including his promise to end the leasehold system in England. The housing secretary said he would legislate to improve rights for leaseholders in a number of ways, including limiting rises in ground rents, giving leaseholders more power to take control of the management of their properties, and reducing legal and insurance costs for leaseholders. But he confirmed that leasehold would remain a legal form of home ownership, triggering concern among some campaigners about the scope of his planned changes. Gove also promised that two big UK developers would be punished after failing to sign the government\u2019s contract to improve building safety after the Grenfell Tower fire. He did not say which developers had not signed or what the punishment would be, although in the past he has promised to impose a nationwide development ban on any company that refuses to comply."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e15", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/24/greta-thunberg-fined-for-disobeying-swedish-police-at-climate-protest", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Greta Thunberg fined for disobeying Swedish police at climate protest", "lead": "Activist had pleaded not guilty on grounds she acted out of necessity at demonstration that blocked oil trucks in Malm\u00f6", "author": "Damien Gayle and agency", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 12:02:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679703", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c3cb61edc82dd23628134e0d45309979ce2f97e8/965_310_6715_4031/500.jpg", "body": "Greta Thunberg has been fined by a Swedish court after she was found guilty of disobeying a police order to leave a climate protest.

Forest sprite protagonist Mavka (voiced in the English version by Laurie Hymes) is a fetchingly designed ingenue with green hair, disproportionally large doe eyes and magical healing skills, who lives in a part of the forest where humans no longer go, thanks to an old treaty between them and the forest spirits. But wealthy villainess Kalina wants to acquire an elixir from a magic tree in the forest that keeps her from ageing, so she sends a guileless young musician hunk named Lucas in to the forest to find it \u2013 and he promptly makes friends/falls in love with Mavka. All this is very much in the tradition of Rapunzel by way of Disney\u2019s Tangled, with a big dash of Ferngully: The Last Rainforest, while the animal sidekicks \u2013 such as cat-frog Swampy and a mobile tree spirit/talking log named Frol \u2013 are like fractionally cuter versions of the genetically engineered abominations from The Island of Doctor Moreau. Squint very, very hard and you might be able to divine an allegory in there about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Kalina representing Russian aggressors who only want to strip the forest of its resources. The local peasants, unusually for these sort of films, are very much coded as being from a specific country, what with their red and white traditional Ukrainian dress and tendency to break into throat singing when the mood takes them. Towards the end, Mavka must access a spark of rage \u2013 a literal spark, in fact \u2013 and it\u2019s this fury that she kindles that gives her the strength to match the powers of the invaders. OK, so the spark isn\u2019t shaped like a cluster bomb or an M1 Abrams battle tank, but the parallels between Mavka and the Zelenskiy regime, discovering inner combative resilience with help from outside agents, is just there on the table, waiting to be parsed. The colour palette is eye-searingly hypersaturated and viewers over the age of eight may consider this a mildly offensive weapon in itself. However, the character animation and movement are thoughtful and well done. Most importantly, the music is lovely, especially the Ukrainian songs \u2013 because who doesn\u2019t love a bit of throat singing? \u2022 Mavka: The Forest Song is released on 28 July in UK and Irish cinemas."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e17", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/proms-at-sage-gateshead-review-festival-goes-north-for-euphoric-weekend-that-moves-from-brahms-to-barking-like-dogs", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Proms at Sage Gateshead review \u2013 festival goes north for euphoric weekend that moves from Brahms to barking like dogs", "lead": "With concerts encompassing pop, classical, jazz and a CBeebies family extravaganza, the Proms took over Sage Gateshead for a triumphant communal experience that underlined how music can connect us", "author": "Dave Simpson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:59:28", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679739", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bf17dc996e16b9fe208cc43bf3dd69a78334da1b/0_18_3673_2204/500.jpg", "body": "\u2018I\u2019ll pretend it\u2019s me and my friends and we\u2019re just chilling,\u201d jokes Rebecca Lucy Taylor, better known as Self Esteem, admitting to feeling \u201cquite nervous\u201d at the start of her debut performance with a live orchestra. Behind her are the strings, horns, keyboards and percussion of the Royal Northern Sinfonia (RNS). In front of her, an audience are making a noise that conductor Robert Ames later compares to \u201ca jet engine\u201d. The whole thing is being recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 3. No pressure. The world\u2019s largest classical music festival may still be synonymous with the Royal Albert Hall, but the fastest selling concert in Sage Gateshead\u2019s history kicks off the Proms\u2019 first ever festival weekend outside London. This year, the festival travels to towns including Aberystwyth, Great Yarmouth and Dewsbury. \u201cThis is the most ambitious thing we\u2019ve done to date. We don\u2019t want the Proms to just feel like a London festival,\u201d says Proms director David Pickard. \u201cWhen Sir Henry Wood started the Proms in 1895, the original mission was to bring the world of classical music to a widest possible audience. All we\u2019re doing is reinterpreting that.\u201d The programme has been carefully curated in conjunction with the Sage, the result reflecting the north \u2013 Self Esteem is from Rotherham \u2013 and the way we now listen to music. The six concerts stretch from pop to classical to jazz to the now traditional Proms CBeebies concert, conceived to introduce younger children to the power of live music. There is certainly no doubting that on Friday night, with the removal of most seating from Sage One, the atmosphere was one of increasing euphoria. Taylor sings about modern issues facing women, from self-worth to predatory men, with big choruses. The conductor/arranger Ames has worked also with Taylor Swift and Radiohead, and he and Taylor make an inspired pairing. \u201cSelf Esteem\u2019s acclaimed Prioritise Pleasure album has orchestral elements and leans towards left-field atonal sound,\u201d Ames tells me backstage, and it is notable how he has ensured that the orchestra is an integral part of Self Esteem\u2019s music, rather than a separate, added entity. The inventive arrangements emphasise the songs\u2019 strength and the delicately beautiful strings allow Taylor and four female backing singers\u2019 voices space to soar. Taylor sings George Michael\u2019s Praying For Time for the first time live, but delivers it spellbindingly. If anyone has any lingering preconceptions about orchestral music being stuffy, they should surely be dashed as Taylor cheekily introduces the song Fucking Wizardry \u201chere on the BBC\u201d. The audience bark like dogs (a feature of her song I\u2019m Fine) as increasing audience participation makes for a triumphant communal experience in the best tradition of the Proms. Shortly afterwards, in the smaller Sage Two, British-Bahraini trumpeter/flugelhorn player Yazz Ahmed may seem a world away from Self Esteem. However, her songs inspired by \u201ccourageous women\u201d and \u201clives lost crossing the Mediterranean for a better future\u201d also tell a modern story, while her music, too, roams through genres, from jazz to Arabic to electronica. Pickard might have seemed optimistic in hoping that people would come to see Self Esteem on Friday and stick around for Saturday night\u2019s big classical event. However, prommers of all ages are here on Saturday to see the RNS demonstrate its mettle with some tempestuous Mozart before driving Brahms\u2019 Symphony No 2 to a pulverising climax, which leads the woman behind me to exclaim: \u201cSo powerful. Ohh!\u201d Over coffee in the foyer, Sage\u2019s managing director, Abigail Pogson, who grew up in Bridlington, Yorkshire, tells me that they tried to give the programme \u201ca north-east feel, but not in a slavish way\u201d. Saturday\u2019s late-night choir concert reflects the region\u2019s traditions of community and choral singing. The mesmeric combined voices of the Chorus of Royal Northern Sinfonia, Voices of the River\u2019s Edge and Massed Voices of the North East rework nocturnally themed songs ranging from Elgar to Wagner to Laura Mvula\u2019s Sing to the Moon and a stunning arrangement of Depeche Mode\u2019s Enjoy the Silence. More surprisingly, but delightfully, the acclaimed fusion clarinettist Arun Ghosh may be Calcutta-born, Bolton-reared and perform in an Indian kurta, but he peppers an emotional set with regional references. There is a song about the northern lights (Aurora) and a beautifully melancholic take on Geordie boy Mark Knopfler\u2019s Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero). \u201cLocal songs for local people,\u201d says Ghosh, grinning. By Sunday, a theme has emerged of the ways music can connect us. Angel-voiced, Grammy-nominated countertenor Reginald Mobley and stellar French jazz pianist Baptiste Trotignon take us on a magical and deeply moving journey through the African American spiritual. They are timeless songs that have resurfaced everywhere from Woodstock to acid house and Moby, and Mobley\u2019s powerful voice and obvious empathy make them sound fresh and impactful. The main hall packs with tots as Royal Northern Sinfonia (led by the red-jacketed, broadly grinning and visibly enthusiastic conductor Kwam\u00e9 Ryan) and the CBeebies Ocean Adventure reveal the secret sauce for turning under-fives on to environmental issues and live orchestral classical music: dolphins, whale song, lively TV presenters Chantelle Lindsay and Rory Crawford and much-loved cartoon characters JoJo and Gran Gran. Our 11-year-old is far too mature for this sort of thing now, but the inaugural regional Proms weekend notches up another convert when he says: \u201cThe best bit is definitely the music.\u201d \u2022 Listen to the concerts on BBC Sounds, all available until 8 October.

After being comprehensively beaten again by Verstappen at the Hungarian Grand Prix, Wolff observed that at very best Mercedes might only be considered quick in a field of cars that excluded the Red Bulls. Verstappen won at the Hungaroring by almost 34 seconds from McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris. Hamilton had started on pole but was passed by Verstappen, Norris and his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri through the opening corners. The British driver came back strongly in the final stages but could still only manage fourth. He said afterwards he felt he had not been performing at his best for more than a year and insisted the result in Hungary reflected the reality that despite the pole, Mercedes were not fast enough. Wolff felt their car\u2019s ultimate pace was enough to have beaten the McLarens but admitted Red Bull remained in a different league to Mercedes. \u201cWe can talk it up and say we could have been or would have been second,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is irrelevant because you have a car in front that is 34 seconds clear and probably he was cruising for a long time. That\u2019s the bitter reality.\u201d After a captivating qualifying session on Saturday in which Hamilton pipped Verstappen by three\u2011thousandths of a second, there was optimism a decent fight might be on the cards for Sunday. But Red Bull\u2019s race pace, with a series of upgrades employed in Budapest, proved unmatchable. Verstappen\u2019s teammate, Sergio P\u00e9rez, also moved through the pack from ninth to finish third. So much was the differential Wolff said that while Mercedes had some form in Hungary it was only in terms of light-heartedly comparing the rest of the field to representing F1\u2019s feeder series. \u201cAs surprising as it sounds in terms of pace, it was quick in terms of the rest of the world,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cIn the F2 pack it was quick, the F1 car won by 34 seconds \u2026\u201d With their 12th win in a row in Budapest on Sunday, Red Bull broke McLaren\u2019s 35-year-old record of 11 consecutive wins in 1988. That feat was celebrated by the team principal, Christian Horner. \u201cTo break that record from 1988, which I remember watching [Ayrton] Senna, [Alain] Prost, the great McLaren team led by Ron Dennis,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think it has taken 35 years but we are the team to break that, particularly to think about the quality of the opposition we are competing against, is a phenomenal achievement.\u201d Wolff also reaffirmed that it was up to his team to do better in a season dominated by Red Bull, which \u2013 as he knows from the periods of Mercedes supremacy \u2013 is not appealing to fans. \u201cWe just need to work better and get ourselves back into contention,\u201d he said. \u201cMany fans would have left frustrated after Saturday thinking that we were really close together, keen to watch what happens on Sunday and then they see one car just disappear into the sunset.\u201d Wolff said Mercedes would continue to push to improve this year\u2019s car, especially given the exceptional advances McLaren have made with their most recent set of upgrades. He also confirmed work on next year\u2019s car was proceeding apace and that the team were investigating all options in bridging the gap to Red Bull. \u201cWe need a lot of changes in 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cThe direction our team is developing is really quite interesting \u2013 we see opportunities and we are leaving no stone unturned, looking at every single concept. Every single concept that we have seen on other cars, whether that is powerful or not, whether this of any use for us.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e19", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/tory-turmoil-blamed-for-delays-in-tackling-islamophobia-within-party", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tory turmoil blamed for delays in tackling Islamophobia within party", "lead": "Independent reviewer says party has taken \u2018for ever\u2019 to focus on recommendations in his 2021 report", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:46:49", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679776", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/50d77b149dc1729c4c4e86a630203f7c25771a23/0_405_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Turmoil within the Conservative party is behind delays in implementing plans to tackle Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination within its ranks, an independent reviewer has said. Two years since the publication of his report on Islamophobia among Tories, Prof Swaran Singh said it had taken \u201cfor ever\u201d for officials to focus on the recommendations, with the biggest problem being tackling issues at a local level. Singh said the number of Conservative leaders and chairs over the two-year period \u2013 three and seven respectively \u2013 had an impact on the party\u2019s ability to fulfil the recommendations. His original report, which found that claims of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d were not borne out by evidence, was condemned in 2021 as a whitewash by Muslim Tories despite it including criticism of the language used by Boris Johnson and the mayoral campaign run by Zac Goldsmith for insensitivity. Key findings from a review published on Monday included Singh\u2019s observation that the party has no formal measures in place to handle complaints relating to discriminatory behaviour involving its most senior members. It added that some senior members told the review that mechanisms already existed to create an independent panel to investigate complaints against the most senior figures but this appeared to be \u201cad hoc\u201d and there was an absence of any documented formal procedure to reflect this. The review also found there had been 212 complaints relating to 137 incidents in the three months up to June 2022. Five complaints were categorised as bullying or intimidation, three cited sexual assault, two referred to criminal activity and one was about a member writing on an \u201calt-right\u201d website. One case singled out for further investigation in the review was that of a complainant who was further distressed by no sanction being completed after nearly a year from the judgment \u2013 and the offending continued \u201cundeterred\u201d. \u201cNo apology has been offered to the complainant, or demanded of the respondents, despite the panel imposing other sanctions,\u201d said the review. Churn at the top of the Tories was said to have had an \u201cunavoidable impact on the day-to-day running\u201d of the party, Singh said, adding: \u201cIt just took forever for them to focus on this.\u201d In a statement released as part of the review, he said: \u201cWe were happy to see that, after having fully accepted the recommendations of our investigation, the party has made real progress in implementing them.\u201d \u201cHowever, there remains a gap between the good intentions of the party leadership and lasting change at grassroots level, and a number of important areas still need to be addressed.\u201d \u201cWhile any such programme of change will inevitably take time, we urge the party to redouble its efforts as it strives to become a fully inclusive organisation.\u201d In other findings, the review said that awareness of and engagement in updated party policies and training was \u201cmixed\u201d at a local level. The party had also produced a large amount of documentation in response to the recommendations, it added, \u201cbut this has not necessarily led to a corresponding change in awareness or action on the ground\u201d. Training compliance among party volunteers also remained low, and there was a feeling that expectations of volunteers on the part of Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) were increasing, but that local officers were not always offered the support they needed. The Conservative party\u2019s chairman, Greg Hands, said he was extremely grateful for the work on the review, which he said would help the party to \u201cfurther improve\u201d how it dealt with complaints. He said: \u201cThe party has made significant progress on Professor Singh\u2019s recommendations with 25 complete and just six ongoing. There is however still work to be done and this is a process of continual improvement.\u201d Among recommendations that they wanted to see within six months, Singh and his team said that the party should review and improve how it communicated with complainants and respondents and review whether complaints against members at the most senior level in the party should be handled by an independent body."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e1a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/vox-partys-hardline-attitudes-appear-to-have-turned-off-spanish-voters", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vox party\u2019s hardline attitudes appear to have turned off Spanish voters", "lead": "Party has been relegated to near-irrelevance as Spain bucks European trend of shift towards far right", "author": "Ashifa Kassam in Madrid", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:46:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679798", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/160db83eabacf928dbc07f680ab805f301256a36/0_209_4491_2695/500.jpg", "body": "About 10 months ago, a smiling Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, proudly described the northern region of Castilla y Le\u00f3n as a model of what lay ahead for the party. The sparsely populated region, where the far right had made its first foray into a Spanish regional government since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, was a \u201cshowroom\u201d for the party\u2019s promises to do away with Spanish laws on abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality and violence against women. Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Abascal added in the interview with Spanish radio, was \u201can example of the alternative Spain needs\u201d. His words may have proved prescient, but not in the way he intended: Sunday\u2019s snap general election saw Vox lose five of the six seats it won in Castilla y Le\u00f3n in the 2019 vote. This downward trend played out across Spain, as Vox saw its vote count drop from the 15% it received in 2019 to 12%. The loss \u2013 amounting to about 623,000 votes \u2013 sent the party\u2019s representation in the country\u2019s parliament plummeting from 52 to 33 seats. Polls had predicted that the seat count of the far-right party would drop in Sunday\u2019s general election. But the loss was widely expected to be compensated for by the party\u2019s emergence as the election\u2019s kingmaker, potentially paving the way for a coalition government \u2013 led by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) \u2013 which would have included the far right for the first time since Spain returned to democracy after Franco\u2019s death five decades ago. Instead the combined result between the PP and Vox came to 169 seats, falling short of the 176 needed for a majority in the 350-seat parliament. While a potential PP-Vox coalition may be able to garner one or two votes from smaller parties, the bulk of these will be unlikely to agree to any deal that could ease Vox\u2019s path to power. Sunday\u2019s result suggested that Vox\u2019s hardline attitudes, epitomised by a massive banner erected in central Madrid that showed a hand tossing symbols representing feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, Catalan independence, climate crisis action and communism into a bin, appeared to have turned off voters. The party\u2019s recent foray into regional and municipal power across the country, where it racked up headlines over the cancellation of a movie screening due to a kiss between two women, an attempted crackdown on access to abortion, and its vetoing of a theatrical adaptation of Virginia Woolf\u2019s gender-shifting novel Orlando, may have also proved unpalatable to some. The disappearance of the conservative Ciudadanos party \u2013 whose vote is believed to have gone primarily to the PP \u2013 meant Vox\u2019s seat count may have also been slightly penalised by an electoral system weighted in favour of larger parties. While Vox remains the third most voted-for party nationally, the results relegate it to political near-irrelevance. The party failed to meet the parliamentary threshold to present no-confidence motions and legally challenge the constitutionality of legislative measures. Even so, Abascal avoided any sort of reflection on his party\u2019s performance on Sunday. Instead, he lashed out at the Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. \u201cI would like to point out something that is bad news for many Spaniards,\u201d Abascal told supporters. \u201cDespite losing the election, Pedro S\u00e1nchez can block the formation of a new government. Worst still, Pedro S\u00e1nchez could even be invested as prime minister with the help of communists, separatists and terrorists.\u201d Spain\u2019s snap election had taken on a wider significance across Europe as analysts painted it as a barometer of Europeans\u2019 shifting attitude towards the far right. It was a point driven home by Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, during a video link appearance at a Vox rally in Valencia earlier this month. Pointing to governments in Italy, Finland, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic, Meloni argued that the time had come for \u201cpatriots\u201d. She added: \u201cFor all of us it is crucial that on 23 July a conservative patriotic alternative is established, in which Vox plays a leading and decisive role in the formation of the new national government.\u201d But it appears Spain bucked the tide, pointed out Jordi \u00c9vole, one of Spain\u2019s best-known television personalities on the left. \u201cThe extreme right, which is in its best moment across much of Europe, is losing votes and seats in Spain,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cToday, more than ever, VIVA ESPA\u00d1A.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e1b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/24/female-firefighters-in-kent-made-to-strip-to-underwear-in-front-of-male-colleagues", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Female firefighters in Kent made to strip to underwear in front of male colleagues, union says ", "lead": "FBU says \u2018unnecessary, degrading practice\u2019 at Kent fire and rescue service must end", "author": "Kevin Rawlinson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:33:22", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679818", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/47fe91ad0a813da9b511b80ab371c3cf204d60aa/0_158_4724_2835/500.jpg", "body": "Female firefighters are being forced to strip down to their underwear in full view of their male colleagues and the wider public, in an \u201cunnecessary, degrading practice\u201d being enforced by an English brigade, their representatives have said. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU), frustrated at what it sees as \u201cchronic management inaction\u201d, has written to the official inspector to demand an end to the practice at Kent fire and rescue service. A few months ago a scathing report from His Majesty\u2019s inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue services (HMICFRS) detailed \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d behaviour throughout the emergency service in England. \u201cFire stations are workplaces \u2013 and it is unacceptable that firefighters are being put in the position of stripping down to their underwear in full view of colleagues, or even the public,\u201d said the FBU general secretary, Matt Wrack. The union said firefighters were being made to strip down at stations \u201cprior to donning fire kit when attending operational incidents\u201d. It said it contacted the Kent brigade\u2019s chief fire officer, Ann Millington, in May after concerns were raised via the union\u2019s national women\u2019s committee. The union added: \u201cShe also appeared to defend the practice, stating that stripping down to underwear could prevent overheating.\u201d In the face of Millington\u2019s denial, the FBU said its officials had personally witnessed it happening. In his letter to HMICFRS, Wrack wrote: \u201cTo be clear, this is not common practice elsewhere; the accepted practice is that fire kit is donned over cotton workwear.\u201d The complaint has followed the HMICFRS report released in March that found every fire brigade in England was plagued with bullying, harassment and discrimination complaints. Writing to the inspectorate, Wrack said the response from Millington, a lead figure in the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), highlighted the \u201cvery cultural problems we are trying to eradicate\u201d from the emergency service. In particular, he noted Millington\u2019s claim in response to the union\u2019s letter that no official complaint had been made about the issue. \u201cIt is naive at best for the chief fire officer to argue that ... As HMICFRS has noted, many people are reluctant to report situations and behaviours for fear of a hostile reaction, a refusal to act or attempts to dismiss their concerns.\u201d He said the union also raised the matter in June with the NFCC chair, Mark Hardingham, and the fire minister, Chris Philp, but that neither directly addressed the issue in their responses. \u201cThis episode demonstrates chronic management inaction. The problems in the fire service go right to the top,\u201d Wrack said. Millington said: \u201cCrews told us that wearing trousers under firefighting leggings makes them feel hotter, and practically all of them, men and women, wanted the option not to wear trousers under PPE. Especially at this time during warmer weather, many firefighters raised the discomfort of trousers becoming sweaty under leggings and said it can become very uncomfortable. \u201cIndividuals who choose not to wear trousers under PPE are expected to be aware of their own privacy/dignity and that of their colleagues while undressing behind open fire engine doors. \u201cI would like to add that we have previously offered to discuss this matter with the FBU, and they have not responded.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to see fire and rescue services where professional standards are upheld and everyone is treated with respect. We hope the local Fire Brigades Union representatives can work collectively with Kent fire and rescue to resolve any concerns.\u201d The NFCC has been approached for comment."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e1c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/24/the-smeds-and-the-smoos-review-songs-and-screams-in-donaldson-and-schefflers-jolly-voyage", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Smeds and the Smoos review \u2013 songs and screams in Donaldson and Scheffler\u2019s jolly voyage", "lead": "This show from Tall Stories brings children into the action with a gentle warmth, squeal-inducing gags and engaging puppetry", "author": "Miriam Gillinson", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:16:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679837", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb37e67cdd7df862f1816c8e39ae181ea01f9e2/0_270_8104_4864/500.jpg", "body": "Tall Stories know a thing or two about adapting Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler\u2019s books for the stage.

The dramaturgy isn\u2019t perfect (too much filler!) but this is my son Benji\u2019s first visit to a proper theatre and, other than a few lapses in concentration, he has a wonderful time. The director, Toby Mitchell, and the designer, Barney George, have pitched the atmosphere and visuals really well. The Smeds and the Smoos and their barmy planet is conjured up with a few choice props; a jaggedy jiggly plant here and a purple sprouting flower there. It is all very impressive, but never overwhelming. The use of narrators (Tom Capper is particularly engaging) helps to echo the intimacy of the bedtime story routine \u2013 only everything is just that bit bigger and brighter, with a few jolly songs thrown in for good measure. After Smed Janet (an expressive Felicia Akin-Tayo) and Smoo Bill (a peppy Robert Penny) disappear, their two warring families set off in pursuit of the runaway lovebirds. The gang embark on an epic adventure through outer space but things are kept nicely low-key. The rocket is represented by a few cardboard cutouts; outer space by a smattering of twinkling stars. Yvonne Stone\u2019s puppets do just enough to grab our attention without pushing too hard. There is a green and gooey-monster, a lumbering lurgle and some floating Gruffalo heads that very nearly steal the show. It is just the script that slightly falters. Lots of ad-libs are threaded through the original text and they are not very helpful: they disrupt the rhythm and dilute Donaldson\u2019s clever repetitions, which are so important in maintaining momentum. Jon Fiber and Andy Shaw\u2019s songs are bright and lifting but the lyrics feel a little flat. The joy of The Smeds and the Smoos is largely to be found in the nonsense language, but all those wonderful new words (\u201cthe trockles grew tall/and the glompoms smelled good \u2026\u201d) are slightly lost in this thinner and overstretched script. However, what\u2019s lost in the language is made up for with lots of lovely visual gags. Benji looks as if he is about to explode with excitement as the Smeds carry out a very silly swimming routine and invite the audience to join in. There are also lots of nice little panto moments, as the children are encouraged to point and scream and generally let loose. Snacks are happily snacked on. Squeals are loudly squealed forth and there\u2019s a general air of ease and engagement, which an awful lot of adult theatre would do well to learn from.

O\u2019Brien joined the union after dropping out of college at age 19 to haul equipment on construction sites in 1991. Thirty-two years later, he is on the verge of leading the union in one of the biggest \u2013 and costliest \u2013 strikes at a single private employer in US history. The Teamsters have 1.2 million members, making it one of the largest unions in the world. Its membership is diverse, ranging from police to bakers, but it is most famous for representing freight drivers and warehouse workers. The shipping and logistics giant UPS is the single largest employer in the Teamsters Union. Under O\u2019Brien, the Teamster\u2019s general president, the contract negotiations between the two have become a test case for a union giant that is flexing its muscles after corporations have stonewalled nascent labor movements at Starbucks and Amazon with long delays toward a first contract. \u201cWe are going to set the tone \u2013 and we have \u2013 for how organized labor should deal with corporate America, with politicians, and how they should stand up and fight. We will set the example through this situation with UPS whether we get a deal or if UPS chooses not to do the right thing to strike themselves,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. UPS\u2019s 340,000 workers have authorized industrial action unless the two sides can agree on a new contract by the end of July. Talks have broken down and the US faces its largest strike since about 675,000 telephone workers walked off the job in 1983 \u2013 a strike that could cause chaos in a country still feeling the after-effects of the pandemic\u2019s supply chain crisis. Economic estimates of a UPS strike\u2019s impact suggest it could be the costliest in at least a century, with an estimated $7bn in losses for a 10-day work stoppage. Consumers reliant on home deliveries, medical supplies and business inventory will all be hit. But O\u2019Brien argued the responsibility for the effects of a strike on the public falls on UPS \u2013 and that other corporations should take note. \u201cUPS knows what our members\u2019 wants, needs and demands are, and if there is a labor strike over this, I want to be clear: the public should know this and everybody else should know that UPS will be striking. They know what our members want. They know what our members deserve.\u201d The looming strike could lead off a summer of labor unrest in the US as thousands of hotel workers in California, TV and film writers, and most recently, thousands of TV and film actors have walked off the job. Additionally, 150,000 autoworkers are prepping for a possible huge strike in the fall in the lead-up to new contract negotiations. O\u2019Brien had a meteoric rise at the Teamsters. He was elected president/principal officer of Local 25 in 2006 at the age of 34, the youngest to achieve that feat, and became eastern region vice-president of Teamsters International in 2011. But his career was almost derailed after a clash with James Hoffa, the longtime Teamsters president and son of the notorious Teamsters boss and mafia associate Jimmy Hoffa. O\u2019Brien had been the Teamsters\u2019 top negotiator with UPS during its union contract negotiations for 2018. But Hoffa fired him in 2017 after only six months in a move some saw as political payback for his championing of Teamsters members who had not supported Hoffa in his last presidential election \u2013 allegations that Hoffa\u2019s supporters denied. Discontent with the past UPS contract catalyzed a changing of the guard among the Teamsters\u2019 leadership. The following union leadership election in 2021 was the first time in 25 years that James Hoffa was not on the ballot. O\u2019Brien ran for president of the union and won by a landslide after campaigning on taking a more aggressive approach toward UPS and new organizing efforts at Amazon. \u201cWe had weak leadership in the past administration, and we just wanted to make certain that we enrolled our members to fight for what is right and just,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cThe previous administration didn\u2019t have its members\u2019 best interests at hand and that\u2019s when I made my decision to run for general president.\u201d Since assuming leadership of the Teamsters, O\u2019Brien has taken a more aggressive approach toward anti-union animus from corporations and politicians. The Teamsters are trying to organize Amazon, which has successfully fought grassroots labor movements to a standstill. \u201cYou have an employer like Jeff Bezos taking a joyride into space, and he bangs on his workers to be able to fund his trip,\u201d O\u2019Brien said last year. O\u2019Brien hasn\u2019t been shy in taking on Washington DC either. During a Senate hearing in March 2023, Markwayne Mullin, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, got into a heated argument with O\u2019Brien over the senator\u2019s opposition to union organizing. Mullin called the Teamsters boss a \u201cloudmouth bully\u201d and challenged O\u2019Brien to a charity mixed martial arts cage match. \u201cAnyplace, Anytime cowboy,\u201d O\u2019Brien replied on Twitter. \u201cHe\u2019s a juvenile delinquent, he has a big ego and a small mind. He\u2019s one of 100 people in this country who should be setting an example, and unfortunately, he wants to be a schoolyard bully, and that\u2019s OK, at some point in time that will be addressed. But the cage fight I\u2019m more focused on right now is the cage fight on behalf of 340,000 members at UPS,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. As the 31 July deadline for a deal approaches, UPS workers around the US have held practice pickets and rallies to highlight demands of the workforce and prepare for a possible strike. \u201cThey\u2019re fired up, but most importantly they\u2019re fed up,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cTo say the least, it\u2019s one of the most impressive campaigns I\u2019ve ever been involved in.\u201d The union has secured agreements with UPS on some significant issues such as installing air conditioners in delivery vehicles, but the union and UPS are still far apart on economic issues. On 5 July, the Teamsters were in negotiations with UPS, pushing for higher wages for part-time employees, higher wages for new hires, higher wages for full-timers, an increase in more full-time jobs, and protecting and improving pensions and healthcare benefits. O\u2019Brien said about 95% of the contract was resolved when UPS walked away from the negotiating table, claiming it had nothing left to give. UPS accused the union of walking away from the negotiating table. \u201cWe remain focused on reaching an agreement with the Teamsters that is a win for UPS employees, our customers, our union, and our company before Aug 1. While we have made great progress and are close to reaching an agreement, we have a responsibility as an essential service provider to take steps to help ensure we can deliver our customers\u2019 packages if the Teamsters choose to strike,\u201d a UPS spokesperson said in a recent statement announcing that the company is currently training managers for business continuity plans if a strike occurs. Talks are now back on, but as 1 August approaches, the issues remain. O\u2019Brien said that UPS had reported record profits during the course of the current five-year contract, reaching a record $100bn in revenue in 2022 and reported profits of $12.89bn in 2021 and more than $13bn in 2022. With the recent strike threat looming, UPS has pushed back its second quarter earnings date to 8 August, the latest date it has ever posted mid-year earnings. \u201cThat answer is unacceptable on behalf of our members, especially when you made $100bn and everyone else that didn\u2019t touch a package, didn\u2019t deliver a package especially during the pandemic, got rewarded with very, very lucrative stock options provided to upper management in the hundreds of millions of dollars, investors got paid dividends at 50% higher than they were in January 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the while, everybody that touched and forwarded packages and provided goods and services to this company have yet to be rewarded and they just want our piece of the pie.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e1e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/24/new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-emissions-greenpeace-government-uk", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": " New North Sea oil and gasfields will emit as much carbon as 14m cars, report says", "lead": "Licences UK has approved in last two years will result in carbon dioxide matching annual emissions of Denmark, Greenpeace finds", "author": "Fiona Harvey Environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 11:00:08", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679876", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/902b57f92c97713ec8e6a049dda94419f516442e/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "New oil and gas licences for the North Sea that the UK government has approved in the past two years will produce as much carbon dioxide as the annual emissions of nearly 14m cars, or the entire yearly emissions of Denmark, analysis has shown. This amount \u2013 about 28m tonnes of carbon dioxide over the lifetimes of the fields \u2013 will be increased more than eightfold, if potential licences under consideration are also granted, according to data from public sources analysed by Greenpeace. Three large oil and gasfields have been approved since the International Energy Agency warned in May 2021 that no new developments of fossil fuels could be constructed if the world was to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The IEA report was conducted at the behest of the UK government, which was preparing to host the Cop26 climate summit. Since then, the government has put in place a \u201cclimate checkpoint\u201d, assessing potential new licences before drilling can take place. But the checks focus on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with exploring and operating new fields, rather than taking into account the emissions \u2013 known in climate jargon as \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions \u2013 that are generated from burning the fossil fuels produced from the fields. Greenpeace argues that failing to take these emissions into account in official impact assessments makes a mockery of the UK\u2019s climate goals. In a court case expected to be heard on Tuesday, the group will seek to establish that the government\u2019s actions are unlawful. Philip Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cAs large parts of Europe, North America and Asia are gripped by a hellish heatwave, we can see that the climate crisis is spiralling out of control, yet the government is insisting on massively expanding oil and gas drilling that will only make it worse. \u201cAs if that wasn\u2019t scandalous enough, when making these decisions ministers deliberately ignore the emissions from burning all these new fossil fuels. That\u2019s grossly irresponsible.\u201d Government ministers face a fresh assault on green issues. The byelection held in Boris Johnson\u2019s former seat, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, was judged to have been lost by Labour, which keenly targeted the seat but was defeated by a margin of 495 votes, because of voter concern over the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez). Ulez, which was originated by Johnson and stipulated by the Conservative energy secretary, Grant Shapps, in an agreement with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, will affect only one in 10 motorists. However, many people in the highly car-dependent constituency raised concerns before its rollout, scheduled for the end of August. The byelection result has revived a culture war in the media in which rightwing Conservatives and elements within the Labour party have pushed for rolling back green measures. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, stoked fears for the party\u2019s green commitments at the weekend, saying the party was \u201cdoing something very wrong\u201d. A Tory party source told the Guardian there would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be more to come from Shapps, who has repeatedly called Labour \u201cthe political wing of Just Stop Oil\u201d. Before the byelection result, the climate minister Graham Stuart said there was cross-party agreement on the need to achieve net zero but told the Guardian the Labour party was \u201cthe lunatic fringe\u201d. Khan is understood to want to push ahead with Ulez, with local campaigners arguing that the Uxbridge campaign was characterised by \u201cdirty tricks\u201d that misrepresented the scheme, and the mayor believes the reality would reassure voters. Sources within the Labour party told the Guardian Starmer was not feeling pressure to change his stance on green issues. Greenpeace will argue in the judicial review hearing that the government is reneging on its climate commitments by giving the green light to new oil and gasfields in the North Sea. The three largest approved since the IEA report are Jackdaw, Abigail and Talbot, the emissions from which are the equivalent of seven coal-fired power stations, according to Greenpeace. If Rosebank and Cambo, two other large fields under review, are approved the total will rise to about 240m tonnes of CO2, equivalent to running 64 coal-fired power plants for a year, or the annual emissions of Spain. Evans said: \u201cRishi Sunak\u2019s government seems to have stopped listening to the experts on climate. Instead, they are bending over backwards to promote the interests of the fossil fuel industry, at the expense of bill-payers and the climate.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cDevelopment proposals for oilfields under existing licences are a matter for the regulators, with the environmental impact of proposed developments subject to rigorous regulatory assessment, including a full environmental impact assessment and public consultation. \u201cThe transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we\u2019re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee. Sourcing gas domestically is also better for the environment as it has a lower carbon footprint than importing from abroad.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e1f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/24/no-sign-of-deal-on-uk-return-to-eu-horizon-science-programme", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No sign of deal on UK return to EU Horizon science programme ", "lead": "Negotiations stalling over London\u2019s request to quit atomic research organisation and for financial rebate", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll Brussels correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 10:57:57", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679896", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0594e9c43eb3b5614bca0a477efceaa99dad5bc1/0_171_5121_3073/500.jpg", "body": "The UK\u2019s return to the EU\u2019s \u00a385bn Horizon science research programme appears to be hanging by a thread after London\u2019s request to quit the associated atomic research organisation, Euratom. The delays are causing huge anxiety in the scientific community. Many anticipated a deal to return to the programme to be announced in early July but negotiations are going to the wire with no sign of final agreement yet on Euratom or rebates the UK wants to compensate for its late association with the programme. According to sources quoted by Research Professional News, a publication for academics, the European Commission has offered the UK the option of either exiting from Euratom or a financial adjustment but not both. Vivienne Stern, the chief executive of the vice-chancellors\u2019 group Universities UK, told the journal it was \u201clegitimate that the government is seeking a good deal\u201d, but that \u201cnobody\u2019s blood pressure can stand another several months of delay, and more delay would have a real, actual cost\u201d. Stern, who was a vocal bystander to the original negotiations in 2020, urged the commission to take \u201ca little step towards the UK\u201d. Diplomats in Brussels have yet to be briefed on the deal, suggesting it is still not signed off despite claims in London last week that it was \u201cclose\u201d. Stern also appeared to confirm the UK\u2019s position that the European Commission had not acknowledged the \u201cmaterial loss\u201d caused to the UK from a two-and-a-half-year absence from the seven-year programme. Under the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement, British contributions were to be based on research funds awarded to UK projects from 2019. The UK argued that contributions should be based on success rates in 2023, which would be much lower given the reduced applications to the fund due to the uncertainty over membership. Before Brexit the UK was one of the top beneficiaries of the Horizon programme and scientists are still eligible to apply for funding, which is underwritten by the UK government. However, the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s membership and its inability to lead pan-EU research while outside the programme has dealt a blow. Data from the European Commission shows a huge drop in awards to British science programmes since 2019. In that year, \u20ac959.3m (\u00a3828.8m) went to the UK in 1,364 grants, compared with \u20ac22.18m in 192 grants in 2023 to date. \u201cThere is a lot of water under this bridge and we just need pragmatism and an acknowledgment that there has been a material loss to the UK through the a deal,\u201d Stern told Research Professional adding there was \u201ca real risk that everyone stands on principle\u201d. Expectations that talks between Rishi Sunak and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on the sidelines of the recent Nato summit in Vilnius would seal the deal have been followed by radio silence. One source insisted that the European Commission would not be reopening the terms of the original deal post-Brexit. \u201cThat is [the vice-president of the European Commission for inter-institutional relations] Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s job \u2013 to be inflexible,\u201d the diplomat said. The UK had been a full member of Horizon Europe and would have remained in the programme through an \u201cassociate\u201d deal open to non-EU countries as part of the trade deal clinched in December 2020. But the EU delayed the ratification of the UK\u2019s associate membership and eventually admitted it was being withheld in retaliation over the row over Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. After a resolution to that row was brokered with a new Windsor framework, Von der Leyen promised re-entry to the programme would be swift. A UK government source said there was \u201cno update\u201d and negotiations continued. But they added that the alternative Pioneer programme being proposed by Sunak was a \u201cpretty strong\u201d alternative. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \u201cTalks are ongoing and no deal has been agreed or finalised. The EU has been approached for comment."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e20", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/daughter-hong-kong-activist-elmer-yuen-detained-national-security-police", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Daughter of Hong Kong exiled activist detained by national security police", "lead": "Mimi Mi Wahng Yuen, daughter of wanted pro-democracy activist Elmer Yuen, taken for questioning, according to local media", "author": "Helen Davidson in Taipei", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 10:56:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679914", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/49a3aa737302191534bfe0d71f880f02324e7db9/0_213_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "Hong Kong national security police have reportedly detained the daughter, son, and daughter-in-law of a wanted activist, in the latest move targeting the families of pro-democracy figures in exile. Mimi Mi Wahng Yuen, the daughter of Elmer Yuen, her brother Derek, and his wife, the legislator Eunice Yung, were taken for questioning on Monday morning, according to local media. Sing Tao Daily reported Mimi had only arrived from Los Angeles on Monday morning. Hong Kong police told the Guardian one man and two women had been detained but did not name them. \u201cThey are suspected of assisting persons wanted by police to continue to commit acts and engage in activities that endanger national security,\u201d a duty officer said in a statement. \u201cInvestigation is under way and further operations, including arrest, may be made. In conducting any operation, police will act on the basis of actual circumstances and according to the law.\u201d Elmer Yuen, 74, is accused of having encouraged foreign countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong officials and judges, online from the US, and promoting Hong Kong\u2019s self-determination. Derek Yuen is a former political adviser to the pro-establishment New People\u2019s party, of which his wife, Eunice Yung, is a member. Hong Kong Free Press reported Yung had cut ties with the elder Yuen in 2022, and called for him to return to Hong Kong after authorities issued an arrest warrant for him. Yung told media on Monday afternoon her home had been searched by 10 national security police, and she was questioned for three hours. \u201cI cooperated with the police and have told them everything I know. I know the police have made up their mind to seek evidence relating to the eight wanted [activists] and I support the police action,\u201d she said, according to the Hong Kong Free Press. Yung said she was innocent and wanted to protect her family. She said she had warned her husband not to involve himself with anyone suspected of violating the national security law and that if she knew of Elmer Yuen\u2019s whereabouts she would \u201cdefinitely disclose it to the police\u201d. Media reported Derek Yuen was still being questioned at the time of his wife\u2019s press conference, and was later released without taking questions from press. Authorities in Hong Kong recently announced bounties of HK$1m (\u00a399,500) on eight activists wanted for arrest. All are based overseas, including the UK, US and Australia, and are accused of continuing to violate the 2020 national security law while in exile. All eight left Hong Kong after the introduction of the law, which authorities have wielded as part of an expansive crackdown on pro-democracy opposition after the 2019 mass protests. The activists are Nathan Law, Anna Kwok, Finn Lau, Dennis Kwok, Ted Hui, Kevin Yam, Mung Siu-tat and Yuen, high-profile pro-democracy activists, former lawmakers and legal scholars, who the police said \u201cencouraged sanctions \u2026 to destroy Hong Kong\u201d. The bounties were condemned at the time by the UK, US, and Australian governments. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said the arrest warrants were a \u201cfurther example of the authoritarian reach of China\u2019s extraterritorial law\u201d. The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Hong Kong\u2019s attempts to apply the law outside its borders were \u201ca dangerous precedent that threatens the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people all over the world\u201d. Two of the activists \u2013 Hui and Lam \u2013 live in Australia. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Penny Wong, said Canberra had repeatedly expressed concern about the national security law\u2019s application and was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with the warrants. The questioning of Yuen\u2019s family on Monday is at least the fourth action against the families of wanted activists this month by the national security police division, which was formed in 2020 to enforce the controversial law. This month, officers raided the home of Law\u2019s family, and last week they raided the homes of the families of Kwok and the UK-based labour activist Christopher Mung. Kwok\u2019s brother and relatives of Mung were among people taken away for questioning by the police. Police at the time said the questioning related to suspicion of \u201cassisting the fugitives to continue to engage in acts that endanger national security\u201d."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e21", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jul/24/germany-v-morocco-womens-world-cup-2023-live", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Germany 6-0 Morocco: Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Minute-by-minute report:</strong> Alexandra Popp scored twice as Germany made a real statement of intent against the World Cup debutantes from North Africa", "author": "Barry Glendenning", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 10:54:47", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.679932", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/41d0abb24209dae064bd899138799d595b11b934/0_0_3769_2262/500.jpg", "body": "Group H: \u201cIt was evident from the first whistle that Morocco were not going to be able to keep a clean sheet for long and after a slower first half the Euro 2022 runners-up brushed the debutants aside with an emphatic 6-0 victory,\u201d writes Jo Khan from the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium \u2026 Germany beat Morocco: The first Arab nation to play at a Women\u2019s World Cup, Morocco certainly didn\u2019t disgrace themselves but their inability to deal with crosses really cost them. Having gone down to two Alexandra Popp goals in the first half, the game really got away from Reynald Pedros\u2019s side immediately after the break when Germany scored within 30 seconds of the restart. Back-to-back own goals from Morocco kept the scoreboard ticking over until Lea Schuller wrapped up the proceedings for Germany in the closing stages. Peep! Peep! Peeeeep! It\u2019s all over in Melbourne, where Germany have swattted the World Cup debutantes aside and made a real statement of intent. 90+8 min: Lea Schuller tries her luck with a piledriver from outside the penalty area but it\u2019s blocked by a defender. 90+5 min: Germany have an effort ruled out for offside after Schuller had planted a downward header between the legs of Er-Rmichi after getting on the end of a flick-on. We\u2019ll have nine minutes of added time. It seems a little harsh on Morocco, who I\u2019m sure would welcome the final whistle right now. German substitute Nicole Anyomi would certainly have welcomed it a minute ago as she\u2019s just shipped a clearance in the face from close range It\u2019s a tennis score! And not a flattering one for Morocco, who are being bageld by their opposition. Lea Schuller slots into an empty net after Khadija Er-Rmichi had made a decent save from close range, only for the ball to drop at the feet of the substitute. 89 min: Germany make another substitution, bringing on Chantal Hagel in place of Jule Brand. 86 min: Morocco create a half-chance from a corner which Germany failed to clear properly. With some nifty footwork, Rosella Ayane creates an opening and shoots low towards the German goal. Her fairly feeble effort is saved comfortably by Frohms. 82 min: Alexandra Popp has been susbstituted and won\u2019t be completing her hat-trick. She\u2019s replaced by Laura Freigang. 82 min: Morocco defender Elodie Nakkach hurt her head in that most unseemly scramble and is replaced. She looks like she might be concussed. Morocco double-substitution: Nakkach and Mrabet off, Nesryne El Chad and Najat Badri on. Germany make it five! What a mess. The ball\u2019s send into the Morocco penalty area, where goalkeeper Er-Rmichi punches the ball on to the head of Mrabet, her own defender. It ricochet\u2019s goalwards and standing on the line, Redouani desperately tries to clear the ball, only to help it over the line. Just to make sure, Alexandra Popp barges through the melee to finish the job. That\u2019s an own goal and it\u2019s being attributed to Mrabet. 78 min: Brand stands the ball up in the Morocco six-yard box but it\u2019s headed out for a corner by Redouani. 75 min: The German substitute Anyomi is booked for a clumsy challenge on Zineb Redouani, who goes to ground smacking the turf in pain. It\u2019s the first yellow card of the game. 73 min: With Germany having put the game well out of Morocco\u2019s reach, there\u2019s not a great deal to report on the pitch. The European side are firmly in control and for their African opponents, it\u2019s all about damage limitation and trying to score their first ever World Cup goal. 70 min: Just replaced by Germany, Melanie Leupolz missed the Euros last summer because she was pregnant. The Chelsea midifelder has since given birth to a son, who is a firm favourite around the WSL side\u2019s Cobham training ground and has also made the trip to Australia for the World Cup. 69 min: Morocco substitution: Saima Amani on for Anissa Lahmari in midfield. 65 min: Germany triple-substitution: Lea Schuller, Lena Lattwein and Etonam Anyomi on for Leupolz, Magull and Buehl. 62 min: Germany ping the ball around, leaving Morocco chasing shadows, a most exhausting pursuit, particularly when you\u2019re 4-0 down. Ait El Haj comes perilously close to scoring her second own goal in a few minutes, when she deflects a low Jule Brand cross goalwards. On this occasion, her goalkeeper digs her out in a far more productive way, getting down to turn the ball around the upright. Good save. 60 min: There\u2019s a break in play as one of Morocco\u2019s players, the scorer of the own goal, receives treatment for an injury. 59 min: Klara Buehl finds herself in acres of space down the left wing but is unable to pick out a teammate with her low cross. Somewhat frantically, Morocco clear their lines. 58 min: Playing for pride now, Morocco keep plugging away against an increasingly confident German side after amo st eventful opening to the second half. It\u2019s turning into a rout. Moroccan defender Hanane Ait El Haj turns the ball into her own net after a defensive header from Elodie Nakkach dropped her way. Somewhat uncharitably, her team\u2019s goalkeeper, Khadija Er-Rmichi, rollocks the crestfallen young defender out of it, despite not being entirely blameless herself. She\u2019d come for the initial delivery into the Morocco box but failed to get anywhere near it. 53 min: Anissa Lahmahri strays offside a split-second before receiving a pass from Ghizlane Chebbak and shooting past Frohms. Her \u201cgoal\u201d is correctly ruled out for offside. 52 min: Morcocco get forward and Chebbak has a low shot comfortably saved by Marle Frohms. 47 min: Standing in an offside position, Magull cleverly lets a through ball roll between her legs so Buehl, running from deep, can shoot goalwards. She clips the outside of the post and the flag goes up for offside. Had Buehl scored again, I suspect that offside decision might have beenn overturned, unless the officials deemed Magull to have been interfering with play. 47 min: Buehl started and finished that move, getting down the left flank and crossing to the far post, where the ball was knocked down for Lina Magull, who hit the woodwork. Morocco failed to clear their lines and the ball broke to Buehl, who sent if fizzing past Khadija Er-Rmichi. Germany extend their lead! It\u2019s a disaster for Morocco as Klara Buehl rifles home from eight yards just 10 seconds after the restart. 46 min: Play resumes with no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! Referee Tori Penso draws first-half proceedings to a close, with Germany leading courtesy of Alexandra Popp\u2019s brace. They\u2019re well worth their lead but haven\u2019t had it all their own way against a team ranked 70 places below them in the cosmic scheme of things. 45+3 min: An intricate move by Germany that would have Pep Guardiola himself salivating ends with Jule Brand teeing up Klara Buehl, whose low drive from inside the penalty area is blocked. It stemmed from a throw-in and featured an inch-perfect, wonderfully weighted backheel from Lina Magull. Had Buehl scored, that certainly would have been an early contender for goal of the tournament. 45+2 min: Zineb Redouani, who\u2019s been very impressive in the Morocco defence, makes a crucial interception to concede a throw-in as Germany try to play in behind their rivals down the right touchline. 44 min: Going back to Popp\u2019s second goal, the German was actually facing away from goal when she connected with Klara Buehl\u2019s excellent corner. She didn\u2019t make any sort of clean contact with her head but managed to steer the ball past Er-Rmichi with her shoulder from six yards. It won\u2019t be a goal of the tournament or Puskas Award contender but they all count. 41 min: Morocco squander what looks like a big chance after Fatima Tagnaouti is playedf in behind for a one-on-one with Merle Frohms, but is unable to round the German goalkeeper, who rushed off her line but stayed on her feet. The flag goes up for offside, so Tagnaouti\u2019s blushes are spared. Popp doubles Germany\u2019s lead! The German skipper sort of shoulders one in from the edge of the six-yard box, getting on the end of the corner delivery to score her second goal of the game. 37 min: Germany are posing Morocco plenty of problems down the inside left but on this occasion, Hanane Ait El Haj dispossesses Jule Brand with an impeccably timed tackle to concede a corner after the German had been played in behind. 33 min: It\u2019s a beautiful dinked finish from Sara Daebritz, who thinks she\u2019s doubled Germany\u2019s lead after being played in behind to lift the ball over Morocco keeper Er-Rmichi. Offside! 30 min: Chebbak, whose father Arbi won Afcon with Morocco in 1976, is penalised for a rough challenge on Svenja Huth and gets a mild ticking-off from our American referee Tori Penso upon protesting her innocence. 29 min: Morocco win a free-kick halfway inside the Germany half and the ball is drilled low and hard towards the edge of the penalty area. The Germans clear their lines. 26 min: German left-back Felicitas Rauch tries a shot from the edge of the Morocco penalty area but her effort is blocked by Redouani, a rock in the African side\u2019s defence. 25min: With Rosella Ayane loitering with intent in the centre, Morocco get the ball into the Germany box and it\u2019s cleared \u2026 eventually, but only as far as Chebbak. The Morocco skipper tries her luck from a long way out and her shot is on target. It arrows straight into the breadbasket of German goalkeeper Merle Frohms. A decent effort. 22 min: A wayward pass from German midfielder Lina Magull prompts the breakdown of another promising German attack, as Morocco get numbers back to defend. 19 min: Sakina Ouzraoui plays the ball down the right touchline trying to release Fatima Tagnaout but her pass is intercepted and put out for a throw-in. Morocco are a goal down but are giving a pretty decent account of themselves so far. There\u2019s no evidence of any bus-parking in Melbourne so far. 16 min: Moments before that goal, there was a moment of panic in the Morocco defence, when Redouani was forced the hack the ball clear from the six-yard box seconds after after the Germans had hit the woodwork. The ball rebounded to Klara Buehl, who should have scored from inside the penalty area. 15 min: Popp was completey unmarked for the goal and was ably assisted by Morocco goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi, who came for the cross but was unable to claim it. Germany lead! Employing a high press, Germany win the ball deep in Morocco territory, pouncing on a loose pass out of defence. Kathrin Hendrich was played in behind and she played an inch-perfect cross to Popp, who powered her header home from seven yards. 9 min: Morocco are gradually getting a foothold in the game having weathered what passed for the early German storm. The German\u2019s go forward again and Klara Buehl picks out Popp with her back to goal on the edge of the Morocco penalty area. Before she can turn, Yasmine Mrabet sticks in a leg to take the ball off her toe. Good defending. 8 min: A promising Morocco sortie upfield breaks down when their captain Ghizlane Chebbak gives the ball away in midfield. 5 min: Germany continue to dominate possession in these early stages, as you might expect. They advance down the right with Svenja Huth on the ball. She gets in behind Morocco left-back Zineb Redouani and sends a cross into the box. Her delivery is cleared. 3 min: Sakina Ouzraoui concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position with a handball. It\u2019s wide on the left, in line with the edge of the penalty area. Instead of crossing into the box, Klara Buehl sends a shot fizzing across the face of the goal, trying to catch out Morocco goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi. It\u2019s wide, but not by much. 2 min: Morocco win a series of throw-ins but eventually concede possession. Germany ping the ball around at the back. 1 min: Alexandra Popp gets the ball rolling for Germany, with Morocco contesting their first ever match at a World Cup finals. Not long now: Both sets of players march out and line up either side of referee Tori Penso and her team of match officials for the national anthems. There looks to be a capacity crowd in the Rectangular Stadium with fans of both nations extremely well represented. Kick-off is just a few minutes away. Germany are heavy favourites. The second ranked team in the world have seven of the team who started last summer\u2019s Euros final in their line-up. Alexandra Popp, who missed out on that showdown against England after injuring herself in the warm-up, also starts up front today. Morocco may be rank outsiders but will surely be inspired by the heroics of their male counterparts, who surprised us all by reaching the World Cup semi-finals. The Moroccan government has ploughed plenty of money into the women\u2019s game and in Reynald Pedros, have an elite manager with plenty of trophy-winning experience at the very highest level. Meanwhile in Group G: Italy left it late to take all three points against Argentina, with Cristiano Girelli coming off the bench to nod home the only goal of the game in the 87th minute with her first touch of the ball. Germany: Frohms, Huth, Hendrich, Doorsoun, Rauch, Leupolz, Dabritz, Brand, Magull, Buhl, Popp. Subs: Berger, Anyomi, Freigang, Hagel, Hegering, Kleinherne, Lattwein, Lohmann, Nusken, Oberdorf, Schuller, Johannes. Morocco: Er-Rmichi, Ait El Haj, Mrabet, Redouani, Ouzraoui, Nakkach, Kassi, Tagnaout, Chebbak, Ayane, Lahmari. Subs: Arouaissa, Amani, Badri, Benzina, Bouftini, Chapelle, El Chad, Gharbi, Jraidi, Mazrouai, Seghir, Zouhair. Referee: Tori Penso (USA) \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready for the first match against Germany and we\u2019ll do what we can in the group phase to qualify for the last 16,\u201d said the 51-year-old Frenchman. \u201cThen it all comes down to how much work you put in. We know that Germany, Korea Republic and Colombia are happy to be playing Morocco. It\u2019s up to us to show them that it\u2019s not going to be that easy for them and that we\u2019re going to give it our best shot to qualify. If we get it into our heads that we can do it, then we\u2019ll be in a position to go and do just that.\u201d \u201cI want to trust players to make decisions, to think about attacking and be creative,\u201d said the German boss. \u201cWe want to have courageous players. We want them to develop a joy and passion for playing. I think we showed that at the Euros last year, with our defending, and with our willingness to counter-attack and play the ball straight away. \u201cThat [style] means always being active and alert. We work on that both on and off the pitch \u2013 and our amazing players create a positive atmosphere, which is the basis for success. \u201cWe want to be contenders for the title, to be a team who could be world champions,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s cool, a good feeling, and I think if everyone stays fit we can be a team to beat.\u201d Rosella Ayane: The sole member of the Morocco squad to play in the English WSL, Ayane made 12 appearances in the competition last season, scoring one goal. Germany\u2019s football self-image, which was lost for a short time, is back. After the quarter-final defeats at the 2017 European Championship and the 2019 World Cup, the Germans were no longer considered favourites \u2013 but that changed at Euro 2022. Read on \u2026 Morocco\u2019s maiden participation in the World Cup is an achievement in itself. Hosting the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations in 2022 was a huge boost to promoting the women\u2019s game in the country and the side reached the final with a team largely composed of players from Rabat\u2019s AS Far and some very talented individuals from further afield. Read on \u2026 Early team news: German head coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg has to plan without Wolfsburg defender Marina Hegering, who is out with a heel injury, while her club teammate, the midfielder Lena Oberdorf, misses this opener with a thigh strain. Morocco boss Reynald Pedros is expehas a full complement of players to choose from. Should the Frenchman pick defender Nouhaila Benzina, she will become the first ever player to appear at a World Cup wearing a hijab. Among the tournament favourites, Germany get their World Cup campaign under way with an opener against Morocco. The first Arab nation ever to play in this tournament, Morocco are 72nd in the Fifa rankings, the second lowest in the competition and on paper at least, should pose few problems for last year\u2019s beaten European finalists. This match, however, will be played on grass, specifically that of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium and the Atlas Lionesses will have taken heart from the performances of other \u201cminnows\u201d who have defied lowly rankings to give unexpectedly admirable accounts of themselves in the opening games of this competition. Kick off in Victoria is at 9.30am (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e22", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/first-thing-conservatives-spain-fail-to-secure-expected-majority-twitter-rebrand", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Conservatives in Spain fail to secure expected majority | First Thing", "lead": "Weeks of negotiations likely after snap election leaves left and right almost neck and neck.

In Spain, the opposition conservative party has won the most number of seats in national elections but looks unlikely to have secured a coalition rightwing majority. The vote had raised fears of the far right entering government for the first time since Spain returned to democracy after the death of Gen Francisco Franco five decades ago. Although the polls had consistently predicted the People\u2019s party (PP) would cruise past the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) to secure an emphatic win in Sunday\u2019s election, early results quickly established that the race was going to be much tighter. With 100% of the vote counted, the PP had won 136 seats to the PSOE\u2019s 122. The conservatives\u2019 potential coalition partners in the far-right Vox party had won 33 seats \u2013 well down on the 52 it picked up in the last election. The PSOE\u2019s allies in the new, far-left Sumar alliance were in fourth, with 31 seats. The results show the political hue of the next government is far from a foregone conclusion, with the left and right blocs running almost neck and neck in their race to get as close to 176 seats as possible. As Monday approached, the PP and Vox had 169 seats to the PSOE and Sumar\u2019s 153. This suggests Spain is in for weeks of negotiating and horse-trading as the rival camps explore their options for government. Why was an early election called? The last time Spain went to the polls \u2013 in November 2019 \u2013 the cover of the satirical magazine El Jueves showed a manic and sweating Pedro S\u00e1nchez hunched over a fruit machine, desperately hoping that his gamble of calling the second general election of the year would pay off. It did, writes Sam Jones. Four years later, however, the stakes were even higher for Spain\u2019s socialist prime minister, for his country \u2013 and for Europe. S\u00e1nchez, a politician known for his willingness to take chances, surprised everyone at the end of May when he reacted to his party\u2019s poor showing in regional and local elections by calling a snap general election. Greece: wildfires break out on Corfu and Evia as 19,000 flee Rhodes blazes Firefighters in Greece have been struggling to contain 82 wildfires burning across the country, 64 of which started Sunday, the country\u2019s hottest day of the summer so far. As well as huge blazes on the island of Rhodes, which forced 19,000 people to flee, wildfires also broke out on the islands of Evia and Corfu. On Evia, authorities told residents of four villages in the south of the island to evacuate to the town of Karystos, which was west of where the fire was advancing. A vice-governor of the Central Greece region, Giorgos Kelaiditis, who was near one of the villages, told the state news service ANA-MPA that the situation was difficult. \u201cThe fire may be 2km [1.2 miles] away, but the wind is strong, the growth is low, the smoke thick and the air is hard to breathe,\u201d he said. Northern Evia was devastated by wildfires in August 2021. How have people been evacuated? Local police said 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. Six people were briefly treated at a hospital for respiratory problems. A person who fell and broke a leg during a hotel evacuation, and a pregnant woman, remained in hospital, authorities said. Two drones downed over Moscow, says Russian defence ministry Russia has said it has neutralised two Ukrainian drones over Moscow in the early hours of Monday, with one crashing close to the defence ministry in the city centre. Officials said the drones hit non-residential buildings in the capital and that there were no casualties a day after Kyiv vowed to \u201cretaliate\u201d for a Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said: \u201cA Kyiv regime attempt to carry out a terrorist act using two drones on objects on the territory of the city of Moscow was stopped. Two Ukrainian drones were suppressed and crashed. There are no casualties.\u201d The Tass news agency reported one drone had crashed in the Komsomolsky Prospekt area, near the defence ministry, while another hit a business centre on Likhacheva Street, which is next to one of the city\u2019s main ring roads. The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, said the drone strikes took place at about 4am local time. He said emergency services were working at the scene and also reported no casualties. What else is happening? An ammunition depot was struck during a Ukrainian drone attack on Dzhankoi in Crimea early Monday morning, with Russian air defence forces intercepting or suppressing 11 drones over the area, a Russia-installed official has said. In other news \u2026 A Texas Republican representative, Tony Gonzales, has called the tactics used to deter people at the US-Mexico border \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and urged the Biden administration and Congress to focus more heavily on legal immigration. Gonzales said the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, was \u2018doing everything\u201d he could at the border despite justice department backlash. Eleven people have been killed after the concrete roof of a school gymnasium collapsed in China\u2019s Qiqihar city \u2013 many of them believed to be young volleyball players \u2013 with authorities saying the illegal stacking of materials on the roof may have caused the cave in. A woman has been found dead in Montana after coming into contact with a grizzly bear on a trail west of Yellowstone national park. The investigation into the attack was continuing, the state\u2019s fish, wildlife and parks department said. It did not confirm the cause of death. Calls for a federal government takeover of New York\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail are likely to grow after a stabbing suspect died in his cell early Sunday morning. It was the prison\u2019s seventh inmate death this year and the 26th since New York\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams, took office in January 2022. A fifth bus of asylum seekers from Texas arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday as part of the Texas governor Greg Abbott\u2019s plans to transport people away from his state. On Saturday, the LA mayor Karen Bass\u2019s office said the bus arrived at about 11.30am at Union Station. Stat of the day: Greta Gerwig makes history as Barbie has biggest opening weekend for film directed by a woman Greta Gerwig has made history as Barbie took $377m at the box office during its opening weekend around the world, the biggest ever for a film directed by a woman. In North American, Barbie claimed top spot with $155m in ticket sales across 4,243 locations in the US and Canada, surpassing The Super Mario Bros Movie and this year\u2019s Marvel releases to become the biggest opening of the year in North America. The social media-fuelled fusion of Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s new film Oppenheimer as \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d brought moviegoers back to the theatres in record numbers to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer also soared past expectations, taking in $80.5m from 3,610 theatres in the US and Canada, making it Nolan\u2019s biggest non-Batman debut and one of the best ever starts for an R-rated biographical drama. Don\u2019t miss this: \u2018We are winning\u2019 \u2013 are US Jews who oppose Israeli settlements finally getting somewhere? Mike Levinson has been pushing back for 40 years and finally thinks he may be getting somewhere. \u201cThere\u2019s a change and the politicians see it. I think it scares them,\u201d said Levinson, holding a sign demanding \u201cStop Israeli settler violence\u201d as he marched through New York Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous change going on in the American Jewish community. There are a lot of Jews, especially young people, who are not so quick to automatically and unconditionally support everything that Israel does. People are accepting the fact that it\u2019s OK to be Jewish and criticise Israel.\u201d Levinson, a Jewish New Yorker, began protesting against Israeli government policies during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon. It has been a long and often lonely road since then as he has sought to get his fellow Americans to pay attention to decades of Israeli occupation, military assaults on the West Bank and Gaza, and the unrelenting expansion of Jewish settlements. Climate check: Why aren\u2019t we more scared of the climate crisis? It\u2019s complicated This summer, millions of people in the US have experienced the intense effects of the climate crisis. The \u201cheat dome\u201d that has gripped the south-west for the past three weeks is expanding into the south-eastern states. In the north-east, people have been killed and crops wiped out by catastrophic flooding. Canada\u2019s worst wildfire season on record has not only caused tens of thousands of Indigenous people to be displaced, but the accompanying smoke has also billowed over into the north-eastern and midwest US, setting records for poor air quality. In many cases, these events have caused irreparable damage and trauma to those directly affected, and can certainly feel like they\u2019re encroaching on those people on the periphery. And yet despite the fact that we\u2019re living through a climate disaster, most Americans aren\u2019t cowering in fear every day about the future of our planet. There\u2019s a psychological reason for that. Last Thing: Rebranding Twitter \u2013 the shaky history of corporate makeovers Elon Musk has revealed a new logo for Twitter, choosing a \u201cminimalist art deco\u201d X as part of a rebrand of the platform. However, the overhaul could prove highly risky, given the history of customer backlashes to previous high-profile corporate rebrands. Here are a couple of high-profile fails Musk may want to learn from. The oil company BP unveiled a new sunburst logo in 2000, named the Helios mark after the Greek sun god, as it sought to rebrand itself as an environmentally aware energy firm. It said its name would stand in future for \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d rather than British Petroleum, but environmental campaigners were unimpressed and accused the firm of greenwashing. The clothing brand Gap was forced into a breakneck reversal of its logo change plans in the space of six days in 2010. Consumers were excoriating on social media about the new design, which swapped the familiar blue square containing the company\u2019s name in skinny serif-font capitals for a black lower-case Helvetica \u201cGap\u201d with a small blue square over the \u201cp\u201d.

It\u2019s June and things are starting to get busy at one of Cornwall\u2019s biggest beaches. Stretching for more than two miles up the county\u2019s north coast, and backed by craggy cliffs and rolling dunes that reach nearly a mile inland, Perranporth attracts crowds of sunbathers, swimmers, bodyboarders, surfers and dog walkers. Now in his 12th season as an RNLI lifeguard, Houghton knows exactly what to look out for \u2013 from a rip current or incoming weather front, to unsuitable inflatables or beginner bodyboarders. Vigilance and prevention are fundamental to lifeguarding, \u201cbut things can change in a second\u201d, he says. \u201cWe have to be ready to respond to anything.\u201d What originally started out as \u201cjust a summer job\u201d for Houghton is now an integral part of his life. As a senior lifeguard, he is responsible for running the unit at Perranporth as well as delivering training and working with the local community on education programmes. \u201cThe combination of helping people, being outdoors, the bonds we form as teams, and being able to pass on what I\u2019ve learned \u2013 it\u2019s such a rewarding and fulfilling thing to do,\u201d he says. Despite the job\u2019s serious nature, the mood inside the lifeguard unit is relaxed, with occasional chatter from a walkie-talkie as the lifeguards scan the beach. Houghton and his two colleagues are part of a seven-strong team on duty at Perranporth, and among the 1,632 RNLI lifeguards who patrol more than 240 beaches around the UK and the Channel Islands. Next year will mark the 200th anniversary of the founding of the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, which became the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1854. Its original and enduring mission is simple: to do all it can to save lives at sea. Over two centuries, the charity\u2019s lifeboat crews and lifeguards have saved more than 140,000 lives. In 2022 alone, RNLI lifeguards responded to nearly 19,000 incidents, aided more than 24,000 people and saved 117 lives. How do they do it? Through courage, dedication, extensive training \u2026 and a whole range of top-notch equipment. Here, Houghton offers an expert\u2019s guide as to how he and his colleagues use this array of life-saving kit to uphold the RNLI\u2019s mission. 1 Ford Ranger This four-wheel-drive pickup serves as a highly versatile, mobile lifeguard unit and enables the crew to patrol beaches, reach hazardous situations and store and move vital life-saving equipment. More than 90 of these tough Fords are in service with the RNLI across the country. The Ranger\u2019s four-wheel drive capabilities are vital for navigating sandy, undulating terrain. Every year, lifeguards complete a training course to hone or refresh their driving skills for a beach environment, including how to use the differential locks in low-traction conditions. The Ranger is customised with a PA system to announce important messages to bathers; a raised viewing platform for lifeguards to monitor the beach and the water; a VHF radio base station, and an extensive first aid kit. It\u2019s used to haul vital equipment such as warning flags, rescue boards, wetsuits and so on, as well as to tow and launch inshore rescue boats and rescue watercraft. 2 VHF radio base station Tucked between the Ranger\u2019s front seats, the VHF radio base station is vital for the lifeguards\u2019 communication network and supplements a system in each lifeguard station. \u201cRadio reception can be affected by things like surrounding cliffs or bad weather,\u201d says Houghton. A mobile base station down at the water\u2019s edge makes communication more reliable, not only among lifeguards on land and in the water, but also with other rescue authorities such as HM Coastguard. 3 Rescue boards A lifeguard\u2019s \u201cbread and butter\u201d rescue kit, the Ranger typically carries two bright yellow rescue boards. Once the lifeguards are in position on the beach, one board stays on the roof rack with the other placed in the sand nearby. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ll take to most situations in the water,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cWe can grab a board and be in the sea in seconds. It\u2019s quicker than swimming and it gives a floating platform for someone to rest on or bring a casualty back to shore.\u201d A lifeguard will either kneel or lie face down on the board and propel themselves across the water with their arms. It may look easy, but it requires a practised combination of strength, fitness and technique. 4 Viewing platform A bench seat across the rig at the rear of the Ranger gives lifeguards a raised mobile viewing platform, from which they can use binoculars to watch the beach and the water. \u201cYou might not think it, but this is one of our most important pieces of life-saving equipment,\u201d says Houghton. \u201cEven though it\u2019s only a few extra feet, we can see so much more than we can at ground level. It doesn\u2019t take much of a wave to obscure your view. Having this elevated position can make the difference between spotting someone in trouble or not.\u201d 5 Inshore rescue boat (IRB) Perranporth is home to one of the RNLI\u2019s 33 IRBs, which are towed from the lifeguard unit down to the water\u2019s edge each day by the Ranger, ready for launch. Though nearly 4 metres long and 1.75 metres wide, an IRB is highly manoeuvrable, which is vital when operating in the surf zone. It has space for six sitting casualties and requires a crew of two \u2013 a helm (the driver) and a crewperson, both of whom undertake special training. Guiding an IRB safely through pounding waves involves considerable skill. It can take a full season to learn to be a crewperson and then another season or two after that to become a helm. Like a sidecar racer, the crewperson has to adjust and position their bodyweight to aid the boat\u2019s handling. \u201cThe front of the IRB is also hinged slightly, so when you hit a wave, it absorbs the power of the wave, making you less likely to capsize,\u201d Houghton says. 6 Rescue water craft (RWC) Highly responsive and agile, the RWC \u2013 popularly referred to as a jet ski \u2013 can quickly take lifeguards into demanding situations. It\u2019s easier to navigate through bigger waves than the IRB, and the rider\u2019s standing position offers a better view of people in the water and the surrounding conditions. Houghton says it is also often used to patrol on busy days and potentially transport people away from dangerous areas before they actually get into difficulty. At well over 200kg, an RWC is too heavy and cumbersome to launch by hand \u2013 which is where the Ranger comes in. Lifeguards are trained to use it to quickly and precisely reverse the trailer carrying the RWC into shallow water, where the RWC is released. 7 Rescue sled Attached to the back of every RWC is a rescue sled, a quick and effective way of carrying someone back to safety \u2013 those rescued may not even have been in the water; rising tides can quickly catch out beachgoers and leave them stranded. It\u2019s essentially a larger, more robust bodyboard: \u201cYou just have to grab the handles and hang on. \u201cI once had to rescue a dog walker and his dog,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cThey were cut off by the tide and trapped up by the cliffs, with heavy waves coming in. We didn\u2019t want to put the dog on the sled in case it jumped off or got too scared, so I had to carry it while struggling through the waves. The owner was on the sled. He was cold and wet but very relieved!\u201d 8 Swim fins Of course, all lifeguards are good swimmers, but fins can be a simple and effective way of increasing their power in the water. Houghton recounts a callout to a coasteerer, who was suffering chest pains and got stuck in a cove. \u201cWe pulled up outside the cove on the RWC and I jumped in. The fins helped me to swim into the cove more quickly and they make it easier to swim out with a casualty, too,\u201d he says. On this occasion, though, Houghton didn\u2019t need to, as the coasteerer had \u201cmanaged to climb up on to the rocks and we decided it was safer to have her winched up by the coastguard helicopter\u201d. Play it safe this summer: visit an RNLI-lifeguarded beach. If you get into trouble in the water, float to live, until help arrives."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e24", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/what-happened-spain-snap-general-election", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What happened in Spain\u2019s snap general election?", "lead": "Expected coalition between conservative People\u2019s party and far-right Vox did not materialise.

Pretty much the opposite of everything the pollsters and pundits had predicted would happen. The election, called by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, after his Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) did badly in May\u2019s regional and municipal elections, had been expected to usher in a coalition government between the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the far-right Vox party. Although the PP finished first and picked up 47 more seats than in the November 2019 election, its victory over a resurgent PSOE was far narrower than had been forecast and the party failed to secure the absolute majority it had hoped for. What about Vox? Sunday was indisputably a bad night for the far-right party. It lost 19 seats, saw its share of the vote cut and had its chances of playing kingmaker slashed. The PP won 136 seats and Vox 33, giving them a combined total of 169 \u2013 seven seats short of the 176-seat absolute majority needed in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress. How did the Spanish left do? The PSOE picked up 122 seats \u2013 two more than it won last time \u2013 while its allies in the new leftwing Sumar coalition won 31, giving the two main parties of the Spanish left 153 seats. While the PSOE and Sumar have fewer seats than the PP and Vox, they have more options when it comes to doing deals to win the support of smaller parties as they endeavour to form a new government. What happens next? Both the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, and S\u00e1nchez are going to try to put together new governments over the coming weeks. Congress will convene on 17 August and King Felipe VI will then meet party leaders to determine which candidate could win MPs\u2019 backing to become the next prime minister. That candidate would then take part in an investiture debate followed by a vote that requires an absolute majority in Spain\u2019s lower house (the aforementioned 176 seats). If the candidate falls short of that number, a second vote will be held 48 hours later in which a simple majority \u2013 more votes for than against \u2013 will suffice. Should that fail to happen, MPs have two months to appoint a prime minister. When those two months are up, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called for the end of the year. So who is most likely to be able to pull together a government? S\u00e1nchez and his allies. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s decision to enter into more regional and municipal coalitions with the far right following May\u2019s elections has not endeared the PP to more moderate parties, which simply won\u2019t entertain supporting an alliance that includes Vox, an anti-feminist, anti-immigrant party that denies the existence of gender-based violence and human-made climate change. And any attempt by Feij\u00f3o to try to forge a minority government would be sunk by the PSOE\u2019s refusal to back it or to abstain to allow it into office. What are S\u00e1nchez\u2019s options? By enlisting the support of smaller regional parties, including the separatist Catalan Republican Left party and the pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu, the PSOE leader could potentially secure the backing of 172 MPs \u2013 enough to get him over the line in a second investiture debate. But S\u00e1nchez would also need to negotiate a deal to ensure the abstention of Junts, the hardline, centre-right pro-independence party of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. In another of the election\u2019s many twists of fate, Puigdemont\u2019s party \u2013 which spearheaded the unsuccessful push to secede from the rest of Spain almost six years ago \u2013 could find itself playing kingmaker. \u201cWe won\u2019t make Pedro S\u00e1nchez PM in exchange for nothing,\u201d its leader, M\u00edriam Nogueras, warned on Sunday night. While the PSOE may have a numerical advantage over the PP, deals with Catalan and Basque independence parties would play neatly into the hands of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rivals, who accuse him of being far too reliant on them. The campaign for May\u2019s elections was dominated by the legacy of the defunct Basque terrorist group Eta after it emerged that EH Bildu \u2013 whose support the S\u00e1nchez government has enlisted in congress \u2013 was fielding 44 convicted Eta members, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates. S\u00e1nchez criticised Bildu\u2019s decision \u2013 describing it as legal but \u201cobviously indecent\u201d \u2013 but it was swiftly seized on by his opponents, who have also attacked his government over its botched sexual offences reforms, which have led to more than 100 convicted sex offenders being granted early release. \u201cYou\u2019re the great electoral hope for rapists and pederasts, for mutineers, squatters, corrupt people, and now for those who used to go about in balaclavas with pistols,\u201d Feij\u00f3o told S\u00e1nchez. \u201cAnd I will never be that.\u201d What\u2019s the most likely outcome? As the PP has once again learned to its cost, it never pays to bet against S\u00e1nchez. That said, the coming weeks and months are unlikely to be easy for the socialists and their allies as they try to put together a new government. Spanish politics continues to be fragmented and another general election remains a distinct possibility. It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that Sunday\u2019s vote means that the last five Spanish general elections have resulted in hung parliaments."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e25", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/kylian-mbappe-al-hilal-world-record-300m-bid-psg-saudi-arabia", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9: Al-Hilal submit world-record \u20ac300m bid for PSG forward", "lead": "The Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal have submitted a bid understood to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3259m) for the Paris Saint-Germain outcast Kylian Mbapp\u00e9", "author": "Fabrizio Romano", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 10:22:13", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680023", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7943cfe6c3b6346b93503e2907225a02cf7dda36/185_101_1435_861/500.jpg", "body": "The Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal have submitted a world-record bid for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, understood to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3259m), and are willing to pay the forward \u20ac200m for a one-season stay if that is what it takes to get the deal done. The move comes after Paris Saint-Germain left Mbapp\u00e9 out of their squad for their pre-season tour of Japan, determined to sell him unless he signs a new contract. PSG will accept Al-Hilal\u2019s offer but there have been no talks between Al-Hilal and Mbapp\u00e9, and PSG remain convinced the 24-year-old has agreed terms to join Real Madrid on a free transfer next summer. Al-Hilal will try to tempt Mbapp\u00e9 with a world-record \u20ac200m-a-year salary and his income could get closer to \u20ac700m a year with commercial arrangements and image rights. The club, mindful it may suit Mbapp\u00e9 to come for only one season, are open to a deal that \u2013 even by recent Saudi Pro League standards \u2013 would destroy football\u2019s financial norms. Al-Hilal offered Lionel Messi more than \u00a3350m a year to join from PSG but the Argentina forward opted to move to Inter Miami. It emerged in June that Mbapp\u00e9 had presented a formal letter to PSG, informing them he would not to take up the option of a one-year contract extension next summer.

We don\u2019t want to lose the best player in the world for free; we can\u2019t do that.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 joined PSG from Monaco in 2018 for \u00a3166m. Saudi Pro League clubs have been spending huge sums this summer to sign players from Europe. Al-Hilal are one of four teams in the country majority owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which also has majority ownership of Newcastle United, and have signed R\u00faben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Kalidou Koulibaly.

Unless there are major changes to the bill, I intend to vote against it. Here\u2019s why. As everyone knows, our country faces enormous crises. As a result of climate change our planet is experiencing unprecedented and rising temperatures. Along with the rest of the world, we need to make major investments to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into more efficient and sustainable energy sources, or the life we leave our kids and future generations will become increasingly unhealthy and precarious. Our healthcare system is broken. While the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry make hundreds of billions in profit, 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, our life expectancy is declining, and we have a massive shortage of doctors, nurses, mental health practitioners and dentists. Our educational system is teetering. While we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of almost any major country, millions of parents cannot find affordable and quality childcare. The number of our young people who graduate from college is falling behind many other countries and 45 million Americans are struggling under the weight of student debt. Our housing stock is totally inadequate. While gentrification is causing rents to soar in many parts of our country some 600,000 Americans are homeless, and 18 million are spending more than half of their limited incomes on housing. These are some of the crises our country faces. And we\u2019re not dealing with them. And then there is defense spending. Well, that\u2019s a whole other story. The proposed military budget that the Senate is now debating would increase defense spending by $28bn to over $886bn, an all-time record. The total is over $900bn if you include nuclear weapons spending through the Department of Energy. I will oppose this bloated defense budget and efforts to further increase military spending through a defense supplemental for three main reasons. First, more military spending is unnecessary. The $886bn in defense spending agreed in the debt ceiling deal matches the Pentagon\u2019s budget request and is more than sufficient to protect the United States and our allies. The United States spends more than three times what China spends on its military. This record high defense spending would come in spite of the end of the war in Afghanistan and despite the fact that the United States spends more on the military than the next 10 countries combined, most of whom are allies. Second, the Pentagon cannot keep track of the dollars it already has, leading to massive waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling military-industrial complex. The Pentagon accounts for about two-thirds of all federal contracting activity, obligating more money every year than all civilian federal agencies combined. Yet the Department of Defense (DOD) remains the only major federal agency that cannot pass an independent audit. Last year, the department was unable to account for over half of its assets, which are in excess of $3.1tn. The Government Accountability Office (Gao) reports that DOD still cannot accurately track its finances or post transactions to the correct accounts. Each year, auditors find billions of dollars in the Pentagon\u2019s proverbial couch cushions; in fiscal year 2022, navy auditors found $4.4bn in untracked inventory, while the air force identified $5.2bn worth of variances in its general ledger. A serious effort to address this waste should be undertaken before Congress throws more money at the Pentagon. Third, much of this additional military spending will go to line the pockets of hugely profitable defense contractors \u2013 it is corporate welfare by a different name. Almost half of the Pentagon budget goes to private contractors, some of whom are exploiting their monopoly positions and the trust granted them by the United States to line their pockets. Repeated investigations by the DOD inspector general, the GAO and CBS News have uncovered numerous instances of contractors massively overcharging DOD, helping boost these companies\u2019 profits to nearly 40% \u2013 and sometimes as high as 4,451% \u2013 while costing US taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. TransDigm, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are among the offenders, dramatically overcharging the taxpayer while reaping enormous profits, seeing their stock prices soar and handing out massive executive compensation packages. Last year, Lockheed Martin received $46bn in unclassified federal contracts, returned $11bn to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, and paid its CEO $25m a year. TransDigm, the company behind the 4,451% markup, touted $3.1bn in profits on $5.4bn of net sales, almost boasting to investors about just how fully it was fleecing the taxpayer. The fact that a share of the profits from these lucrative contracts will flow back to the congressional backers of higher defense budgets in the form of campaign contributions \u2013 America\u2019s unique system of legalized bribery \u2013 makes the whole situation even more unconscionable. Let\u2019s be clear. Defending the American people is not only about pouring money into the Pentagon. It\u2019s about making sure our children go to good schools and will have a habitable planet when they get older. It\u2019s about making sure that every American has a decent standard of living and can enjoy quality healthcare and affordable housing. As a nation, the time is long overdue for fundamental changes to our national priorities. Cutting military spending is a good first step. Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and chairman of the health education labor and pensions committee. He represents the state of Vermont, and is the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e27", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/us-federal-minimum-wage-rev-william-barber", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "We last raised the US federal minimum wage 14 years ago.

Poverty kills more people than homicide, respiratory disease, gun violence and opioid overdoses, the study showed. It\u2019s stress, it\u2019s starvation, it\u2019s disease. And it\u2019s all unnecessary. Policymakers have many tools to counter the death by poverty that is ravaging America. But they have neglected the simplest one in their toolkit for far too long: raising the federal minimum wage. Monday marks 14 years since the last federal minimum wage increase, the longest period America\u2019s lowest-paid workers have gone without a raise since the minimum wage was first put into effect in 1938. The minimum wage has been stuck at an unlivable $7.25 an hour under three presidents. Adjusting for inflation, today\u2019s minimum wage is now worth less than at any point since 1956. Nearly a third of the workforce, or 52 million people, earn less than $15 an hour, including 47% of Black workers, 46% of Hispanic workers, 20% of Asian American and Indigenous workers, 40% of working women and 50% of working women of color. Raising the minimum wage to even $15 an hour would lift 7.6 million people \u2013 many of whom are women, immigrants, Black, Latinx or parents \u2013 out of poverty and give more than 50 million people a raise. According to the Economic Policy Institute, a worker paid the $7.25 federal minimum wage earns 27.4% less in inflation-adjusted terms than what their counterpart was paid in July 2009 when the minimum wage was last increased, and 40.2% less than a minimum wage worker in February 1968, the historical high point of the minimum wage\u2019s value. Courageous workers in the Fight for $15 and the union movement have pushed 14 states and the District of Columbia to adopt $15 minimum wage laws. We\u2019re proud to have marched with, prayed with, and even gotten arrested with these workers as they\u2019ve demanded living wages and a union. But the sad fact is that 20 states remain stuck at the federal minimum of $7.25 \u2013 and working people in those states, the majority of which are in the south, need help now. That\u2019s why, earlier this year, we hit the road with Bernie Sanders and stood alongside workers across the south to demand living wages. These workers are 46% more likely to be paid less than $15 than workers in the 30-plus states with minimums higher than $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And, according to EPI, there isn\u2019t a place in the country where even a single adult without children can get by on less than $15 an hour. There\u2019s no city, county or state where a full-time minimum-wage worker can afford a two-bedroom rental, a report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition showed. Yet instead of raising pay for fast-food cooks, home care aides, warehouse workers, retail clerks and others, politicians push a false moral narrative of religious nationalism, trying to trick us into believing that poverty is a moral failing on the individual and that the real moral issues of our time are standing against LGBTQ+ people and a woman\u2019s right to choose while defending tax cuts and gun rights. We will not be duped: the real moral question for our country is where we stand in relation to the poor. Instead of pushing culture wars and partisanship, lawmakers should focus on the 800 people dying each day from poverty in the wealthiest nation on earth. Our politicians have failed to act, and leaders who stand silent in the face of these injustices are guilty of policy murder. Indeed, our demand for a living wage is the moral issue politicians should be focused on. Isaiah 10 says, \u201cWoe unto those who legislate evil and rob the poor of their rights, and make women and children their prey.\u201d And President Franklin D Roosevelt adopted the moral argument of the Social Gospel when he declared that \u201cno business which depends for its existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.\u201d It is a moral travesty that as a nation we continue to expand the military budget in surplus, but refuse to guarantee basic human rights like healthcare and living wages. We are putting our nation\u2019s leaders on notice, across party lines, that we need living wages now. If they don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll vote them out. Poor and low-wealth people make up nearly 40% of the electorate and have the ability to decide elections. We are calling for a Third Reconstruction to lift our nation\u2019s 140 million poor and low-wealth people from the bottom up. This includes raising the outdated minimum wage to a living wage as well as updating the also-obsolete official poverty measure to reflect what it takes to secure a decent standard of living today. America has gone 14 years without a raise. It\u2019s literally killing us. And it\u2019s time for it to change.

Jeanne is an entrepreneur who has fallen into a depression caused by the death of her mother and the recent bizarre collapse of her business; she has an inner anxiety-voice represented by Devaux\u2019s own sketches of the cartoon-ghost in her head, always nagging at her. An undersea device for hoovering up microplastics, into which Jeanne invested every cent of her own money, became unmoored and Jeanne was humiliatingly shown on the TV news as she desperately dived fully clothed into the sea in a doomed attempt to save it. She is played by Blanche Gardin \u2013 who was L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s producer and best friend in Bruno Dumont\u2019s media satire France \u2013 and brings a certain kind of not-yet-irretrievable jadedness to the role.

I have never had a garden shed before, so I wasn\u2019t expecting to give it away so quickly, but once they moved in I accepted it was rightly theirs \u2013 for this summer at least. I have never had such a good view of a wasp nest. I peer in most weeks to marvel at its progress. It is quite exquisite in its grey, papery layers. Where there was once a solitary queen, now there are many more insects building and foraging, so the nest is only going to grow in size. These are common wasps, Vespula vulgaris, and the colony will survive into early autumn, until the first queen dies. At this point, in a fit of genetics and anger, the worker wasps will revolt against the collective and start to lay their own eggs. Without the queen, the strict rules of the colony fall apart, no one goes to work foraging for the collective good and everyone gets hungry. Cannibalism sets in and some workers start ripping up the nest, trying to carry off their own brood. Everyone left behind freezes. In this light, when you meet an angry wasp in the summer, imagine it as this: a distraught empty-nester flooded with destructive hormones on a quest for sugar to get drunk on. The whole nest will be empty by winter and it won\u2019t be revisited next year. While things are running smoothly, however, the growing colony needs food, and lots of it, which means the workers are busy collecting protein to fatten larvae: caterpillars, spiders and other soft-bodied insects. Wasps are excellent garden predators and will be doing all sorts of good work. Yes, the adults\u2019 love of sugar means that drinking cider or eating strawberries and ice-cream nearby will attract their attention. But years ago someone told me that if you talk to wasps with good intention, they really do listen.

You could get anything: puppies, wallabies \u2013 owls, even. It smelled wrong in there: of excrement and fear. Your vestigial hackles were raised. I knew we shouldn\u2019t buy a pet from that shop. It was no better than buying a pangolin from a Vietnamese market to \u201csave\u201d it, really, but walking around, between sphynx cats, chinchillas, geckos and chameleons, we spotted a large tortoise in a glass case that was far too small. My husband and I had had tortoises as kids and loved the idea of them. Plus, he was so beautiful: big \u2013 probably 40cm long \u2013 with a yellow and black head and ruby-red spots, like jewels, on his legs. Impassively munching a stalk, he seemed like a grounded dragon, stuck in a box in a Brussels suburb. We exchanged a quick glance, then called over one of the sales assistants. He was called John Paul II, the chap said, because he looked a bit like Karol Wojty\u0142a. He cost us \u20ac500 \u2013 a fortune \u2013 and the only paperwork he came with was a receipt that read \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d. We travelled home, box on my knees, in a state of disbelief. We renamed him Julius after Julius II; if he had to be a pope, I thought he should be a more extravagant Renaissance one. Red-footed tortoises are tropical, so they don\u2019t hibernate, we discovered, as we rapidly became red-foot experts, sourcing heat lamps and studying his diet, grating cuttlefish bone over his greens and fruit, and offering him snails. Julius spent summers in our small back garden and roamed the house in winter \u2013 all the vivariums we could find were far too small for him. He was a winning presence: curious and fearless, often getting improbably lost for such a big creature. We would sometimes find him dozing in a cupboard, like an exceptionally decorative rock. When anyone sat in the garden, he would lumber over to investigate. Reptile brains are supposed to be primitive, so I suppose it wasn\u2019t affection, but something drew him to us. In return, we adored our mysterious housemate. It would be nice if this were a happy-ending story; it isn\u2019t. A few years later, we came home to the horrifying sight of Julius with his large penis sticking out. We took him to the vet, who was baffled, describing it as \u201can erection gone wrong\u201d, but also excited. Manual reinsertion failed, so he decided to amputate: a first for Belgium. We waited anxiously for a call, which eventually came: Julius had survived. He came home to recuperate, but he wasn\u2019t his old self: he seemed listless, disinclined to rumble around the house, and off his greens. My husband was travelling, so it fell to me to rub iodine on the amputation stump, upside down over the sink, grimly massaging as he struggled to escape. He continued to decline and a few weeks later he died, probably of a post-operative infection, or shock. I used to tell this story for laughs \u2013 the receipt, John Paul II, the penis stump! \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t feel so funny now. Julius\u2019s death was the moment that I let go of my Gerald Durrell fantasy of having a house full of exotic creatures and started to think that mostly those kinds of animals have no place with us and keeping them isn\u2019t a kindness. We still have tortoises \u2013 little European ones, who happily stomp around the garden and hibernate all winter. I think of Julius like one of my son\u2019s needy, always-ailing tropical houseplants: beautiful, extraordinary, wondrous, but not really meant for our grey, rainy lands."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e2d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/24/summer-minestrone-chicken-rice-recipe-rachel-roddy", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for summer minestrone with chicken and rice | A kitchen in Rome", "lead": "A summery, Milanese take on the much-loved Italian soup, to be eaten at room temperature in a cooling breeze", "author": "Rachel Roddy", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 10:00:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680173", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9303af42622fbc2c919cca5c4c732a355dd90edf/0_46_2448_1469/500.jpg", "body": "There was a house on Cassland Road, east London, that would produce the most fantastic cooking smells. This is more than two decades ago now, when I would pass the house once or twice a week, usually on my way to catch the bus. It didn\u2019t matter what time it was \u2013 early morning, late afternoon or evening \u2013 evidence of something baking, simmering or roasting was almost always drifting through the kitchen window, over the wall and across the pavement. What made the situation even more intriguing, (and slightly Roald Dahl) was that I never saw anyone at the window, or going in or out. Who was responsible? And why? Did they have a large family, lots of friends, or run a small catering company? Were they happy cooking, or exhausted, or both? Whatever the reason, their repertoire was wonderful, and the smell of fruit cakes, things covered in pastry, burnt sugar, rice and peas, full roast dinners and even fuller curries circled like low-flying aircraft before being whisked away on the east London breeze. Twenty years later in Rome, the smell of burnt jam and frying chicken brought back memories of Cassland Road. I was cooking in my dressing gown at 9am, an attempt to beat the heat and stickiness that moves in by mid-morning, a state not helped by watermelon, which turns every surface into adhesive. The burnt jam had leaked out of a tart, and the chicken was for this week\u2019s recipe: minestrone estivo freddo, or cold summer minestrone. The name minestra comes from a verb for distributing \u2013 minestrare or somministrare \u2013 so a dish that needs spooning from a large dish into smaller ones. The suffix \u2013 one (or oni) \u2013 denotes largeness, so a minestrone is a big soup. Of the countless versions from every region, this one from Milan is a particular favourite, and a delight to make. The first step is frying diced chicken, then, just before pulling it off the heat, adding minced garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper. This delicious-smelling mix then rests while you make an onion, potato, courgette, bean and red pepper soup, cook rice in it, then add some cooked beans and the chicken, as well as any juices collected on the plate, and then you leave the minestrone to rest. The rest is vital, by the way \u2013 it needs at least 15 minutes and up to a few hours, so the rice can swell and the flavours settle. At this time of year, there is no risk of resting food going cold, which is also why \u201croom temperature\u201d or \u201ctepid\u201d are better descriptors than \u201ccold\u201d, because that is how it is eaten. Some recipes suggest turning out the soup into a dish, or sticking spoons upright in it. This version is soft, however, even at room temperature, so it\u2019s best served straight from the pan or from a tureen. And, of course, you can reheat if you want to, which means the scent will circle around the kitchen, while we hope for a breeze. Summer minestrone with rice Serves 4-6 Olive oil 200g boneless and skinless chicken breast, diced 1 small sprig rosemary, minced 1 garlic clove, peeled and minced Salt and black pepper 2 onions, peeled and sliced 150g potatoes, peeled and diced 150g courgettes, trimmed and diced 150g red pepper, diced 150g green beans, trimmed and cut in 3cm lengths 180g arborio or carnaroli rice 200g cooked cannellini beans 1 handful basil leaves, torn In a heavy-based pan or casserole, warm two teaspoons of the oil, then fry the chicken until it\u2019s cooked through. In the last seconds of cooking, stir in the rosemary and garlic, and season to taste, then take off the heat, tip on to a plate and set aside. In the same pan, gently fry the onion and a pinch of salt in six tablespoons of oil, until they start to turn soft and translucent. Add the potato, courgettes, peppers, green beans and a litre and a half of water. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Add the rice and raise the heat slightly so the soup simmers in a lively way for another 10 minutes, then, in the last few seconds, return the chicken (and any resting juices) to the pot and stir in the cannellini beans. Pull off the heat, add a handful of torn-up basil, season again, if you think it needs it, and leave to sit and rest for at least 15 minutes."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e2e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/24/climate-emergency-artworks-dear-earth-eden-project", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s positive, not apocalyptic\u2019: can climate change art help save the planet?", "lead": "The climate emergency has inspired a raft of disquieting art, and opinion is divided as to whether it encourages action or despair.

Twenty years ago, the BBC\u2019s pioneering science show Tomorrow\u2019s World came to an end after 1,400 episodes. First beamed into living rooms across the nation back in 1965, the series envisioned the inventions of the near future, offering a blueprint of blue sky thinking. As well as introducing products that soon became commonplace \u2013 such as artificial grass, the pocket calculator, the mobile phone and the robotic vacuum cleaner \u2013 it stretched the imagination to breaking point with the robot snooker player, paper underwear and the worm omelette, a protein-packed dish predicted to take over dinner tables. While the early episodes of Tomorrow\u2019s World opted for 60s optimism and, towards the series\u2019 end in the 90s, dreamed of better things, the future of the planet today has never looked bleaker. We are living in a global climate emergency, with record heatwaves across the globe. Closer to home, wildfires increased fourfold in England last year and annual flood damage costs could rise by 20% due to the crisis. Eggy worms don\u2019t seem too scrambled an idea now. It is no wonder, then, that art in recent years has looked ahead, like Tomorrow\u2019s World, to the future of the planet. In 2018, the artist Michael Pinsky created a series of Pollution Pods at London\u2019s Somerset House, filling five domes with the particulate matter of five cities. Last year, the Our Time on Earth exhibition at the Barbican in London brought together 18 works from across the globe that imagined possible planetary futures. Liam Young\u2019s film Planet City, for example, pictured a future mega-metropolis of 10 billion, based on the biologist EO Wilson\u2019s idea that humans could live on just half of the Earth and regreen the rest. Meanwhile, Dear Earth, showing at the Hayward Gallery at London\u2019s Southbank Centre until early September, features works from 15 international artists that examine, in the gallery\u2019s words, how art can \u201cdeepen our psychological and spiritual responses to the climate crisis\u201d. While these shows venture into sociology, politics and economics, others focus squarely on nature. The BBC Earth Experience in west London is inspired by the Seven Worlds, One Planet television series and takes viewers on a journey through the world\u2019s wildlife. Large digital screens display videos narrated by David Attenborough; each room in the space is dedicated to a different continent. All these exhibitions have deeper roots. In 2009, the exhibition Earth at the Royal Academy in London broke ground by examining the climate through abstract art. \u201cI didn\u2019t want penguins or icebergs,\u201d curator Kathleen Soriano explained to the Guardian at the time: \u201cWe wanted people to have an aesthetic response.\u201d Then there is the Eden Project. First opened in 2001, the Cornwall attraction, which features huge enclosures with more than 1,000 plant species, has since blossomed, attracting more than 1 million visitors a year, with a new marine venue in Morecambe, Lancashire, set to open in 2026. Sam Smit, the Eden Project\u2019s creative head, believes the venue\u2019s multisensory approach helps to inspire action. \u201cIn the rainforest, you can smell it, see its visual abundance, feel the humidity and temperature on your skin, hear the sound of the waterfall, and the odd bird,\u201d he says, citing the recent installation, Blue (Infinity Blue), a nine-metre monument to bacteria that fires O-shaped vapour rings into the air fragranced with \u201cprimordial\u201d aromas. Other features invite visitors to complete the story. Seeing the Invisible, an augmented reality exhibition, is accompanied by a Call to Action trail and activity book that invite young visitors to create a mind map, illustration or short video imagining what\u2019s next. Technology has often been used by the Eden Project to give viewers the opportunity to see the planet through other species\u2019 eyes. AI-poweredThe app Pollinator Pathmaker imagined gardens from a bee\u2019s eye view; audio experience Vegetal Transmutation encouraged listeners to view the Eden Project as a plant might; while the film Kinommic Botany took this to the extreme: shot from a potato\u2019s perspective and giving new meaning to the role of the YouTuber, it challenged our anthropocentric view of the world. The aim of these exhibitions is to offer a preview of the near future: but they also show what\u2019s in the pipeline to change the timeline. The hope behind the work of attractions such as the Eden Project is not only to show a glimpse of the future but also to spur change. \u201cThese exhibitions can tangibly help people visualise what a different world can look like,\u201d says Our Time on Earth curator Luke Kemp. \u201cWe felt that historically a lot of exhibitions and experiences depicted the problem of the climate crisis.\u201d \u201cFacts and data can leave one feeling disempowered and disengaged,\u201d the Eden Project\u2019s senior arts curator Misha Curson says. \u201cImmersive experiences like ours are more powerful than talk of environmental disasters that are already in the media every day. It\u2019s a positive approach rather than an apocalyptic one.\u201d But does eco-art actually make us act? A study led by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology examined the behaviour of visitors to Pinsky\u2019s Pollution Pods. Using interviews and a questionnaire to measure the emotional responses of the audience, it concluded that the exhibition did increase people\u2019s intention to act, but that very few attendees later went on to track their climate crisis emissions \u2013 something they were encouraged to do. Studying the effectiveness of different works at COP21\u2019s eco-art festival, the researchers Laura Kim Sommer and Christian A Kl\u00f6ckner later defined four categories of environmental art: what they termed the comforting utopia (playful visions of a better world); the challenging dystopia (depicting negative scenarios); the mediocre mythology (imagery drawing on myth and folklore); and awesome solutions (beautiful representations of nature that offer viable outcomes). They discovered only three of 37 artworks made a positive behavioural impact: Mur Vegetal, an upcycled carpet made from flowers; The Blue Whale, a representation of a captured whale; and Honey Roads, 80 photographs of hives across the world. All three, they found, belong to the \u201cawesome solutions\u201d subset; they were sublimely beautiful, were exhibited outside, clearly showed the effects of human behaviour, and were regarded as something new. \u201cWe suggest environmental art should move away from a dystopian way of depicting the problems of climate change \u2026 and keep in mind the power of offering solutions and emphasising the beauty and interconnectedness of nature,\u201d Sonner wrote in the report. Malcolm Miles, the author of Art Rebellion: The Aesthetics of Social Transformation, is more doubtful, arguing that increasingly less realistic depictions of nature can numb the emotional effect on the viewer and lead to inaction. \u201cIf the eco-narrative becomes entertainment, the message may be lost: people go home at the end of the film,\u201d he says. He also warns against the damaging effects of climate art that tries to say something good, but isn\u2019t very good at all. \u201cBad art doesn\u2019t communicate much; the same with immersive technologies.\u201d There is hope, though, if the art actively showcases the future and \u201cimagines what alternative futures might be\u201d, he continues. \u201cThat matters because it is not easy to foresee something which does not yet exist. The underlying message is: there are always alternatives to the way things are, and another world is possible.\u201d Back in 1989, an episode of Tomorrow\u2019s World that imagined a family home in 2020 was strikingly accurate \u2013 it got automatic lights and voice-activated music right \u2013 but crucially got something wrong. \u201cThere will be enormous pressure on us to cut down our burning of fossil fuels to protect the environment,\u201d it predicted, before showcasing a honeycomb-shaped insulating material that could bring heating bills down to zero and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. That future has yet to fully arrive but if we treat artists\u2019 solutions as fantastic, rather than fantastical, we may have a better tomorrow.

The dark bordered beauty is clinging on in just three places in Britain but its numbers are being increased by a conservation project to establish new populations in the Scottish Highlands. Freshly emerged male moths were last week discovered in non-lethal light traps after 160 caterpillars were released at a secret site in the Cairngorms this summer, raising hopes that the endangered moth can be successfully revived. The moth, which is virtually extinct in England and only found at two places in the Cairngorms, feeds in Scotland on suckering aspen, a relatively uncommon tree whose young shoots are frequently grazed by livestock or an overabundance of wild deer. In 2022, 40 dark bordered beauty moth eggs were collected from the wild and transferred to a purpose-built breeding facility at Highland Wildlife Park as the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) in partnership with other conservation charities led the first ever captive breeding programme for the species. These eggs hatched into caterpillars and then pupated into adults, producing a further 497 eggs. From these, 160 caterpillars were released into the wild. The first moths from these caterpillars were found in light traps by conservation scientists monitoring the site. Dr Tom Prescott, the head of conservation for Butterfly Conservation Scotland, said: \u201cI was peering in the moth trap and I could see one on an egg carton in the trap. I couldn\u2019t quite believe my eyes \u2013 it was very exciting. \u201cWe hope this is just the start of the moth becoming established at this site \u2013 it shows that the habitat is correct, and we hope the population will thrive and become sustainable there.\u201d Conservation scientists want to spot some female moths at the site during the species\u2019 short flight season of a couple of weeks but the RZSS said \u201cpainstaking\u201d captive breeding would continue for some years. Breeding moths will be carefully paired and managed to maintain their genetic diversity while conservationists also work with landowners to create other suitable sites with lots of young aspen shoots for further releases and to encourage the species \u2013 not thought to be particularly mobile \u2013 to naturally spread. Dr Helen Taylor, the conservation programme manager at RZSS, said: \u201cThis is a really important and exciting step in our efforts to save dark bordered beauty moths, but there\u2019s still a long way to go. \u201cWe have made a long-term commitment to help improve the conservation status of dark bordered beauty moths and ideally we would like to see successfully reintroduced, self-sustaining populations at multiple sites to safeguard the future of this stunning, but little-known moth. That\u2019s going to take a few years, but this is a brilliant start.\u201d The moth is one of a number of endangered invertebrates found in the Cairngorms that conservationists are seeking to revive, including the silver stiletto fly, the pine hoverfly and the small scabious mining bee. Taylor said: \u201cAll insects play vital roles in the ecosystems they live in, from pollination to waste recycling. Without these often overlook animals, ecosystems start to fall apart. Working with big, fluffy, charismatic animals is also important, but if we want healthy ecosystems to release animals like beavers and wildcats into, then we need to look after little guys like dark bordered beauty as well. I\u2019m really glad that at RZSS we are working at both ends of that scale.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e30", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/on-reflection-its-very-uncool-readers-scrapbooks-of-pop-fandom", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018On reflection, it\u2019s very uncool\u2019: readers\u2019 scrapbooks of pop fandom", "lead": "With the Wham! documentary showcasing Andrew Ridgeley\u2019s mum\u2019s scrapbooks of their career, readers share their own shrines to Roxy Music, Metallica, David Bowie and more", "author": "Guardian readers and Alfie Packham", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 09:53:39", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680232", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/318235b96115e696633397a1838a457a91006873/63_71_1161_696/500.jpg", "body": "\u2018I heard Roxy Music at a Scouts gathering and was hooked\u2019 I was obsessed with Roxy Music as a teenager. I heard their first two albums at a Scouts gathering and was hooked. Every week, I would buy the maagzines Sounds, NME and Melody Maker if they had any Roxy-related articles or photos, and take my scissors to them for the scrapbook [pictured above]. I eventually saw them at Birmingham Odeon in 1974 and still have the pristine programme and ticket stub. I never imagined that many years later I would be photographing them and Bryan solo for Getty. Looking through the book brings back many happy memories of my youth. Steve Thorne, 64, Warwick \u2018On reflection, it\u2019s a very uncool thing to have done\u2019 Growing up near Birmingham, the home of Sabbath, in the late 70s and early 80s, I was always going to be into metal. I lived in a sleepy village, too, which is just the place to sell your soul to the devil. I heard Metallica for the first time on the Friday rock show on Radio 1. I was 17 and they were my new gods. I cut out everything I could find in Sounds and Kerrang! and put them in scrapbooks. On reflection, it\u2019s a very uncool thing to have done. I pasted in ticket stubs; my first was a Monsters of Rock one from 1985 and this was the start of my obsession with them. After the death of their first bass player Cliff Burton in 1986, these scrapbooks almost took on a role of religious artefacts. I kept them going through the art school years but inevitably my head was turned by other things. A good friend of mine recently did Metallica\u2019s tour T-shirts and in June we went to Download (what Monsters of Rock became) to see them, 38 years after I first saw them there. We were in the snake pit (just in front of the stage) so had special wristbands. When I got home, mine went in my scrapbook. Simon Davis, 55, London \u2018I saw nearly every rock band that came through LA\u2019 In 1980 I was 18 years old and had just graduated from high school. That summer before going off to college, my friends and I saw nearly every rock band that came through LA. I kept a collage of most of the ticket stubs. It is fun to look through them now because I had forgotten how many bands I saw live back then. Van Halen, Queen, Elton John, the Who \u2013 all the big name performances. It\u2019s also interesting to see that those tickets cost in the range of USD $10-20. When I think back to those times, I was making minimum wage ($3.10) at the supermarket and could manage a ticket to a big show for less than a day\u2019s labour. It\u2019s surprising to compare to today. Susan Lund, 61, Oregon, US \u2018This was how I got the attention of my school mates\u2019 Growing up in Brisbane in the 70s/80s was mostly spent playing sport and watching and listening to music. Countdown on Sunday night was the perfect end to the week as we watched with excitement to see which song would get the coveted No 1 spot. The next day at school there would be a discussion with a bunch of like-minded pop music aficionados around whether the song was deserving of the top position or if another song should have taken it. As my interest in music increased, I made the decision to plaster my diaries with cutouts from various music magazines (Smash Hits, Rolling Stones, No 1, Countdown) and supplement every square inch of the diary with everything from chart, radio and concert flyers and stickers to Raiders of the Lost Ark picture cards. Constructing a labyrinthine scrapbook that could be unfolded to reveal previously hidden treasures was how I was going to get the attention and interest of my school mates. Mission accomplished. Fady, Sydney, Australia \u2018It was called the Bruce Book\u2019 I made my scrapbook in the mid-80s when I was 16. It was called The Bruce Book, with photos, magazine articles, newspaper cuttings, ads, and even song lyric sheets all about the Boss. Back in the mid-80s, Springsteen established himself as one of the biggest music acts in the world but it was actually quite hard to get hold of interviews and reviews as he was not keen on doing publicity. I then set about collecting articles from the likes of Record Mirror, Smash Hits, Melody Maker, and Sounds. I kept collecting till the late 80s when he took part in the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! tour with the likes of Sting, Tracy Chapman and Peter Gabriel. Little did I know my fandom would come in useful in later life as in the 90s I worked in advertising and one of the clients I worked with was Sony Music, who Springsteen signed to, and I got to work directly on his album launches. Things come full circle as I found myself down the road with another 70,000 people in Hyde Park recently singing along to all those massive 80s hits I collected the song lyrics of from Smash Hits all those years ago. Paul O\u2019Grady, 54, Petts Wood, Kent \u2018I still love Bowie\u2019 I started my scrapbooks in the mid-70s. I stuck in the photos I\u2019d collected over the years and asked school friends to save any they found for me. I cut out any text, whether it was interviews or whatever. Regretfully, these scrapbooks are a couple of the only things I have as memories of my youth. I still love David Bowie, though. Matt Davis, 62, London \u2018In 1995, I worshipped Blur\u2019 During the late 80s and early 90s, my brother used to give me mixtapes of whatever music he was into at the time. Being 15 years his junior, I worshipped him and everything he listened to \u2013 including Girls &amp; Boys and Parklife by Blur, both of which featured on his 1994 mixtape. By 1995, my school locker was plastered with Blur posters and my scrapbook was coming along nicely. It was a compilation of photos cut from magazines, newspaper clippings and quotes from the band members, all of which were glued on to A4 paper and lovingly preserved in the plastic pockets of a black folder. I recently found it in a forgotten box in my old bedroom. I\u2019m not generally a nostalgic person, but that\u2019s one piece of teenage memorabilia that came back with me.

The suit alleges the EPA failed to consider impacts on endangered species, as is required by law, when it set new rules that will expand biofuel use nationwide during the next three years, said Brett Hartl, government affairs director with the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), which brought the litigation. The agency has twice ignored court orders to study the impacts and is probably dodging the requirements because ethanol production \u201cprops up\u201d the corn industry, which has a politically powerful lobby, Hartl added. \u201cThe Biden administration failed to even modestly reform this boondoggle and crumbled again in the face of political pressure from powerful special interests,\u201d Hartl said. \u201cOur streams and rivers will choke with more pollution and coastal dead zones will continue to expand.\u201d The EPA said in a statement that it does not comment on ongoing litigation. About 40% of all corn grown in the US is used for ethanol production, and nearly half is used as animal feed. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set minimum levels of biofuel usage for the transportation sector. The new rule approved by the agency calls for about 15bn gallons (57bn liters) of conventional corn ethanol for each of the next three years, plus an increase from 5.9bn gallons to 7.3bn gallons of advanced biofuels during the same time period. While the fuels are designed to decarbonize the transportation sector, their production eliminates wetlands and prairie land that act as carbon sinks, Hartl noted. The EPA in 2018 estimated that up to 7m acres (2.8m hectares) of land had been converted to grow corn for ethanol fuel. Ethanol production also pollutes water. Regulations around pesticides and fertilizers used in corn grown for ethanol fuel are much looser, which means much higher levels of dangerous chemicals run into surface and groundwaters. The pollution probably plays a significant role in dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico after pesticides flow down the Mississippi River, Hartl said. Still, the EPA has failed to adequately scrutinize those issues, he added, and has failed to fully comply with the Endangered Species Act. It requires the agency to complete consultations with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to address harm to endangered species from land conversion, pesticides and fertilizer use. The biofuel rules cannot \u201cjeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat\u201d, the law states. The EPA is using \u201cdirty tricks\u201d to circumvent the law, Hartl said. Instead of meeting with the agencies before the rule was finalized, the EPA skirted the process by consulting with the agencies after it had completed its new rules, and just days before it sent the rules to the White House for final approval, Hartl said. The move comes after the DC circuit court ordered the EPA to consider harm to endangered species in 2019 and 2020. In a more recent settlement on the issue, the EPA again promised to properly analyze the fuels\u2019 impact on the environment, but did not, Hartl said. The agency has essentially claimed the issue is too complex to study and it has limited authority, Hartl added, which he characterized as a \u201ccop-out\u201d. \u201cEveryone knows [the EPA is] hugely determinative as to how much of this stuff makes it into people\u2019s cars,\u201d Hartl said. \u201cLast time I checked, that\u2019s supposed to be their job \u2013 to assess harms to the environment and rationally address them \u2013 but they\u2019re really not doing that.\u201d Because the litigation is over a federal rule, the legal process does not require plaintiffs to ask for a remedy, and Hartl said the CBD was still considering what it will ask the court to do. But he said its attorneys would seek a \u201cmore aggressive remedy\u201d because the case marks the fourth time the two sides have been in court over the issue. If the EPA did take an \u201chonest look\u201d at the environmental harms caused by biofuel production, it would probably find that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, Hartl said, adding he suspects the agency knows it would come to that conclusion. \u201cThere is very little evidence when you look at the full life cycle \u2013 transportation, processing, refining and, when you take into account land use, degradation \u2013 that corn ethanol is really making a difference,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e32", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/24/british-manufacturers-share-of-eu-business-falls-despite-global-trade-boom", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share of EU trade for English and Welsh factories falls despite global trade boom", "lead": "Make UK report says post-Brexit structural shift in trade is particularly hurting factories in north-west and West Midlands", "author": "Phillip Inman", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 09:22:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680269", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1804c8538acf122de4b1a68345a2008ffff5d1/0_167_5040_3025/500.jpg", "body": "Factories in England and Wales are seeing a downward trend in the share of their trade going to the EU, an analysis from the manufacturers\u2019 trade body shows. Make UK said that between Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU in 2020 and 2022, only Scotland and Northern Ireland increased their share of exports to the EU, leaving the majority of English regions and Wales suffering a decline in the proportion of sales going to the bloc. Research by the business advisory firm BDO for Make UK indicated that a structural shift in the UK\u2019s trade patterns was hurting factories in north-west England and the West Midlands that had previously forged strong connections with firms inside the single market and customs union. The study of official data found that the UK\u2019s share of manufacturing exports to the EU had increased slightly in 2022, to 52% from 50% in 2019, but put this down to an increase in tariff-free trade across the land border in Ireland owing to the Northern Ireland protocol and a jump in the value of Scottish oil and gas exports after Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine sent wholesale prices soaring. \u201cThis [rise] was a result of sharp increases in the share of exports to the EU from Northern Ireland and Scotland over the same period, without which the overall UK share of goods exports would also be on a downward trend,\u201d the report said. \u201cFurthermore, given the share of goods exports to both Asia and Oceania and North America has remained relatively stable at around 16% since 2019, this would indicate that UK manufacturers are looking at opportunities outside their traditional big three markets.\u201d According to the analysis, London and the south-east and east of England were the only English regions to have experienced an increase in their share of goods to the EU since 2019. The share of goods exported by London and south-east England increased from 49% to 50%, while the east of England\u2019s share rose from 49% to 54%. Meanwhile, the north-west recorded a drop in its share from 52% to 50%, the West Midlands slipped one percentage point to 45%, and the north-east, which depends heavily on its relationship with northern Europe, suffered a fall from 60% to 57%. By contrast, in the same period Northern Ireland\u2019s share increased from 59% to almost two-thirds (64%), while Scotland recorded an even sharper increase, from 50% to 59%. The figures follow separate data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) last month that showed Britain endured the worst exports record of any member of the G7 besides Japan over the last decade. Unctad said the UK\u2019s goods and services exports had a value of $813bn in 2012 and rose by just 6% to $862.6bn by 2021, compared with the double-digit increases, calculated in US dollars, enjoyed by Canada (10.2%), France (16.1%), Germany (22.7%), Italy (15.9%) and the US (13.8%). Make UK said the figures for 2022 showed that England\u2019s small and medium-sized factory owners, which face the biggest burden of extra costs from customs checks, needed more government support for exporting to countries outside the EU. Verity Davidge, director of policy at Make UK, said: \u201cGiven the EU remains the most important market for manufacturers, efforts still need to be made to improve the existing agreement with the EU to reduce barriers to trade. \u201cHowever, UK trade patterns may be undergoing a gradual shift, with many companies continuing to look for opportunities in other markets. This has significant implications for export support and government policy must reflect this.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 24 July 2023. As the main text makes clear, it is the share of EU trade for English and Welsh manufacturers that has fallen, not that of British manufacturers as an earlier version said."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e33", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/24/icacs-handling-of-investigation-into-gladys-berejiklian-to-be-probed-by-watchdog", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Icac\u2019s handling of investigation into Gladys Berejiklian to be probed by watchdog", "lead": "Commission\u2019s inspector, Gail Furness SC, to examine whether delays amount to \u2018maladministration\u2019", "author": "Tamsin Rose", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 09:05:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680287", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/da9ff40f9f4db841c58eece9ae4b94250b122a1e/216_168_4167_2500/500.jpg", "body": "The New South Wales corruption watchdog\u2019s handling of the investigation into former state premier Gladys Berejiklian, including the length of the probe and the public way it was handed down, will be the focus of an investigation by its inspector.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Former state treasurer Matt Kean had written to Furness in June to request the investigation, after complaining about his former boss\u2019s treatment by the watchdog. The Icac found Berejiklian engaged in serious corrupt conduct, but she has maintained she served the public interest \u201cat all times\u201d while in office. In response, Furness said she would investigate whether the delays by the Icac amounted to \u201cmaladministration\u201d, and probe the effectiveness and appropriateness of the way the commission acted, and the presence of the media at the furnishing of the report. The office of the inspector confirmed the scope of the investigation in a statement on Monday night \u201cThe Inspector intends to make a special report to Parliament at the conclusion of her investigation, which she will recommend be made public,\u201d a spokesperson said. Furness gave no indication of when that report would be completed. The Icac investigation into the former premier spanned from September 2021 until June 2023. Despite the findings against Berejiklian, the body did not recommend charges be laid against the former premier. Kean wrote to Furness to request she consider investigating the body over the prolonged nature of the probe and the decision to allow media to be in the room when the final report was handed to the parliament\u2019s presiding officers in June. He welcomed the confirmation of the scope and \u201cespecially the recommendation that the outcome of such a serious investigation be made public\u201d. \u201cMany in my community shared my belief that the corruption watchdog had turned the investigation into the former premier and the release of their findings into an undignified circus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll find out if they\u2019ve also crossed a legal line. \u201cThis investigation will make clear if the Icac has engaged in serious maladministration, inappropriate activity and serious impropriety, but the damage to Gladys has already been done.\u201d In June, a spokesperson for the inspector, which fields complaints about Icac and oversees its conduct, said the office was preparing to investigate the widely criticised delays. \u201cThe inspector is currently determining the scope of an investigation around the delay in the furnishing of the Operation Keppel report to parliament,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe inspector intends to make a special report to parliament at the conclusion of her investigation, which she will recommend be made public.\u201d The Icac declined to comment on Monday evening."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e34", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/24/slow-running-revolution-sexy-pace-enjoy-the-race", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The slow running revolution: how to move at a \u2018sexy\u2019 pace \u2013 and really enjoy the race", "lead": "Forget personal bests, stopwatches and numbers on the scales.

The four-minute mile. The two-hour marathon. The 10-second 100m. Recreational runners \u2013 a country mile away from breaking these barriers \u2013 still chase times, pore over \u201csplits\u201d (minutes a mile or kilometre) and obsess over shaving minutes, or seconds, from their personal bests. But change is afoot. Away from the business end of the sport, where records continue to tumble, running\u2019s vital statistics are getting slower. Between 1986 and 2018, the average finish time for a 10km race slipped by about 12 minutes and for a marathon, by 39 minutes. The biggest factor in the slowdown is that running has become a broader church. A glance at any start line confirms that there are runners of all ages, abilities, shapes and sizes, a far cry from when I started out, more than 30 years ago, when race participants were uniformly skinny, swift, club-vested \u2013 and mostly male. Martinus Evans, 36, is the proud owner of eight marathon medals. His running journey began 11 years ago, when his doctor told him: \u201cMr Evans, you\u2019re fat. You have two options: lose weight or die.\u201d At the time he weighed 21st 7lb (136kg). Evans announced he would run a marathon, much to the doctor\u2019s derision. But he went on to do exactly that and has since completed more than 100 other races. \u201cRunning has nothing to do with a number on a scale or a time on a stopwatch,\u201d he says. Evans set up, and is now in charge of the Slow AF Run Club, a virtual club with more than 10,000 members, and his book of the same name came out last month. \u201cMy message is that running is for anyone and that you can do it in the body you have right now,\u201d he says. Evans\u2019s experiences in past events \u2013 being called \u201cfat and slow\u201d by the driver of the \u201csweeper vehicle\u201d that brings up the rear, getting lost because route signage had been taken down and crossing finish lines to find no medals or water left \u2013 might suggest that not everyone agrees. However, he believes the outlook for non-traditional runners is improving. \u201cOne race director said that after he read my story, he started to offer finisher T-shirts up to size 3XL,\u201d he says. In 2020, after consultation with slower runners who had reported negative experiences at the previous year\u2019s event, the London Marathon launched its \u201cback-of-the-pack\u201d initiative. The finish line on the Mall now remains open until 7.30pm, with 50 \u201ctailwalkers\u201d starting at the back of the final wave on all three starts and moving at eight-hour marathon pace (18 minutes and 18 seconds a mile). A tailwalker will drop back to support any runner struggling to maintain that pace, moving on to the pavement with them and accompanying them to the finish line. \u201cDrinks stations and timing mats remain in place until all tailwalkers have passed,\u201d says Lianne Hogan, the event\u2019s communications manager. Even after the official finish line closes, an alternative one in St James\u2019s Park is open for those coming in later than 7.30pm. \u201cAll participants who finish on marathon day and have not left the course at any point will get a medal,\u201d says Hogan. Lisa Jackson, a member of the 100 Marathon Club and author of Your Pace or Mine? welcomes the move. \u201cI think races should extend their cutoffs if they can. Why exclude anyone?\u201d Jackson describes herself as \u201cborn genetically slow\u201d, and has finished last in 20 of her 110 marathons. \u201cMy attitude to racing is that it is about the time you have, not the time you do,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a driven person, but not time-focused at all. I don\u2019t want to be looking at my watch all the time. What\u2019s important to me is the connections I make with others. I love talking to people, and the people at the back of the pack talk more.\u201d Jackson\u2019s disregard for speed is music to the ears of Bethan Taylor-Swaine, who is researching problems around inclusivity in running for her PhD. \u201cWe need to move away from pace as the sole marker of success and find other ways of interpreting or rating running experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve no problem with people chasing times, but let\u2019s also talk about what else we value about running.\u201d Parkrun, the global series of free weekly 5km timed events, has played an instrumental role in filling the pews of running\u2019s broader church, if not prising the doors open in the first place. Parkrun is not a race but a run (although you will still see fingers poised over watches at the start line) and has no time limit for its 5km distance. As each event has a volunteer tailwalker bringing up the rear, it is impossible to come last. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the traditional narrative around what running should be, making it more spacious and inclusive,\u201d says Chrissie Wellington, a four-time Ironman world champion and Parkrun\u2019s head of health and wellbeing. The average finish time in 2005 was 22 minutes 17 seconds whereas in 2023, it is 32 minutes 34 seconds. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that our finish times are getting longer,\u201d says Wellington. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better at giving more people the opportunity and space to walk or run at whatever pace they feel comfortable. Ultimately, it\u2019s about movement. There are incredible health benefits from running at any pace, and from walking.\u201d Wellington makes an important point when I use the term \u201cslow running\u201d. \u201cThere are many reasons why people might choose, or need, to run slowly,\u201d she says. \u201cSpeed is relative. One person\u2019s leisurely pace is another\u2019s maximum effort. Finish time can be just as important to a slower runner as to a fast one.\u201d Taylor-Swaine no longer tells people her race finish times, as part of her attempt to broaden the conversation about running. \u201cIt really gets some people\u2019s backs up,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of not being a \u2018real\u2019 runner.\u201d Instead, her suggested questions to ask runners at the finish line include: \u201cHow did you feel?\u201d, \u201cWhat was your highlight?\u201d and \u201cHow will you celebrate?\u201d I admit that I have always kept a close eye on my time. When my performances started to decline with age, I found my enjoyment of racing following suit. That has not been the case for former British elite marathoner Tina Muir (personal best 2hr 36min), who retired from professional running in 2017, aged 28. I am intrigued to know how she continues to derive satisfaction from crossing a finish line, despite her best times being behind her. \u201cIt took a while not to care what the result next to my name said and what people would think,\u201d she says. \u201cMy first race as a non-professional athlete was miserable as I hadn\u2019t let go of the habit of pushing myself to the brink. But gradually I realised I really enjoyed running when I wasn\u2019t obsessing over the result. I just ran a 10km in 1hr 4min \u2013 my slowest ever by far \u2013 and it was so much fun!\u201d I have found a different way to recalibrate my relationship with running as I have got slower. I have stopped racing entirely, swapping performance targets for goals such as stress reduction, time in nature, mental and physical health. I am not alone. Sarah Kern, a runner for 25 years, also gave up racing six years ago. \u201cRunning can be so comparative,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about performance goals. Every time I signed up for a race, I\u2019d either lose all motivation to train or get injured. Now I run because I want to be out there. I love the headspace, being in nature. It\u2019s quite liberating not to care any more about my pace. I\u2019ll run a bit, walk a bit, stop and take pictures of the bunnies.\u201d We slow runners even have a new vocabulary that is far more positive than words such as \u201cplod\u201d and \u201cshuffle\u201d: \u201cJeffing\u201d, which describes a walk-run combo (named after Jeff Galloway, the US Olympian who was a fan of it as a coaching technique); \u201cpicnic pace\u201d (used by ultrarunners) and my favourite, Martinus Evans\u2019s \u201csexy pace\u201d. I suspect there will be naysayers reading this who will grumble that 18, 16 or even 12 minutes a mile isn\u2019t \u201cproper running\u201d. Perhaps they will suggest that people should train more or lose weight before they toe a start line. But as the slow running movement gathers pace, they will be the ones left behind."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e35", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/football-transfer-rumours-fabinho-dogs-saudi-move-bayern-munich-kylian-mbappe-real-madrid", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Fabinho\u2019s dogs to scupper \u00a340m Saudi move?", "lead": "Kyle Walker and Harry Kane to Bayern Munich? | Michael Olise to Chelsea or Manchester City? | Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to Real Madrid via Saudi Arabia?", "author": "Gregg Bakowski", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 08:36:31", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680329", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a966a53b70c43c478f3a0cca4520b40a46be7d5a/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "In news it is safe to say The Mill didn\u2019t see coming this morning, Fabinho\u2019s \u00a340m move from Liverpool to Al-Ittihad has apparently been thrown into jeopardy by rules in Saudi Arabia banning \u201cdangerous and aggressive dogs\u201d from the nation. The Brazilian has two French bulldogs and, although they look about as threatening as a couple of sticks of candy floss, they may be categorised as \u201cdangerous\u201d owing to poor branding when names were being handed out to fashionable pets. The Mill would have liked Fabinho \u2013 and other footballers \u2013 to have been put off moving to Saudi Arabia because of other hardline rules there but in the Brazilian\u2019s case it seems the line could be drawn at discriminating against cute dogs. The developments are being watched keenly in Bavaria where, it says here, Bayern Munich are ready to give the midfielder \u2013 and his fluffy friends \u2013 a new home. The German champions seem keen to build their team around a collection of ageing Premier League players, with Manchester City\u2019s Kyle Walker still on their wanted list alongside Harry Kane, who looks increasingly likely to leave Tottenham after the longest transfer saga in history but will cost more than \u00a370m. Chelsea and Manchester City are set to do battle over the signature of nifty young Crystal Palace attacking midfielder Michael Olise. The 21-year-old reportedly has a \u00a335m release clause which City are ready to trigger but tricky Todd Boehly could gazump them with a \u00a339m bid for the hell of it. PSG have had enough of the Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 sideshow and have started an auction for the France striker. Obviously, a bid from a Saudi club was always going to be on the cards and Al-Hilal are readying a \u20ac200m offer with a reported two-year deal worth \u20ac200m a year in wages and the possibility of a one-year release clause which can only be triggered by Real Madrid. Whatever this is, it isn\u2019t football. Maurizio Sarri used to ignore Callum Hudson-Odoi when he was Chelsea manager and, perhaps because he is spiked by guilt, he wants to atone for his lack of care in the past and help the young winger realise his potential at Lazio. He\u2019ll cost a snip at \u00a312m plus add-ons, though Fulham might make a late move for him. If they fail in hijacking that move they may switch their attention to Demarai Gray, who could be available for as little as \u00a37m from Everton.

West Ham will be happy to sell Gianluca Scamacca to Roma if they can rescue Divock Origi from a pretty torrid time at Milan. David Moyes is also keen on Ajax midfielder Edson \u00c1lvarez, who looks as hard as he tackles. The Mexican Declan Rice would cost \u00a340m. And free agent Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is still perusing a list of clubs he could join, with Besiktas, Brighton and Brentford high up among them."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e36", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/share-your-barbie-themed-film-plans-and-photos", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Share your Barbie-themed film plans and photos", "lead": "We would like to see photos of your Barbie outfits and plans following the release of the film", "author": "Guardian community team", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 08:34:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680349", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2b17eaf8f46a09c44143fddce6a4ae298c94657c/407_247_3025_1815/500.jpg", "body": "Following moviegoers flocking to the cinema to watch Barbie during its opening weekend, we would like to see photos of your outfits and hear what you thought of the film.

A late header from substitute Girelli was what Italy needed to get them over the line after a frustrating game. Germany v Morocco is about to get underway so make sure you keep up with that and return to join me later for Brazil v Panama. For now you can catch up with Italy v Argentina here: The Golden Boot is another battle of this World Cup and the US\u2019 Sophia Smith continues to top the charts. You can keep up to date with the trophy fight in real time here: Here\u2019s Girelli\u2019s winner, the clip is from ITV and so some may not have access: The next game up is Germany v Morocco and you can keep up to date with all the action from that one: After that result Italy sit second in their group with Sweden top on the amount of goals scored thanks to their 2-1 win over South Africa yesterday. Will Girelli get the starting shirt next game? I think she will after that goal, the impact she had! She was only on the pitch less than four minutes and she found the breakthrough. The corner is taken short and is out of play, full-time! Italy\u2019s support staff are in a huddle jumping up and down. Italy\u2019s squad do the same. Girelli\u2019s header the difference in a frustrating match. 90 + 8 min: Boattin takes it to Girelli, who has it back to Boattin and her shot is out for a corner. 90 + 7 min: Rodriguez is down on the edge of the area but no free kick given this time. Stabile gets a yellow card and concedes a free kick. 90 + 5 min: Bonsegundo fires the free kick on target but Durante makes a great save. Italy counter and Cantore takes a shot but it is wide. 90 + 3 min: Argentina make a change with Falfan off for Ippolito. Italy concede a free kick in a dangerous position, right on the edge of the box! 90 + 1 min: I expected a lot of time to be tacked on with the amount on injuries and there will be seven added minutes. Giugliano is down in the box but there wasn\u2019t anything in the tackle, no penalty. 90 min: Argentina almost immediately respond with a long range free kick from a foul. Durante saves once more and can clear her lines after being fouled herself. 88 min: That may have been Girelli\u2019s first touch! Her header sends her team wild, they huddle around her. The support staff and the coach are emotional with that goal. Talk about instant impact! A great cross and Girelli rises to head home, then runs and slides on her knees! 86 min: Bonsegundo has a great run but Italy do enough to repel the chance. Bonansea gets a yellow card for a foul and gifts Argentina possession. 84 min: Greggi shoots but Correa saves! It\u2019s do or die now to pick up more than a point as we come to the closing stages of this match. Italy make another change as Dragoni comes off for Girelli. 82 min: It\u2019s the final touch letting Italy down, Argentina on the other hand just need some time on the ball to thread something together. 80 min: Mary has got in touch and said: \u201cGreetings from Northern California. It\u2019s 10.40pm. I took a long nap this afternoon and I am going to mainline coffee so I can stay up for the first two fixtures. In 2019 Italy played the most entertaining brand of football and just ran out of gas against the Netherlands. I am hoping for a repeat performance.\u201d I respect the dedication! Yes, Italy have played with some slick football today but it is more akin to their disappointing run at the Euros last year than the 2019 World Cup. They need to convert a chance soon, they have had the upper hand. 79 min: That was close! Giugliano lays it off for Bonansea but Argentina see it out for a corner. It comes in but the opportunity is wasted again because of a foul. 77 min: Braun takes a tumble but she is up quickly. Bonsegundo gets a yellow card for a foul on Cantore and Italy have a free kick. Argentina make a change before the set piece with Nunex off for Rodriguez. 76 min: Giacinti is off for Italy with Cantore on. This game has been fragmented, wasteful but lively! It\u2019s a great one for neutrals but the teams\u2019 fans must be frustrated. Bonansea has a shot on target but Correa can easily save. 74 min: Boattin looks frustrated as a decision goes against her, conceding a free kick. Wow what a hit! It bends around on target from Bonsegundo but Durante gets a hand to it, Larroquette then hits it out of play. 72 min: Linari takes some contact off the ball which sees her limp for a while but she is okay to continue. 70 min: What a run from Bonansea, it\u2019s such an electric break the only way Argentina can stop her is by hacking her down. Mayorga gets a yellow card for the foul. Giugliano is over the ball and it is just over the bar! 68 min: Falfan concedes another free kick, needless push to the floor. They take it quickly and it eventually comes into the box but Giacinti can\u2019t get good contact. Cometti had a bit of cramp and is receiving treatment on the side of the pitch so Argentina are down to 10 for a moment before she comes back on. 66 min: Argentina ping it into the box but Durante punches away again \u2013 she really doesn\u2019t like to catch a high ball. 64 min: Salvai is also receiving treatment, it looks like for a knee problem and so play does not immediately get back underway. She comes to the side but is staying on. 62 min: Bonansea makes a great cross in but it is headed away. Boos rain down as Bonsegundo has an injury and play isn\u2019t stopped, the referee then does pause play. Bonsegundo is receiving treatment for a head injury but she is okay to continue. 60 min: Beccari fouls and Italy have a free kick. Before they take it Italy make their first change with Caruso off for Greggi. Giugliano takes it but it\u2019s poorly taken, it\u2019s straight out of play. 58 min: Italy are in a good position and a shot comes in from outside the box but it is over the bar. Bonansea works it around a few defenders and rockets a shot but it sails over. 56 min: The Mexican wave has started in the stands and it generates one of the biggest cheers of the game. Giugliano has a good run but her pass only finds an Argentinian player. 54 min: Falfan concedes a free kick, Argentina looking more frustrated with each decision that goes against them. Boattin takes it and Giacinti gets a head to it but she can\u2019t target it on goal and a teammate can\u2019t finish it off. 52 min: Italy do get some build-up play together but it ends with a Bonansea cross that is not met by a teammate. 50 min: Stabile takes it and it is almost in! Durante gets a touch on it to stop it, she slaps it down and Italy manage to clear. 49 min: It\u2019s like the ball is a hot potato and the players don\u2019t want it at their feet! Boattin gives away a free kick from a foul on Nunez, it\u2019s in a good position. 47 min: A slow start to the second half with possession exchanging hands quickly. Momentum is a tough thing to grasp in this match with build-up play non-existent at times. The action is back! Duncan has emailed saying: \u201cAs a South African, the stalemate so far is good news for us! Hoping Sweden pick up the pace and beat both of these sides, and that we can get a smash and grab win over one of them at least and squeeze through!\u201d This result will open the group wide open if it does stay as a stalemate! Co-hosts Australia have been hit with an injury to their captain Sam Kerr but the team have continued to show a confident front. Have a read of this: Who will win the World Cup? It\u2019s a big question and one fans will question throughout. Kurt has got in touch and asked: \u201cCan Argentina win?\u201d It\u2019s certainly possible but with favourites US, England and Spain they may find it tricky to get their hands on the trophy. For me, I think the US will do it again especially with a talent like Sophia Smith. Eric has emailed and said: \u201cGreetings from Hong Kong! Thanks for the coverage. I\u2019ve been greatly enjoying all the competitive matches so far this World Cup. Such a delight to see news stars like Dumornay! I don\u2019t have a favourite in this match, but the back and forth action is gripping.\u201d Yes so many games have been closer than people anticipated. Italy have had the ball in the back of the net twice but with both ruled offside the deadlock remains. Both teams have been strong but it is the final pass or shot that is not coming off for them at the moment. A lot to play for in the second half. 45 + 3 min: Linari has a risky pass back to her own keeper but Durante manages to collect. Bonsegundo takes a shot but it is out for a corner. Stabile takes the corner again, they go short and it is then thundered in. It\u2019s headed away, it comes back to Stabile\u2019s feet but Durante collects. 45 + 1 min: There will be four minutes added on/ 45 min: Banini wins a corner and Stabile steps up to take the set piece. They take it short but it is well read by Italy\u2019s Dragoni who intercepts. She loses possession higher up the pitch. 42 min: Oh Italy! Again they thought they had an opener but Giacinti\u2019s run was offside. A great finish and she starts to celebrate but the flag is lifted. 40 min: Argentina can only thread a few passes together before Italy win it back. Bonansea wins a free kick in a good place Giugliano takes it, it is cleared easily. Boattin pops it back in but it\u2019s headed clear. Giacinti is in here but she fouls an the chance is gone. 38 min: A great ball in but Giacinti can\u2019t control the chance, her run was impeccable though. Caruso fouls Nunez \u2013 what a battle this is \u2013 and Argentina can relieve some pressure. 36 min: Boattin is hobbling to the side of the pitch after treatment, no replacement is being prepared so I think she will stay on. 34 min: Italy win a free kick, it comes in and is dealt with initially by Argentina. It comes back in though and Caruso is so close to getting a shot away. Mayorga and Boattin collide, Mayorga is okay but Boattin needs a bit of treatment. 32 min: Giugliano is over the corner ball and sends it in but Correa punches away. Salvai pops it back in and Correa punches away \u2013 maybe should have caught that but she cleared the danger nonetheless. 30 min: Possession continues to pass between the teams quickly but it ends with Italy winning a corner. John Cartmell has emailed and said: \u201cAlso watching late Sunday night into Monday A.M. on Telemundo. I\u2019m in Portland, Oregon, home of the NWSL champion Thorns (thank you, Sophie!) and the University of Portland Pilots, alma mater of both Christine Sinclair and the Rapinoe sisters, among other pioneers of world class North American women\u2019s soccer. Plenty of passion, pace, and power so far in tonight\u2019s game. Italy and Argentina are well represented.\u201d Good evening! Yes Sophia Smith a great player for the Thorns and the US \u2013 one of the breakout young stars of the World cup I suspect. 28 min: Banini takes the free kick but it smacks the wall. Argentina still have possession and Banini makes an amazing run but Italy manage to deal with it. Two players are down after colliding. It was Nunez and Bonansea, the Italian is back to her feet but the Argentinian looks in a bit of pain here. She is eventually back up and okay. 26 min: Banini makes a good run but her resulting cross has too much on it. Larroquette is fouled by Caruso and she gets a yellow for her efforts \u2013 a free kick is awarded in a very good spot. 24 min: Caruso again gets a good ball in but no one is in a good position to take a shot. Larroquette stayed down after a challenge and takes some time to get back to her feet but she is okay. 22 min: Caruso rockets a ball into the box but no one if there to pick it up. Linari is down here after a collision with Bonsegundo but she doesn\u2019t need treatment and okay to continue. 20 min: Nunez takes the free kick but Caruso heads away. It comes back in and Nunez has a great run but great defence from Linari sees it out. Italy try a counter but Boattin fouls Nunez. 18 min: Confirmation it was offside. Larroquette is fouled herself this time and it launches an Argentina attack. Bonsegundo makes a good run and she is hacked down to win a free kick. 16 min: A wasted opportunity there, Argentina were in a great spot but Larroquette fouls again and coughs up possession. Italy immediately attack and Caruso thought she had the opener! It\u2019s a good pass, takes a few touches and volleys it home. They celebrate and then the offside flag goes up! VAR are checking it but I don\u2019t think it will be awarded. 14 min: Argentina\u2019s back line are doing well to swarm the ball when Italy attack now, they seem more confident in their actions in the past few minutes. 12 min: Argentina ping the ball into the box but Durante easily collects. Larroquette gets a yellow card for a foul on Bonansea. 10 min: Salvai cuts out a cross from Nunez, Argentina continue with the attack but Boattin shepherds it out for a goal kick. Bonansea lays off a beautiful ball for Giacinti but her shot is straight at Correa. 8 min: Bonansea is fouled and Italy have a free kick, it is in a good position. It comes in but Argentina defend it really well. Italy have grown into this and after the early chance from Argentina they have hardly had the ball. 6 min: It comes in but Stabile concedes another corner. Boattin take it once more and Caruso gets a touch to it but it hits the side netting. She is appealing for another corner but the referee awards a goal kick. 4 min: Argentina are looking for their first World Cup win in this match and they have started the better, Italy are just settling into this. Caruso passes a pinpoint ball into the box and it is out for a corner. It comes in and Argentina can\u2019t clear their lines \u2013 so close to an opener. Italy are on the attack once again but Falfan sees it out for another corner. 2 min: Stabile is fouled early on to earn a free kick and she takes the kick herself. It comes in and Larroquette almost scores a bicycle kick! So here we go! Who will come out on top? We will soon find out. The players are out and the anthems are underway. A good crowd for this one, including Natalia Portman! We are just a few minutes away from kick-off.

I\u2019d love to know where you\u2019re at and what time zone you\u2019re in! Is it breakfast, lunch or dinner? Let me know via Twitter or email. We have a section on rising stars from each country at the World Cup in our guides and here is Italy\u2019s: \u201cGiulia Dragoni, 16, made the news in Italy and abroad when named in the squad. Dragoni, a gifted midfielder, is just 16 and played only a few Serie A minutes with Inter. In January, she left for Barcelona, becoming the first foreign woman to reside at La Masia, the legendary Bar\u00e7a academy. However her talent is clear and Dragoni has always been considered destined for success. At a very young age she was named \u201clittle Messi\u201d for her dribbling and technical qualities. After six months with Barcelona B, she is expected to train \u2013 and debut \u2013 with the first team next season.\u201d Read the full piece: Here is some information on Argentina\u2019s star player from our guide to the country\u2019s team: \u201cIn 2021 Estefan\u00eda Banini became the first Argentinian woman to be named in Fifa\u2019s Best World XI. Her technique and ability mean the 33-year-old Mendoza-born midfielder remains key to the national side. This will be her second and probably last World Cup. \u201cI understand that this is over and have enjoyed it to the fullest,\u201d she said. \u201cI have mixed feelings: I would love to play for life, especially with the national team.\u201d\u201d Read the full piece: The team news is in! Italy starting XI: Durante; Di Guglielmo, Linari, Boattin, Salvai; Giugliano, Bonansea, Beccari, Dragoni, Caruso; Giacinti. Argentina starting XI: Correa; Stabile, Cometti, Braun, Mayorga; Nunez, Falfan, Bonsegundo, Benitez, Banini; Larroquette. Good morning, afternoon or evening depending on where you are tuning in from! We are in for a treat as we kick off day for of the World Cup with Italy v Argentina. The two nations are in group G, the other two countries in the group competed against one another yesterday. Sweden narrowly beat South Africa with a last-minute winner meaning they sit top of the table. But if Italy or Argentina can get a win bigger than a one goal difference they will take top spot. Italy had a good run at the 2019 tournament, making it to the quarter-finals. Argentina, meanwhile, have never been beyond the group stage and so that will be their target for the 2023 edition. It will be a close encounter with Italy having the slight upper hand in the odds for favourite to win. The game will kick-off in an hour and the teams should have their teams news shortly.

Cheng was subjected to a closed trial in Beijing on 31 March 2022 over national security-related accusations, but has yet to be informed of a verdict. The decision was due last week but has now been delayed for a further three months, the latest in a series of extensions. Her partner, Nick Coyle, said the delay was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThere has been no verdict or outcome since her trial 16 months ago, and it will be three years in very difficult custodial conditions \u2026 on 13 August,\u201d Coyle said on Monday. \u201cFair-minded people in Australia and all over the world simply do not accept this as reasonable. \u201cIt quite unnecessarily damages China\u2019s standing at a time many good people from both countries are seeking to repair relations and move the relationship forward.\u201d The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has raised consular cases in all of her meetings with Chinese counterparts, including when she held talks with China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, in Jakarta earlier this month. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said on Monday: \u201cThe Australian government shares the deep concerns of Ms Cheng\u2019s family and friends about the ongoing delays in her case, and will continue to advocate for her at the highest levels. \u201cWe continue to call for basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment, in accordance with international norms, and for her to be reunited with her family in Australia.\u201d The Chinese embassy told the Australian newspaper: \u201cChina\u2019s judicial authorities have handled the case in accordance with the law and the lawful rights of Cheng are under full protection.\u201d In May the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told Guardian Australia national security-related matters took \u201cmore time\u201d to reach verdicts, when asked about the cases of Cheng and fellow Australian detainee Yang Hengjun. Xiao reiterated his own personal concerns for Cheng, the journalist who had not seen her children in \u201csuch a long time\u201d. \u201cI will continue to try to do my utmost to facilitate more access, that she could have some kind of access granted to her partner and friends and families to let them know that she\u2019s OK.\u201d The cases are one of numerous obstacles in the overall diplomatic relationship between Australia and China. The China Daily, a state-run outlet, published an editorial on Sunday evening criticising the Australian government\u2019s \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d decision to reject a proposed takeover of a lithium mine. The Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said on Monday that he acted in line with advice from the foreign investment review board (FIRB) in blocking the proposal for Austroid Australia to take a 100% stake in Alita Resources Ltd. Chalmers told reporters in Canberra the government had \u201ca non-discriminatory foreign investment process\u201d but would not say more. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate that I provide further commentary on specific cases like that one,\u201d he said. The China Daily wrote that the takeover \u201cwas apparently nixed, because Austroid Australia has a Chinese national as a director, who is also a director of the Chinese company, Liatam Mining, which tried to buy Alita\u2019s assets in 2020 but was unable to get FIRB approval\u201d."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e39", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/24/paunch-free-zone-why-barbie-movie-ken-body-diversity-empowerment", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Paunch-free zone: why the Barbie movie\u2019s body diversity message shortchanges Ken ", "lead": "Greta Gerwig\u2019s empowerment movie is unarguably righteous.

After a difficult history setting, and maintaining, unrealistic beauty standards, she has been reinvented as a feminist icon. But there\u2019s a problem \u2013 one that shortchanges half the potential audience and jeopardises the overall empowerment message. It\u2019s the Kens. Ken has, of course, long been portrayed as a pretty boy, the canonical boyfriend throughout the decades. Consequently, he hasn\u2019t formed as tangible a personality as the more contemporary Barbie dolls we see today, with Mattel focusing on humanising their lead figure in all her varying manifestations. Although Ken has always played second fiddle to his girlfriend, some of director Greta Gerwig\u2019s decisions over how to portray them in her film weakens the patriarchal deconstruction she\u2019s aiming for. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Kens\u2019 appearance. While there are at least two plus-sized Barbies, and one in a wheelchair, none of the Kens are anything other than svelte. Even those who lack a six-pack certainly don\u2019t have a paunch. Ken becomes like the Barbies of the past: generic, carbon copies of coiffed hair and muscles. They\u2019re manufactured so only their looks matter, their worth beholden to their desirability; those who don\u2019t quite fit the mould, like Allan, become outcasts. Then, like the Allan dolls, these outcasts are quickly discounted because they have no place in Barbieland. That Barbie is allowed to be any size, despite the societal constructs that originally shaped her creation, feels unfair if Ken is trapped in a slim body. Plus-size men are denied a film in which they are represented, unlike female viewers in this case. One could argue that men don\u2019t require such breadth of representation \u2013 after all, this film is not aimed at them, right? But that\u2019s surely not the outcome Gerwig \u2013 or Mattel \u2013 were after. Barbie\u2019s journey of self-discovery is rooted in a challenge to the patriarchy. Although that patriarchy protects the Kens, the film shows how it also damages them, and leads them to turn Barbieland into a mecca for toxic masculinity. While the type of man being portrayed is one many people may have encountered, confining the Kens to that one type prevents them from escaping the very patriarchal system the Barbies are attempting to break down. In the end, the Barbies adhere to the same standards. Rather than becoming a matriarchy, which seeks to find power from within as opposed to exerting it over others, the Barbies end up holding absolute power over the Kens. No one is freed from Ken\u2019s coup; it simply gets a fabulously pink makeover. A general critical consensus has formed on the foundation that it\u2019s OK to dilute the Kens down to a parody of themselves because they\u2019re only suffering the same humiliation women have endured. However, having the Barbies act like real-world men ultimately continues the long legacy of male influence, as opposed to quelling it. Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken is on a journey alongside Barbie, too: he\u2019s trying to learn who he is without Barbie, and finds himself left wanting. Even as the film ends, and Barbie is able to venture into the real world as a real woman, Ken is simply \u201cKenough\u201d; he has no ending. His singing about his \u201cblond fragility\u201d is met with laughter, yet the joke conceals depths. Ken might be played as a repetitive one-note character, but he has complexities: he\u2019s insecure and self-conscious, and bombastic in his attempts to mask his feelings of inadequacy. Compared to Margot Robbie\u2019s Stereotypical Barbie, Ken is in fact significantly multifaceted. Given how the narrative unfolds, Ken is unequivocally central to the plot. Without him, there is no Barbie movie \u2013 but there is no closure for his story. As viewers, we\u2019re left with an uncomfortable punchline: that people are either superior or inferior, and that one group has to lose in order for the other to win. Does this mean Barbie is a write-off, failing to live up to the hype? Not at all. But its powerful message of empowerment is skewered to only empower in one direction. Men have been retained their empowered position over millennia, but it still feels like a grey area to elevate Barbie by shortchanging the Kens. If Barbie is a feminist icon, the message should be equality for all, and not at the expense of someone else."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e3a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/24/car-parts-shortage-leaves-drivers-in-limbo-as-makers-put-sales-first", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Car parts shortage leaves drivers in limbo as makers \u2018put sales first\u2019", "lead": "Motorists are waiting months for repairs, or having cars written off, because replacement parts apparently cannot be found.

The one-year-old Volkswagen needed a new bumper and sensors. Her insurer, Aviva, told her to book it into an approved dealership \u2013 and that\u2019s where it\u2019s been ever since. \u201cFour months on, there\u2019s still no update on when they\u2019ll have the bumper,\u201d she says. \u201cIt took three months for Aviva to get me a courtesy car, and when I call for updates I\u2019m sent round in circles.\u201d Late last week, after queries from the Observer, Aviva said the part had finally arrived and her repair had been prioritised. The company apologised and paid compensation. Joad is one of thousands of drivers left in limbo because of a global shortage of car parts. Insurers are writing off vehicles because of indefinite repair delays, according to the National Body Repair Association, which estimates that drivers are having to wait five weeks longer than the pre-pandemic average to book cars in. Several who have contacted the Observer have been forced off the road for months with no update on when their vehicle can be repaired. A shortage of courtesy cars, caused by the same manufacturing issues, means those in rural areas are effectively immobilised. Car manufacturers blame Covid and the invasion of Ukraine for disrupting global supply chains. Two-thirds of vehicle components are produced in China and the Middle East, where lockdowns hit supply and demand, while Ukraine is critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. Added to this, there\u2019s a Europe-wide shortage of mechanics and HGV drivers to install and transport the parts. However, our investigation suggests some drivers are being fobbed off by manufacturers who are prioritising sales over repairs. Several readers who had waited months because a crucial part could not be sourced found it could be summoned as soon as we questioned the delays. Mark Ellis was left with an unroadworthy Mercedes for seven months after a headlamp unit failed, leaving him without lights or indicators. \u201cThe dealer ordered a replacement last October and, come May, could give me no date on when it might become available,\u201d he says. \u201cRaising a complaint to Mercedes-Benz UK customer services yielded no response. Without lights, it couldn\u2019t pass its MOT.\u201d Ellis\u2019s car was repaired a week after the Observer intervened. Mercedes blamed \u201cglobal supply issues\u201d. Anitre MacDonagh\u2019s Jeep Compass was also stranded when a replacement for a defective oil part could not be sourced. \u201cAfter five weeks, the dealer notified us that there was a production problem and our order had been cancelled,\u201d she says. \u201cAccording to Fiat UK [Jeep\u2019s parent company], the manufacturer needed an order of 200 parts before it could be produced, and it could take up to a year. We called Fiat/Jeep dealers in the US, Italy and Albania on the off chance it might be in stock, but no such luck. One dealer told us Fiat has stopped making replacement parts, meaning our four-year-old is now obsolete.\u201d Fiat produced the part as soon as we got in touch. It tells us: \u201cDue to an unfortunate set of circumstances, there has, on this occasion, been an error in the process of obtaining the part for the customer.\u201d Clara Coleman* was left without wheels after her BMW was recalled by the manufacturer to investigate a software issue. She was informed that a cooling device was leaking and, as a necessary part was unavailable, the repair could take months. \u201cThe dealer advised they would need to impound the car until it could be repaired as the fault could be fatal. However, they could not offer a courtesy car,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the meantime, I am paying my finance agreement with BMW for a car which has been condemned, and no end in sight.\u201d The part was found and a loan vehicle provided two days after the Observer made inquiries. BMW says: \u201cThe parts required are not on back order. Rather, they had to be ordered from a central UK warehouse. BMW, and its retail network, always strive to minimise disruption for our customers, offering mobility solutions on a case-by-case basis.\u201d According to Chris Rosamond, current affairs and features editor of car magazine Auto Express, poor communications on the part of manufacturers, and a drive to boost sales at the expense of repairs, are leaving thousands of drivers stranded. \u201cIn recent months parts shortages have caused manufacturers to prioritise new vehicle production, and they are choosing to ringfence parts supply or production capacity for that purpose,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe knock-on effect has been frustration and uncertainty, often not helped by a less-than-transparent approach from manufacturers when it comes to sharing information via dealers.\u201d Industry insiders claim the situation is the worst they\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous,\u201d says one senior executive in the body repair sector, who asked not to be named. \u201cEvery manufacturer is affected by the current shortage of semiconductor chips. Because car production dropped during the pandemic, manufacturers cut back orders for spare parts. Meanwhile, demand for electronic devices in the home soared, so chip producers started selling more to Apple and the like. \u201cNow manufacturers find themselves at the back of the queue and, once they get hold of chips, they use available spare parts to put into new cars, as that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d He says insurance firms are increasingly writing off vehicles with minor damage because it\u2019s cheaper than funding a courtesy car during an indefinite wait. It\u2019s the consumer who ultimately foots the bill. The average premium has risen 40% in 12 months, according to new research by Confused.com. An increase in payouts for write-offs is one of the factors it cites for the record price rise. The Association of British Insurers tells the Observer: \u201cLike many other sectors, motor insurers are facing significant challenges due to inflation, supply-chain disruption and global shortages, and are doing all they can to manage the impact. \u201cWhether a damaged car can be repaired, or written off, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d There is no legal requirement for spares to be available for a set period in the UK, but all large manufacturers have signed up to The Motor Ombudsman\u2019s new car code, which makes the vague stipulation that parts should be available throughout production of a model and \u201cfor a reasonable period thereafter\u201d. If a car is less than two years old, or it is under warranty, the manufacturer has a legal responsibility to replace it with a similar spec if it can\u2019t be repaired. *Name has been changed How to beat the delays Repairs under warranty, or via an insurance claim, have to be undertaken by a dealer or an approved garage. Drivers of older vehicles needing routine work may be better off seeking an independent body workshop and authorising the use of non-branded parts or components recycled from compatible vehicles. The one positive of the strangled supply chain is that the sale of these so-called \u201cgreen parts\u201d is soaring in response to the manufacturing shortfall, and some insurance companies are starting to embrace them as an alternative. They are up to 70% cheaper than new components and reduce the environmental impact of the repair industry."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e3b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/though-the-bodies-fall-by-noel-oregan-review-eloquent-tale-of-trauma-and-absence", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Though the Bodies Fall by Noel O\u2019Regan review \u2013 eloquent tale of trauma and absence", "lead": "An unflinching debut novel set in west Ireland explores the pull of place and duty", "author": "Lucy Popescu", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 08:00:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680442", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3845bb46d13e1f59e83c9c34c3298a017f580c/0_231_5385_3230/500.jpg", "body": "Noel O\u2019Regan, born in Tralee, County Kerry, is a notable addition to the wave of literary talent coming out of Ireland. In his debut novel, he writes about difficult subjects such as depression, trauma and absence with a quiet eloquence. Miche\u00e1l lives in his family\u2019s bungalow at the end of Kerry Head: \u201clike some tourist\u2019s dream of a rural Irish cottage\u201d. It\u2019s a stunning landscape, but the cliffs exert a powerful pull on the bereft and Miche\u00e1l\u2019s home is the last port of call before the headland. His parents had felt it was their duty \u2013 spiritual and civic \u2013 to attempt to save the lost souls they referred to as \u201cvisitors\u201d. When Miche\u00e1l\u2019s father dies, his mother places the burden on her young son\u2019s shoulders \u2013 an experience from which he never fully recovers. O\u2019Regan\u2019s focus is the inner turmoil of his troubled protagonist who frees others from their personal demons but is sinking under the weight of his own. Miche\u00e1l escapes briefly to study in Limerick, finds love with budding rower Nadine, whom he marries, and embarks on a tentative teaching career. But the 2008 recession upends their plans. After his mother\u2019s death, they move to the Kerry bungalow, ill-prepared for the emotional cost on their relationship. Now in his early 40s, Miche\u00e1l contemplates his past mistakes, avoiding thoughts of the future. His sisters are keen to sell the land, but he is loath to relinquish the place he feels tethered to, even if it offers him little comfort. He spends his time bird-watching and recording passing ships \u2013 the irony is that they move on, while he remains stuck. His only companion is his dog, Sammy. Moving between two timelines, Though the Bodies Fall takes time to ignite, but O\u2019Regan\u2019s exploration of ordinary lives shattered by extraordinary circumstances, strained sibling relations and the vicissitudes of solitude is perceptive. In unfussy prose, O\u2019Regan creates an evocative sense of place and depicts Miche\u00e1l\u2019s sense of duty, guilt and increasing self-neglect with unflinching honesty. \u2022 Though the Bodies Fall by Noel O\u2019Regan is published by Granta (\u00a312.99).

As per the title, director \u00c1lvaro F Pulpeiro has a habit of looking frequently to the skies, casting them in an aghast, high-contrast yellow and indigo, as if the spillage of this petrostate\u2019s woes has tainted something spiritual in the higher order of things. Interspersing it all with radio commentary discoursing on million per-cent inflation and the disputed 2018 election, and poetry extracts tolling the bell for the country itself, Pulpeiro roams Venezuela in search of telling vignettes: soldiers firing ordnance off navy vessels in the Caribbean, refugees joining the exodus into Brazil, a recurring ride-along with a man transporting a newborn child (a symbol of hope, or maybe hopelessness). Only once \u2013 as a mariachi group serenades a pair of giggling women in the back of a pickup truck \u2013 is there much optimism. Otherwise, the pervasive mood is a sense of betrayal by those in power. At one point, driving around as the baby wails in the backseat, the radio relays Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro denouncing Donald Trump, and Pulpeiro owns them both with another burst of verse: \u201cI\u2019m talking to you as a child from a homeland just like any other / A father like any other / Voracious Saturn.\u201d That Venezuela is devouring its children hits home in the long final section, accompanying a group of almost Mad Max-like wastrels decanting gasoline in rough conditions at a makeshift depot in the Guajira desert just across the border in Colombia.

Here were the main developments today: Treasurer Jim Chalmers said officials expect the federal surplus for 2022-23 to be about $20bn. In announcing this Chalmers said the government is \u201cnot currently working\u201d on new cost-of-living relief measures, and are instead rolling out measures that have already been announced. Meanwhile, seasoned economist Chris Barrett has been appointed to head the Productivity Commission for the next five years. No campaign leader and former Labor minister Gary Johns is facing calls to resign after comments he made proposing blood tests to prove Aboriginality for welfare payments emerged. Labor senator Jana Stewart said these were \u201coutdated views, from over 100 years ago\u201d. Meanwhile, NSW Liberals MP Matt Kean labelled Johns\u2019 comments \u201cout of touch and extreme\u201d, saying he should be sacked if he doesn\u2019t resign. Meanwhile, no campaigner Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said the yes vote is popular in Victoria because it\u2019s one of those \u201cdifficult states\u201d where everything is \u201cabout ideology and not common sense\u201d. The government will spend nearly $10bn to buy 20 new Hercules transport planes from the US \u2013 eight additional ones, and 12 to replace existing Hercules planes. Deputy prime minister Richard Marles said they are a \u201ccrucial asset\u201d in peacekeeping operations and bushfire and flood emergencies. Former senior public servant Kathryn Campbell resigned from the Department of Defence in the wake of the robodebt royal commission report. The government will make it easier for casuals to convert to full-time work if they choose, under Labor\u2019s next stage of industrial relations reforms. A child was located after a car was stolen in Dandenong, Melbourne with the two-year-old on board, Victorian Police confirmed. A male surfer is in hospital after being bitten by a \u201csuspected white shark\u201d near Gnarabup beach in Western Australia this morning. As always, we\u2019ll be back here bright and early tomorrow morning. Have a lovely evening! Target to merge operations with retail bedfellow Kmart Retail department chain Target will merge its administrative operations with stablemate Kmart, as part of a plan by their owner to boost returns in the competitive sector. Perth-based conglomerate Wesfarmers said in a statement the two store networks had operated closely for some time. Kmart managing director Ian Bailey said: The announcements today are an internal reorganisation of our support offices and there are no impacts to the Kmart or Target stores. The change was first reported by the Australian Financial Review. The competitive price-focussed Kmart drives significantly more revenue for Wesfarmers than Target, which sells affordable apparel and home furnishings. Wesfarmers has long cited an unsustainable cost base at Target for a decision to close or convert its stores, a strategy that has been in place for several years. At the end of last year, there were just under 250 Kmart stores in Australia, almost double the number of Target stores. There are also more than 50 smaller-format K-hub stores. Child located after a car stolen from Dandenong Victorian police have confirmed a toddler has been located at a business on Burwood Highway in Ferntree Gully this afternoon after a car was stolen with the two-year-old on board. Investigators have been told a black Kia Carnival, registration 1WU5QT, was parked on Cleeland Street in Dandenong about 3.25pm. The toddler was located a short time later at a business in Ferntree Gully about 4.35pm, and was not injured during the incident. Police are still searching for the stolen vehicle. Anyone with CCTV, dashcam footage, information or who witnessed the incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines so far with the Afternoon Update from Antoun Issa: Baby found after car stolen in Melbourne Victorian police have confirmed the toddler that was inside a stolen car in Melbourne has been found. We will bring you more details as they emerge. Deputy prime minister Richard Marles has shared a photo on social media of his meeting with the minister of state for the armed forces of the United Kingdom, James Heappey, in Canberra today. Marles tweeted: Our two nations have a proud history of cooperation, including to support Ukraine\u2019s self-defence. Thank you Minister Heappey for hosting our ADF personnel who are helping train Ukraine recruits at Operation Kudu. The Bureau of Meteorology has released its national weather outlook for the week ahead: Desperate search for stolen car with toddler inside A frantic search is under way after a car was stolen with a toddler inside in Melbourne, AAP reports. Police say a black Kia Carnival, registration 1WU5QT, was parked on Cleeland Street in Dandenong about 3.25pm on Monday. The exact circumstances are yet to be determined but the vehicle was parked with the two-year-old child in the rear seat when it was stolen. Witnesses report seeing the vehicle driving towards Heatherton Road. Anyone who sights the vehicle is urged to contact triple zero. South Australia Health has reported another case of meningococcal disease, bringing the state\u2019s total this year to 17 \u2013 compared to eight cases recorded at the same time last year. The latest case was reported in a 55-year-old man from regional South Australia. He has been admitted to hospital in a stable condition, and two contacts have been directed to take clearance antibiotics. Labor vows to \u2018get to the bottom\u2019 of robodebt Labor\u2019s assistant trade minister Tim Ayres is asked on the ABC about Kathryn Campbell\u2019s resignation. He said he learned the news live on air when Afternoon Briefing host Greg Jennett put the matter to a different guest. Responding, he commented on the government\u2019s focus around robodebt broadly: We as a government have been determined to do two things here, one is commenced this royal commission process, make sure we get to the bottom of what has happened here. It\u2019s been a cruel, illegal, unfair process that has demonised some of the most vulnerable Australians and put people in a terrible position. Get to the bottom of that. Secondly, make sure we are government that is driven by what are the proper processes. You have seen that unfold over the last couple of weeks. There is a royal commission report which is completely authoritative which has made adverse findings about previous ministers, including the previous prime minister. There is a confidential section \u2026 It is important people in my position respect that process and don\u2019t say anything that would undermine the process. Role of Hercules goes beyond military operations, minister says Veterans affairs minister Matt Keogh is speaking to the ABC about Australia\u2019s investment to acquire 20 new C-130J Hercules aircraft. He said their role goes beyond military operations, also being used for humanitarian efforts: The Hercules uses a military airlift aircraft but also plays a vital role in humanitarian assistance. Whether supporting bushfire operations or floods here in Australia, as they were in the north-west of Australia at the beginning of this year, or across our region where that assistance required. Keogh is asked whether the government has the right to slow down acquisitions if they don\u2019t meet the personnel targets needed. He said Australia needs to grow the size of its defence force for many different reasons: Obviously we do need to grow the size of our defence force, not just for this capability but for capabilities across the defence force. We have a big uplift coming with the Aukus submarine program \u2026 That is consistent across the board. [That\u2019s] why we are putting in such a tremendous effort to make sure we are growing our recruitment, retaining more of our people in defence, making changes at that end as well. Matt Kean says no campaign\u2019s Gary Johns should step down NSW Liberal MP Matt Kean is continuing to campaign for a yes vote on the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum. Appearing on Sky News, he said that although the result \u201cwill be tight\u201d he is feeling optimistic. With the momentum that I\u2019m seeing out there in the community, the yes case can get up. Kean said he wants to see a respectful debate take place: What we don\u2019t want to see is the divisive and extreme views that are entering the debate. He points to comments made by Gary Johns. Earlier, we reported that Johns is facing calls to resign from his position in the no campaign after comments were published in which he appeared to suggest blood tests for welfare payments, among other remarks. Kean said Johns\u2019 comments were \u201cout of touch and extreme\u201d: They have no place in any organisation, let alone in a body that\u2019s leading the no campaign in the referendum. I think the good people running the no campaign should have the dignity \u2026 to ask Mr Johns to step down. This guy has a long history of offensive and extreme views which should have no place [during such an important debate]. Kean said if Johns refuses to stand down from the no campaign, he should be sacked. Government to boost options for casual workers The assistant climate and energy minister, Jenny McAllister, spoke to the ABC about the governments plan to give casuals the option to switch to permanent employment under certain circumstances. It won\u2019t be for everyone, a lot of people like working casually, but for some people it can make all the difference. We know that we need to talk to employers about this and we need to talk to unions about this so that we can bring together arrangements that are workable and practical for everyone involved. But this is a commitment that we made before the election and we want to go back to the situation we had just two years ago when there was a clearer definition of what a casual really was, and a clear pathway for people to move to permanency if in fact that reflected their actual work circumstances. McAllister said the pandemic demonstrated the importance of benefits such as sick leave: \u2026 not just for the employee but also for their family and often in fact for their co-workers, who might prefer that a person who is sick actually has the financial capacity not to come to work that day and not to make everyone else in the workplace sick as well. In breaking news, former senior public servant Kathryn Campbell has resigned from the Department of Defence in the wake of the robodebt royal commission report. Defence issued a statement moments ago that said: Defence can confirm it has accepted Kathryn Campbell\u2019s resignation from the department with effect from Friday 21 July 2023. Defence will not provide further comment on this matter. It comes after confirmation last week that Campbell had been suspended without pay. Greens urge government to negotiate over housing bill demands The Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, just spoke on Sky News about the Greens call for an annual $2.5bn investment in affordable and public housing. He said: When we\u2019re talking about affordable housing \u2026 it\u2019s not just for those most doing it most tough \u2026 but also there\u2019s teachers or nurses looking for a sharehouse right now who can\u2019t find anything. Chandler-Mather is asked whether the Greens are any closer in its negotiations with the government over the housing bill. He said the party is \u201cpushing as hard as we can\u201d on its two sticking points \u2013 an annual $2.5bn investment in affordable and public housing, and a rent freeze and cap. We would be willing to pass the bill as soon as possible if they came to the table on our two key demands. Chandler-Mather clarified that the Greens wouldn\u2019t necessarily refuse to pass the bill if their demands aren\u2019t met, but they want the government to start negotiating with them: We\u2019ve already halved our offer we put to the government, we started at $5bn \u2026 the reality is the government does need to realise that their proposal at the moment will see the housing crisis get worse and they need to negotiate \u2026 Detained journalist Cheng Lei\u2019s partner says latest delay unreasonable The partner of detained Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who is currently being held in China, says the decision to delay the verdict \u201cunnecessarily damages China\u2019s standing\u201d at a time when efforts are under way to improve the bilateral relationship. Her partner, Nick Coyle, said today: It will be, of course, deeply disappointing for Lei and of course her family. There has been no verdict or outcome since her trial 16 months ago, and it will be three years in very difficult custodial conditions ... on August 13. Fair-minded people in Australia and all over the world simply do not accept this as reasonable. It quite unnecessarily damages China\u2019s standing at a time many good people from both countries are seeking to repair relations and move the relationship forward. Cheng Lei was subject to a closed national security related-trial in Beijing on 31 March 2022 but has yet to be informed of a verdict. Guardian Australia understands the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was told the verdict deadline of 19 July had been extended for a further three months \u2013 the most recent in several such extensions. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has raised consular cases in all of her meetings with Chinese counterparts, including with Wang Yi in Jakarta earlier this month. A spokesperson for Dfat said today: The Australian government shares the deep concerns of Ms Cheng\u2019s family and friends about the ongoing delays in her case, and will continue to advocate for her at the highest levels. We continue to call for basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment, in accordance with international norms, and for her to be reunited with her family in Australia. ACTU hopeful Reserve Bank will not raise rates tomorrow Asked on Sky News whether she expects the Reserve Bank to announce another rate rise tomorrow, the ACTU\u2019s secretary, Sally McManus, said: We would hope the reserve bank does not put up rates again. We say that because they have been talking about for a while [about] a mythical wage spiral which has not come about. McManus argued that around the world in countries where inflation is falling, wage rises have also been bigger. Given what\u2019s happening around the world, the Reserve Bank should absolutely hold fire. Sally McManus positive on new productivity commission chair but warns against groupthink The ACTU\u2019s secretary, Sally McManus, just spoke to Sky News on the appointment of Chris Barrett to chair of the productivity commission. McManus said she doesn\u2019t know who Barrett is, but \u201che sounds pretty well qualified to me\u201d: The bigger problem is when you have an issue with groupthink, and I think that\u2019s what the productivity commission got to, like the Reserve Bank [where you had people with] one way of seeing things. Having a diversity of views so they can be challenged \u2026 always leads to better decision making. Greens renew call for annual $2.5bn investment in public housing With news that Australia\u2019s federal budget surplus will likely be over $20bn, the Greens has renewed its call for an annual $2.5bn investment in public and affordable housing: The Greens\u2019s housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, tweeted: Once again, all the Greens are asking for to pass the [housing Australia future fund bill] is a commitment to invest $2.5bn in public &amp; affordable housing every year and put $1bn on the table to coordinate a rent freeze and cap. Man bitten by shark on WA coast in \u2018stable condition\u2019 Just a bit more information on the shark bite at Gnarabup beach in WA: A St John\u2019s Ambulance spokesperson confirmed the man in his 20s is believed to be in a stable condition at Bunbury hospital. He was transferred there by St John\u2019s from Margaret River hospital earlier today. We are seeking more information from the hospital. Duo charged with smuggling $61m in cocaine inside yacht Two men accused of importing cocaine worth more than $61m into Queensland by sea will remain in custody, AAP reports. Matthieu Anthony Rees, 44, and Rachid Kachour, 55, both from Griffith in the ACT, were arrested at their Canberra apartment on Thursday as part of an investigation into a quarter-tonne of cocaine seized from a yacht moored in Townsville. Police say one of the men threw a backpack containing $290,000 in cash in a vacuum-sealed bag from the apartment balcony when the officers knocked on the front door. Australian Federal police allege the cash was the proceeds of crime. The acting magistrate, Athol Kennedy, adjourned Rees\u2019 matter to 1 September and ordered Kachour\u2019s case be heard again on Tuesday. Food delivery driver dies in Sydney on Saturday Unions say a food delivery rider who died in Sydney on Saturday was working for UberEats at the time. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) issued a statement late Monday sharing its condolences with the rider\u2019s family. The ACTU said such incidents serve as a reminder of \u201cwhat\u2019s at stake when workers don\u2019t have the protections they need at work\u201d and criticised the lack of any system in Australia to give transport gig workers basic rights, including minimum wage and sick leave. The ACTU said it is the 12th-known food delivery rider known to have died since 2017, nine of whom were UberEats riders. The ACTU\u2019s secretary, Sally McManus, said urgent reform was needed to improve the rights of delivery workers. The precarious nature of the work means they are forced to take risks just to bring in a paycheck. These workers deserve so much more. Working no matter what the weather or time to bring us convenience comes with a cost, employers are passing risks onto individuals in the pursuit of corporate profits. Chalmers says foreign investment review board advised him to block lithium mine takeover The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says he acted on advice from the foreign investment review board (FIRB) in rejecting a proposed takeover of a lithium mine. But a Chinese state media outlet has described the decision as \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d. In a prohibition order published late last week, Chalmers blocked the proposed acquisition by Austroid Australia of an extra 90% stake in Alita Resources. Because it already has a small stake in the business, the proposal would have increased Austroid\u2019s stake in Alita to 100%. The Australian newspaper reported that the proposal would have given Austroid \u201ccontrol of one of Australia\u2019s only in-production lithium mines \u2013 Bald Hill \u2013 owned by Alita Resources\u201d. In an editorial published last night, the China Daily wrote that the decision was \u201cdisheartening as both sides have everything to gain from maintaining the positive momentum that has revived the ties\u201d between Australia and China. The newspaper added: It [the takeover] was apparently nixed, because Austroid Australia has a Chinese national as a director, who is also a director of the Chinese company, Liatam Mining, which tried to buy Alita\u2019s assets in 2020 but was unable to get FIRB approval. Chalmers was asked at a media conference in Canberra today why he had blocked the deal \u2013 and what it signalled about the government\u2019s approach to China-linked investments in critical minerals in Australia. Chalmers said: We run a non-discriminatory foreign investment process, very similar across governments of either political persuasion. I issued a prohibition order last week consistent with advice from the foreign investment review board. And just like other decisions that I\u2019ve taken in the past, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate that I provide further commentary on specific cases like that one. Pat Conroy \u2018very confident\u2019 ALP conference will support Aukus Conroy was also asked whether the Aukus deal is under any threat, following speculation that it would be debated at the ALP national conference. He remains \u201cvery confident\u201d the conference will support Aukus: This is the policy of the Albanese Labor government because it\u2019s in our national interest. It is in our national interest and we\u2019re getting on full speed with implementing it. I was in the United States last month discussing the legislation that\u2019s required in the US system. We\u2019re getting on with the job and I\u2019m very confident that the national conference will support us. Pat Conroy: Albanese Labor government has spent \u2018billions\u2019 on hardening northern military bases Pat Conroy, the minister for defence industry, also responded to comments from the Air Force chief over the weekend saying that he was not confident Australia can defend its northern bases. Well, the chief of the Air Force was reflecting on what the Albanese Labor government inherited. And what we did was commission the defence strategic review [which] said one of the critical six priorities that we immediately need to work on is hardening our northern bases. That\u2019s why we allocated billions of dollars to do that work. And obviously, the chief of the Air Force is reflecting that assessment and the need for that money to go into \u2013 whether it\u2019s RAAF base Tindal, Scherger, our naval port at Darwin, the army base at Townsville. We need to harden these facilities and that\u2019s why the Albanese Labor government is allocating billions of dollars to do that. Pat Conroy says $9.8bn investment in Hercules fleet will increase RAAF capacity and create \u2018hundreds\u2019 of jobs The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, has given a doorstop interview following the announcement that Australia\u2019s Hercules aircraft fleet will rise from 12 aircraft up to 20. This investment of $9.8bn will almost double the fleet and represents a massive uplift in capability in mobility and transport for the Royal Australian Air Force. He said the government is buying eight extra aircraft and replacing the existing 12, which have been in operation since 1999. Deliveries will start in 2027 and the first twelve will arrive by 2030, Conroy said. Almost doubling the fleet gives Australia more capacity to deploy the aircraft on multiple operations at the same time, Conroy said. He added that \u201chundreds\u201d of jobs will be created or maintained through supporting the Hercules aircraft in the north-west of Sydney: Those maintenance jobs are critical to keeping those aircraft in the air \u2026 hundreds of jobs will be supported around RAAF base [in] Richmond. And secondly, there are Australian companies that supply parts into them. Quickstep is a very advanced composites company that will really do great work in the supply chain there as well. \u2018Significant\u2019 fire hazard burn backlog ahead of summer Firefighters are scrambling to prepare for the upcoming bushfire season in NSW after wet weather and floods severely hampered backburning, AAP reports. The state government has committed an extra $10m for 100 more NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) crew to speed up their \u201ccritical work\u201d ahead of the upcoming bushfire season, saying just 20% of planned burns were completed. Fire authorities are urging residents to prepare for a drier summer after three wet years spurred vegetation growth. RFS\u2019s commissioner, Rob Rogers, said the \u201creturn of dry, windy conditions\u201d meant teams were needed \u201cout there doing hazard reduction burns at every opportunity\u201d. The state emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, conceded there was a \u201csignificant backlog in hazard reduction burns\u201d statewide: We need to accelerate our efforts heading into the next fire season and these additional crews will help make a difference. The Bureau of Meteorology has declared an alert for an El Ni\u00f1o weather event, which lifts risk of drought, heatwaves and bushfires. New Productivity Commission chief has \u2018the right skills and attributes\u2019: Chalmers The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has shared a photo on social media of him with Chris Barrett, who has been appointed the chair of the Productivity Commission for a five-year term: In a statement, Chalmers said: Barrett brings to the table the right skills and attributes to take the Productivity Commission into the future. [His] experience \u2013 from key senior roles in important international institutions to practical experience delivering reforms in both state and federal governments \u2013 will further cement the commission\u2019s role as a world-class economic institution. I would like to thank outgoing chair Michael Brennan for the significant contribution he has made to the commission\u2019s work and to the national economic debate over the past five years, and in his senior public service and ministerial advisory roles before that. Man in hospital following shark bite, AAP reports Further to our last post, AAP is now reporting that the man is in hospital after a possible shark attack along the Western Australian coast this morning. We\u2019ll continue to bring you the latest news as we learn more. Investigations are under way after a surfer was bitten by a shark near Margaret River in Western Australia today. The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development confirmed a male surfer was bitten by a \u201csuspected white shark\u201d at about 8.45am this morning. The incident took place at a boat ramp surfing spot near Gnarabup beach. Officers from the shire of Augusta Margaret River have closed beaches from Gas Bay to Margaret River Mouth following the incident. The department is encouraging people to take additional caution in the Gnarabup and Prevelly areas, and adhere to beach closures. If you see a shark, report it to water police on (08) 9442 8600. WFH chills the outlook for the commercial property market We\u2019ve gotten used to seeing city skylines spiked with construction cranes, but perhaps that\u2019s going to be a rarer sight in the future if NAB\u2019s commercial property index is any guide. According to the bank, the index eased further into negative territory in the June quarter to be down to -7 points from -6 in the March quarter. (The long-term average is -2, so perhaps negativity is the norm.) By sector, though, hotels are doing well (+38 points). Industry too is still humming at +26, but that was a two-and-a-half-year low. With so many of us working from home when we can, the office indeed extended its plunge to be at -28. Retail is also very weak at -17 and won\u2019t rebound soon \u2013 save perhaps for those peddling Barbie merch. NAB said: [A]ctivity is slowing sharply after a very strong period of growth in 2022. And with rates moving higher, the risks to growth continue to rise. Market sentiment was negative in all states bar Queensland (+8) in the June quarter but \u201clowest in Victoria by a big margin at (-22)\u201d, NAB said. Victoria was also the only state with a negative confidence outlook over the next two years (-4 points) and the only state to print negative in all market sectors, particularly the office (-25). As for office vacancies, the level actually dropped nationally to 9.6% in the June quarter from 9.9%. (Long-term average vacancy rate is 8.5%.) Empty space was highest in WA at 11.9%, with Victoria not far behind at 11.3%, while it was lowest in NSW at 8.2%. Indigenous voice to parliament no campaigner Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has taken aim at Victoria in the lead-up to the referendum. Appearing on 3AW radio, Price is asked why Victoria is one of the states with a majority of yes voters. She argued Victoria is one of those \u201cdifficult states\u201d where everything is \u201cabout ideology and not common sense\u201d: You only have to look at who\u2019s running the show here in Victoria and, you know, the level of activism that takes place in a place such as Victoria. You\u2019ve got the progressive no\u2019s who are pushing against it \u2013 [independent senator] Lidia Thorpe\u2019s doing her part in that \u2026 Victoria is one of those difficult states where everything is about ideology and not common sense. Price also argued that clubs and groups, such as sporting organisations, are publicly showing support for the voice as an act of \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d: Is it them trying to demonstrate, \u2018oh look, we\u2019re not a racist club\u2019? There\u2019s corporates out there, there are those who have virtue signalling and saying they support this and it\u2019s more about their own self-interest than it is actually about improving the lives of marginalised Indigenous Australians. [They\u2019re] saying, \u2018we\u2019re virtuous and we\u2019re not racist, please don\u2019t pick on us\u2019. Price said she is working towards 14 October as the date of the referendum, but still has no official confirmation. NSW premier says police \u2018well-resourced\u2019 after three people shot in Sydney AAP has an update on the shooting that took place in Sydney\u2019s south-west yesterday morning: The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has defended police resourcing after three people were shot in Sydney. A critically wounded 25-year-old man is among three people in hospital after they were shot while sitting in two parked cars in Greenacre early on Sunday morning. Assistant commissioner Stuart Smith told the Daily Telegraph: It has all the hallmarks of an organised crime hit, however there are no links to organised crime by any of the people involved. Police said on Sunday they are investigating gangland links but that there was \u201cno direct link to anything ongoing\u201d. The city\u2019s south-west has been grappling with a gang-linked war involving families that has claimed at least 11 lives in recent years and flared up again in the past few months. The premier described Sunday\u2019s attack as \u201cvicious and violent\u201d but says police have sufficient resources to curb the escalating criminal underworld tensions. Minns said this morning: We\u2019re in constant communication with NSW police about the resources that they do have to keep the public safe and if there are changes that they need, both in legislation or resourcing, of course we\u2019ll come to the party. The people of NSW are concerned about it [and] I want to assure them that we have a well-resourced, disciplined and experienced police team that are conducting this inquiry. A 22-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were hit and are in a stable condition in hospital. Police from Auburn are investigating with assistance from the state crime command. Chalmers to campaign for the voice no matter the timing Moving away from the economy momentarily, Chalmers has commented on the voice to parliament referendum. When asked about calls to delay the referendum to build a broader consensus for the yes vote, he says he will be campaigning for the voice no matter the timing: I\u2019m not going to wait for the timing of the referendum to be announced to campaign for the voice. I\u2019m looking forward to campaign in my community, home state and around the country \u2026 I recognise historically that Queensland has been a difficult place to make the case for changes like this one. That fires me up more, rather than deters me. When it comes to the timing of the referendum, that a decision largely for the prime minister and [Indigenous Australians] minister [Linda] Burney and others. I\u2019ll campaign for it whenever it is. More on officials expecting the surplus for 2022-23 to be about $20bn, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is asked if that gives the government greater scope to look at cost-of-living relief options, or if this will not be necessary with inflation starting to trend down. Chalmers says that even though inflation is moderating, it is higher than the government wants it to be: The government\u2019s main focus is on providing cost-of-living relief by rolling out the commitments we\u2019ve made over our first two budgets. We\u2019re not currently working on a new package of cost-of-living relief. We\u2019re focused on rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief we have already announced. What a much better budget position allows for is it gives you the flexibility down the track, in future budgets. If you want to do more on the cost-of-living front, it gives you the opportunity to do that and it builds a buffer right now. And we need to recognise that even though the budget is in much better condition in the near term, we have the longer term intensifying pressures as well. We weigh all of that up, but the approach we have taken is textbook fiscal policy, targeted relief for people but not at the expense of repairing the budget. Chalmers: 2010s \u2018worst for productivity growth in the last 60 years\u2019 Jim Chalmers tells reporters that productivity growth is \u201cabsolutely central\u201d to growing the economy and lifting living standards: I sat a metre or two from [former RBA governor] Phil Lowe and we made almost exactly the same point \u2026 If we want to see rising living standards and want to see different wages, productivity needs to be part of that. The economy has not been productive enough for too long. The decade to 2020 was the worst for productivity growth in Australia in the last 60 years. And it will take time to turn that around. Nobody pretends that there\u2019s a switch that you can flick to turn around what has been disappointing performance on the productivity front. We\u2019ve been realistic and upfront about that as well. We see productivity as absolutely central to growing the economy the right way, getting the decent wages growth and lifting living standards over time as well. Opportunity to \u2018revitalise and renew\u2019 Productivity Commission Chalmers says he is looking to \u201crevitalise and renew and refocus\u201d the Productivity Commission, and the appointment of Chris Barrett will provide an \u201cimportant opportunity\u201d. I think we\u2019ve got a really important opportunity here under Chris Barrett\u2019s leadership to take the PC forward into the future in ways that recognise that the productivity has evolved as well. We know the productivity gains made in recent Australian history were the product of governments which were prepared to recognise the economic conditions and the economic opportunities to make our economy more productive \u2026 We\u2019ve made it clear we think the productivity opportunity for Australia is not to make people work longer for less, but to invest in human capital and the energy transformation and get much better at adapting and adopting technology as it evolves. It will remain [wholly] independent, as it should be. It will be a very valued part of our institutional landscape when it comes to economic policy. Jim Chalmers has said officials expect the federal surplus for 2022-23 will be about $20bn \u201cor more likely just north of that figure\u201d. Addressing the media in Canberra, the treasurer also emphasised the government\u2019s priority is rolling out \u201ccost-of-living relief for people doing it tough\u201d without adding to inflation. Chris Barrett to lead Productivity Commission The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has announced that Chris Barrett will be the new chair of the Productivity Commission, serving for a term of five years. Speaking in Canberra, Chalmers said: Chris\u2019s appointment recognises if we want to build a stronger economy, then we\u2019ve got to build stronger economic institutions and that means renewing and refocusing and revitalising the Productivity Commission. Chris Barrett is a very experienced and very well-regarded economist and public servant. He has spent almost three decades working in public policy, the majority of that time as a senior public servant \u2026 His appointment comes after a rigorous merit-based process, which involved interviews with two departmental secretaries and the Australian public service commissioner as well. His experience \u2026 will be absolutely invaluable to our thinking as we renew and refocus and revitalise the Productivity Commission for the future \u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to working with such a well-credentialed, experienced and well-regarded economist and public servant. Chalmers: inflation \u2018will be higher than we\u2019d like for longer than we\u2019d like\u2019 Taking you live to Canberra now, where the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to the media about inflation. Following the G20 meetings in India last week, Chalmers says some parts of the world are in recession and some are proving more resilient, meaning there are risks in the global economy and Australia is \u201cnot immune\u201d: Right around the world inflation is moderating but it is still higher than what people would like to see. We will get a read on our on inflation numbers in a quarterly sense and a monthly sense [later] in the week but we\u2019ve made it clear that inflation is moderating in our economy. We would like to see it moderate quicker. It will be higher than we\u2019d like for longer than we\u2019d like, but it has come off the peak in inflation that we saw around Christmas time. And certainly less than the expectation is for less than what we saw at the beginning of 2022. Thanks to Natasha for taking us through the morning! I\u2019ll be with you for the remainder of the day \u2013 let\u2019s get into it. Handing over to Emily Wind who will take you through the rest of today\u2019s developments! John Farnham cancer free and \u2018doing fantastic\u2019 after surgery, says son John Farnham\u2019s son James Farnham says his father is cancer free and \u201cdoing fantastic\u201d after undergoing a 12-hour operation to remove a tumour in his mouth and reconstruct his jaw. Appearing on Seven\u2019s Sunrise this morning to discuss the premiere of the documentary, John Farnham: Finding The Voice, the 74-year-old singer\u2019s son said: Just the other day he was, you know, walking around with his cane and did a little bit of a dance, which was pretty fabulous. He\u2019s walking with his dog a lot \u2013 so he\u2019s really, really happy. Farnham said his father wasn\u2019t one to watch himself on television, but the family would \u201cmake him\u201d watch the documentary. Read Luke Buckmaster\u2019s take on the documentary, which airs today on Seven and 7Plus, here: NT police to use handheld scanners to search people for knives Northern Territory police will be allowed to use handheld scanners to stop and search people for knives and other weapons under proposed new laws, AAP reports. Police will be able to detect, seize and destroy weapons, and anyone caught with an illegal item could face a jail term of up to two years. The amendments stem from the government\u2019s review of bail and weapon laws released today. The chief minister, Natasha Fyles, said there was no place for knife crime in the territory and no excuses for people who committed knife crimes. Police will now have the powers to stop people, search them and destroy weapons they may be carrying. And if someone uses that weapon in a violent crime, it\u2019s going to be even harder to get bail. The government\u2019s review also added axes to the definition of controlled weapons and clarified the definition of a knife to include a machete. Violent offences involving those weapons will trigger a presumption against bail. A series of non-legislative changes include training for judges and prosecutors on the potential risks of defendants on bail, strengthening bail support programs and extra resources to ensure a faster resolution of court cases. Fyles said the legislative changes would be passed by the parliament as a matter of urgency. Many of Sydney\u2019s beaches deemed to be too polluted for swimming Any Sydneysiders considering a winter ocean swim today might want to think again. The NSW environment department is warning people to avoid swimming in several locations across the northern beaches and Sydney\u2019s east due to pollution. After recording more than 40mm of rain around Manly before 9am this morning, beaches from Shelly Beach to North Curl Curl have been flagged as likely to be polluted in the department\u2019s \u201cbeachwatch\u201d daily bulletin. The bulletin also says pollution is likely at Bronte and Coogee in Sydney\u2019s east, and possible at Bondi, Tamarama, Gordons Bay and Clovelly. The department says the predictions are made using rainfall data to determine the likelihood of bacterial contamination. The Australian federal police has seized 247kg of cocaine hidden inside a yacht\u2019s hull in Townsville and charged two men over the incident. In a statement, police said the men from Griffith attempted to sling cash over their apartment balcony before their arrest: Police allege one of the men threw a backpack containing $290,000 cash in a vacuum sealed bag from the apartment balcony when the AFP knocked on the front door and announced they had a search warrant. Police will allege the cash is proceeds of crime. AFP Det Supt Adrian Telfer said the cocaine seized on the yacht had an estimated street value of $61,750,000. Police allege the men travelled to Townsville from Canberra in May to recover the cocaine from the yacht, which arrived in Townsville in April after sailing from Vanuatu. The men, aged 55 and 44, appeared in the ACT magistrates court on Friday before being extradited to Brisbane on Saturday. Both are due to appear in the Brisbane magistrates court on Monday charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug and dealing in the proceeds of crime. The 55-year-old man is also charged with failing to comply with an order made under the Crimes Act. Telfer said the investigation remains ongoing and did not rule out further arrests in the future. Lizzo brings sane and sanitary update to the shoey Performing in Sydney last night, Lizzo has introduced some much-needed sanity/sanitation to the shoey tradition in Australian pop concerts by popping a bottle in her boot. One of her fans captured the moment: The New South Wales government has secured the rights to host this year\u2019s NRL and NRLW grand finals. The NRL had raised the prospect of the showpiece rugby league events leaving New South Wales last year after the NSW government pulled millions of dollars in funding in its local stadium strategy. This year\u2019s arrangement is a one-year deal. Both the NRL and NRLW deciders will be played in a double-header on 1 October at the 82,500-capacity Accor Stadium at Olympic Park. Australian Rugby League Commission chair Peter V\u2019Lanyds said he appreciated the NSW government\u2019s \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach. We have a great partnership with the NSW Government and we are grateful for their support of rugby league. NSW minister for tourism John Graham said the event attracts \u201cthousands of fans from interstate and overseas who also visit Sydney\u2019s many attractions, enjoy shows and arts, eat and drink in our world-class restaurants, supporting jobs in the visitor economy. The NSW government secured a three-year deal for hosting rights to the A-League grand finals last year, prompting backlash from fans in the league. The traditional practice in the A-Leagues had been for the grand final to be hosted by the highest-placed team in the home-and-away season. NRL grand finals have always been held in Sydney, with the exception of the pandemic-affected 2021 season which was decided in Brisbane. Leaders to map out the future of NSW rail manufacturing More than 100 representatives of Australia\u2019s rail manufacturing industry will meet to map out a plan to boost the sector in NSW, AAP reports. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, says the meeting today is \u201ca critical first step on the path to our commitment to build the next generation of trains that replace the Tangaras\u201d. The way to rebuild the NSW rail manufacturing industry in a sustainable way was to work with the federal government on a nationally coordinated approach, he added. The roundtable will include rollingstock manufacturers as well as businesses and unions involved in the rail manufacturing supply chain. It will also involve academics, companies involved in research and development, along with transport and infrastructure department representatives from the commonwealth, NSW and other states. Federal assistant manufacturing minister, Tim Ayres, says Australians want trains and rollingstock built and designed in Australia. He said: After countless bungles under the previous state government, NSW is now heading in the right direction. Changes to casual workers\u2019 rights add \u2018uncertainty in the employment relationship\u2019, says Acci head Circling back to the government\u2019s new rules announced today to make it easier for casuals to convert to full-time work if they choose: Andrew McKellar, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told ABC Radio he believes the move risks adding uncertainty into the workplace relationship: The employment relationship is based fundamentally on the contract that you enter into at the start of that employment relationship. It works for small business, it works for many employees. In fact, given the opportunity to convert from casual employment to permanent employment, we find that in practice, it\u2019s only 1-2% of people that make that choice. \u2026 We\u2019re removing flexibility. We\u2019re adding uncertainty in the employment relationship that will make it harder to employ people. It will be harder to drive productivity at the enterprise level. And the risk there is that we don\u2019t end up with higher real wages at the end of the equation. But the Australian Council of Trade Union secretary, Sally McManus, said the chamber\u2019s concerns are much ado about nothing: I think that they\u2019re just busy jumping up and down saying, \u2018Look at me, look at me! Something terrible is going to happen.\u2019 They keep fishing around for something terrible, and nothing is terrible. It\u2019s all benefits to workers at a time when we really need these benefits. Forecast for Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup matches in Melbourne and Adelaide As we know from the Ashes results, weather can play a big part in a sports match\u2019s results. If you\u2019re interested in the forecast for today\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup contests, the Bureau of Meteorology has you covered: Gary Johns is facing calls to resign from his position in the no campaign in the Indigenous voice referendum after comments were published in which he appeared to suggest blood tests for welfare payments. Johns, who is on the Recognise a Better Way Committee which opposes the voice, is facing scrutiny over comments in his book, published last year, titled The Burden of Culture: How to Dismantle the Aboriginal Industry and Give Hope to its Victims. He says people should read the book to form their own views. It includes a list, \u201c16 Ways to Save Lives and Overcome Aboriginal Colonisation\u201d, which includes abolishing Welcome to Country at events and establishing a new day called \u201cIntermarriage Day\u201d. Johns wrote: It is possible to test Aboriginal lineage. If the current three-part test on Aboriginality is to remain, then, just as Aborigines insist in native title claims, blood will have to be measured for all benefits and jobs. Victorian Labor senator Jana Stewart, a Mutthi Mutthi and Wamba Wamba woman, said in a statement: These are outdated views, from over 100 years ago. These [ \u2026] views were abhorrent then and they\u2019re abhorrent now. They do not reflect 2023 Australia. It\u2019s up to the No campaign to explain whether they think the author\u2019s views are acceptable and if not why does he remain on their campaign committee. Johns and the Recognise a Better Way group have been contacted for comment. But Johns told the Daily Telegraph the criticisms were based on an \u201coutrageous misrepresentation\u201d and people should read the book to form their own views. Labor MP Andrew Charlton tweeted this morning: Both sides have a right to make their case, but Gary John\u2019s views are offensive and have no place in modern Australia. Mr Johns should resign from his leadership position in the No campaign. The NSW state Liberal MP Matt Kean wrote: Both sides have a right to make their arguments with passion. But Mr John\u2019s views are beyond the pale. Mr John\u2019s should step down from the No Campaign today. Victorian government lawyers fail to reach deal on Commonwealth Games compensation Victorian government lawyers negotiating the cost of the state\u2019s shock cancellation of the 2026 Commonwealth Games have flown home without reaching a compensation deal. The officials were in negotiating talks with the Commonwealth Games organisers in London last week. A Victorian government spokesperson today said \u201cnegotiations are continuing in Australia over coming weeks\u201d. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has vowed to get the \u201cbest deal\u201d in negotiations for taxpayers. The value of Australian banknotes in circulation has declined for the first time, according to new stats from the central bank. The RBA\u2019s data shows that the total value of banknotes circulating around the country has dipped to $101bn in June 2023, down from $102bn the same time last year. That means more than a billion dollars worth of physical cash has disappeared from circulation in the last financial year. $8m to boost uni spots for primary school teachers Prospective primary school teachers will get a leg up with a $7.9m boost to get more workers into the sector, AAP reports. The pilot program will create 105 primary school teaching places, the first of the government\u2019s proposed 1,500 under a national teacher workforce plan. The money will go to La Trobe University and target mid-career workers to move towards primary teaching. They will then be placed into primary schools in dire need of teachers across NSW and Victoria. The education minister, Jason Clare, says while primary teachers play a huge role in children\u2019s lives, there aren\u2019t enough to fill the workforce: We don\u2019t remember much about when we are little, but most of us remember our teachers\u2019 names. That shows just how important our teachers are and the impact they have on us. Recruitment will begin later in the year and the teachers will be placed into primary schools in April 2024. Guardian Australia has now obtained the image from the defence department of an Australian air force craft passing a Chinese spy ship. The royal Australian air force P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is seen passing a People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy Dongdiao class auxiliary intelligence ship. Central Queensland is currently hosting the international Talisman Sabre military exercise, in which 13 countries, including the US, Japan and Indonesia, are taking part in the two-week training exercises. Our defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, was the first to report that Chinese intelligence was expected to monitor the Talisman Sabre exercise: \u2018No loss to the employer\u2019 caused by new rights for casuals, Burke says Burke says the new legislation won\u2019t make some employers think twice before taking on a casual and make things more uncertain for casuals: If an employer has hours that are in fact permanent hours, then there\u2019s no loss to the employer in the actual total dollar figure for them. They don\u2019t pay the loading, they pay the leave instead. There\u2019s no actual cost to the economy here. And if for the business, for example, it is a job that isn\u2019t in fact ongoing \u2013 it\u2019s a job where the hours are in fact, not guaranteed, then in those circumstances, it would never satisfy the test anyway. New rights for casual workers to move to full-time are in addition to existing 12 months rule: Burke The employment relations minister, Tony Burke, has given more details about the conditions around the government\u2019s legislation to give casuals new rights to full-time employment. Burke told ABC Radio there are increasingly more people in the casual workforce who are \u201ctrying to support entire households\u201d. He said the new legislation is about giving those people a right to permanency they don\u2019t have at the moment, regardless of what\u2019s in their contract: After the first couple of months, you\u2019d have to get to the point where you\u2019re able to make a realistic assessment that a regular pattern has been put in place. \u2026 The right that we\u2019re looking at is something additional to the 12 months rule that\u2019s already there, where an employer might refuse, where an employee at the moment never gets to raise the issue again. So they have a situation where every six months, an employee who does believe that there is a regular pattern going on \u2013 and if the employee wants to be a permanent \u2013 then they\u2019d be able to apply and get the conversion. Reward offered over teen\u2019s disappearance 20 years ago A $750,000 reward is being offered for information about the disappearance of a NSW teenage girl more than 20 years ago, AAP reports. Eighteen-year-old Rose Howell was last seen at about 6.15pm on 11 April 2003, walking along Perrys Road, Repton, in the direction of her home in Bundagen \u2013 about 25km south of Coffs Harbour. Her mother believed Rose intended to meet friends in Bellingen and it was not unusual for her to spend the night at one of her friends\u2019 homes. NSW police were told Rose was excited about her upcoming birthday party. On 13 April 2003 she was reported missing after she failed to return home and meet her mother for an 11am appointment. Rose is described as being of Caucasian appearance, with an olive complexion, about 160-165cm tall, with hazel eyes and short, dark hair worn in a Mohawk. In 2012, a coronial inquest found that it was likely Howell had died, but the date, place and cause of death were undetermined. Sydneysiders, don\u2019t forget your wet weather gear If you\u2019re in northern Sydney, you\u2019ll be wanting to take your umbrella or raincoat out the door with you this morning. The Bureau of Meteorology says further showers are on the way! SA announces panel to conduct review into non-Aboriginal artists allegedly intervening in Aboriginal art production The South Australian government has announced the expert panel who will undertake an \u201curgent\u201d review into accusations of non-Aboriginal artists intervening in Aboriginal artworks \u2013 although the start date is still unknown. Lawyer Anne Sibree, National Suicide Prevention and Trauma Recover Project director and Menang woman Megan Krakouer, and First Nations Tourism Council interim chair and Quandamoooka man Cameron Costello will investigate allegations that staff at the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Art Centre Collective (APYACC) intervened in First Nations artists\u2019 work. (The Australian is reporting a brouhaha over the makeup of the panel). In a statement, the government said the APYACC had committed to fully cooperating with the review, which would be \u201cundertaken as quickly as possible\u201d. SA arts minister, Andrea Michaels, said APYACC and its artists supported the review. She said: I am confident that Megan Krakouer, Cameron Costello and Anne Sibree have the necessary skills and experience to conduct a culturally safe independent consideration and assessment of the allegations and the operations of APYACC. This review is about ensuring that Aboriginal artists are being respected and that the integrity of their art is being maintained. Tasmania has kept its spot as the best performing state economy amid a slowdown across the nation, AAP reports. CommSec\u2019s State of the States report released today found economic performances were being supported by a solid job market and strong population growth at a time of rising interest rates. But state and territory economies were slowing in response to higher borrowing costs and price pressures. CommSec said: \u201cThe future path of economies will depend on the response of inflation to higher interest rates.\u201d Tasmania improved its ranking on retail spending and ranked first on equipment spending and dwelling starts. NSW remains in second position, ranking first on relative unemployment and coming second or third on four indicators. Third-placed South Australia ranked first on relative population growth. Its 1.58% annual population growth rate was 64.1% above the decade average for the year to the December quarter 2022. Queensland was placed fourth, leading the nation in terms of home loans. Western Australia came in at fifth, but was ahead of all other states and territories on relative economic growth. Its economic activity in the year to March 2023 was 44.1% above its decade-average level of output. Sixth-placed Victoria led the nation on construction work, while the ACT ranked seventh ahead of the Northern Territory. However, the national capital leapt from fourth to first position in terms of retail spending, up 15.3% in the March quarter on its decade-average levels. Annual growth of real retail trade was up 2.7% in the ACT, the strongest of all the states and territories. The popularity of the West Australian Labor government has crashed according to a surprise new poll, AAP reports. The Utting Research poll of 1,000 voters shows a resurgence of support for the Liberal party, which now has a 54% to 46% two-party preferred lead over Labor. The last poll conducted in May, after leader Mark McGowan stepped down and was replaced by Roger Cook as premier, had Labor ahead at 61-39, the West Australian reported on Monday. Labor\u2019s primary vote has also fallen to 32%, from 52% previously. After the 2021 state election, the Liberal and National parties banded together to form opposition, with the Liberals as the junior partner. The Liberals hold two parliamentary seats in the Legislative Assembly while the Nationals hold four. The Utting poll also shows the Nationals are carrying 6% of the primary vote with the Greens on 10% and other parties with 15%. The phone poll was conducted between 18 July and 20 July. No campaign \u2018offers no solutions and no vision\u2019: young Indigenous leaders The youth declaration urged Australians to educate themselves on the change, claiming \u201cthe no campaign offers no solutions and no vision for our young people\u2019s futures, or our families and communities\u201d. Fellow youth dialogue co-chair Allira Davis said young Indigenous people \u201care serious about this\u201d: We are excited that our Uluru Youth Dialogue, as the leading and only youth-led campaign, will be at the forefront of this referendum working alongside the senior leaders of the Uluru Dialogue. Uluru Dialogue\u2019s youth ambassador program issues youth-led declaration of support for voice The Brisbane meeting issued a youth-led declaration of support for the referendum, noting polls showing 83% of Indigenous people and 75% of young people backed the voice. The declaration said: These statistics are important. They paint a picture of a media debate that has shut out young people and their voices. Especially the voices of First Nations young people. It is our future. Young people are crucial to this movement. We stand on the shoulders of our ancestors, carrying forward the spirit and legacies of warriors before us. We bring fresh perspectives and ways of doing things. We have seen some change in our lifetime, but we have also seen the status quo mostly upheld and even steps backwards. We now have an opportunity worth seizing. We ask that our voices be heard; we want to inherit mechanisms that will work, and that means we need change. By having a say on the issues that affect us, we can build our future. Young Indigenous leaders are urging Australians to back the voice to parliament referendum, saying they \u201cwant to inherit mechanisms that will work\u201d into the future, and that the change would help them most. The Uluru Dialogue has launched a new youth ambassador program, sitting under voice architects Megan Davis and Pat Anderson, to advocate for a yes vote in the referendum. Unveiled in Brisbane over the weekend, the Uluru Youth Dialogue says young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the most to gain from the voice, but that they had been \u201cshut out\u201d from the debate so far. Youth dialogue co-chair and Wiradjuri woman Bridget Cama said: This is our future on the line; it is us who will benefit most from a \u2018yes\u2019 result, but we will be greatly impacted if the referendum doesn\u2019t succeed. It\u2019s about our futures and those of our kids and the generations after that. First image emerges of air force encounter with Chinese spy ship The first image has emerged of the Australian air force\u2019s encounter with Chinese spy ship during the international Exercise Talisman Sabre. The ABC\u2019s defence correspondent, Andrew Greene, writes: An aerial photograph showing an RAAF P-8 Poseidon plane flying over a Chinese surveillance ship as it headed towards Australia last week has been obtained by the ABC. The image of the Dongdiao Class Auxiliary General Intelligence (AGI) vessel was taken from on board another Australian military aircraft over international waters in the Coral Sea. On Sunday the Chinese vessel, carrying the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) fleet designation number 793, was believed to be positioned off the Queensland coast, possibly as far south as Shoalwater Bay, trying to collect sensitive information on the international Exercise Talisman Sabre. Thirteen countries, including the US, Japan and Indonesia, are part of the two-week training exercises, which have logistics as a key focus. Our defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, was the first to report that Chinese intelligence was expected to monitor the Talisman Sabre exercise: Purchase of new Hercules aircraft will create \u2018more Australian jobs\u2019: Conroy The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said the aircraft would deal with a \u201cwide range of challenges\u201d. Since 1999, the C-130J Hercules has served Australia across our region and beyond, proving to be a reliable workhorse in roles from humanitarian operations to conflict zones. Having 20 aircraft, up from 12, will mean more opportunities for local industry to sustain the aircraft, creating more Australian jobs. There\u2019ll also be jobs associated with infrastructure redevelopments at RAAF Base Richmond. The government will spend nearly $10bn to buy 20 new Hercules transport planes from the US. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said the new C-130J planes, which are used for transport, search and rescue, and disaster response, would be \u201can important capability\u201d for the air force. From bushfire and flood emergencies across the country, the delivery of crucial supplies to the region during the Covid-19 pandemic and more than two decades supporting peacekeeping operations, this has and will continue to be a crucial asset. The Albanese government is committed to ensuring the ADF is equipped with the capabilities it needs to keep Australians safe, and this targeted expansion of the fleet size will do just that. The 20 new planes will begin arriving from 2027 at a price tag of $9.8bn. The government currently has 12 Hercules planes. ACTU welcomes new rights for casual workers to move to full-time The Australian Council of Trade Unions has welcomed the government\u2019s new legislation to give casuals new rights to full-time employment. Sally McManus, the secretary of ACTU, has told ABC Radio legislation had previously allowed employers \u201cto write whatever they want in a contract\u201d. Even if you\u2019ve got regular hours every single day, week in week out, they can say you\u2019re a casual. Now that is just not right. Objectively, it\u2019s not right. Support organisation workers at risk of burnout amid housing crisis Housing support organisations say they are facing a huge workload, putting their staff at risk of burnout. Everybody\u2019s Home has called on the government to urgently build large numbers of new social housing stock, as well as legislate for better conditions for renters. Azize said: We need more social and affordable housing for people in extreme rental stress. Our shortfall is so big that some people in our survey have been waiting for over a decade. Social housing is the best way to free up cheaper rentals and boost the supply of affordable homes \u2026 Our national, state and territory leaders must work to create a better deal for renters. It\u2019s time to end unfair rent increases and no-cause evictions for good. The federal government has to also phase out unfair tax breaks for investors. Australia\u2019s housing crisis is \u201cpushing ordinary people to the brink\u201d and leaving people feeling hopeless, anxious and scared, warns a new report from advocacy group Everybody\u2019s Home. A survey of 750 people in June found two-thirds in housing stress and a concerning 82% in rental stress, says the report from the housing group. Three-quarters of people are scared about their financial security due to housing issues, and 66% said they had concerns about their mental health and wellbeing. Everybody\u2019s Home spokesperson Maiy Azize called the figures \u201charrowing\u201d. We\u2019ve heard from people worried they will become homeless with their children, renters in extreme hardship, and older women who are considering sleeping in their cars or on the streets because they can\u2019t find an affordable home. Even people who own their own home are worried about what the future holds for their children. Everybody\u2019s Home will launch the report in Canberra today, alongside the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army. And welcome to our Australian live news blog as we begin this new week. The advocacy group Everybody\u2019s Home has called new survey figures \u201charrowing\u201d after they showed two-thirds of Australians were in housing stress and more than four in five were in rental stress. The group will launch the report, which finds Australia\u2019s housing crisis is \u201cpushing ordinary people to the brink\u201d, in Canberra today, alongside the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army. Staying in Canberra, the government is set to spend nearly $10bn to buy 20 new Hercules transport planes from the US. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said the new C-130J planes, which will begin arriving from 2027, would be \u201can important capability\u201d for the air force. The Uluru Dialogue has launched a new youth ambassador program, sitting under voice architects Megan Davis and Pat Anderson, to advocate for a yes vote in the referendum. The program was unveiled over the weekend with young Indigenous leaders saying they \u201cwant to inherit mechanisms that will work\u201d into the future. The assistant minister for health, Ged Kearney, is today launching Australia\u2019s first paediatric palliative care national action plan to drive better access to care for children and young people with life limiting conditions. As you might have already read on our homepage, the government is also making it easier for casuals to convert to full-time work if they choose, in the first taste of Labor\u2019s next stage of industrial relations reforms to be unveiled in coming months.

A motorcyclist, aged 22, died on Saturday night after a collision with an SUV in Epping, New South Wales. Police said the man was treated at the scene but later died at Royal North Shore hospital. An UberEats spokesperson confirmed the rider worked for the company and said the company was deeply saddened by what it described as a \u201ctragic incident\u201d. \u201cWe are in contact with his family and loved ones and are providing our support,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe are committed to the safety of delivery people and have policies and features in place to help enhance their safety on the road. In Australia, Uber Eats delivery people are covered by a support package designed specifically for them, which includes insurance should an accident or injury occur while delivering.\u201d UberEats said it notified the state\u2019s work safety watchdog, Safework, has offered assistance to police and is attempting to expedite the insurance process for the worker\u2019s family. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) said on Monday that such deaths serve as a reminder of what\u2019s at stake for food delivery riders and criticised the lack of any system in Australia to give transport gig workers basic rights, including minimum wage and sick leave. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said urgent reform was needed to ensure the safety of delivery workers. \u201cThese workers deserve so much more. Working no matter what the weather or time to bring us convenience comes with a cost, employers are passing risks on to individuals in the pursuit of corporate profits.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is Australia\u2019s 12th known death of a food delivery rider since 2017. Nine of the dead were riders for UberEats, the ACTU said. \u201cWe urgently need reform to fix this crisis,\u201d McManus said. \u201cNo worker\u2019s life is expendable for convenience.\u201d The Albanese government has proposed significant reforms to the gig economy, planning to set minimum pay and conditions for workers by giving the Fair Work Commission remit to regulate \u201cemployee-like\u201d workers. The business lobby and gig economy companies have mounted a lobbying effort against the proposed changes, arguing they will increase costs and prices for consumers and lead to job losses. The reform push comes as families of deceased riders continue to seek compensation through state-based schemes. In August, the Transport Workers Union launched legal action seeking workers\u2019 compensation for the families of two UberEats delivery riders killed on Sydney roads in 2020. The families received a payment under Uber\u2019s accidental death policy in 2021, but the union at the time said the cases demonstrated why workers\u2019 compensation schemes must be overhauled. In June last year, the family of a Hungry Panda delivery rider Xiaojun Chen received more than $800,000 under the NSW workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Chen was hit by a bus while making deliveries on his motorbike in Sydney in 2020. Chen\u2019s case was thought to be the first where a gig economy worker was considered to be an employee. The harm suffered by delivery riders is thought to be significantly underreported. A 2022 study by researchers at Macquarie University and St Vincent\u2019s hospital found significantly higher rates of injury than previously known. The study examined presentations to one Sydney hospital emergency department between May 2019 and April 2020, and found at least 43 cycling-related injuries among commercial riders. SafeWork NSW had reported 37 pedal cycling injuries associated with commercial delivery across the state during the same period."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e3f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2023/jul/23/spain-election-2023-live-results", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Spain election 2023: full results", "lead": "Voters in Spain on Sunday went to the polls for a snap general election, called by the Socialist prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.

Then in 2008, when the credit crunch happened, I realised no job is stable and nothing is serious, so I might as well give my comedy dream a try! Who inspired you when you were first starting out? The most inspirational comic for me when I first started was Chris Rock, after seeing Bigger and Blacker. After that, I would say that the list is now endless, as I\u2019ve been able to draw inspiration from all over. From Dave Chappelle to Katherine Ryan to David Mills to Sebastian Maniscalco, there\u2019s inspiration to be found anywhere. Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny? A mixed bill at Brunel University. I followed a fashion show, poet, three rappers and was supposed to be one of the last acts before the afterparty. Suffice it to say, the audience was not in the mood for accurate and biting satire and social commentary. One sympathetic woman in the crowd said, \u201cHe\u2019s doing his best,\u201d but that display of solidarity turned every man in the room against me.

Best heckle? I used to have a bit where I would ask the audience what their last meal would be if they were on death row. One audience member replied, \u201cYour dick.\u201d Suffice it to say I had no comeback for that aggressively delivered compliment. What has inspired your upcoming show, Bapsquire? Getting old! Being in the entertainment industry can prolong middle age for performers, but Bapsquire is about accepting the fact I\u2019m ageing and settling into my space in the new post-pandemic comedy and entertainment landscape. It\u2019s been five years since I had a fringe show that I toured, and the world has changed. Bapsquire, yours truly, has had to move with the times and become an older wiser comedian \u2013 and almost a parent! Any bugbears from the world of comedy? I didn\u2019t like the point in comedy about five years ago where good comedy shows were measured by how many harrowing, tearjerking stories they included, when comedy is supposed to be the endeavour of using humour to rationalise traumatic experiences. Also, the failure of most British comedians, despite their keen observational skills, to identify racial and class inequality in the UK. Also, nepotism. If art isn\u2019t meritocratic, then I don\u2019t see the point. Just make your rich kid get a job please! What are you currently excited about? After being the first Black British comedian to receive an Edinburgh award nomination, and the first Black Briton to write a sitcom on the BBC in 20 years, it\u2019s been massively exciting to see how the comedy landscape has had to change and the industry has had to recognise the artistic and commercial viability of Black British acts, as well as working-class acts from the circuit. Comedy will become a democracy, whether the powers that be want it to or not. What\u2019s an important lesson you\u2019ve learned from being a standup? Experience is the best teacher. My message to anybody who is worried about doing standup comedy: you\u2019ll only learn by getting up on that stage. If it doesn\u2019t go well, remember that I once had a whole auditorium tell me to get off stage \u2013 and I\u2019m still here!

The test While some people see perfume almost like a body spray, to fragrance fans like me it is much more than that. And nothing smells quite as good as the original. Case in point, Aldi\u2019s take on the classic Jo Malone Pomegranate Noir candle, that to me, smells completely different. So what can you do if you want to keep the quality of your perfume, but pay a little less? Meet hair perfume. Sales of it are up across leading retailers and it has more than 117.8m views on TikTok. It\u2019s essentially a lighter version of the original scent, created to perfume the hair, but traditionally seen as an extravagance, aimed at those who have everything. The formulations may differ from traditional scents (often hair perfumes contain less drying alcohol and have added nourishing ingredients) but crucially, they\u2019re also way cheaper. I spritzed Byredo\u2019s Bal D\u2019Afrique Hair Perfume (\u00a358 for a 75ml) on one wrist and the original perfume (\u00a3140 for 50ml) on the other. The hair mist was definitely lighter by the end of the day, but it was also the perfect amount of scent for the summer months. Misted into my hair, it meant that I got a waft of scent every time I turned my head. The verdict A huge win. I\u2019d always rather have a smaller amount of the real thing, and this is an excellent way to do it.

A police statement had already done the heavy lifting, with its charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and its stern disapproval of public disorder. That left the golfing establishment to sound cool, calm and \u2013 unusually for them \u2013 like the good guys. They had, after all, triumphed. No one had been inconvenienced in the course of watching their sporting entertainment and that, by and large, has been the focus of anger at Just Stop Oil\u2019s activity this summer. Critics find it frustratingly hard to accuse them of anything else. The protesters haven\u2019t endangered players, or broken equipment; they haven\u2019t altered the course of the sporting action or brought it to an unwanted conclusion. They\u2019ve shown up, made something temporarily orange, then disappeared peacefully in a police van. Take the pitch invasion during the Lord\u2019s Ashes Test, which couldn\u2019t have been more considerate. The protesters timed their incursion for the second over of the match, when it could have no effect on the cricketing narrative at all. The innocuous cornflour in their possession was never going to damage the wicket and was easily dispersed by the ground staff\u2019s leaf-blowers. What a strange, dissociated world we currently inhabit where Europe is literally on fire, fish are suffocating in our oceans, climate change is, in the words of the UN secretary general, \u201cout of control\u201d, yet it\u2019s Jonny Bairstow who is our saviour-hero, for carrying a protester to the boundary rope. The brief interruptions in our scheduled viewing have been too much for the sporting establishment and the politicians to bear, which is why a special meeting was convened at Downing Street this month to discuss jail sentences for those involved. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, promised to be \u201cuncompromisingly tough on the selfish protesters intent on spoiling our world-class sporting occasions\u201d, after spectators on Wimbledon\u2019s court 18 were forced to wait a marathon 10 minutes for the groundsmen to clear up biodegradable confetti, and British hopeful Katie Boulter was shamefully taunted by the sight of a scattered jigsaw puzzle she had no time to complete. It was \u201cvery disappointing,\u201d announced Sally Bolton, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club in a headmistress tone, \u201cthat people came to disrupt the enjoyment of others\u201d. And yet the majority of spectators were far less bothered by a brief, colourful interruption of play on the outer courts than the extended security searches that benighted the queue. It\u2019s good to know that Wimbledon officials are conscientious and detail-oriented, but you do wonder whether they spent half as much time investigating their new headline sponsor\u2019s record on fossil fuel investment as they did searching people\u2019s bags for chalk dust. The outraged reaction to Just Stop Oil\u2019s mild behaviour \u2013 and entirely appropriate sense of panic about the planetary catastrophe we are already experiencing \u2013 says far more about us than it does about the activists themselves. We\u2019re happy to champion the idea of free speech, and we all agree that Something Must Be Done about humanity\u2019s impending collapse. But we\u2019d really like people to do it somewhere else, some other time, somewhere it doesn\u2019t interfere with our chosen escapism. In that respect, the protesters\u2019 messages are the perfect way of calling us all out. Sport vastly inflates its own importance right now. As cover for its commercially driven growth it bangs on about the great global good it provides, and that includes laying claim to a narrative of empowering social change. From suffragettes on race courses to Williams sisters demanding equal pay, from Muhammad Ali\u2019s draft defiance to Colin Kaepernick taking the knee, the industry stitches its history of radicalism into an inspirational montage with a soundtrack of soaring strings. It conveniently forgets that in almost every case, the reaction of the sporting authorities was to disavow, disapprove and decry. Four years ago, a slew of books marked the anniversary of the UK\u2019s 1969-70 sporting protests against apartheid. A 19-year-old Peter Hain was almost universally vilified for his Stop The Seventy Tour campaign, which included mass pitch invasions at rugby matches against South African teams, and vandalising grounds at which their cricketers were due to play. Fifty years on, it\u2019s impossible not to cringe at the morally vacant position taken by the cricket authorities and the inflammatory rhetoric of the written press. Hain was called a communist, an anarchist and a terrorist; he was told that sport and politics don\u2019t mix, that his was the \u201cwrong way\u201d to protest, that his tactics would turn every sports lover in Britain against his cause. In the end, Hain\u2019s interventions triggered political change and turned the tide of public opinion. He has been a respected Parliamentarian for three decades. In half a century\u2019s time, when we look back on a generation tap-dancing at the brink of cataclysm, we\u2019ll no doubt fete the people who put their bodies, theirreputations and their freedom on the line to urge the vital measures their leaders refused to take. Right now, those running sport prefer to condemn them \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d. The very organisations that fill their social-media feeds with sustainability goals and rainbow-coloured icons retreat behind \u201ccommercial reality\u201d when called out on the big stuff, like handing over their biggest properties to oil billionaires who abuse human rights, or basing vast portions of their sponsorship income on deals with the world\u2019s biggest investors in fossil fuels. And yet, many sports administrators have demonstrated just how flexibly minded they can be. Take the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive, Martin Slumbers, who argued last year that LIV Golf, with its oil fortune backing, was \u201centirely driven by money\u201d and not in the sport\u2019s best interests. At this year\u2019s tournament he admitted they could be a future sponsor of the Open. \u201cThe world of sport has changed dramatically in the past 12 months and it is not feasible for the R&amp;A or golf to just ignore what is a societal change on a global basis.\u201d Hopefully he and his sport can be just as quick adapt to the global, societal change of increasing heat deaths and rising sea levels. Otherwise just think how inconvenient those stoppages in play are going to be."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e44", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/24/great-art-surrounds-londoners-if-they-bother-to-notice-it", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Great art surrounds Londoners \u2013 if they bother to notice it | Katy Hessel", "lead": "From kaleidoscopic mosaics to modernist masterpieces, let\u2019s open our eyes to the art hidden in plain sight", "author": "Katy Hessel", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 07:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680615", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d160d5563dcff4888efeb860e6578ad11d7fee84/0_2862_3413_2048/500.jpg", "body": "Last Monday, I was at the National Gallery in London to attend a talk about an exhibition by Paula Rego, which opened last week. Afterwards, I was walking along the museum\u2019s entrance with a historian friend who, pointing to the floor, said \u201chave you seen these?\u201d I looked at my feet, and a kaleidoscopically coloured mosaic pavement emerged, as if silently sprawling beneath hurried gallerygoers. I couldn\u2019t believe that, while I have spent my life going in and out of this museum, I had never thought to look down. The mosaic celebrates learning, culture and everyday life and is divided into three sections: The Labours of Life, The Pleasures of Life and The Modern Virtues. It was completed between 1928 and 1933 (with the third added in 1952) by Boris Anrep, a Russian refugee artist associated with the Bloomsbury group. It features famous names immortalised as mythological figures: Virginia Woolf sits as Clio, muse of history, Greta Garbo poses as Melpomene, muse of tragedy, Winston Churchill acts as \u201cdefiance\u201d; nameless figures are also depicted in scenes evoking an \u201copen mind\u201d, \u201chumour\u201d and \u201cfolly\u201d. Others, more humorously, are dedicated to British culture: \u201cChristmas pudding\u201d, \u201cmud pie\u201d and \u201cconversation\u201d. The fact that I hadn\u2019t noticed these extraordinary mosaics made me think about all the other artworks that hide in plain sight, requiring us to look up or down \u2013 or further. Take the ceiling of the front hall of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. It is home to four painted roundels by artist Angelica Kauffman (one of two female founder members of the institution), in which she immortalises a woman as the four elements of art: invention, composition, design and colour. As an institution that failed to elect another woman as a Royal Academician until more than a century after its founding \u2013 and didn\u2019t admit women into the life drawing room until the 1890s \u2013 these roundels show not only that women of course were capable of being artists, but also the limits in which they had to abide. In \u2018design\u2019 we see a woman studying from a muscular body cast, the Belvedere Torso: her substitute for a male life model. Then there are the artworks we might pass on our morning commute, but go our entire lives without noticing. If you live and work in London, have you ever seen, on the John Lewis flagship store on Oxford Street, a colossal sculpture by Barbara Hepworth? Although Hepworth had a knack for creating works that seem as though they have existed for ever \u2013 that can accentuate the natural environment or enhance the modern architecture around them \u2013 this sculpture dominates the corner of the building. Yet, when I recently passed the sculpture, I didn\u2019t see anyone pay it any attention. However, the buildings that surround us speak volumes, both about the past and what they represent now \u2013 for instance, the building that is now Bafta on Piccadilly, formerly the home of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, whose name is still engraved under its eaves. Below are busts of eight male artists. Looking up the facade of the National Portrait Gallery, I noticed that it bore the busts of nine male artists. It\u2019s interesting to notice how proudly institutions wear these narratives. The exhibition I attended at the National Gallery was Rego\u2019s 1992 mural Crivelli\u2019s Garden, which she completed while an artist-in-residence at the museum (she had initially refused the residency on the grounds that it \u201cis a masculine collection\u201d). The work, which charges female biblical figures with strength, was originally placed in the dining hall rather than the main gallery, which made me wonder whether there is a correlation between the works often hidden from view and artists sidelined by art history. But it also made me think about where our attention is directed. It\u2019s not as though these stories or works never existed, it\u2019s the fact that museums haven\u2019t, for the most part, enabled us to notice them. So what we can do is seek out and direct others to these artworks, artists and stories, so we no longer miss out on what is right in front of us."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e45", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/24/time-for-an-entirely-new-face-or-body-the-chequered-history-of-the-tv-makeover-show", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Time for an entirely new face or body?

Or someone\u2019s mum being trotted out on a British high street for 10 Years Younger (2004), while members of the public guess her \u2013 ostensibly much younger \u2013 age? After which she has her face cut up and sewn back together, or sometimes her fat sucked out, before being swaddled in a tasteful blazer and kitten heels? Makeover shows at their peak, in the 2000s, were famously unhinged, arguably even more so across the Atlantic. The US had Extreme Makeover (2004), whereby \u201cordinary\u201d people underwent invasive surgery, strict exercise regimens and a wardrobe overhaul. On The Swan (2004), Fox\u2019s controversial reality show, two \u201cugly ducklings\u201d were completely physically transformed \u2013 including the use of surgery \u2013 before battling it out for the title of \u201cthe swan\u201d. Some, too, might remember Bridalplasty (2010), in which 12 women fought to win their perfect wedding as well as an entirely new face or body (to be revealed down the aisle. I\u2019m not making this up.) These sorts of shows eventually went out of fashion. In recent years, however, we\u2019ve seen the format make a tentative return \u2013 this time with empowering new branding. Gone are the rampant body-shaming and catty asides about a mum who\u2019s \u201clet herself go\u201d. Instead, shows such as Netflix\u2019s Skin Decision: Before and After (2020) and Queer Eye\u2019s lovely 2018 reboot, and the BBC\u2019s You Are What You Wear (2020) have generally signified a kinder approach to makeovers. This week, we also have Channel 4\u2019s Unique Boutique \u2013 described as a \u201cgroundbreaking series offering fabulous new looks for a wide range of people not served by mainstream fashion\u201d. One episode in, and it\u2019s clear that much has shifted since the humiliations of earlier eras. One woman, Lisa, whose body has changed after cervical cancer treatment, gets her favourite clothes reworked to fit her shape. Emma Jane, whose arthritis means she uses a wheelchair, is presented with new outfits designed with the chair, and her tastes, in mind. With its jazzy soundtrack and peppy colour palette, this is uplifting, fuzzy-hearted daytime television, in which nobody is made to feel like they have fundamentally failed as a human. \u201cI\u2019ve got sparkle,\u201d says Lisa, towards the end, her voice cracking. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d Unique Boutique leads with empathy. But with makeover shows in the past, this hasn\u2019t always been the case. Lhouraii Li, remembers being cast on BBC Three\u2019s Snog Marry Avoid in 2008 \u2013 in which participants were given a \u201cmakeunder\u201dto achieve a more natural look \u2013 and being dressed in minimal, plain clothes that she wouldn\u2019t usually wear. Li absolutely loves makeup. Online, she is now famous for painting her face blue and experimenting with surreal, alien-like looks. So the process was out of her comfort zone. \u201cThe worst part of it was that I specifically told them I don\u2019t show my arms or legs,\u201d she says. \u201cThey dressed me in a room with my eyes closed and I felt the dress. I said, \u2018No, absolutely not, I can\u2019t show my arms or legs.\u2019 But they convinced me they weren\u2019t showing and I didn\u2019t realise [they were] until the reveal \u2026 I\u2019m not sure how they convinced me I was covered when I could feel I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Melissa Howe, 33, also appeared on Snog Marry Avoid in 2009, with her twin sister, Carla Howe. The two are presented as ditzy and looks-obsessed. \u201cI could tell that, with the editing, they were trying to make people look stupid,\u201d remembers Howe. \u201cIn one scene, my dress wasn\u2019t pulled down properly and they were like \u2018leave it like that\u2019 \u2013 it was them trying to make people look silly. I didn\u2019t like my outfit, either. They [dressed] me in grandma-style clothes and pinned my hair into a sleek ponytail. It wasn\u2019t my choice at all.\u201d It wasn\u2019t uncommon for participants to be shoehorned into a show without being privy to the full picture. When Cheyenna Stoll, then 21, from New Jersey agreed to be on Bridalplasty, she says she wasn\u2019t informed about the plastic surgery element when she signed up to the show (its working title, Stoll tells me, was originally House of Brides). By the time she found out that contestants might go under the knife, she just ran with it. \u201cI was like, OK, whatever, I\u2019ll just see what happens as it goes, and then of course I was the first person to win and get plastic surgery, which was super nerve-racking.\u201d Stoll was filmed immediately after a nose job. She is dazed, her face plastered in bandages. \u201cIt was a little weird because you don\u2019t feel well, and then you have cameras in your face and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, people are going to see me in such an unpleasant light,\u201d she says. Still, Stoll doesn\u2019t view the experience as negative. She\u2019s an \u201ceasygoing person\u201d and had no qualms about having plastic surgery. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be for everybody \u2026 if you\u2019re not a very open person, it wouldn\u2019t be a good scene.\u201d Sheila Conlin, a casting director and producer on numerous US makeover shows throughout the years, including The Swan and Skin Decision, remembers how, in the 2000s, the onus was often on achieving the big physical reveal. These days, an inner transformation is pushed front and centre; it\u2019s what audiences care about most. \u201cThe Swan did incorporate inner transformation,\u201d Conlin says. \u201cHowever, back then, with the style of those shows \u2026 we only showed the physical.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by Nicky Hambleton-Jones, who presented 10 Years Younger from 2004 until 2008. She tells me that participants often underwent a huge amount of inner growth, and were \u201camazed by the end result.\u201d But now that aspect is prioritised. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely more of a holistic thread to makeover shows these days; they are much more about wellness and the emotional side of it, rather than, \u2018Come in, do this, do this, do this, and boom! You look amazing, and off you go\u2019.\u201d Shows in the 2000s that involved plastic surgery often appeared violent: women lay on their backs in yellow-lit rooms as surgeons sliced their eyelids or carved into their stomachs. But, Conlin points out, \u201ctechnology has changed completely\u201d in the years since. So, even on recent shows that include cosmetic procedures, such as Skin Decision, everything appears a lot more subtle, less dramatic. \u201cWe have lasers, liposuction has a quicker turnaround, you can have cellulite dissolved \u2026 What happened was, there became more options that involved non-cutting,\u201d says Conlin. Our attitudes towards cosmetic procedures have also shifted massively. Getting a round of Botox or filler might be almost as normal as a manicure now, but it wasn\u2019t always like that. \u201cPeople were horrified that we were doing Botox, never mind plastic surgery, because nobody did that stuff at all \u2026 it created quite a stir,\u201d remembers Hambleton-Jones. \u201cIronically, now it\u2019s quite normalised.\u201d \u201cIt used to be fascinating \u2013 to watch and be almost appalled by what these women were doing,\u201d says Stoll. \u201cBut now people are going to be like, \u2018I had that done last week, what\u2019s the big deal?\u2019\u201d We\u2019ve come a long way since women were regularly lambasted on TV for being frumpy and in dire need of physical transformation. The rise of body positivity and the mainstream rise of feminism has meant that, watching back, these shows are often uncomfortable. Sure, they were entertaining, even funny in their absurdity, and plenty of cast members were pleased with the results, but it\u2019s not necessarily an era anybody wants to repeat. Still, the slate has yet to be wiped clean. Many newer makeover shows \u2013 Unique Boutique in particular \u2013 are in some ways quietly defined by what they are not: they are po-faced as opposed to caustic, compassionate instead of shaming, more focused on inner confidence than conventional beauty standards. Are they as shocking, and therefore as engaging, as makeover shows at their peak? Maybe not. Is that a good thing? Most definitely."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e46", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/24/afternoon-update-no-voice-leader-criticised-over-aboriginality-blood-test-comments-kathryn-campbell-resigns-and-john-farnham-cancer-free", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Afternoon Update: no voice leader criticised over Aboriginality blood test comments; Kathryn Campbell resigns; and John Farnham cancer-free", "lead": "Former Labor minister Gary Johns faces calls to resign for comments he wrote published in a book last year", "author": "Antoun Issa", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 06:43:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680652", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d8ce11b920a080cc2c8d7c7ee9748dcf396c2fb4/0_58_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "Good afternoon.

Kerr did not train on Monday and the Matildas have said they will reassess her condition ahead of next week\u2019s final group stage encounter against Canada. But in a hopeful sign for Matildas fans, Kerr posted photos to Instagram of her working out in the gym at the team\u2019s base camp in Brisbane. With Kerr ruled out of the game on the opening night, Australia struggled to get through Ireland\u2019s defence and needed a Steph Catley penalty to break the deadlock. But, speaking following the training session, Matildas veteran midfielder Katrina Gorry insisted the team would be able to find goals in their captain\u2019s absence. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at it as a blow for the team,\u201d said Gorry. \u201cWe have incredible players all across the park. For us it\u2019s about focusing on the players that we do have, we know Sammy is always next to us, always supporting us. It gives us a bit of fire in our belly to keep going out there, working harder and in the last minutes of the game putting in that extra effort for her.\u201d The Matildas have not provided a further medical update on Kerr since Thursday, when it was revealed that she had suffered a calf injury while warming up for the team\u2019s final pre-match training session ahead of the Ireland clash. \u201cWe\u2019ll need her in the back-end of this tournament,\u201d said Gorry. \u201cShe\u2019s staying on her plan and we\u2019ll stay on ours and we\u2019ll get her there.\u201d Gorry, who is only a handful of caps away from making her 100th appearance for the Matildas, pointed to the breadth of attacking options across the team. Manchester City\u2019s Mary Fowler started against Ireland in Kerr\u2019s place, while Gorry, Caitlin Foord, Charlotte Grant and Alex Chidiac have all supplied goals for the Matildas in recent games. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we\u2019re so dangerous \u2013 you never know where the goals are going to come from, they can come from all across the pitch,\u201d said Gorry. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes us dangerous, it doesn\u2019t matter what players are playing, they\u2019re always going to bring that X-factor. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so hard to stop at the moment.\u201d The 30-year-old, who plays her club football with Vittsj\u00f6 GIK in Sweden, said the Matildas needed to focus on controlling the match against Nigeria. \u201cFor me personally the turn-overs [are an area for improvement] \u2013 too many lost balls,\u201d Gorry said. \u201cI think we just need to stay more composed on the ball, keep more possession, so we don\u2019t have such a big transition game. It\u2019s definitely something we\u2019ll work on leading into the Nigeria game. The more we can control the game, keep possession of the ball, the less second balls we need to pick up and win.\u201d Gorry\u2019s midfield partner Kyra Cooney-Cross was tight lipped on Tuesday about how the team was adapting to Kerr\u2019s absence. \u201cAs a team we\u2019re just focusing on Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cSam is doing her own thing to get back as quick as possible.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e48", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/be-dingo-safe-how-kgari-tourists-can-avoid-being-transformed-into-wongari-snacks", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Be dingo-safe!

It has heard allegations \u2013 which Robert strenuously denies \u2013 that lobbying firm Synergy 360 proposed a structure that would benefit Robert financially. Robert has rejected the allegation \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d and says there is \u201czero evidence\u201d for it. Robert\u2019s associate, John Margerison, was due to face a hearing into procurement at Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency on Friday. On Monday, the committee chair, Julian Hill, said the relevant part of the hearing could no longer go ahead after Margerison\u2019s lawyer told the committee he now lived overseas, had severed all ties with Australia and considers himself outside parliament\u2019s jurisdiction. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The committee was told in June that under the arrangement discussed, 20% of Synergy 360 former executive director Kham Xaysavanh\u2019s shares would be transferred to United Marketing, an entity controlled by Margerison. Xaysavanh\u2019s former personal and business partner, Anthony Daly, alleged it would have been designed \u201cto facilitate the flow of funds through United Marketing and onward to Stuart Robert\u201d. \u201cThe main objective of this arrangement was to secure Stuart Robert\u2019s involvement and support in acquiring federal government contracts,\u201d Daly said in a statement to the committee. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, said in parliament in June that the committee had heard evidence from Margerison that he had told his accountant to direct Synergy 360 profits to a trust to which Robert was a beneficiary. Robert said he had \u201cnever part-owned any company that ever received anything from Synergy 360\u201d. On Monday, Margerison\u2019s lawyer did not say where his client was. Hill said the committee would consider the lawyer\u2019s letter at its next meeting and that Margerison\u2019s whereabouts was \u201ca matter of great mystery\u201d. \u201cThat Mr Margerison\u2019s lawyer now claims he has left and severed all ties with Australia is a somewhat surprising turn of events indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe committee will make findings based on the evidence before it.

The weather forecast It is raining at midnight. Will we have sunny weather in 72 hours? Solution. No! In 72 hours it will be midnight and the sun will have set. (Unless you are reading this from inside the Arctic or Antarctic circles. If you are, please tell us more in the comments below.) 2. Stripy socks Wind socks show wind direction. But why are they usually striped? Solution: In order to show the speed of the wind. When there is no wind, the sock droops down. As the wind increases, the sock becomes horizontal. The number of stripes visible in the part of the sock that is horizontal is an indication of wind speed. Each visible stripe (before the sock droops) is supposed to represent 3 knots. 3. Windy Wendy Wendy cycled 10 miles in 30 minutes with the wind in her back. When she returned against the wind, the trip took 40 minutes. On a windless day, how long would it take her to cycle 10 miles? Solution About 34.3 minutes. There are various ways to solve this. Here\u2019s one way. Ten miles in 30 minutes is 1/3 miles per minute. Ten miles in 40 minutes is 1/4 miles per minute. We can rephrase theses speeds as 8/24 and 6/24 miles a minute. The windless speed must be half way between, since the wind either makes you go faster, or slower, by the same amount. Thus the windless speed is 7/24 miles a minute. Since speed = distance/time, the time = distance/speed, which is 10/7/24 = 240/7 = 34.2857 4. Barometer brainstorm A weather forecaster\u2019s favourite instrument is the barometer, which measures air pressure. According to urban legend, a physics professor once asked his students how to measure the height of a building using a barometer. The obvious answer is to measure pressure at the bottom and the top: the change in pressure can be used to deduce the relative altitudes. But that wasn\u2019t the answer he was looking for. He wanted more inventive solutions. As do I. How might you use a barometer to measure the height of a tall building? I asked you to post your suggestions below the line.

In a statement issued on Monday afternoon, the department said: \u201cDefence can confirm it has accepted Kathryn Campbell\u2019s resignation from the department with effect from Friday 21 July 2023.\u201d The department said it would \u201cnot provide further comment on this matter\u201d. The news comes days after confirmation that Campbell had been suspended without pay from her senior Aukus advisory position following the royal commission report into the robodebt scandal. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told ABC Radio last Thursday that he would not \u201ccomment on individual cases in detail\u201d because of \u201cprocesses in place\u201d. But he said the royal commission was \u201cvery clear about failings\u201d in the former government and the bureaucracy surrounding the rollout of the robodebt scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate that there be a response to that,\u201d Albanese said. Shortly after last year\u2019s election, Campbell was moved out of her then role as head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and into a newly created Aukus-related position in the senior ranks of Defence. Guardian Australia revealed last year that Campbell retained the conditions of employment from her previous role as Dfat secretary, when she had a total annual remuneration package of $889,853. That included a base salary of $767,529 and superannuation of $102,635. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Campbell was suspended without pay, effective Monday 10 July \u2013 three days after the royal commission report was tabled. The decision to resign likely means Campbell will be paid out any unused leave. But a resignation does not necessarily close off potential investigations under the Australian public service code of conduct. Agency procedures typically state that if an employee resigns during the course of such an investigation, an agency head can choose whether or not to continue the process to determine whether a breach of the code has occurred. Further comment was sought from the government. The assistant minister for trade, Tim Ayres, said the government had been careful to follow \u201cproper processes\u201d. Ayres said the government had launched the robodebt royal commission to \u201cmake sure we get to the bottom of what has happened here\u201d. He told ABC TV the robodebt scheme was \u201ca cruel, illegal, unfair process that has demonised some of the most vulnerable Australians and put people in a terrible position\u201d. The royal commission report said Campbell, a former head of the Department of Human Services, had been \u201cresponsible for a department that had established, implemented and maintained an unlawful program\u201d. But Campbell \u201cdid nothing of substance\u201d when exposed to information that brought to light the illegality of income averaging, the report said, and \u201cfailed to act\u201d when presented with opportunities to obtain legal advice. Independent MPs had called on Campbell to consider her future following the robodebt reports findings, while the government came under pressure to act. The royal commission report found Campbell knew of both the intended use of income averaging in the robodebt program and advice from the Department of Social Services that legislative change was needed, but did nothing to change the policy proposal that went to government. It found she did so because she knew Scott Morrison wanted to \u201cpursue the proposal and that the government could not achieve the savings\u201d that were promised without income averaging. Campbell has not responded to media requests for comment after the royal commission report, but at the hearings Campbell defended her handling of the matter and said she had assumed the scheme was lawful despite earlier advice raising serious questions. During questioning at the royal commission, Campbell said: \u201cI have never been in a department that sought to mislead. And I have never been involved in an operation that has sought to mislead the government.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e4d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/24/equity-release-house-sweden-sell-in-uk", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Is equity release the best way to buy a house in Sweden a year before we sell in the UK?", "lead": "We are thinking of \u00a3150,000, some for decorating, as my husband wants to be nearer his family when he retires", "author": "Virginia Wallis", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 06:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680782", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b8068da630e9059f7645143273ef60e83bdb38aa/1533_31_3428_2056/500.jpg", "body": "Q My husband and I are going to move to Sweden when he retires as he wants to be nearer to his family. We own our home outright. We are thinking of taking out equity release for \u00a3150,000 to buy and decorate a property about a year before we move out of and sell our current home. Is this a good idea? Is there a better option of releasing money from the property? Our house is worth approximately \u00a3650,000. PS A I\u2019m not sure that it is a good idea. But that\u2019s because I can\u2019t imagine being able to manage the renovation of a property at long distance, not to mention the cost of insuring an empty property that is miles away. But if you are made of sterner stuff than I am, you may be pleased to hear that, according to Andy Vickery, an equity release expert and mortgage adviser at the independent brokers Money Release, \u201clifetime mortgage interest rates are at an all-time low, so now might be the best time for you to look at equity release\u201d. But it is worth noting that if you want to release just under 24% of the value of your home (which is what \u00a3150,000 represents) the younger of you has to be over 60. If you are under 60 the most you will be able to release is \u00a397,500 (which is 15% of \u00a3650,000). Another factor is the interest rate that you\u2019ll be charged. Vickery says the lowest interest rate is currently 6.2% fixed for life, while the highest is 9.39%. On the plus side, you don\u2019t actually have to pay out the interest as it is added to the amount you initially borrowed. On the minus side, because of the interest added to the original loan, there will be less left over when you come to sell the house. It would be cheaper and simpler to wait until you have sold your UK property to buy your Swedish home. You should also investigate whether you need to get a residency visa now that the UK is no longer part of the EU. As a third-country national (unlike EU, EEA or Swiss citizens) you won\u2019t be able to live, work and own property in Sweden without the necessary visa.

Or at least that\u2019s how I read it: the book, 160 pages long, raw as well as wrought, is narrated by a woman, Megan, who loses a male friend \u2013 the titular Kit \u2013 in circumstances that, as with much else here, you\u2019re invited to infer; told in bittersweet retrospect, it\u2019s a novel of spaces and gaps, of things that didn\u2019t happen or might have happened, or ought to have. Megan and Kit meet in the 90s while living in Glasgow. Their friendship is joyous, intense, platonic-ish \u2013 she\u2019s attached and he\u2019s sleeping with her flatmate, which she finds herself overhearing more keenly than she\u2019d like. After a snapshot of their early 20s \u2013 nights out, plans, ambitions \u2013 we cut to London (\u201clast year\u201d) as they\u2019re catching up in middle age over a curry. But Kit doesn\u2019t look well \u2013 there\u2019s an oblique reference to whether his drugs are working or not \u2013 and he has stalled (we think) on a photography PhD, talking about an ex-girlfriend who aborted a child he wanted. Megan, for her part, is knee-deep in what she calls, not altogether joking, \u201cthe Great Betrayal\u201d, wed with three young children: \u201cMy daughter never sleeps. My marriage is on its knees. I speak in ultimatums. I have become a gaoler of wild things... All deep thought has been replaced with lists.\u201d Much of Kit\u2019s texture comes from the granular rendering of its narrator\u2019s push-pull emotions around motherhood, from lying sleeplessly at night in a bed crowded with unsettled kids, \u201csnatch[ing] angled breaths over all the tangle of hair in my face\u201d, to waking up to \u201ca million notifications... from other mums about the potato person we are supposed to have made, ready for school\u201d. But the book\u2019s crisis comes when the narrator, after a hesitant yes from her husband, brings Kit on their family holiday to the Welsh coast, which ends abruptly after a harmless accident compels them to weigh their duty to Kit against their duty to their children. Addressing Kit throughout, the novel makes no attempt to inhabit his state of mind; these are the narrator\u2019s feelings, not his. More silhouette than character, even a void, Kit sometimes seems to stand in for the lost freedom of the narrator\u2019s youth \u2013 a symbol, somewhat selfishly, of roads not taken. Yet there\u2019s an ethical steadfastness, too, to the novel\u2019s candidly self-centred narration; it feels somehow significant that the only three named characters other than Megan are all monosyllables \u2013 Flo, Mac, Kit \u2013 as if placing strict limits on disclosure in a novel that feels like life poured into art. True, Barker\u2019s poetic sensibility can feel willed; this is the sort of book that sees fit to describe Glasgow as \u201cthis most marcasite city\u201d. But more often the diction hits the bullseye: playful as well as serious, mashing near homophones to layer meaning (\u201cthe messh of existence\u201d, say, which more or less sums up the book\u2019s theme), and a slyly sexual undertow that hints at the range of the narrator\u2019s unvoiced feeling. In this novel \u2013 a fleeting requiem \u2013 the problem of finding the right words ultimately leads to none at all: \u201cwhat\u2019s to be said? / When your blood\u2019s full thrumming / but all you have is A-Z.\u201d \u2022 Kit by Megan Barker is published by Cheerio (\u00a312.99).

Across 26 exhibitions, documentary photographers explore the contrasts between wealth and poverty, abundance and scarcity, and the marginal and the mainstream. Below, photographer and festival artistic director Paolo Woods explains his theme. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very interested in why documentary photography has been so fascinated by poverty, and has so much forgotten wealth, the well-heeled and the rich; and why most of the images of the rich were commercial, celebratory, advertising, or just pure portraiture \u2013 but always made on the terms of the sitters,\u201d he said. A portrait from Karen Knorr\u2019s Belgravia series \u201cSecondly, I think today, with the press melting like snow under the sun, the role of the festival is not only to show good work but to say something. \u201cSo much of what is produced in photography today is focusing on the inner, focusing on the intimate, focusing on what you feel, focusing on the personal at the expense of the political. \u201cPhotography is an incredible instrument for exploring the self, but it can\u2019t only be about the self; it has to address a larger community and the conditions of the world we live in \u2013 what you could call political work. Uzi Lvke, the stage name of Luca Sampieri, an Italian rapper, photographed in Corviale, a residential complex on Rome\u2019s south-western outskirts. The photograph features in Marco Garofalo\u2019s Ultima Chance exhibition. \u201cIf we go back to the old distinction where we divide photography into windows and mirrors, I do feel there are now a lot of mirrors, and the windows all tend to show the same thing. But I also feel there is a lot of work that deserves to be shown that deals with the world we\u2019re in. \u201cIn a year where we saw inflation galloping, and we see statistics about inequality, especially after the pandemic, skyrocketing, I thought we can\u2019t escape this. I want to speak about wealth and poverty. \u201cThis cleavage between more and less is a way you could look at the world. It\u2019s a filter through which you can look at not only issues about the economy and wealth, but other issues too. \u201cIt\u2019s about who we are. And it\u2019s also about, obviously, the wealthy and how they portray themselves, and how we portray them, and how we imagine them. It\u2019s not that the wealthy are underrepresented; they may be overrepresented, but on their terms. Firenze by Massimo Vitali. For Woods, \u2018Vitali is 100% documentary. He tells us something about the world we live in. It\u2019s not photojournalism, it\u2019s just one of the dialects of the language of photography.\u2019 \u201cA poor person doesn\u2019t have a press secretary, a PR person, dogs and barriers and villas with alarms. No poor person decides how they get photographed. \u201cNow when you photograph somebody important, you first speak with somebody in between who tells you what kind of image you can make, who looks at the image to decide how much retouching there is going to be, and who then decides what you can do with it. We\u2019re not even close to journalism; we\u2019re close to hagiography. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about the rich, it\u2019s about how you portray things. We are used to a kind of photography, and we see the kind of images already in our minds before they are taken. A full moon yoga session in Dubai, from Nick Hannes\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights series \u201cI\u2019ve tried to go a bit beyond that cliche and say wealth and poverty, but not only those issues, can be portrayed in different ways. And wealth and poverty can be found in Europe, or Africa, South America, the US or anywhere else. \u201cI\u2019m looking for work that will speak to me from completely new perspectives about the world that surrounds us. It can start from something personal, but become much more general, and speak to many more people. A few years back you would have had a hard time defining that as documentary photography.\u201d Five to see \u2026 Lara, 29, works as a makeup adviser at a cosmetics store in Argentina. Irina Werning\u2019s How to Survive Inflation from a Pro consists of deadpan set pieces making wry comments on Argentina\u2019s decades of double-digit inflation. Makeup adviser and trade union delegate Lara, for example, poses with banknotes representing one month\u2019s salary plus earnings from her freelance modelling jobs. For Woods, \u201cWerning comes at it from an economist\u2019s point of view and tells you what is the system and what lies behind it. She makes photo illustrations that are explanations.\u201d VIP reception with finger food at a Swedish stand at a defence fair in Kielce, Poland, in 2016. Nikita Teryoshin\u2019s Nothing Personal explores the terrain of defence exhibitions and arms fairs, and is installed appropriately and effectively in the bunker-like former armoury of Cortona\u2019s Fortezza del Girifalco. The off guard, anonymised attenders represent a class of merchants whose business is combat. In Woods\u2019s eyes, \u201cNikita is a young photographer who has an entire tradition of photojournalism behind him, but he employs a different language. He approaches it in a different way.\u201d Left: From Larry Fink: the Vanities \u2013 a book focusing on beauty, fame, glamour and wealth by the American Vanity Fair photographer; Right: Oslin\u2019s Graduation Party, June 1977, from Fink\u2019s Social Graces series. Larry Fink\u2019s Class Issues exhibition counterposes two distinct bodies of work. The first, and most familiar, includes photographs of Hollywood parties taken for Vanity Fair. Fink, says Woods, \u201cwas not photographing Warren Beatty, Hillary Clinton, this or that actress, he was photographing very self-important people playing roles\u201d. The other work on show is of the less glamorous lifestyles of his neighbours in Pennsylvania, for whom roleplaying would appear to be an unaffordable luxury. Maria Planas\u2019s Warlike Approaches to Tourism. Maria Planas\u2019s Warlike Approaches to Tourism is an archival and textual exploration of the impact of the leisure industry on major tourist destinations, most notably Mallorca.

Unexpectedly, Planas\u2019s most abundant visual resource is the archive of her photographer grandfather, the individual most responsible for crystallising the iconography of the island as a leisure destination.

The irony is not lost on Woods: \u201cAt the beginning, it was super marginal, yet it embraced the values of extreme wealth,\u201d he said.

I think it scares them,\u201d said Levinson, holding a sign demanding \u201cStop Israeli settler violence\u201d as he marched through New York on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous change going on in the American Jewish community. There are a lot of Jews, especially young people, who are not so quick to automatically and unconditionally support everything that Israel does. People are accepting the fact that it\u2019s OK to be Jewish and criticise Israel.\u201d Levinson, a Jewish New Yorker, began protesting against Israeli government policies during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon. It\u2019s been a long and often lonely road since then as he has sought to get his fellow Americans to pay attention to decades of Israeli occupation, military assaults on the West Bank and Gaza, and the unrelenting expansion of Jewish settlements. Through it all, however, support for Israel in Washington has remained largely undiminished. Nothing much looked to have changed last week as Democrats and Republicans alike feted Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, during his address to Congress. The Democratic leadership distanced itself from a boycott by some progressive representatives and joined the pile-on against Pramila Jayapal, chair of the influential Democratic Progressive Caucus, after she called Israel a \u201cracist state\u201d before rowing back to say she meant that its government is pursuing \u201coutright racist policies\u201d. The Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, made a pointed defense of Israel while congressional Republicans quickly engineered a resolution declaring \u201cIsrael is not a racist or apartheid state\u201d. All but 10 members voted for it. The New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg described the backlash against Jayapal as a \u201chysterical overreaction\u201d from Democrats and Republicans alike \u201cdemonstrating that, no matter how far Israel veers from liberal democratic norms, when it comes to American politics, it\u2019s still protected by a thick lattice of taboos\u201d. But for all that, Levinson was upbeat as he marched last Thursday in support of proposed state legislation to block New York charities from funding illegal Israeli settlements. He said opinions about Israel have been shifting for years as increasing numbers of ordinary Americans, Jewish and not, see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the prism of civil rights. \u201cI hear it from them. They see social media, they\u2019re checking out information coming from the Middle East. They don\u2019t have to rely on the mass media here any more. They\u2019re more sceptical about what they hear from the politicians and mainstream Jewish groups,\u201d he said. Opinion polls suggest Levinson is right. A Gallup survey earlier this year found that for the first time more Democrats were sympathetic to the Palestinians than the Israelis by a margin of 11%, a significant shift from a decade ago. In 2021, a Jewish Electorate Institute poll found that 58% of American Jewish voters support restrictions on US military aid to prevent Israel using it to expand West Bank settlements. One-third agreed that \u201cIsrael\u2019s treatment of Palestinians is similar to racism in the United States\u201d and one-quarter said that \u201cIsrael is an apartheid state\u201d, numbers that shocked some Jewish community leaders. Part of the shift has been driven by social media and the wide circulation of videos such as Israeli assaults on Gaza and the West Bank, the large-scale forced removal of Palestinians from the South Hebron hills, and armed Jewish settlers rampaging through Palestinian towns. In addition, the repudiation by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of a Palestinian state, and far-right members of his latest government openly advocating annexation, have undercut Israel\u2019s longstanding defense that its policies are a response to terrorism. That has given traction to claims by Israeli and foreign human rights groups that Israel has imposed a form of apartheid on the occupied territories. But protesters in New York on 20 July in Manhattan\u2019s Herald Square who were protesting against Israeli settlements had no illusions that evolving public opinion is going to translate into a change in policy in Washington any time soon. Rosalind Petchesky, a retired political science professor at the City University of New York whose family fled anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, was also marching on Thursday. She said that some politicians were uncertain how to respond to the gap between the strong pro-Israel instincts of Washington and the views of some of their constituents. \u201cTheir response to Pramila Jayapal is a sign of weakness in the sense that they feel threatened because they\u2019re exposed. But the mainstream Democratic leaders care about 2024 and get a lot of money from these groups and billionaires that support Israel, and that gives them power. So as long as that\u2019s true, we are fighting an uphill battle. But we are going to win,\u201d she said. One way forward, said Diala Shamas, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights who joined the demonstration, is to focus on aspects of Israeli policies that are hard to defend. American politicians mostly support Israel in the broadest terms, often referring to shared democratic values with the US and speaking up for Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d. But it is harder to justify individual Israeli policies, particularly over the settlements. \u201cIt is, of course, an uphill battle to climb,\u201d said Shamas. \u201cBut we know that the numbers are moving towards consensus around opposition to Israeli settlements. When you actually look at the demands of this campaign, they are the most uncontroversial from a legal standpoint. So those who oppose it have to actually say that they actually think that it\u2019s OK to aid and abet war crimes.\u201d Still, it\u2019s one thing to win support and another to get voters to care enough about an issue that it has political impact. The challenge was clear in Herald Square. As the protesters chanted \u201cWe are winning\u201d, New York shoppers mostly walked by without paying attention. Except for a man who stopped and started explaining to his son who the settlers are."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e51", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jul/24/six-of-the-most-spectacular-paris-metro-stations", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Parisian panache: six of the most spectacular Paris M\u00e9tro stations", "lead": "Grand designs will feature in a major expansion of the Paris M\u00e9tro, but there is plenty of theatricality, beauty and swagger on show at existing stations", "author": "Andrew Martin", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 06:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.680860", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c61fe32fbc70a6f4a5d6d8c31c8afadc1a22eace/0_79_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "One aspect of the Paris M\u00e9tro is minimalism. Most stations are simply white subterranean vaults with no surface building to sully the beauty of the streets. Sometimes, a station entrance is indicated by art nouveau iron flowers of no known genus (except possibly triffid), and these \u2013 the creations of Hector Guimard in the early 1900s \u2013 signify the flamboyance that coexists with the minimalism. The sheer theatricality of some stations reflects a society that accords engineers a high status (the UK has no real equivalent of the elite engineering school \u00c9cole Polytechnique) and encourages them to make bold statements. This kind of swagger is evident in the Eiffel Tower and the Pompidou Centre. It will also be manifest in the huge new stations of the Grand Paris Express scheme which, between now and 2030, will double M\u00e9tro mileage. But here are some fine examples on the existing network. Cit\u00e9, Line 4 There could be no question of building railway bridges in the heart of Paris, so Line 4 had to go under the river, waterproofed in great tanks called caissons. Saint-Michel and Cit\u00e9 stations comprise three caissons: vertical ones at either end for access and a lateral one for the platforms. At Cit\u00e9, the lateral caisson forms a strangely distorted version of the traditional M\u00e9tro vault, illuminated by antique-looking white globes. One of the vertical caissons is spookily disused; the other resembles a great riveted metal bucket, with rusty water dribbling down the sides, and primitive staircases ascending in a crisscrossing Escher-like way towards the ticket hall. There is a lift, but most voyageurs prefer to walk up, shoes and boots clanging, Parisians (many of whom live in flats in tall, old buildings) being accustomed to stair climbing. Nearby Ha Noi 1988 serves Vietnamese food in a flower-decked room with a terrace overlooking the Seine (or at least the tops of the plane trees rising up from its banks). The Pho du Chef is particularly recommended. viet-eat.com Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Line 11 M\u00e9tro panache is exemplified on the Line 11 platforms at Arts et M\u00e9tiers, the most thoroughgoing of the 20 or so themed or \u201ccultural\u201d stations. The vault is clad with panels of riveted copper, with portholes in which models of machines dreamily float. You are in Captain Nemo\u2019s submarine, which has dived deep, if the dim lighting is anything to go by. The design \u2013 surely apprehended by most tourists as some inexplicable mirage \u2013 was created in 1994 to mark the bicentenary of the museum served by the station. Nearby A museum of technology that\u2019s as aesthetic as an art gallery. In the steam engine section, look out for the burnished narrow-gauge tramlines on the wooden floor \u2013 once used for transporting heavy exhibits. arts-et-metiers.net Mirabeau, Line 10 Among the flamboyant features of the M\u00e9tro are its track loops encompassing multiple stations: a means of giving an intensive service to a particular area. One such occurs at the eastern end of Line 10, and it\u2019s at Mirabeau that Line 10 splits for the loop to begin. Here, you can only board trains that are coming off the loop and heading back towards town, but you can also watch trains coming from town and heading on to the loop, and as they do this they climb, because they have just come from under the river. What you see from the single platform is the track immediately in front of you (where a train will eventually arrive to take you off the loop), beyond which is a track on a steep ramp. Trains heading for the loop go roaring up that ramp while paying no attention to the station and, since they are tilted, you can see sparks fizzing about their undersides like fireflies. Nearby Less than 10 minutes from Mirabeau lies rue Jean de la Fontaine, which is lined with swirly art nouveau apartment blocks. Numbers 14, 17, 9, 21 and 60 are by Hector Guimard. His masterpiece (which earned him the metro gig) is number 14, Castel B\u00e9ranger, whose iron front gate is a scribble of whiplash curves. It\u2019s easy to imagine Guimard\u2019s M\u00e9tro triffids oozing out of here to take Paris by storm. Gare d\u2019Austerlitz, Line 5 The theatrical highlight of Line 5 \u2013 and perhaps the entire M\u00e9tro \u2013 is its river crossing between Gare d\u2019Austerlitz on the Left Bank and Quai de la Rap\u00e9e on the Right. The trains come above ground after Saint-Marcel; they then enter, through a skylight, the attic of Gare d\u2019Austerlitz mainline station, where the M\u00e9tro station of that name is located. Trains leave the attic through another skylight, to cross the river on the elegant, single-span Viaduc d\u2019Austerlitz. As they descend towards Quai de la Rap\u00e9e station, they swirl with misplaced exuberance around the Paris morgue, otherwise known as the Institut M\u00e9dico-L\u00e9gal, which does its best to look anonymous on the riverbank. This downhill stretch is known as \u201cthe toboggan\u201d, and after you\u2019ve ridden it once, you might want to return to Gare d\u2019Austerlitz to do it again. Nearby The rambling gardens of Jardin des Plantes (free) and its academically important hothouses (for which admission is charged) have such old-world elegance that it seems a shame visitors are not wearing white linen suits or twirling parasols. jardindesplantesdeparis.fr Bir-Hakeim, Line 6 Line 6 emerges from a tunnel at Passy on the Right Bank for a spectacular run of elevated stations, beginning with the river crossing on Pont de Bir-Hakeim, which commands views of the adjacent Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s worth alighting at Bir-Hakeim station for a look at the bridge you\u2019ve just traversed. The lower deck is a road and walkway; the upper deck, which carries the M\u00e9tro, rests on great stanchions like an avenue of iron trees \u2013 which becomes something more like an enchanted forest at night, when the lanterns hanging from it are lit. Nearby Saucisson and pomme pur\u00e9e is among the food available in Comptoir Principal, at prices below the norm for this part of town. It\u2019s a corner site, and a terrace table at the apex has views of the Eiffel Tower to one side and Line 6 trains rolling over their ornate viaduct to the other. comptoirprincipal.com Gare de Lyon, Line 14 Opened in 1998, Line 14 is the showpiece of the existing network, its stations resembling sets for a science fiction film, and they are big \u2013 future-proofed. Descending the glittery escalator at Gare de Lyon, you see before you a concrete hall of great severity, while to the right, behind a glass screen, is a large \u201ctropical garden\u201d. It\u2019s watered, allegedly, by regular automatic \u201cthunderstorms\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen one of these, but I assume seasoned Line 14 commuters take them in their stride.

But sorting out your own pension provision can be daunting, particularly when you are managing a fluctuating income and running your own business. Almost half \u2013 45% \u2013 of freelance and other self-employed workers are not currently saving into a pension, according to the latest research from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed. But you can typically save from about \u00a350 a month into a personal pension, and it is important to start somewhere. After all, you will need additional income on top of the full new flat-rate state pension, currently \u00a3203.85 a week, or \u00a310,600 a year, which you get if you have made enough national insurance contributions. Becky O\u2019Connor, the director of public affairs at the firm PensionBee, says: \u201cIf you are self-employed, pensions are still worth it. You might not get contributions from your employer but you will still get tax relief on contributions. This is an instant uplift on what you put in.\u201d As a basic-rate taxpayer, tax relief means that it costs \u00a380 to pay \u00a3100 into your pension, while it will cost higher-rate taxpayers \u00a360 to pay \u00a3100 into their pension. Pick your pension type You have several choices. You could choose a personal pension that offers a range of ready-made plans to suit different types of savers. If you pay into a stakeholder pension, your contributions will usually be paid into a default fund. A self-invested personal pension (Sipp) typically gives you greater investment choice, including individual shares and investment trusts, for example. It is up to you to choose the investments you want to hold, and this type of pension is usually more suitable for people who are comfortable making their own investment decisions. Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cIf you have strong investment views, check to see what level of investment choice different providers can offer. If you would prefer to be invested in a ready-made solution, you may want to look at standard personal pensions.\u201d Choose your provider There are plenty of simple personal pensions on offer from a growing number of digital providers. The online pension providers PensionBee and Penfold, for example, are designed for the self-employed, and let you consolidate your old pensions into a single plan if you wish. Other investment providers offering personal pensions include Nutmeg and Wealthify. If you are looking for greater investment choice through a Sipp, the investment platforms AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown and interactive investor enable you to choose from thousands of funds and other investment options. Bear in mind that moving old pensions into your current plan may not be the right move, though, and if you are unsure, seek professional financial advice. Assess your risk Before choosing your personal pension plan, decide on your risk profile. Generally, the sooner you plan to draw an income from your pension, the less risk you should take. For example, Penfold offers four different risk levels for its standard plan, as well as sustainable and Sharia-compliant portfolio options. If you are decades away from retirement, you can afford to take more risk to hopefully generate greater investment growth over time. If you are closer to retirement, you may want to choose a lower-risk pension plan, so that your returns are less affected by stock market movements. Check charges and flexibility Look closely at the charges you will have to pay, as these can eat into your retirement pot over the years. You will usually either pay a percentage charge or a fixed fee. Nutmeg\u2019s charges, for example, range from 0.45% to 0.75% on pots of up to \u00a3100,000, while PensionBee\u2019s range from 0.5% to 0.95%, depending on the plan you choose. There may be other costs, too \u2013 for example, with Nutmeg, there are fund costs (perhaps about 0.2%-0.3%) on top. Also, consider flexibility. O\u2019Connor says: \u201cFind a personal pension provider that allows flexible payments, if this makes more sense for you than regular monthly contributions. This way, if you get paid unpredictably and sometimes in large chunks, you can simply add a proportion of your payments in, as and when you get them.\u201d Consider other options You don\u2019t have to focus solely on pensions when you are saving for retirement. Stocks and shares individual savings accounts (Isas) are another option. You do not receive tax relief on your contributions but there is less red tape around how you access your money. You can invest up to \u00a320,000 in an Isa this tax year. Morrissey says: \u201cMany self-employed people are put off pensions because they cannot access the money within them until at least age 55 (going up to 57 in 2028).\u201d However, she adds that lifetime Isas (Lisas) are another valuable option, as you get a 25% bonus that works in a similar way to basic-rate tax relief on a pension. You can use a lifetime Isa to save for later life (you can withdraw money at age 60) or buy your first home. You must be 18 or over but under 40 to open one, and you can put in up to \u00a34,000 a year until you are 50. The government will add a 25% bonus to your savings, up to a maximum of \u00a31,000 a year. \u201cIf times are tough and you need to access the money you have saved in a Lisa, you can do so subject to a 25% penalty,\u201d Morrissey says. Carry on contributing It can be tough to make ends meet as living costs soar, and difficult to find the spare cash for pension contributions. But pay in however much you can afford, when you can. Stopping contributions completely could have a big impact on your retirement income in years to come, particularly if you don\u2019t restart your payments. Also, don\u2019t be deterred by stock market downturns. Remember that it\u2019s during these times that your money buys more investments, so contributing to your pot during a rocky period may boost your returns in the long run. Ultimately, the amount you end up with in your pension will depend on how much you have paid in over the years, and how your investments have performed, after charges. You can use the MoneyHelper pension calculator to see what income you could end up with based on your monthly pension contributions."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e53", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/24/a-new-start-after-60-i-became-a-powerlifter-at-71-and-have-never-felt-so-good-about-myself", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A new start after 60: \u2018I became a powerlifter at 71 \u2013 and I\u2019ve never felt so good about myself\u2019", "lead": "Peeps Nicol was newly widowed, \u2018really unfit\u2019, and struggling with MS when she first visited her local gym last year.

The woman had been pushing a walking aid and was large. As her husband tried to help her up, Nicol \u201cgot her under the arm, and got her back on her feet. I thought, I\u2019m a powerlifter now. I can do this.\u201d Nicol is 71, and in March she entered her first powerlifting competition. She only joined the gym last year. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m really coming into my own. I\u2019ve never felt this good about myself,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe I was trained that way by my mother and society. I was always slightly to the back of my husband. It was his wishes \u2026 I can\u2019t imagine doing what I am doing now in any of the preceding years.\u201d Nicol has multiple sclerosis and when she was diagnosed in 2005, she and her husband, Brian, a triathlete and former soldier, had a life plan that, \u201cwhen I got really disabled with MS he would look after me, and push me around in the wheelchair. He cooked very well. That would be it.\u201d Back then, \u201cI was shaky from the inside out, and my balance was awful,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember what it felt like to be well.\u201d But, within a few years Brian was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \u201cAs we understood it, you have three to five years from diagnosis.\u201d Brian suggested a move to Spain, and he did well. \u201cBut there was no outrunning IPF,\u201d says Nicol. \u201cIn April 2020, he died in our little sunny apartment near the Med. I promised him I would be all right. He was worried I wasn\u2019t that strong.\u201d She returned to the UK, where she has two daughters from her first marriage, and now lives in a static caravan near the younger one, outside Weston-super-Mare. She didn\u2019t have friends there, but she saw an advertisement on Facebook for the local health centre, with its pool and cafe. \u201cMy membership included the gym induction,\u201d she says. She had no intention of using the gym, but TJ, the trainer who inducted her, reminded her of her younger brother. \u201cI thought: maybe he can do something for me. I\u2019m really unfit. I could do with losing some of the fat tummy you get after a certain age. I\u2019ll give it a try.\u2019\u2019 After a few sessions using resistance machines, Nicol and TJ got talking. \u201cI can\u2019t remember how powerlifting came up. He said: \u2018If you want to learn, I can train you.\u2019\u201d \u201cThere was something about the idea that appealed. The idea of becoming bigger and stronger, and being able to look after myself. I wanted to know how far I could push it. I don\u2019t think nature encourages women over 70 to put on muscle \u2013 or do anything much.\u201d When she first started training, Nicol\u2019s ankles were so stiff she couldn\u2019t squat, even without the bar. Now she can deadlift 55kg. In March, she went to a weightlifters\u2019 gym for her novice competition. Brian had represented Team GB in the triathlon in the 60-64-year-old category and Nicol hopes eventually to enter an International Powerlifting Federation competition in the over-70 category. Has she always been adventurous? \u201cFor me, having two kids was a huge adventure,\u201d she says. \u201cI had none of the \u2018womanly skills\u2019. I didn\u2019t feel cut out to be a mother. Can\u2019t really cook, don\u2019t know how to keep house.\u201d She met her first husband when she was 20, and they married within two months. She became a mother at 22 \u2013 a child herself, really. Later, after she married Brian, he \u201chad always, as they say in the army, done \u2018the recce\u2019. I would go along as his acolyte.\u201d Powerlifting is really the first time Nicol has chosen something for herself. \u201cIt has made an almighty difference to how I feel about myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI can look after myself. When I\u2019m getting to the point where it hurts so much I\u2019m thinking: oh God, make it stop, I\u2019m getting better at thinking: come on! This is where the strength is happening!

The minute I walked into that theatre and saw this bowel being lifted up, I thought, \u201cThis is amazing. I have to do this.\u201d As a breast surgeon, I loved the artistry behind the surgery, and the way you develop such a close relationship with your patients. But I never checked my breasts regularly. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m a breast surgeon \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get breast cancer.\u201d Completely ridiculous. When I had an ultrasound for a lump, I looked at the screen and knew instantly it was a cancer and I needed chemo and a mastectomy. And I had a good idea of my prognosis: I thought I had a 60-70% chance of being alive in 10 years. I was treated at the hospital where I trained; my former colleagues did my operation. Everyone was trying to be very professional, but going into theatre, I could feel the emotion in the room. I wanted to tell my surgeon, \u201cCan you use these sutures? And can you put the drain here? And can you put this dressing on?\u201d She asked me to stop and said: \u201cBe the patient.\u201d I trusted her completely, but giving up control was really hard for me. I didn\u2019t get the impact of having breast cancer before it happened to me. I only knew the basics about the side-effects of chemotherapy, because those were the oncologist\u2019s job. Then suddenly, oh my god: the brain fog, constipation, how the menopausal symptoms can affect your relationship. And the grief for things you\u2019ve lost. My husband and I didn\u2019t have children, and we knew chemo would more than likely make me infertile. I had 18 months off to recover and plan a route back to work. It was really, really hard. The first time I saw someone find out she had cancer, she was young, and I saw her and her husband crumple, and I just thought: \u201cI can\u2019t make this better.\u201d I had flashbacks, thinking this was what my husband and I looked like. The first operation I did brought a sense of relief and pride, but also sorrow for what that woman was going to go through. You\u2019re so desperate to share your own experiences, but it\u2019s not right ethically. I changed my language. I used to say things like, \u201cWe\u2019re lucky we caught it early, and it\u2019s good it hasn\u2019t spread.\u201d But no one\u2019s lucky to get cancer, and no cancer\u2019s good to have. I used to say, \u201cDon\u2019t Google it.\u201d First thing I did? Google, middle of the night, metastatic cancer blogs. We need to recognise that people will go online and signpost them to the best resources. I\u2019m embarrassed that I never looked at a breast cancer forum before I was diagnosed. It would help if doctors took the time to do that, to get an idea of what patients want when they leave your office. And I never listened to patients at conferences because I was too busy networking and hearing about the latest treatments. Everybody should listen to the patient experience. Five months after I returned to work, my cancer came back. That meant having my implant removed, more radiotherapy, having my ovaries out. And it meant I was forced to retire because I could no longer move my left arm, so I couldn\u2019t operate safely. Twenty years of my life had gone and I was in despair. Now, through talking and blogging and doing videos, I have my own way of helping people. But it is hard having to rediscover yourself when it wasn\u2019t your choice. I can\u2019t remember the last operation I did. I got the results of my biopsy the next day and I never went back. I wonder whether, if I had known it was my last operation, I would have done things differently. Would I have been better or worse because the pressure was on? I really, really miss being in that room of people coming together to make a difference to someone\u2019s life. \u2022 Dr Liz O\u2019Riordan is a breast surgeon, author, podcaster and on Instagram @oriordanliz.

The uproar is all about rewilding \u2013 how it cannot, must not, should not apply to gardening. Rewilding gardens is \u201cpuritanical nonsense\u201d, rails Monty Don. Alan Titchmarsh believes gardeners have been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d. He\u2019s just written to the Lords about it. The rewilding craze, he told peers, is an \u201cill-considered trend\u201d loaded with \u201cmisleading propaganda\u201d that will \u201cdeplete our gardens of their botanical riches\u201d and be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for wildlife. What is frustrating about this outburst is that neither have grasped what rewilding a garden actually means. There\u2019s a common misconception that it\u2019s about doing nothing, \u201cletting nature take over\u201d. But turning your back on a garden, as both Don and Titchmarsh clearly understand, is not the way to improve it for wildlife. Thuggish pioneer plants take over and, eventually, colonising trees shade out the light for other plants. Lack of plant diversity leads to lack of insect diversity and abundance of other life. A garden is only complex and species-rich because of the interventions of the gardener. So, the rewilding gardener is not saying, stand back and let it all go. Quite the contrary. It\u2019s only at the wilderness end of the rewilding spectrum \u2013 in vast areas such as Alaska, with fully functioning ecosystems and apex predators \u2013 that human beings can relax and let nature get on with it. Almost all the rest of the land on our planet is already managed, in some way, by humans. In our depleted, fragmented, developed and polluted world, with so many species lost and a million more on the brink of extinction, human beings must intervene, in varying degrees, to restore the natural processes that are the fount of life. At landscape-scale, this might mean reviving dynamic river systems and reintroducing keystone species such as beavers, bison and water buffaloes which, themselves, help re-establish wetlands, soil and vegetation. At smaller scale, such as our 3,500-acre rewilding project at Knepp, in West Sussex, there are obvious constraints. We use old breeds of domesticated cattle, pigs and ponies as proxies for the aurochs, tarpan and wild boar that once roamed here. Their disturbance creates a kaleidoscope of habitats that is rocket fuel for wildlife. In the absence of apex predators, our main intervention is controlling herbivore numbers to levels that maximises habitat for wildlife. At even smaller scale, say, 20 hectares (50 acres) or less, where free-roaming animals are not possible or desirable, scythes, spades, bulldozers, hedge trimmers and chainsaws can mimic their disturbance. By randomising and varying the intensity of these interventions, as happens in the wild, the ecosystem of even the smallest rewilding site can become complex and dynamic. And so, to the garden. At an average size of 190 sq metres, yet more intervention is needed to create the complexity that produces life. So, the rewilding gardener thinks foremost about how nature works, and acts as a keystone species. This affects the whole decision-making and design of a garden. A conventional gardener, for example, might build a pond. Good for wildlife. But it would most likely be uniform in depth, round, steep-sided and edged with rocks or paving. The rewilding gardener would create a pond with open edges and varying depths, and then think like a beaver \u2013 putting dead branches in the water to create habitat for aquatic insects. They might puddle the margins like a water buffalo, creating pockets for aquatic plants and places for newts, frogs and toads to spawn. A miniature ecosystem. Perhaps the greatest insult to nature in a garden is the monoculture lawn. A nature-friendly gardener might cut out the herbicides and pesticides, reduce the mowing, encourage lawn flowers, and allow rougher areas of long grass as cover for wildlife. A rewilder will think again. At Knepp, in a garden redesigned by Tom Stuart-Smith and James Hitchmough, we\u2019ve dumped 400 tonnes of crushed brick and concrete on to a manicured croquet lawn. The rough, 3D surface mimics the humps and hollows found in nature, providing microclimates for different communities of plants on different aspects of the slopes. An ephemeral pond comes and goes with the seasons. We haven\u2019t been purist about natives. We\u2019ve planted 940 species, many from the Mediterranean and southern hemisphere with long flowering seasons that our insects love. They are plants that love poor, dry soils \u2013 that won\u2019t need fertiliser or watering. Our gardens, now, must help us in the battle against the climate crisis. The planet is on fire. Water is catastrophically scarce. The sprinklers, mowers, leaf-blowers, high-carbon gismos, peat compost and chemical inputs pushed on us by garden centres \u2013 the billion-pound horticultural industry that Titchmarsh has been defending to the House of Lords \u2013 is as bad for the planet as industrial farming. It\u2019s always going to be tricky, challenging the established conventions and aesthetics of something as personal as gardening, especially if it\u2019s your profession. But the rewilding approach can be refreshingly liberating. It can relieve a gardener of the burden of perfection and yet still produce a space that is achingly beautiful.

He is trying to go abroad without us for the first time this summer, after finishing his A-levels. But we have hit a brick wall with Eurostar over some medical equipment he needs to take with him. We booked and paid for the train journeys and hotel stays in Amsterdam for him and his carers. They use a hoist and sling to help him on to the toilet and into bed and, as his hotel doesn\u2019t have ceiling track hoists, we have been trying to hire a mobile setup. This has proved extremely difficult. The companies we have dealt with have been inadequate. Also, the sling system they use there is different from the UK\u2019s, which is very risky as AS sits in one for long periods, so it\u2019s vital it is comfortable. None of this, however, would be a problem if Eurostar would permit him to take his own mobile hoist. It is about the size of a large rucksack, weighs 26kg and is on wheels. If we can\u2019t send him with his hoist, he simply can\u2019t go.

A few days ago it seemed a foregone conclusion that a coalition of rightwing parties were going to win Spain\u2019s snap elections. A huge majority was not a guarantee, but most of the polls were in their favour. Election night, however, told a different story. While the centre-right People\u2019s Party (PP) secured the largest number of votes, they have not met the threshold of 176 seats to gain an absolute majority in parliament, even with the support of the far-right Vox party. The two parties won 136 and 33 seats respectively, giving them a grand total of 169 seats. The Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE) of prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on the other hand, outperformed predictions significantly, with 122 seats, two more than they had before. The party\u2019s far-left allies, Sumar, were in fourth place with 31 seats. Last night was supposed to bludgeon the PSOE\u2019s tentative hold on power, instead it showed their impressive capacity to mobilise their base, following their defeat in local elections less than two months ago. Meanwhile the far-right Vox party, who were widely predicted to be the king makers of this election, lost 19 of their 52 seats. To make things more confusing, both sides have claimed that the results are a success, with the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, insisting that he viewed this as a victory for his party. While this may technically be the case, Feij\u00f3o is still unable to form a government, so there is a chance that there will be another election before the end of the year. While the Spanish public wakes up to an inconclusive result, one thing is clear: Spain has \u2013 for now \u2013 bucked the trend of far-right parties making their way into government across Europe. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones, about last night\u2019s results and how Spain got to this highly divided point. That\u2019s right after the headlines.

In depth: \u2018The prospect of the far right playing a big role in governance \u2026 has receded\u2019 The decision by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s prime minister, to call a snap election six months earlier than he needed to was a huge risk that could have backfired. Many predicted that it would. But, on the campaign trial, S\u00e1nchez put the options in front of the Spanish people in very stark terms. He told the public that they had to choose \u201cbetween the forces of progress and the forces of reactionary conservatism\u201d, Sam Jones wrote in his analysis. \u201cThe aim of that gamble was to mobilise left-wing voters massively,\u201d Sam says. And they were able to pull that off. There was a 70% turn out despite the searing temperatures, which is significantly higher than in 2019. But despite this success in galvanising voters, it will be weeks, maybe even months, before there is a conclusive idea on who will run the government. *** What triggered the snap elections? At the end of May, Spain had its regional and municipal elections, in which prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE) suffered significant losses, with the conservative opposition People\u2019s party (PP) taking control of a string of key city halls and regions. After four years in power in which the government has been faced with the Catalan independence push, the effects of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the PSOE were braced for a bad night, but it turned out to be even worse than they had anticipated. The PP took 11 regions up from five, in comparison to the socialists who secured three, having held nine before the elections. The results were troubling for the socialist party but not catastrophic, so S\u00e1nchez\u2019s response surprised many. Living up to his reputation as a risk-taker, the prime minister called a snap general election just after the regional elections. \u201cIt was an entirely pragmatic response from S\u00e1nchez and it was not a bad move because he knew what he was in for over the next six or so months with the mounting criticisms and attacks,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSo he thought, \u2018Let\u2019s bite the bullet and get it over with.\u2019 And he did.\u201d The stakes were high but S\u00e1nchez was hoping that, as with his previous gambles, it would pay off. *** The campaign The PP and Vox homed in on S\u00e1nchez\u2019s political dealings as a way to portray the socialist leader as unreliable and power-hungry. His association with the Basque nationalist party, EH Bildu, a group that had ties to the disbanded separatist terror group Eta, had been at the centre of these tirades. \u201cThe whole business with Eta is still very warm [in Spain] even though it hasn\u2019t been on the scene for a long time,\u201d Sam says. Eta was an armed organisation that for four decades tried to achieve independence for seven regions in northern Spain and south-west France. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s involvement with Bildu, a party that the PSOE has relied on to get policy through Congress, only became more controversial after it was revealed Bildu was fielding 44 convicted members of Eta as candidates, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes. The right-wing parties, PP and Vox, used this to claim that\u201c[S\u00e1nchez] has gotten into bed with the terrorists again\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the constant line of attack from the right and the far right. They say S\u00e1nchez is hypocritical, cynical and is very happy to rely on the votes of \u2018terrorists\u2019, as they call Bildu, despite the fact that [ultimately] they are still a legitimate political party,\u201d Sam says. And then there was the political blunder that dealt a huge blow to S\u00e1nchez\u2019s reputation. Last August the Spanish government passed new legislation known as \u201cOnly Yes Means Yes\u201d on sexual consent. It created a loophole that inadvertently cut jail time for more than 1,000 convicted rapists. S\u00e1nchez was forced to apologise and swiftly pushed through changes. But the political damage was done, with Vox leader Santiago Abascal saying: \u201cAs far as Pedro S\u00e1nchez is concerned, protecting democracy is about getting the votes of rapists, coup-mongers, [the convicted Eta murderer] Txapote and of Mohammed.\u201d However, the chiding and campaigning did not work as well as the PP and Vox had hoped. *** A surprise loss Riding high on the success of the regional and municipal elections, the Vox party seemed as if they were a shoo-in to help form the next Spanish government. They had come a long way from their formation less than 10 years ago. Vox\u2019s breakthrough came in the 2019 elections, running on an anti-immigrant and anti-LGBT ticket, with a heavy focus against the Catalan independence movement. They have also been campaigning to repeal and roll back laws on abortion, gendered violence and euthanasia. Their tactics seemed to be working \u2013 Vox doubled its share of the vote in May. But yesterday\u2019s results show that their influence is waining. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute bloody nose for Vox, no doubt about it,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIt looks like a lot of their voters have gone back to the PP.\u201d He adds: \u201cVox and the PP thought they had the momentum to win this and get very close to the absolute majority of 176 seats, but that just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d The \u201cemphatic victory\u201d expected for the PP simply did not arrive. This election has revealed that the PP could have shackled itself to a slowly sinking ship. \u201cFor now, the prospect of the far right playing a big role in governance for the first time since the return to democracy after Franco\u2019s death has receded,\u201d Sam says. *** What\u2019s next? The PP can now only govern with the support of both Vox and other regional parties. However, Vox\u2019s politics means that many other groups have drawn a red line on going into coalition with them. S\u00e1nchez, on the other hand, has far more options in terms of other parties he can call on for support. \u201cBut that\u2019s going to open up the old can of worms for the PSOE,\u201d Sam says because they will have to call on the Catalan independence parties for support, including Bildu, which will give S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rivals more ammo to portray him and the PSOE as anti-nationalists. He will also need the backing of the hardline Junts party, who do not support S\u00e1nchez and have said that they would \u201ctake advantage of [this] opportunity\u201d, meaning they will likely use this moment to try to bring Catalan independence back on the table. There will be weeks of negotiations to try to secure the number of seats needed, until 17 August when parliament reconvenes. If there is no resolution, there could be another election before the end of the year. The most striking takeaway from this election, however, is that Spain appears to be bucking the Europe-wide trend seen in Germany, Hungary, Italy, France and Finland of far-right parties steadily making gains. \u201cThere was always a kind of assumption, before Vox really broke through, that Spain was immune to it because of the recent memory of the Franco dictatorship, and because it wasn\u2019t a very nationalistic country,\u201d Sam says. And that seemed true until Vox started gaining momentum riding the wave of public anger after the Catalan independence crisis. \u201cIt seems that Spain is coming up to the line \u2013 which many other European countries have stepped over \u2013 and thought [at least for now] \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to do this\u2019,\u201d Sam concludes.

Across the country, retail giants closed their doors and buildings once occupied by independent local businesses stood empty for years. That was the case for Kingland Crescent in Poole town centre, a high street residents avoided and described as \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cdepressing\u201d, until the landlord LGIM (Legal &amp; General Investment Management) Real Assets launched a scheme in 2021 to find local entrepreneurs and offer them space free of rent and business rates for two years. The project has given many people a fresh start; Tim Greenslade (pictured above) has a fishmonger, while Hope Dean opened a house plant emporium after she lost her job in event management during Covid. \u201cI always wanted to work in plants and this was my chance,\u201d she said. LGIM did not just give these business owners a building, they also offered mentoring sessions, legal advice and generous financial offers. And now the two-year rent-free period is over, it has not unsustainably raised prices. The results are telling: there was a 16% increase in footfall on the street compared with pre-Covid levels; average turnover per unit this spring increased by 36%; and the thriving high street has generated an additional \u00a32.2m for the local shopping centre.

The Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (Ibac) investigation, Operation Sandon, was sparked by reports in the Age in late 2018 and allegations that John Woodman \u2013 a multimillionaire planning consultant and developer \u2013 was improperly influencing councillors in the City of Casey in an effort to get projects approved. Woodman has denied wrongdoing. The investigation reached state parliament, with the premier, Daniel Andrews, reportedly grilled in private over his dealings with the developer. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A coroner recently found the wait between the hearings and final report affected the mental health of former Casey mayor Amanda Stapledon, who took her own life in January 2022. Woodman, several Casey councillors, a Labor MP and lobbyists linked to both major parties gave evidence at public hearings, which began in November 2019. In addition to pandemic-related delays, Woodman launched several legal challenges to prevent Ibac from publishing its findings. Here\u2019s what we know about the report. What is the report about? Ibac\u2019s investigation centred largely upon Woodman\u2019s effort to rezone land in Cranbourne West to make it residential, a move that would have increased its value by more than $100m and generated a windfall for him and the landowners. Over the course of public hearings, Ibac heard councillors allegedly received \u201cdonations, gifts and benefits\u201d as they considered the proposal. Ibac\u2019s forensic accountants estimate that two councillors \u2013 Sam Aziz and Geoff Ablett \u2013 allegedly received payments totalling more than $1.2m from Woodman\u2019s consultancy company, Watsons Pty Ltd. The former received close to $900,000 and Ablett more than $330,000. Both men deny wrongdoing. Aziz told the hearings he had invested in Woodman\u2019s company and received monthly cash payments as \u201cinterest\u201d. Ablett said Woodman offered to clear his credit card debt, and that other payments were for work done at Hawthorn Football Club and the upkeep of his horse Good Call, in which the developer had a part-share. Former state Liberal MP Lorraine Wreford, who was hired by Woodman as a lobbyist, told the inquiry that she had delivered bags of cash to one of the councillors. Wreford has denied any wrongdoing, telling the Ibac she thought the cash exchange was a legitimate transaction. According to counsel assisting Ibac, Michael Tovey KC, Woodman also poured $400,000 into political parties during state elections, donating almost $160,000 to Labor and about $60,000 to the Liberals in 2018. Woodman also worked with a Labor lobbyist, Phil Staindl, and donated to the campaigns of then government ministers Luke Donnellan, James Merlino and Martin Pakula, who have all since retired, the inquiry heard. No allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the MPs or Staindl. Woodman denied the donations were used to curry favour, telling the hearings the cash was intended to encourage \u201cgood governance\u201d. Ultimately, the proposed rezoning was rejected by the then planning minister, Richard Wynne in 2020. That year, the council was sacked by the state government and replaced with a panel of administrators, who will lead it until October 2024. How was the premier involved? This remains unclear. According to the Australian newspaper, Andrews was interviewed by Ibac in private over his association with Woodman. They reported the interview focused on their attendance at the same fundraising political functions, and whether the premier\u2019s mobile phone number was given to Woodman. Andrews has refused to comment on the report but maintains he always acted appropriately in his dealings with Woodman and other property developers. In August last year, some correspondence between the premier and Woodman was tabled in parliament at the request of the opposition. Most of the emails related to golf-day fundraisers supporting the Monash children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThe event will predominantly be attended by representatives from the property development industry, and they will be very keen to hear your comments and overview regarding the future of property development in Victoria,\u201d Woodman said in an email to Andrews in late 2016. What is expected to be contained in the report? While Ibac has remained tight-lipped, state and local government figures have told Guardian Australia they are expecting the Ibac to criticise current and former state MPs from both major parties for their involvement with Woodman. The most serious findings, however, are expected to be aimed at City of Casey councillors. It is expected recommendations may include changing the state\u2019s laws to strip councillors of the power to make planning approvals. Earlier this year, the premier, Daniel Andrews, revealed the government was looking at changes to its planning laws but framed them as part of \u201cprofound shake-up\u201d of the system to increase housing supply rather than related to the Sandon investigation. Why has it taken so long for the report to be released? In early 2022, Woodman went to the supreme court to prevent Ibac from tabling its report, arguing he needed more time to respond to a draft version. His lawyers told the court the report was hundreds of pages long and mentioned him 1,450 times. The case was heard in a closed court and the judgment was initially restricted from being published. In December, it was released by justice Tim Ginnane, who ordered Ibac to provide Woodman with some additional documents in order for him to respond. He provided Ibac with his response in January 2023. In May, Woodman made a new attempt for a perpetual injunction to stop the report\u2019s publication. The bid was tossed out of court in June. Another bid to block the report\u2019s release failed on Monday, clearing the way for the report to be released. Why was Ibac\u2019s conduct examined by a coroner? Last month a coroner found the lengthy Ibac investigation adversely affected the mental health of the former Casey mayor, Stapledon, who died in January 2022. Coroner David Ryan criticised Ibac for not informing the 58-year-old they did not intend to bring criminal proceedings against her. \u201cIt is likely that her stress and anxiety would have been appreciably alleviated had she been informed that on the evidence before it, Ibac was not contemplating and did not intend to bring criminal proceedings against her or refer her to any prosecutorial body,\u201d Ryan wrote in his findings. He added that while Ibac sent a letter to Stapledon\u2019s lawyers four days before her death outlining she would not be prosecuted, they did not read it before she died. Following Stapledon\u2019s death, the watchdog has developed a new witness welfare policy. \u2013 with Australian Associated Press \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

John Farnham was diagnosed with throat cancer in August 2022. The now 74-year-old rock legend underwent a 12-hour operation to remove a mouth tumour.

Rather than telling people how to dress, the hosts of this joyous new series invite people not served by the mainstream fashion industry into their boutique and ask them what they want from their clothing. Take Emma-Jane, who is going to an event and is looking for a posh frock that looks fabulous and is easy to wear in a wheelchair. Stylist Victoria, model Triple Minor, body confidence coach Natalie and celebrity stylist David get to work on what they call \u201cdopamine dressing\u201d. The results are tear-jerking, but in the most uplifting way. Hollie Richardson Dreaming Whilst Black 10pm, BBC Three Adjani Salmon created and stars in this six-part comedy, based on the hit 2018 web series of the same name. It follows Kwabena, a twentysomething who is fed up with the daily micro-aggressions he faces in the dreary recruitment office in which he works and dreams of a career in film-making. Each half-hour episode is sharp and funny, but also has a lot to say about what it is to be a Black creative. HR Extraordinary Portraits with Bill Bailey 8.30pm, BBC One You can see the thrill of inspiration in artist Jemisha Maadhavji\u2019s face when she first meets her subject. Grace, an A&amp;E doctor and wheelchair user, is exactly the kind of courageous spirit that Maadhavji loves to paint, and the pairing of these women makes for an especially moving episode of this always emotional show. Ellen E Jones Gregg Wallace: The British Miracle Meat 8.30pm, Channel 4 The presenter investigates a cost-effective \u201cnew lab-grown meat\u201d that has been created in response to the cost of living crisis.

HR The Sixth Commandment 9pm, BBC One The gripping true-crime drama about an ingratiating shapeshifter who targets, exploits and murders vulnerable older people enters its final stretch. Thames Valley police are belatedly getting involved, but with a lack of concrete proof, will the chillingly self-assured Ben (\u00c9anna Hardwicke) stay one step ahead? Concludes on Tuesday. Graeme Virtue Long Lost Family 9pm, ITV1 If you have seen one Long Lost Family, you could be forgiven for thinking you have seen them all, but the emotional reactions are as profound as ever as Nicky Campbell and Davina McCall reunite more relatives. This week has two classic cases of children reluctantly abandoned, leading to half-siblings unaware of each other\u2019s existence. Jack Seale Film choice Till (Chinonye Chukwu, 2022), Prime Video The murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955 in Mississippi was a landmark moment in the history of racist oppression in the US \u2013 and it gets an appropriately furious treatment in Chinonye Chukwu\u2019s fact-based drama. Danielle Deadwyler is passionate and affecting as Emmett\u2019s mother, Mamie, whose fears about her bubbly, confident son leaving the safety of Chicago for the deep south, where racial tensions are more heightened, are tragically realised. The film skilfully shows how her grief and determination to get justice have to be weighed against the wider social impact, not least the political opportunity it offers for the Black civil rights movement. Simon Wardell Erin Brockovich (Steven Soderbergh, 2000), 9pm, Great! Movies Julia Roberts rightly won an Oscar for her role in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 2000 biographical drama. As Erin, a hard-up single mother of three, she has an everywoman empathy and innate intelligence that sees her talk her way into a job with Albert Finney\u2019s Californian law firm. Once there, she takes the lead on a case of industrial pollution by a gas and electric company, which led to health problems for hundreds of people. It\u2019s the little folk v the big corporation, so it is easy to take sides, but there is plenty of wit and the thrill of the chase as Erin outsmarts the suits.

The World Cup is the pinnacle of any playing career. To suffer an injury during the tournament and miss games is just heartbreaking. I feel for Sam Kerr. But then you quickly need to turn your thoughts to the team \u2013 football is always more than any one person. I know that Kerr is always contributing, even off the pitch. I played for the Matildas at three Women\u2019s World Cups. At my first, in 1999, I sustained a knee injury in my first game. Back then, in a tournament situation, we couldn\u2019t necessarily have scans straight away to find out what was wrong. So they just pumped me full of needles, but that didn\u2019t fix it. The feeling is one of utter devastation. In the moment you\u2019re willing to do anything to get out on the park. Looking back I wonder if it was worth it \u2013 but in the moment, you just want to get out there. You put your trust in the staff around you. In 1999 I couldn\u2019t get back on the park \u2013 it finished my tournament, we didn\u2019t win a game and we didn\u2019t progress to the next round. It was devastating. You want to play your best at the World Cup. To feel that you didn\u2019t give yourself a chance to prove your talent, how good you are, the strength of the team \u2013 to come away with that disappointment is horrible. In 2007 it was my last World Cup \u2013 I again picked up an injury in the first game, but was able to return and play in the quarter-final. It was so happy to be able to return, but it was a reminder the team is more than yourself. Alicia Ferguson came in for me, and knowing that there was someone else doing the job was some comfort. When I heard the news on Thursday, I was shocked \u2013 and then frustrated. The Matildas have had the best preparation, which is just what the players deserved. But the injury makes me wonder what training habits could result in the girls being injured in warmup. Are the football gods trying to tell us something? Are they training too much, to have this repetition and impact on their muscles? But there are some positive omens. It was a good sign that when Caitlin Foord and Kerr came off against France, in the warmup match, the Matildas could still score. Winning the first game against Ireland without Kerr will give the Matildas the belief they need. And Kerr is still leading the team. She\u2019s still among the group, giving them the right mindset. Last week\u2019s win also showed the importance of the home-ground advantage. It\u2019s a superpower \u2013 as the New Zealanders found out too. Having that 12th player, the home crowd, cheering the team on is so important; as fans, we need to step into Kerr\u2019s shoes and lift the team. I remember playing in the Matildas\u2019 first Asian Cup, back in 2006. It was overwhelming for us \u2013 we had to qualify for the World Cup through Asia for the first time, against the likes of highly ranked South Korea, China and Japan. We didn\u2019t even play in front of large crowds, but being on home soil still lifted us. We played the best tournament of our lives, and went through to the final (where, unfortunately, I missed a penalty in the shootout). I desperately hope Kerr can return, sooner rather than later. But my advice to her would be not to rush it. When you\u2019re in the moment as a player, when you think this is the most important event of your life, and the nation is counting on you \u2013 you want to do anything to get out there. I remember thinking: \u201cdo whatever it takes, I\u2019ll get out there, chop my leg off if you need to.\u201d I am sure that is what Kerr will be thinking, but I hope she knows that she can take her time. Maybe she should target a return in the knock-out rounds. She\u2019s still playing her part off the field, and is a huge influence. The team has proved they can do it without her. I wouldn\u2019t want her rushing back, even though everyone \u2013 herself included \u2013 would be saying they need her back as soon as possible. Kerr needs to look after her long-term self first. She can have confidence that the team will get through while she recovers. With or without Kerr, I know that the Matildas can get it done at a World Cup on home soil."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e5d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/24/starwatch-the-red-heart-of-the-scorpion-appears-next-to-the-moon", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starwatch: the red heart of the scorpion appears next to the moon", "lead": "As the twilight gives way to night, the waxing gibbous moon and Antares will be shown", "author": "Stuart Clark", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681088", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/424dbdd038701b4a04d16b5ddfb58c333a75d864/310_3_1871_1124/500.jpg", "body": "The silver light of the moon meets the blood red starlight of Antares this week.

Trump!\u201d. For Francis Suarez, mayor of Miami, there were jeers and cries of \u201cTraitor!\u201d And perhaps most tellingly, there was no Florida governor Ron DeSantis at all. The recent Turning Point USA conference brought thousands of young conservatives to Florida and there was no doubting the main attraction: former president Donald Trump, who made a glitzy entrance accompanied by giant stage sparklers. In a less than rigorous poll, 86% of attendees gave Trump as their first choice for president; DeSantis, who polled 19% last year, was down to 4%. Events and numbers like this are cause for sleepless nights among those Republican leaders and donors desperate to believe it would be different this time. The Never Trump forces bet heavily on DeSantis as the coming man and the premise that Trump\u2019s campaign would collapse under the weight of myriad legal problems. But six months away from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, none of it seems to be working. DeSantis\u2019s campaign is flailing and leaving some with buyers\u2019 remorse. Hutchinson and Chris Christie, outspoken Trump critics, are polling in single digits, sowing doubts about voters\u2019 appetite for change. Never Trumpers have reason to fear that his march to the Republican nomination may already be unstoppable. \u201cThey\u2019re experiencing a brutal wake-up call that the party is not interested in hearing critiques of Trump,\u201d said Tim Miller, who was communications director for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThe Trump challengers\u2019 candidacies have been astonishingly poor and learned nothing from 2016. When the leading candidate gets indicted and all of his opponents besides Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson just echo his fake persecution complex talking points, it\u2019s going to be hard to beat him.\u201d The Never Trump movement is almost as old as the celebrity businessman\u2019s hostile takeover of the Republican party. In 2016, 50 senior Republican national security officials from past administrations signed a letter saying they would not vote for him, even though Trump was the nominee. Republicans including Colin Powell, a former secretary of state, openly backed his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, albeit in vain. Hopes that Trump would \u201cgrow\u201d into the presidency were soon dashed. In 2018, the White House whistleblower Miles Taylor wrote an anonymous column in the New York Times under the headline \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\u201d, describing the president as unfit for office. Taylor went on to build a network of former government officials and advisers aiming to deny Trump a second term. Former Republican operatives in groups such as the Lincoln Project and Republican Accountability Project welcomed Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 election and hoped his part in a subsequent insurrection at the US Capitol would finally break the fever. But Senate Republicans squandered a chance to end his political career by failing to convict him in an impeachment trial. Since then certain members of Congress have proved willing to criticise Trump on certain issues and a few, such as Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, are implacably opposed to him. But many others, such as Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, have either retired or been purged. As the 2024 election looms, there is no coordinated plan on how to derail the Trump train or alter the trajectory of a race that is still his to lose. Even critics admit that the external events many were counting on to thwart his candidacy have not hurt his standing. Indeed, criminal indictments in New York and Florida have led some voters who were entertaining an alternative to return to Trump\u2019s fold while handing him another fundraising bonanza. His campaign announced that he raised more than $35m during the second fundraising quarter, nearly double what he raised during the first three months of the year and well ahead of his competitors. Trump\u2019s opponents within the party are running out of time and ideas. Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman, said: \u201cThey were all hoping that Trump\u2019s legal troubles would kick him to the side of the road but every indictment or potential indictment just strengthens him among the base, eats up all the oxygen in the room and makes him the likely nominee. They\u2019re probably as frustrated as can be.\u201d Many Never Trump hopes were pinned on DeSantis but the governor is already cutting staff and experiencing fundraising setbacks. Donors ignored the warnings of longtime political operatives who said DeSantis was \u201cundercooked\u201d, had a glass jaw and lacked the personal warmth and charisma required for retail politics. These appear to be have been borne out by a stagnant campaign in which the more exposure he receives, the less popular he becomes. Walsh, who challenged Trump in the 2020 Republican primary, said: \u201cThey all bet on DeSantis without knowing who the fuck he was, without understanding that he\u2019s really bad and weird with people and also mean and cruel, even more so than Trump. They put all their chips on DeSantis before they knew who he was. That was a mistake because they don\u2019t have an alternative. \u201cThere\u2019s only one lane in this Republican party. That\u2019s the Trumpy lane and DeSantis is in that lane with Trump. His problem is he can\u2019t get past Trump but the base wants somebody like that and so there\u2019s no other alternative. They\u2019re really kind of screwed.\u201d Ominously for DeSantis, the Fox News owner, Rupert Murdoch, who had previously given the governor copious airtime and favourable coverage, has reportedly gone cold on him and resigned himself to the prospect of another Trump nomination. Fox News this week unveiled a lineup of prime-time hosts who have lauded the former president. Republicans are doing little to dispel an air of inevitability around the former president securing the nomination again. When it emerged this week that he faces a third indictment, this time over his attempt to subvert democracy, rivals including DeSantis again parroted his claim that the cases are politically motivated. Kevin McCarthy, speaker of the House of Representatives, where Trump had notched far more endorsements than his rivals, told reporters: \u201cIf you noticed recently, President Trump went up in the polls and was actually surpassing President Biden for re-election. So what do they do now? Weaponize government to go after their number one opponent.\u201d Just as in 2016, Trump is also benefiting from a divided opposition. Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, suggests that Never Trumpers coalesced around DeSantis too soon. \u201cThe strategy shouldn\u2019t have been necessarily backing that horse but sitting out a little bit to see how the field settled, to see if someone would emerge. Then you come in.\u201d Individual ambition has prevented Republicans from uniting around a strategy to stop Trump. Steele observed: \u201cThe party was unwilling in the first instance to have a come to Jesus meeting with all the candidates other than Trump and say, \u2018OK, I get it, y\u2019all want to be president but none of you is going to get there if you all stand so I need one of you to do that duty. So that means the rest of you get behind that one. \u201c\u2018Is it Nikki? [Haley] We\u2019re all behind Nikki. Is it Christie? We\u2019re all behind Christie. But one of you.\u2019 And so that\u2019s the word we send out to the party faithful \u2026 At the end of the day, this game is about winning general elections, not winning primaries and the Republican party is stuck on winning primaries to prove a point. And what\u2019s that point? Oh, we lose general elections.\u201d The election is still more than 470 days away and the race is far from done. During the 2008 election campaign, for example, Hillary Clinton appeared to have a decisive lead for the Democratic nomination over Barack Obama while the eventual Republican nominee, John McCain, did not emerge as the frontrunner until January 2008. In theory, Trump should be vulnerable. He comes with excess personal baggage including legal troubles that appeared to converge this week with fresh momentum. On Tuesday Trump revealed that he had been named as a target in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation of interference in the 2020 election. On the same day Dana Nessel, the attorney general of Michigan, announced criminal charges against 16 people who signed paperwork falsely claiming Trump won the election in that battleground state. Meanwhile Fani Willis, district attorney for Fulton county, Georgia, is preparing to present a case to a grand jury over Trump\u2019s election subversion efforts there. Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: \u201cThere\u2019s still a chance that the steady drip, drip, drip of indictments and other problems will open up a larger portion of the party to an alternative because they see him as increasingly risky, as someone who might well not only be indicted but convicted of a major crime, or more than one, during the presidential campaign. \u201cWill a lot of Republicans quietly come to the conclusion that\u2019s not a risk worth taking? I don\u2019t know. I find it very difficult to understand my own party and impossible to understand the other side.\u201d Christie and other critics have also made the case that Trump is an electoral liability, pointing out that, after his narrow win in 2016, Republicans lost the White House, House and Senate. They did regain the House in last year\u2019s midterms but underperformed expectations. Trump\u2019s campaigns are always risky and haphazard: he recently criticised Iowa\u2019s popular governor, Kim Reynolds, for her seemingly cosy relationship with DeSantis while she purports to be neutral. Several groups that oppose Trump\u2019s candidacy have begun spending big money on efforts to undermine his support. Win It Back Pac, an independent Super Pac with ties to the conservative Club for Growth Action, recently spent $3.6m on an advert that features a purported Trump supporter who has grown tired of the former president\u2019s antics. Americans for Prosperity Action, part of a network founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, has also sought to weaken Trump through door knocking and phone calls. But for now, Trump is still the 800lb gorilla of the Republican party. He is dominating polls, drawing huge crowds and shaping the narratives by which other candidates define themselves. Just as in past recent elections, that leaves Never Trump Republicans with few palatable options except to put country before party. Walsh, the former congressman, said: \u201cIf you really believe Trump is unfit then you have to do what me and Liz Cheney and so many others have done and that\u2019s just say we\u2019re going to throw our support behind the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, even though it goes against our policy interests, because Trump has to be stopped. Clearly he can\u2019t be stopped in the primary so he has to be stopped in the general.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e5f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/liberal-economics-free-social-capitalist-safety-net", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Our generation was told liberal economics would make us free.

Burnt out after the pandemic, and struggling with her physical and mental health, she would really like to take unpaid leave, but she cannot afford to do so. Last month, her landlord hiked up her rent, then served her with an eviction notice when she said she couldn\u2019t afford it. She now has to move for the fourth time in three years, and is back in a flat-hunting market where rents are higher everywhere. She feels trapped, she tells me. Trapped in her job, with her accommodation options diminishing and her time permanently constrained by balancing long work hours with the demands of looking for a home. There is no space for socialising or relaxation, only for a fleeting sleep, from which she wakes up to go back to work, to look at places to live that are almost certainly out of her reach, and to run her numbers again, hoping that an overlooked saving will magically appear. Behind the strikes, inflation numbers and talk of all the difficult decisions politicians have to make are a multitude of trapped people, their choices shrinking. People in bad relationships who cannot leave because rents and mortgages have gone up so being single is no longer viable. People who would like to have a child, or another child, but cannot afford its care, or who would like to return to work after having a child but the sums just don\u2019t work. People in bad jobs with no security or benefits who cannot quit and look for alternatives because they have no savings to buffer rising costs. The end result is a crisis not just of the economy, but of freedom. With that crisis, an entire liberal ambition becomes thwarted. We talk of liberalism in grand abstract terms, as the noble heart of an ideal political order that promotes human rights, the rule of law, civil liberties and freedom from religious dogma and prejudice. We hope for it for others, sometimes taking it upon ourselves to bring it to them at gunpoint, evangelical about this finely calibrated system that manages the relationship between citizens and power, so that it never becomes coercive or abusive. But when economic arrangements themselves become coercive and abusive, then political liberalism can coexist with, and indeed mask, a state of illiberalism and bondage. In the throes of personal challenges, lofty political ideals feel remote and irrelevant. All that people like Jane and others have the time or energy to register is a set of invisible oppressive economic forces that simply must be weathered because they are facts of nature. The result is a sort of ambient autocracy, where personal choices are increasingly dictated by forces that you had no say in creating and have no means of overthrowing. You can hear the language and logic of this economic dictatorship everywhere. Tony Blair tells us that with an ageing population, a climate crisis, higher debt interest and an economic workforce increasingly constrained in its ability to seek services such as housing and healthcare outside the public sector, we should be ready to not wait for the NHS and use private health providers for minor health matters, and that we should ultimately be \u201ctaxing less and spending less\u201d. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves fixate on \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201centerprise\u201d, reneging on plans to put up income tax on higher incomes and refusing to impose a capital gains tax, so those whose income comes from that pot of earnings pay less tax than those whose money is earned from labour. \u201cTough decisions\u201d has become Starmer\u2019s mantra, as if the point is the toughness of the decisions, rather than what those tough decisions will achieve. But, in fairness, it\u2019s an accurate mantra for the state many are in. If things are difficult, tough. Because among those for whom things won\u2019t be tough, enough political, media and economic capital has been generated to sponsor politicians\u2019 austerity, and enable it to be branded as realistic truth telling. This, it strikes me, is not only a political choice, but a reneging on a historical deal, forged in the colossal upheavals of the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and revolution in England, the US and Europe. The trade-off was that we would lose the traditional supports and solaces of rural values and extended families, but become free from their prejudices and patriarchies, and the associated economic and political exploitations of a hierarchical system that was skewed to landowners, rent seekers and those imbued with authority because of where they were born in that hierarchy. Yes, we would be more prosperous, but more crucially we would also be free to choose how to live our lives. \u201cThe only freedom which deserves the name,\u201d wrote John Stuart Mill, \u201cis that of pursuing our own good, in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it.\u201d That good is now increasingly limited to those who can afford it \u2013 who can purchase the liberty to love, leave and leisure, and the right to indulge in creative work and expression. The rest are caught in a halfway house between the old and new worlds. Bereft of the support and proximity of family and community, people are deprived of the social safety net that was supposed to replace it, increasingly having to fork out funds for childcare, subsidising boomeranging single children and elderly parents while paying tax, or fretting about their fates in a cutthroat housing market and a scandalously underfunded care system. Anything that disturbs this tenuous balance cannot be contemplated, so the shackles to partners, employers and imperfect domestic arrangements grow ever tighter. I grew up in the old world and saw only its limitations, chafing against it and impatient for some individual autonomy. My mother had four children, working throughout her childbearing years as a school teacher, only able to go back to work because, with each child, a new family member would move in, or move back in, to help. They joined others who lived with us on and off over the years when they needed housing. My parents were distant but seemed to be broadly content figures, either at work or obscured by a blur of relatives they were constantly entertaining, feeding or cleaning up after in a gaggle of chat, laughter and gossip. The price for that mutual communal facilitation was paid in other ways \u2013 a violating lack of privacy and personal space, and a sense that everyone\u2019s lives, in their most private and intimate detail, were the subject of others\u2019 opinions and policing. It was a \u201cgilded cage\u201d, as it is called in Orientalist literature. In hindsight now, and in adulthood and parenthood, having experienced both in the new world, I can see that gilded cages come in many forms. Political freedoms are precious metal, but when they come with economic restraints, they are a shiny enclosure.

The investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) is examining a complaint by two journalists who asked the body to find out whether police in Northern Ireland and Durham, as well as MI5 and GCHQ, used intrusive surveillance powers against them. The journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, were controversially arrested in 2018 in connection to their work investigating a notorious massacre during the Troubles. A judge subsequently rebuked the police and ruled the arrests were unlawful. Earlier this year, almost four years after filing a complaint with the IPT, Birney and McCaffrey learned that, without their knowledge, the tribunal has been conducting a secret investigation in which it has examined a separate incident in 2013. According to papers seen by the Guardian, the IPT ruled this month it would extend a one-year time limit to investigate and consider the lawfulness of a 2013 authorisation the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) used to collect communications data. The journalists understand the PSNI obtained the authorisation to access McCaffrey\u2019s telephone records after he approached the PSNI\u2019s press office in 2013 with questions for a story he was working on about alleged corruption in the police force. McCaffrey, a senior reporter for investigative website the Detail, described this as a \u201cshocking discovery\u201d to make 10 years later. \u201cI had no idea until very recently that my phone had been compromised in this way,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce again, we find the PSNI treating journalists as the enemy. There appears to be a very worrying culture within the PSNI towards journalists in Northern Ireland, one in which we are seen as criminals to be pursued,\u201d McCaffrey added. Birney and McCaffrey said their case also illustrated the secretive manner in which the IPT operates. The judicial body, which investigates complaints against the intelligence services and public authorities that use investigatory powers, adopts an inquisitorial process, typically behind closed doors, and has unique powers to obtain secret evidence. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve been given the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Birney said. \u201cWe appreciate the work of the IPT in uncovering what they\u2019ve uncovered. But we\u2019re particularly frustrated as we\u2019re completely blinkered in this process. We only get to see a glimpse behind the curtain of what the court is doing.\u201d The IPT is expected to hold a hearing this year into the lawfulness of the 2013 collection of communications data. However, it is unclear whether the IPT has yet formed any conclusions about allegations included in the complaint relating to the 2018 police investigation into Birney and McCaffrey. The journalists filed the complaint after a senior judge in Belfast ruled the 2018 search warrants and arrests were unlawful. They told the IPT it was \u201clikely the search orders executed against [them] were not the only attempt made to identify their confidential sources.\u201d The arrests of Birney and McCaffrey, both experienced investigative reporters, sparked outrage and raised concerns about media freedom in Northern Ireland. Police raided their homes and seized large amounts of journalistic material after their work on No Stone Unturned, a documentary about apparent collusion between the police and suspected murderers in the 1994 Loughinisland massacre, in which six Catholic men were killed by loyalist paramilitaries. Commenting on the IPT case, S\u00e9amus Dooley, the assistant general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said: \u201cWe stand with Barry and Trevor and support their stance that a secret court hearing is entirely inappropriate. The NUJ has always opposed secret investigations, justified on spurious security grounds.\u201d A spokesperson for PSNI declined to comment, citing the continuing legal proceedings."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e61", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2023/jul/24/overwhelming-barbie-movie-promo-and-shrinking-swimsuits-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Overwhelming Barbie movie promo and shrinking swimsuits: Edith Pritchett\u2019s week in Venn diagrams \u2013 cartoon", "lead": "Food for thought \u2026", "author": "Edith Pritchett", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681165", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8d963a56906ad815836d14b7b382fe42f8f54721/188_0_1598_959/500.jpg", "body": ""}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e62", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/24/nhs-trust-accused-of-cover-up-is-refusing-to-release-report-into-deaths", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "NHS trust accused of cover-up is refusing to release report into deaths", "lead": "Ambulance service allegedly kept information about patients that died hidden from coroner", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:00:03", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681183", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5beaa87dd4ef54c4f7a9cc158a2a05a84d348639/0_210_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "An ambulance trust accused of hiding information from a coroner about patients that died is keeping a damning internal report about the deaths secret, the Guardian can reveal. A consultant paramedic implicated in the alleged cover-ups continues to be involved in decisions to keep the report from the public. Earlier this month, North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) apologised to relatives after a review into claims it covered up errors by paramedics and withheld evidence from the local coroner about the deceased patients. But a bereaved family left in the dark about mistakes made before their daughter\u2019s death have rejected the apology. Now, it has emerged that a 2020 internal interim report on the alleged cover-up continues to be kept secret by the trust. The damning report by consultants AuditOne has been leaked to the Guardian after first being exposed by the Sunday Times. But the trust continues to refuse to release it under the Freedom of Information Act (FoI), citing \u201cpersonal identifiable information\u201d as the reason for not making it public. Paul Aitken-Fell, a consultant paramedic blamed in the report for amending information sent to the coroner and removing crucial passages about mistakes by the trust\u2019s paramedics, remains in post. He also holds the gatekeeper role of FoI review officer, and as such has endorsed decisions to refuse to release the report to members of the public who ask for it. Explaining the decision to keep the interim report under wraps after a review in May, Aikten-Fell said the report \u201ccontains person identifiable information that is subject to an exemption\u201d under the FoI Act. He wrote: \u201cWe also believe that disclosure would be likely to prevent future reviews being taking place with an honesty and candour needed to ensure that corrections can be made to improve our services.\u201d In 2019, an internal investigation by the trust into the death of 17-year-old Quinn Milburn-Beadle, who killed herself, established that the first paramedic on the scene failed to perform CPR even though her heart was still beating at the time. But this mistake was hidden from the coroner and Quinn\u2019s family. The leaked AuditOne report on the incident says a passage in the trust\u2019s investigation about electrocardiogram (ECG) activity from Quinn\u2019s heart lasting for 16 seconds was removed by Aitken-Fell. He also changed a passage on procedures not being applied correctly to state that the \u201ccorrect decision\u201d was made. The AuditOne report said the \u201camendments removed a critical fact and changed the conclusions so dramatically that it did not reflect the findings within the report\u201d. Quinn\u2019s father, David Beadle, said: \u201cWe\u2019re surprised, disappointed and angry that he [Aitken-Fell] is still employed by the trust. \u201cWhen he was called as a witness at the second inquest into Quinn\u2019s death, he said it was quite routine to change reports. It is ironic that he is the freedom of information review officer. He\u2019s not going to release documents that implicate him.\u201d After the alleged cover-up was exposed, the coroner accused NEAS of trying to turn information from \u201cblack into white\u201d. The trust\u2019s chief executive, Helen Ray, told Quinn\u2019s family in November 2019 that the trust \u201cnow notify the coroner proactively\u201d. But more allegations of cover-ups of information to the coroner over other deaths subsequently emerged. After this month\u2019s independent review into alleged cover-ups involving four deaths, including Quinn\u2019s, Ray said she was sorry \u201cfor any distress caused to the families\u201d by past mistakes. The review did not reach a conclusion on whether changes to the evidence for the coroner were made deliberately to cover up paramedics\u2019 mistakes. Beadle said: \u201cIt\u2019s too little, too late. Until everything has been investigated fully and there\u2019s no stone left unturned, we feel an apology from the trust just isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d He dismissed this month\u2019s report by Dame Marianne Griffith, the former chief executive of University Hospitals Sussex, as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. He said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually tell us anything new that we didn\u2019t already know. And it feels like the NHS marking its own homework. \u201cWe just want some accountability and, ideally, some heads to roll. Some people whose loved ones have died didn\u2019t know that ambulance service covered any up or hid information from coroners. We want justice and this report hasn\u2019t given us that.\u201d Paul Calvert, the trust\u2019s former coroner\u2019s officer who lost his job after blowing the whistle about the alleged cover-up, said: \u201cThe fact Aitken-Fell is still a clinical practitioner is abhorrent. He seems to have complete impunity afforded to him by those who are meant to keep people safe. The lack of accountability is nothing short of a disgrace. \u201cThe fact that the NEAS have facilitated his role as information review officer, given his involvement in the scandal, is further evidence of the trust\u2019s corruption and blatant disregard for patient safety and duty of candour.\u201d A spokesperson for the trust said: \u201cIt would not be appropriate for us to comment on an individual\u2019s employment, however, the independent review included all the relevant information from the AuditOne report and we have acted upon all the resulting recommendations.\u201d They added: \u201cThe final report from AuditOne in June 2020, which includes their findings and recommendations, has been published under FoI. All the relevant information was also included in the independent review. The draft version of the AuditOne report from March 2020 contains personal information and information protected by legal privilege, which are exempted under FoI.\u201d Aitken-Fell has been approached for comment.

Writing in the Guardian, Anneliese Dodds accused the Conservative party of seeking to stoke \u201cculture wars\u201d by pinning its hopes for electoral success on \u201cdemonising vulnerable LGBT+ people\u201d. She set out Labour\u2019s commitment to trans people and women in the aftermath of the party\u2019s national policy forum in Nottingham, which saw delegates back a platform to be put before activists and members at the autumn conference in October. Dodds accused Lee Anderson, the Conservatives\u2019 deputy chair, of trying to \u201cstoke division\u201d when he suggested in an interview prior to his appointment that the Tories should focus on \u201ca mix of culture wars and trans debate\u201d to hold on to power. \u201cChanging gender is not a decision anyone makes lightly,\u201d wrote Dodds. \u201cThe process is intrusive, outdated and humiliating. So we will modernise, simplify and reform the gender recognition law to a new process. We will remove invasive bureaucracy and simplify the process.\u201d The Gender Recognition Act was passed by Labour in 2004 but Dodds said that \u201cnow, in 2023, we have a much better understanding of the barriers trans people face\u201d. She pointed to the legislation passed by Tony Blair\u2019s government, and the 2010 Equality Act under Gordon Brown, as among Labour\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements\u201d. Dodds accused the Scottish National party of a \u201ccavalier approach\u201d to reforming gender recognition laws, following the Scottish government\u2019s drive to support a system of self-identification that was endorsed by Holyrood but blocked by the UK government. The move \u201cseemed to be more about picking a fight with Westminster than bringing about meaningful change\u201d, claimed Dodds, adding: \u201cThe safeguards that were proposed to protect women and girls from predators who might abuse the system were simply not up to scratch.\u201d Labour would not make the same mistakes, she vowed. Dodds wrote: \u201cThe requirement to obtain a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria remains an important part of accessing a gender recognition certificate. That\u2019s especially the case now that gender dysphoria is no longer classified \u2013 and stigmatised \u2013 as a psychiatric disorder.\u201d She said that requiring a diagnosis \u201cupholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system\u201d. Dodds said the current process meant that \u201ca panel of anonymous doctors\u201d got to decide something of momentous significance, \u201cbased on reams of intrusive medical paperwork and evidence of any surgery\u201d. She added: \u201cThis is demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice. A diagnosis provided by one doctor, with a registrar instead of a panel, should be enough.\u201d In a nod to the different views among some in Labour on the topic of gender and sex, Dodds said: \u201cWe need to recognise that sex and gender are different \u2013 as the Equality Act does. We will make sure that nothing in our modernised gender recognition process would override the single-sex exemptions in the Equality Act. \u201cPut simply, this means that there will always be places where it is reasonable for biological women only to have access. Labour will defend those spaces, providing legal clarity for the providers of single-sex services.\u201d Dodds acknowledged there was unlikely to be universal support for the move, suggesting \u201cthese policies will not please everyone\u201d \u2013 and attacked by those acting both \u201cin good faith and bad\u201d. She added: \u201cResponsible politics is not about doing what is easy, it\u2019s about doing what is right \u2026 Everyone deserves to be accepted, without exception and treated with respect and dignity in society.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e64", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/24/mps-launch-inquiry-into-prosecution-of-norton-motorcycles-pension", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs launch inquiry into prosecution of Norton Motorcycles pension fraud", "lead": "Regulators to be asked about how \u00a310m scam was investigated, as Guardian Today in Focus podcast raises fresh questions about case", "author": "Simon Goodley", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681219", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/684f7b905f9553f64a9791ab9953dee7a8befdec/0_73_1526_915/500.jpg", "body": "Financial regulators are to be summoned to parliament to explain how they prosecuted the case of a multimillion-pound pensions fraud whose victims have yet to receive compensation and which has not led to anyone serving prison time. Sir Stephen Timms MP, the chair of the work and pensions committee, said he was launching an inquiry into how watchdogs and prosecutors handled the case, in which \u00a310m of pension savings disappeared after being invested in the heritage brand Norton Motorcycles. Timms said: \u201cI very much sympathise with the frustration of the victims of this case that justice does not appear to have been done.\u201d The parliamentary inquiry follows years of reporting on the scandal by the Guardian, which exposed how senior government ministers feted a businessman called Stuart Garner, who acquired Norton with \u00a31m borrowed directly from a pension fraud, received a further \u00a310m that was raised via a pension liberation scam a decade ago and then illegally invested that money into his own business. During that period Garner received a series of publicly funded grants along with tributes from the likes of the then chancellor George Osborne. He also managed to use Norton\u2019s brand to secure himself a cameo role in the 2015 Bond film Spectre and travelled with a government trade mission to China on Theresa May\u2019s jet when she was prime minister. Garner received an eight-month suspended prison sentence last year, with the judge saying the former gamekeeper would probably have been locked up if the Pensions Regulator, which was prosecuting the case, had alleged dishonesty. In sentencing, Judge Shant QC said: \u201cHad this offence been put on the basis of dishonesty, or one where it was said that you had gained personally significant amounts of money, the court would have no choice but to send you to immediate custody.\u201d Garner has always claimed he was also a victim of fraudsters. Timms\u2019s intervention comes as a special investigation by the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast reveals a string of events in Garner\u2019s career that raise questions over if he was really as clueless as he has claimed. The new findings include allegations he: \u2022 forged the signatures of business partners in order to allow him to more easily raise Norton funds; \u2022 tapped sources of public money after making seemingly inaccurate claims to government bodies; \u2022 oversaw a business where motorbikes returned to Norton for servicing were stripped of parts \u2013 which were then used to build bikes needed for new orders; \u2022 owned a fireworks business where about \u00a31m of assets appear to have been transferred just prior to the company being placed into administration. The latest allegations come on top of Norton pension holders complaining for years that the businessman had repeatedly ignored their requests to return their retirement savings. It also follows a 2020 Guardian and ITV News investigation that showed how more than 200 \u201cordinary working people\u201d had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares. The Norton pension holders \u2013 hardly any of whom actually worked for the company \u2013 had been persuaded to switch from established pension schemes holding retirement savings built up over their working lives. Their money was then transferred to the new Norton scheme, so that it could be invested for \u201cthe long term\u201d in the motorcycle company. In total, savers transferred about \u00a310m during 2012 and 2013. However, fresh evidence seen by the Guardian suggests that much of that money was immediately spent by the company simply to keep Norton running. Between August 2012 and May 2013 \u2013 the period when pension money began coming into Norton \u2013 company bank statements show about \u00a35m in pension cash going straight into the motorcycle firm, accounting for 66% of all the cash that went into the business at that time. Of those cash receipts, the bank statements appear to show \u00a32.3m went to the company behind the original pensions liberation scam that raised the \u00a310m investment for Norton. More than \u00a3300,000 was transferred to a business called \u201calfa cash\u201d, which appears to be a cryptocurrency-trading website. A further \u00a312,000 in cash was withdrawn from ATMs during this period while there were payments to Manchester United\u2019s ticket office. In that same financial year, Garner also took a \u00a340,000 loan out of Norton. The motorcycle company slumped into administration in January 2020, leaving the pension fund holders \u2013 who had initially invested the \u00a310m \u2013 owed about \u00a314m at that point. In June 2020, Garner was ordered to pay the money back after the Pensions Ombudsman \u2013 which is separate from the Pensions Regulator \u2013 ruled he acted \u201cdishonestly\u201d. The investments into Norton were later found to have breached technical pensions laws preventing more than 5% of an occupational scheme\u2019s value from being invested into assets connected to the employer\u2019s company. Three counts of that offence resulted in Garner\u2019s suspended prison sentence last year. The Fraud Compensation Fund has now said that victims will be eligible to apply to it. However, the fund will compensate only for what was put into the Norton pension schemes at the time \u2013 so well short of what Garner had promised they would be worth now. It is estimated that victims will receive roughly half what they thought they were owed. Secondly, the scheme cannot pay out until all avenues to claw back funds for the creditors have been exhausted. Norton was acquired out of administration in April 2020 and has since begun marketing new bikes as a separate business from the business owned by Garner. Timms said his committee would also be examining if payments to victims of this \u201cappalling saga\u201d could be speeded up, saying compensation via the fund was \u201ctaking an extraordinarily long time. It is very striking that scheme members feel they are the last people to be taken account of as this process unfolds.\u201d He added: \u201cOur inquiry will look at the lessons that can be learned from this experience to ensure the right regulatory arrangements are in place both to protect pension rights better and ensure compensation is paid promptly when things go wrong.\u201d The Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe successfully prosecuted Stuart Garner for three serious pension-related criminal offences.

Businesses founded exclusively by women were revealed to have received just 2% of all venture capital funding in 2022, while even less investment went to companies led by black or other minority ethnic executives. Parliament\u2019s Treasury committee is now urging the sector to implement rapid change, and is calling on the government to play its part. Venture capital is a kind of financing provided by investors to start-ups or emerging companies, which are seen as having potential for high growth. The investment is usually offered in exchange for a share of the business but can be risky for investors. The venture capital sector receives support from government through tax reliefs, which are aimed at encouraging investment in the UK. The cross-party Treasury committee of MPs has criticised the unfair allocation of funding revealed by the diversity statistics and is calling on the industry and government to urgently improve the figures as well as transparency. Data also showed that the overwhelming majority (80%) of venture capital investment flows to the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d of London, Oxford and Cambridge, a situation the committee called \u201cunacceptably concentrated\u201d. Nearly half of all venture capital funding goes to small businesses based in the capital, despite it only being home to under a fifth (19%) of such firms. The committee said it can take companies based elsewhere in the UK longer to become established, and called on the government to extend tax reliefs which are currently limited to companies that are less under seven or 10 years old, saying this holds back economic growth and innovation. The committee complained that it had still not received information from the Treasury on when venture capital tax reliefs with expiry dates would be extended. Harriett Baldwin, chair of the committee, said the statistics showing that most venture capital finance failed to reach female and ethnic minority-led businesses demonstrated a \u201cshocking dereliction of duty given the level of government support for the industry through tax reliefs\u201d. She added: \u201cFirms must be compelled to reveal their diversity data when applying to these tax reliefs in an effort to increase transparency and drive change. Government incentives could also be tweaked to encourage more regional venture capital investment.\u201d The committee, which in recent days said it would renew an inquiry into sexism and misogyny in the City after a spate of sexual harassment allegations in the world of business, said it would be keeping a close eye on developments. The MPs also have urged the Treasury to make collecting and publishing the diversity statistics of venture capital firms and their investments a requirement for eligibility."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e66", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/24/texas-tony-gonzales-us-mexico-border-not-acceptable", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Not acceptable\u2019: Texas lawmaker speaks on reports of inhumane border tactics ", "lead": "Tony Gonzales said governor Greg Abbott is \u2018doing everything he can\u2019 at the US-Mexico border despite justice department backlash", "author": "Maya Yang", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681258", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b0c8a920ef2768ea224a5523f897e73aa20f685f/0_267_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "A Texas Republican representative, Tony Gonzales, has called the current tactics used to deter migrants at the US-Mexico border \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and urged the Biden administration and Congress to focus more heavily on legal immigration. In an interview with CBS\u2019s Face The Nation on Sunday, Gonzales, whose 23rd district in Texas includes 800 miles of the US-Mexico border, said that the border crisis \u201chas been anything but humane\u201d and called recent reports of Texas troopers allegedly pushing small children and nursing babies back into the Rio Grande \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable and it hasn\u2019t been acceptable for two years \u2026 Everything that is happening along the border is just adding fuel to the fire,\u201d Gonzales said. He went on to say that Texas\u2019s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, who has come under fire from human rights groups over his controversial Operation Lone Star border security program, \u201cis doing everything he can to secure the border\u201d. Gonzales also addressed the floating barrier of buoys which the state recently implemented in the middle of the Rio Grande. \u201cI don\u2019t think the buoys are the problem,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEvery single week, we\u2019ve seen people drown. Last year, there were hundreds of migrants that were drowning. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s getting some attention. [I\u2019d] much rather see the attention get focused on something else. The reality is the buoy is only a very small little portion of the river.\u201d The 1,000ft buoy barrier, an attempt to deter people from crossing the Rio Grande into the US, has stirred backlash from various critics including activists, lawmakers and the US Justice Department. The barrier deployment in early July came just days after four asylum seekers, including an infant, drowned in the river while attempting to cross. In a letter to Abbott earlier this week, the justice department threatened to sue Texas if it does not remove the buoys, saying that the state\u2019s \u201cactions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government\u2019s ability to carry out its official duties\u201d. In response, Abbott tweeted, \u201cWe will see you in court, Mr President.\u201d Gonzales went on to criticise the \u201cdisconnect\u201d that he is seeing between Republicans and Democrats surrounding the border crisis, saying, \u201cI do worry [about] what\u2019s happening at all levels \u2013 state, local, federal. What I see is a disconnect. I see distrust. I see Republicans blaming Democrats, Democrats blaming Republicans, and round and round we go with nothing getting accomplished.\u201d He called on Congress to step up its efforts in addressing the border crisis, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t just wait on the president to solve things. We can\u2019t wait for governors to try and fix it themselves. Congress has a role to play in this.\u201d Gonzales also reaffirmed the Hire Act, a proposal he introduced that seeks to strengthen and streamline temporary work visa programs in an attempt to address the national work shortage and alleviate illegal immigration. \u201cI don\u2019t want one person to step one foot in that river illegally. What if there\u2019s a route where they didn\u2019t have to be smuggled in the train? What if the Hire Act got passed and people can come over and work legally, not having to live in the shadows? \u2026 Most people are coming here for one reason and that is [for] economic purposes,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e67", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/24/theres-no-other-option-but-to-fight-iranian-women-defiant-as-morality-police-return", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018There\u2019s no other option but to fight\u2019: Iranian women defiant as \u2018morality police\u2019 return", "lead": "Activists speak of their dismay at renewed patrols to enforce wearing of the hijab, but insist protests will continue ahead of the anniversary of Mahsa Amini\u2019s death", "author": "Deepa Parent", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 05:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681278", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c7ee9bb4d149f6ec65cba20b5949e07def6ecb/0_453_4500_2699/500.jpg", "body": "The return of Iran\u2019s infamous Gasht-e-Irshad (\u201cmorality police\u201d) has been greeted with dismay, but protesters who spoke to the Guardian said they would not be dissuaded from taking to streets again. A police spokesperson confirmed last week that they had started patrolling the streets to deal with civilians who \u201cignore the consequences of not wearing the proper hijab and insist on disobeying the norms\u201d. The announcement comes just two months ahead of the anniversary of the death in custody last September of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been detained for allegedly not properly wearing the Islamic headscarf. Her death led to the largest wave of popular unrest in years in Iran. The Guardian spoke to women who took part in the nationwide protests after Amini\u2019s death, who said they have already seen police harassing girls on the street for not wearing the hijab. \u201cI felt indifferent to the news that the \u2018morality police\u2019 have been reinstated. Western media insists on telling us Iranians that Gasht-e-Irshad was abolished, but I don\u2019t know a single Iranian friend of mine who believed that,\u201d says a 22-year-old from Rasht. \u201cThey [the morality police] were never gone and were being deployed as security personnel in universities or as civilians in public places. What the world sees is a tiny glimpse of what\u2019s happening here. Although everything looks normal to the ones who don\u2019t care about us women, if you notice, they are everywhere. \u201cI have worn the headscarf all my life, by choice, and my sister doesn\u2019t. I have always worn it halfway on my head. They killed Mahsa for showing less hair than I do and I know with this official announcement they have now been given a free hand to turn more violent.\u201d In recent months, Iranian women and girls have been posting pictures and videos of themselves on social media defying the mandatory hijab law. \u201cSo many dozens of kids didn\u2019t die [in vain] so a year later we will go back to how we were before September 2022,\u201d says a university student from Tehran. \u201cWhether or not the regime wants to accept, we will hit the streets again and there\u2019s no going back. We are already planning huge protests leading up to the one-year anniversary of Mahsa\u2019s death. There will be more arrests or worse. These are scare tactics and we won\u2019t fall for this. \u201cThe morality police harassed me even before the protests began. The security forces shot me with a paint gun on my head. I don\u2019t fear them. If we fear them and back off, what will be left of the sacrifices made by the protesters who lost their lives and their families? I am ready to continue the fight.\u201d Among those killed during protests after Amini\u2019s death was Minoo Majidi, a 62-year-old mother who was shot with 167 pellets. She reportedly said to her family before attending protests in Kermanshah: \u2018If I don\u2019t go out and protest, who else will?\u2019 Her daughter Mahsa Piraei said her mother always valued women\u2019s rights and freedom. \u201cBy intensifying repressions, arrests and harassment under the pretext of hijab law, the Islamic Republic sends a message to the Iranian people: that we will beat and kill, and if anyone protests, they will be killed too, just like they killed my mother. This circle will continue as [long as] this regime will remain in power, as its foundation is built upon violence and crimes.\u201d Although the morality police have existed in some form since the Islamic revolution in 1979, the current form, the Guidance Patrol, was formed as an arm of the police force in 2005. Since then, it has enforced strict hijab laws with multiple reports of violent arrests and detentions. In 2014, Masih Alinejad, an Iranian journalist and activist, launched My Stealthy Freedom, an online movement encouraging women to share pictures of themselves without a hijab. Alinejad continues to receive images and videos of defiant Iranian women and girls. \u201cThe battle over the hijab became a powerful rallying [cry] against the gender apartheid regime in Iran and a sign of regime change,\u201d said Alinejad, adding that, after Amini\u2019s death, demonstrations quickly escalated into calls for the overthrow of Iran\u2019s clerical regime. \u201cWomen were burning their headscarves, cutting their hair and burning morality police vans. These women became the nightmare of the whole regime and that is why the government try to resume hijab laws to prevent another uprising on the anniversary. They know very well that the next wave of women-led revolution in Iran will be much heavier.\u201d University students have faced harassment, suspensions and expulsion for refusing to wear a hijab. News of morality police patrolling the streets has created more anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m almost getting cold and numb with this news,\u201d says one university student from a city in north-east Iran. \u201cThe events of last year are repeating themselves, even though my life is the same. Even simple things have become a dream for us. In this hot weather of 38 degrees do they expect us to go out in a chador?\u201d The student added that the move to reinstate the morality police was only to provoke women to go out in protest so they can be arrested as a warning to others. A resident in Tehran said morality police had been noting down the car number plates of women spotted without a hijab. \u201cThey have been clicking pictures of me and my friends who have been stepping out without our headscarves. I fear they have already collected enough data to go after us, one by one,\u201d she says. \u201cI got into an argument with one of them recently outside a court. The agents harshly ask women to wear a hijab and when we refuse, they take our pictures, videos and our ID cards. Then we are summoned to the court. I am still going out without a hijab despite the announcement, because we are too many of us who have now decided to defy the law and fight. \u201cIf we fear, they will behave worse and torture more of my people. As an Iranian woman, I say that there\u2019s no other option but to fight. We are not afraid of the morality police.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e68", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/24/productivity-commission-appoints-chris-barrett-jim-chalmers", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Productivity Commission appoints Chris Barrett as new chief, treasurer Jim Chalmers confirms", "lead": "Chalmers announces Barrett, deputy secretary of Victoria\u2019s treasury and finance department, will begin his five-year appointment from September", "author": "Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 04:59:17", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681297", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fc9012962523fdff8dfff4d4cff6cf4c51e5aff5/0_31_6447_3868/500.jpg", "body": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers has appointed Chris Barrett, a seasoned economist and former chief of staff to another Labor treasurer, to head the Productivity Commission for the next five years. Barrett\u2019s appointment for a term of five years starting in September followed \u201ca rigorous process involving interviews with two departmental secretaries and the Australian Public Service commissioner\u201d, Chalmers said on Monday. Barrett, a deputy secretary of Victoria\u2019s treasury and finance department since January 2021, has held a range of senior appointments at home and abroad. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup These included being Wayne Swan\u2019s chief of staff from 2007-10, a role then taken up by Chalmers. Barrett was Australia\u2019s ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris from 2011-14, after which he became executive director of Berlin-based European Climate Foundation from 2015-19. \u201cMr Barrett\u2019s experience \u2013 from key senior roles in important international institutions to practical experience delivering reforms in both state and federal governments \u2013 will further cement the commission\u2019s role as a world-class economic institution,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly looking to revitalise and renew and refocus the Productivity Commission,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear we think the productivity opportunity for Australia is not to make people work longer for less but to invest in human capital and the energy transformation, and get much better at adapting and adopting technology as it evolves.\u201d The commission has often criticised Australia\u2019s poor track productivity record in the past decade, including in its most recent five-year report. Outgoing Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, too, has warned rising wages without workers becoming more efficient would mean higher interest rates for longer if inflation was to be reined in. The commission has also tended to criticise subsidies to support renewable energy while backing \u201ca single, explicit carbon price\u201d, a policy the Abbott government scrapped in 2014. Last week, it warned against \u201cold-fashioned protectionism\u201d by governments trying to support industries such as a national battery strategy. \u201cAs a small open economy, our future prosperity depends on global economic integration and low-trade barriers,\u201d deputy chair Alex Robson said. \u201cIt is unlikely to be in Australia\u2019s interests to try and compete in a protectionist contest via large-scale industry assistance.\u201d Chalmers said he supported the independence of the commission and that the choice of Barrett was not \u201ca kind of a performance review\u201d on outgoing chair Michael Brennan. \u201cI want to make sure the Productivity Commission is providing the kind of insights and perspectives about a more modern economy that a government can pick up and run with,\u201d he said. Brennan said the choice of Barrett as his replacement was \u201can outstanding appointment\u201d. \u201cChris will bring great intellect, strategic insight and a breadth of experience to the role,\u201d Barrett said, according to comments provided by the treasurer\u2019s office. \u201cWe should all be very positive about the future of the PC under Chris\u2019s leadership.\u201d Innes Willox, chair of the AiGroup, also welcomed Barrett\u2019s appointment and said he \u201clooks forward to continuing to work with the Productivity Commission to inform debate and policy making in the years ahead\u201d. Chris Barrett, born in 1969, holds a bachelor of commerce and a bachelor of arts with honours, and a masters in public policy from the Princeton school of Public and International Affairs. Brennan too had hailed from the Victorian government, also serving as a deputy secretary, in the treasury department. He also worked as an associate director in the economics and policy practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, among other roles. Separately, Chalmers said the government wouldn\u2019t dip into the improving fiscal position to support additional funding for struggling households. The budget for the year, which ended last month, is expected to post a cash surplus \u201clikely north of about $20bn,\u201d according to Chalmers. \u201c[T]he government\u2019s main focus is on providing cost of living relief by rolling out the commitments that we\u2019ve made over our first two budgets,\u201d he said, adding the surplus was \u201cbanked\u201d for the year just ended. \u201c[W]e\u2019re not looking for ways to spend out of last year\u2019s budget - even if we wanted to, that wouldn\u2019t be a goal.\u201d Asked about whether he would be open to having more than two RBA votes on the new monetary policy board planned for the central bank, Chalmers said it would have the \u201csame arrangements\u201d as the existing board. The new board is part of the recommendations of the RBA review.

The Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie movie has made $21.5m at the box office since the film opened on Wednesday night. It was the biggest opening weekend for a movie released in Australia in 2023, more than double the nearest rival, The Super Mario Bros Movie, which collected $10.5m in ticket sales. Barbie was also the highest Australian opening for any movie directed by a woman; and the most successful debut for any movie starring Margot Robbie or Ryan Gosling. Christopher Nolan\u2019s historical epic Oppenheimer also overperformed with a robust $9.36m opening weekend. It\u2019s the fourth-highest opening weekend for a 2023 movie, behind Barbie, Mario Bros and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. The three-hour biopic about J Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who spearheaded the creation of the nuclear bomb, achieved the highest opening weekend in Australia for a Nolan film. Its ticket sales were 26% higher than Inception and 56% more than Dunkirk. The combined ticket sales of Barbie and Oppenheimer, along with holdover films including Mission: Impossible 7 and Indiana Jones 5, led to the highest ever Saturday and Sunday at the Australian box office \u2013 beating the previous record for a Saturday in April 2019, when Avengers: Endgame was released; and a record Sunday in December 2015, dominated by Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

The ubiquity of the Barbie marketing campaign, coupled with the framing of Barbie and Oppenheimer \u2013 two movies very different in tone \u2013 as a double feature dubbed \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d, helped propel the success of both films. Barbie and Oppenheimer\u2019s opening weekend dwarfed projections in the US and Canada, where Barbie collected US$155m (A$230m) in ticket sales (compared to estimates of $70m to $80m) and Oppenheimer grossed US$80m (doubling expectations). Barbie\u2019s American box office results also gives Gerwig the highest grossing opening weekend for a movie directed by a woman, toppling a record previously held by Captain Marvel\u2019s co-director Anna Boden. In the UK, Barbie became the biggest box office draw for cinema chain Vue since the pandemic. Rival chain Odeon reported on Thursday it had sold more than 200,000 advance tickets.

Here on the south\u2011west coast of the Isle of Wight, the birds are different (skylarks, lapwings, black-tailed godwit); the butterflies are different (marbled white, wall, white admiral). But the night sky is, frankly, unrecognisable. London\u2019s familiar dirty orange glow is replaced by a clarity of light and a depth of dark that is unimaginable for a city dweller. There are fewer and fewer places free of the creeping spectre of light pollution \u2013 and we are staying in one of them. We find a place. We sit. We wait. The rookery over the road settles down for the night, caw of rook and chack of jackdaw fading into silence. Light wind, few clouds, no moon. Good stargazing conditions. Good enough for us, at least. Slowly, as dusk yields to dark, they reveal themselves. I wonder at the expert\u2019s ability to identify a single star from the random scatter in the sky, and the imagination of our ancestors to construct real and mythical creatures from those infinite join-the-dot patterns. Blissfully ignorant of the details, I\u2019m happy to lie back and contemplate the incalculable vastness of the universe. I do know one, though. Most people do. The Plough.

Seven bright stars forming a distinctive shape, recognisable to even the most novice star watcher. As always, I spend a minute looking at the star at the tip of the saucepan\u2019s handle. Alkaid. It is, give or take, 103 light years distant. Which means, give or take, that the blue-white light reaching my eyes today started its journey around the time my father was born. Look at the night sky for any length of time and big thoughts are inevitable. The darkness intensifies. The International Space Station rolls smoothly overhead. We give it a wave, as we always do. A shooting star. Not, as so often, uncertainly glimpsed in the corner of my eye, but seen and followed from first flash to disappearance.

But the fossil fuel industry operating nearby has no such worries. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals have been springing up along the fragile Gulf coast, securing insurance even as their product contributes to the climate crisis and its growing risks, including more intense hurricanes and increased coastal flooding that are driving away residents. For large projects such as LNG terminals, risk is spread among many insurers; no one company is exposed to all of a terminal\u2019s potential losses. The same is not true for insurance companies whose business is built around residential policies where hurricane damage can lead to millions of dollars of claims at once. But that outcome is more than an actuarial calculation for residents: when Hurricane Ida made landfall in south-eastern Louisiana in 2021, an 8ft storm surge swept over a 6ft Mississippi River levee in Ironton, flooding and destroying much of the small town, even dislodging caskets from their tombs. Damage from Ida sent Louisiana\u2019s property insurance market \u2013 already rattled by three major hurricanes in two years \u2013 into a full-blown crisis. By the end of 2022, nearly two dozen insurance companies had either left the state or gone under. Residents scrambled for new, dramatically more expensive coverage or went without. Meanwhile, just a few miles south of Ironton, a giant $20bn liquefied natural gas terminal is rising on a wedge of land between the Mississippi River and encroaching wetlands. Plaquemines LNG is one of eight terminals built or planned along Louisiana\u2019s coastline. \u201cPeople who can leave have left,\u201d Byron Encalade, president of the Louisiana Oystermen Association, said of his lifelong home, Plaquemines Parish, which includes Ironton. \u201cThe insurance situation is just horrible. People still haven\u2019t been paid fully for the damage [from Ida],\u201d Encalade said, adding with soaring costs, some homeowners are paying more for their insurance than their homes. The three parishes in Louisiana where LNG terminals are concentrated have all seen significant population decreases in the past two years, primarily driven by hurricanes. As more residents leave, the parishes are less able to invest in the infrastructure that makes coastal communities livable, including schools, driving even more people away. \u201cOver time it will diminish the fiscal capacity of the parish in terms of tax revenue to even recover next time,\u201d Jesse Keenan, a professor of sustainable real estate at Tulane University, said. \u201cForget plan or prepare.\u201d \u201cThese parishes have terminal cancer, in the sense that these hurricanes are going to continue in their frequency and their intensity in ways that are really unprecedented,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cInsurance companies are aware of that.\u201d *** Coastal Louisiana has always been in the path of storms, but it\u2019s clear to Alex Kolker, a coastal geologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, that more extreme weather is not only the state\u2019s uncertain future: \u201cIt\u2019s a very certain present.\u201d Warmer oceans and warmer air, Kolker said, provide more fuel for hurricanes, leading to stronger storms with more intense rains and harsher winds. Rising oceans raise the average level of the shoreline. \u201cIn Louisiana that\u2019s compounded by the fact that the land is sinking, and it\u2019s sinking relatively rapidly,\u201d Kolker said. While many of the world\u2019s largest insurance and reinsurance companies have emissions targets and no longer insure coal projects, they have resisted calls to stop insuring fossil fuel projects entirely, despite their contribution to the climate crisis and increased global risk. At the same time, state legislatures and Republican attorneys generals have threatened insurance companies for using environmental criteria when setting rates, spooking major insurers away from a UN-backed effort on cutting emissions. The companies no longer insuring Louisiana homes are well-known, but those insuring LNG terminals are not. Government agencies require proof of insurance for fossil fuel projects, but those documents are often shielded from the public as developers claim confidential business information exemptions, even going to court to prevent insurers\u2019 names from becoming public. In early June, the anti-fossil fuel campaign Insure Our Future got a rare look into one gas export terminal in Texas: Freeport LNG. First published in E&amp;E News, Freeport\u2019s insurers are largely specialty or reinsurance companies, but a few are also involved in the property market, including Liberty Mutual, AIG and Chubb. Most insurers and LNG companies contacted for this story \u2013 including AIG, Chubb, Liberty Mutual and Venture Global \u2013 either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. While no insurance information for terminals in coastal Louisiana has become public, their insurers are likely to come from similar kinds of companies. Oil and gas projects along the Gulf coast have long been \u201ca major market\u201d for specialty insurance carriers, said Jesse Keenan, the professor of sustainable real estate at Tulane University. These projects have been profitable, he added, not because the rates they charge are comparably higher but because of the sheer size of the contracts. \u201cThe dollar amounts are very large and they have very high deductibles.\u201d Each of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies receives annual premiums from fossil fuel projects between $250-800m, according to an internal study commissioned by Insure Our Future from the market intelligence firm Insuramore. For large projects such as LNG terminals, risk is spread among many insurers, as well as the developer itself through financial mechanisms like capital reserves, debt and equity. LNG developers have made assurances to insurers and government agencies that levees, seawalls and other changes to their sites will protect the terminals \u2013 in the case of Plaquemines, a 26ft wall. Further west, as many as seven LNG terminals could someday line the Calcasieu ship channel, which was inundated by a 17ft storm surge during Hurricane Laura in 2020, flooding and destroying parts of the city of Lake Charles. Sempra and Venture Global, the companies currently operating the two terminals along the channel, shut down ahead of the storm and reported no significant impacts. Sempra Infrastructure, which runs Cameron LNG in south-western Louisiana, said the company had conducted flood, wind and storm surge studies at the site. As a result, Sempra raised the level of the facility overall and \u201ccritical equipment\u201d above the level historically expected for an extremely rare flood event. \u201cThese are all aspects that insurers use and take into account prior to insuring the LNG facility,\u201d said Selby Bush Lilley, a vice-president of external affairs at Sempra. But local and national advocacy groups aren\u2019t convinced. Storm surge flooding is not the only concern, said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. \u201cAs if a big wall is going to prevent rain from falling on the facility. And it\u2019s not going to stop the wind.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e6d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/24/neal-lawson-on-the-threat-of-expulsion-by-labour-they-are-making-sure-no-one-on-the-left-has-a-platform", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Neal Lawson on the threat of expulsion by Labour: \u2018They are making sure no one on the left has a platform\u2019", "lead": "The founder of Compass has been a Labour member for over 40 years.

His apparent offence? He had praised an example of cooperation between the Lib Dems and the Green party, saying: \u201cThis is what grown-up politics looks like.\u201d If this was deemed to be an incitement to vote for a party other than Labour, he was warned, he would be in breach of party rules and expelled. \u201cWhether I\u2019m a member of the Labour party or not is inconsequential,\u201d Lawson insists, when I meet him in his south London offices. But it was quite a slap in the face for a man who has been so intimately involved with the party. He has spent 20 years as the head of the membership organisation Compass. Today, it focuses on the progressive alliance \u2013 how parties with shared values can cooperate to beat the Conservatives, rather than splitting the vote. But when he founded Compass in 2003, it was conceived as a critical friend to Labour, a sort of Cassandra-chorus of the soft left, to remind the government what its values were. Over the years, it has campaigned on issues such as high executive pay and loan sharks. I\u2019ve been talking to Lawson about a progressive alliance for years, ever since we were debating whether to call it a \u201crebel alliance\u201d or a \u201ccoalition of the losers\u201d. He looks the same as he always has \u2013 energetic, tanned, a bit restless. Now 60, and also working as a consultant with Jericho Chambers, which advises corporations on pro-social behaviour (fair wages, green policies, workplace rights), he grew up in Bexleyheath, south-east London. His father was a printer; his mother worked in a shoe shop. \u201cMy dad was father of the chapel on Fleet Street,\u201d he says, \u201cso we were like Labour aristocracy, completely blue collar. My name was on the list to get a job in printing.\u201d That\u2019s how it worked in the 80s: you put your son\u2019s name down and then when they were 16, they would be in. When it came to it, though, he went to Trent Polytechnic (now university) instead \u2013 \u201cwhich they\u2019ve made me a doctor of\u201d. This made him the first member of his family to enter tertiary education and the first to join Labour Students, with whom he had 80s skirmishes with the Militant tendency. After that, he joined the Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union, before working for Gordon Brown as an adviser and speechwriter in the run-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide victory. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad Labour history, is it?\u201d he asks, rhetorically, knowing full well that this is more than not-bad \u2013 a Russian spy, trained from birth to pass as part of Labour\u2019s bloodstream, wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently. In 1992, he co-founded Renewal, Labour\u2019s journal of ideas. The party was reeling, humiliated by defeat to John Major. \u201cIt was a solar plexus blow: it destroyed everyone\u2019s confidence. We all felt it so keenly, we just had to start winning.\u201d By early 1997, in that whatever-it-takes spirit, Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown were communicating closely, brokered by Roy Jenkins. \u201cI set the meeting up, in the Goring hotel, where the whole electoral deal was done,\u201d Lawson recalls, with vim. Peter Mandelson and Chris Rennard, election campaign directors for Labour and the Lib Dems respectively, \u201cswapped their target seat lists, which the Mirror then printed: \u2018If you live here and want the Tories out, vote for that.\u2019 I\u2019m the person who did that, and they want to throw me out of the party? Fuck them.\u201d I tell him I can take swearing out if it is used adjectivally, but not if he\u2019s going to use it as a verb. This is a journalistic rule I\u2019ve made up on the spot. \u201cWe need emotion in politics,\u201d he says, nonchalantly. It\u2019s a bit of a \u201cyou-ok-hun?\u201d moment for the Labour party. If this disciplinary move sounds bizarre, it has previous, just not so far with such a high-profile centrist dad. There were a lot of expulsions in the drive to root out antisemitism in the party, which was widely accepted as necessary; this segued into a more general ejection of Corbynistas, which was more contentious, but they often went without a fight, having lost their enthusiasm under the new leader anyway. Where members did appeal, so far none has been successful. But Labour has also been keeping candidates off shortlists for councillors, mayors and prospective parliamentary candidates, and that process is a much more black box affair, where the National Executive Committee holds a hearing and hands down a decision, with no appeal possible. There\u2019s so little transparency that often you\u2019ll only notice it has happened when it\u2019s to someone who already had a profile. I was really surprised, for instance, when Emma Dent Coad was kept off the shortlist for the Kensington seat, in October last year, for \u201cconcerning social media activity\u201d. No question, she had a scratchy relationship with the leadership, and was at the left edge of the party, but she also had rock-solid credentials as a local councillor and was the only Labour MP to win this seat since its creation in the 70s. Residents\u2019 associations in Tory wards wrote to Keir Starmer to complain. Others were more surprised when Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor, was barred from standing for the new north-east mayoralty. (He has since resigned from the party to run as an independent candidate.) That winnowing-out of candidates who don\u2019t match the leaders\u2019 vision has \u201calways gone on to some extent\u201d, Lawson concurs, \u201cbut nowhere near to the industrial level that this is, right down to council seats they can\u2019t win. They\u2019re making sure that no one on the left has got a platform. They\u2019re playing whack-a-mole everywhere.\u201d This must feel like an age-old Labour story. Lawson remembers the militant purges of the 80s, \u201cthe Kinnock years, policy renewal \u2013 I was involved with all of that\u201d. Blair, of course, marked the high point of the command-and-control atmosphere. It was always rumoured that he banned beards from the shadow cabinet, for looking too leftwing. And sure, I haven\u2019t forgotten that he did actually win. But those Labour years between 1992 and 1997 \u2013 for all the fighting \u2013 were also a \u201creally rich intellectual environment\u201d, Lawson says. He reels off a list of thinkers \u2013 Anthony Giddens, Charlie Leadbetter, Will Hutton \u2013 and thinktanks: \u201cDemos took off, the Institute for Public Policy Research found its feet again, we had all these seminars, and then when we got into Downing Street, more seminars, exploring the third way until I eventually realised it was a wild goose chase. The real difference was, Blair and Brown engaged in debate, right? They tried to defend their position and argue for it.\u201d This is true to a weird degree: I remember one Labour apparatchik taking me for a drink to persuade me that public-private partnerships were good, actually. This was 1998, and I was writing listings for the Evening Standard. Blair\u2019s people, Lawson continues, were \u201chegemonic: their attitude was: \u2018We want everyone to be part of this thing.\u2019 It may have been clever co-option on their part\u201d \u2013 quelling dissent by drawing in everyone \u2013 \u201cbut whatever it was, it was a damn sight more intriguing and inquiring and interesting than this silence \u2026 This lot, there\u2019s no intellectual conversation to be had.\u201d Unarguably, whatever conversations are happening at the highest level of the Labour party, the left and, in Lawson\u2019s case at least, the soft-to-centre, are no longer involved, but it would be unfair to conclude that no conversations are happening. However, it is hard to get to the bottom of what the vision actually is. Dominant figures such as Morgan McSweeney, the founder of Labour Together, and Luke Akehurst, the secretary of Labour First, are keenly focused on unity in the party, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m speaking out of turn when I say that nobody outside their clique knows what they want to unify around. Lawson thinks they have only one project: \u201cTo seal the tomb of the left in Labour, to make sure there\u2019s no alternative, not even the soft left, because the soft left is the gateway drug to the hard left. They nearly lost control of the party [to Corbyn and, arguably, to Ed Miliband], and they were lucky to get back in again. I think it is absolutely industrial, cynical, determined and it\u2019s never going to stop. They need to get rid of the seedbed, anything that might produce people who could support Lisa Nandy or Andy Burnham or someone we don\u2019t yet know of, in the future\u201d. If it is as cut and dried as that, Starmer\u2019s leadership campaign \u2013 very much of the sensible left, with a list of pledges around Labour classics such as renationalisation, and the overall intimation that he\u2019d be Corbyn-without-the-cranks \u2013 has panned out quite surprisingly. Lawson is only slightly surprised: \u201cI smelled a rat when Keir was campaigning, but not as bad as this.\u201d Recent leaks from the shadow cabinet are that big ideas on green industrial strategy are sidelined to focus on \u201cfiscal credibility\u201d, and Starmer wants to steer away from hopes and dreams and hates tree huggers. Someone on Twitter said: \u201cLabour: tough on hope, tough on the causes of hope.\u201d The risks of play-it-safe Labour politics unfolded precisely in last week\u2019s three by-elections: you might win (Selby); you might cede to a campaign that is simply more crunchy than your own (Uxbridge); and if you think you can wish away Lib Dem support, rather than working with it, you\u2019re dreaming (Somerton and Frome). I say all this in solid critical-friend spirit: I\u2019ll be voting Labour come what may. Which, again, approximates what many Labour voters felt before the 1997 landslide, but then, Lawson says: \u201c\u201997, pretty talented group of people, quite a rich political project, in the most benign circumstances, no distributional tensions whatsoever\u201d. What does distributional tension mean? \u201cWell, there was loads of money. All you had to do was keep top-skimming the City and plough back into schools, Sure Start. There were no strikes. The question then was: \u2018How do you spend all of this money?\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re comparing and contrasting. I keep looking at what we have now, going: \u2018This ain\u2019t gonna fly.\u2019 Most political projects end up in a bunker; this one\u2019s starting in a bunker. What culture does this take into government? If they\u2019re like this now, they\u2019re going to be like this in government, with stilts on.\u201d Lawson thinks it\u2019s complacent to assume that people will vote Labour whatever happens; he wonders how many people will vote Green or abstain. But more than that, he says, getting elected is only the beginning: if a Labour government comes in and underperforms, fails to deliver meaningful improvements to the millions of lives that have been assailed by crises both caused by Conservatives and beyond them, \u201cthat opens up the trapdoor to the far right\u201d for the election after next. \u201cThat\u2019s how big this is. The only thing that stops the authoritarian right is a new politics, and Labour are currently a million miles away from that.\u201d Obligatorily, then, we end on proportional representation, the change to the system all Labour members agree with, the one the party will never really countenance, not even at its most radical (\u201cJohn McDonnell supported PR but he didn\u2019t support it enough to make it a red line, did he?\u201d), the only change that would ever see this country\u2019s progressive electoral majority reflected in its parliament. \u201cThere\u2019s a great convergence: XR, the Tax Justice Network, the Fairness Foundation, they\u2019re all coming over to the fact that democracy is a first-order issue,\u201d Lawson says. (The Greens and the Lib Dems are, of course, long-term proponents.) Democratic renewal doesn\u2019t end with PR \u2013 Lawson talks about quadratic voting, where each person has a number of votes and distributes them according to where they prioritise issues, and liquid democracy, where you can rescind and reallocate your support more often than once every five years, and, like all \u201cdeeper democracy, ever deeper democracy\u201d programmes, it sounds like really hard work. But \u201cless democracy, always less democracy\u201d, such as we\u2019ve experienced post-Brexit, has hardly been a walk in the park. I don\u2019t think Lawson will be expelled from the Labour party although, to be fair, in talking about it, he\u2019s now breached the rules of the letter he got about the other rules, so it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility. And precisely because I\u2019ve seen the Labour party at war with itself for as long as I\u2019ve been alive, and for a load of different reasons that are often the same reasons, I cannot believe the current animus is insurmountable, or final. I want to screen Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s 1964 election video at some big Labour meeting, perhaps conference. It\u2019s only 60 seconds: we must either love each other, or we must die. Those are the stakes."}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e6e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/24/most-nhs-staff-say-they-dont-have-enough-time-to-spend-with-patients", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Most NHS staff say they don\u2019t have enough time to spend with patients", "lead": "Exclusive: UK-wide poll of healthcare workers also reveals 75% believe the quality of care provided is falling", "author": "Denis Campbell Health policy editor", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 04:00:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681409", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6f5eda5c4751f723021d21fbf2a1544a83953859/0_79_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Most NHS staff think they have too little time to help patients and the quality of care the service provides is falling, a survey reveals.

A third (34%) felt they had \u201csomewhat less than enough time\u201d and 37% \u201cfar less than enough time\u201d than they wanted. Almost a quarter (23%) felt they had the right amount of time while just 3% said they had \u201cmore time\u201d than they wanted.

The Royal College of Nursing\u2019s chief nursing officer, Nicola Ranger, said: \u201cThese figures are a shocking indictment of the state of our NHS, with the vast majority of staff believing that the quality of care that patients receive is getting worse. \u201cThat more than seven in 10 NHS staff feel they have less time than they would like to have to help patients is very worrying. It means the quality of care patients are receiving is suffering.\u201d Recent analysis by the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation thinktanks found that the quality of NHS care had declined since 2012 across most of the 150 indicators they monitor, caused by austerity being imposed on the service. The chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Dr Jeanette Dickson, said the NHS was under greater strain than at any time in its 75-year history because of the Covid-19 pandemic and \u201cyears of underfunding by successive governments\u201d, which has left it short-staffed. Dickson said heavy staff workloads were \u201chugely frustrating not just for the people who need treatment but also for NHS staff who genuinely want to spend more time with patients so they can provide better quality care\u201d. The British Medical Association\u2019s deputy chair of council, Dr Emma Runswick, said: \u201cOur own research has found that many doctors feel \u2018moral distress\u2019 because we cannot give patients the care and support we want to, with insufficient staffing, a lack of time and mental fatigue all major contributing factors.\u201d The King\u2019s Fund thinktank carried out an international study to mark the NHS\u2019s 75th anniversary on 5 July. It found the UK health service had fewer doctors, nurses, hospital beds and other vital resources than most of the 18 other rich countries studied. More positively, the YouGov poll also found that despite the pressures felt, 73% of staff were proud to work for the NHS and only 9% were embarrassed to do so. Sophy Hinchcliffe, a senior researcher at YouGov, said: \u201cWith the NHS increasingly under pressure amid months of industrial action, this research highlights how NHS staff believe the quality of care has fallen over the past five years.\u201d She added that, given the lack of time so many personnel report, \u201cwith winter often a particularly busy time for health services, it will be interesting to see how this translates to the experiences of frontline NHS staff in the coming months\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment directly on the survey\u2019s findings. A spokesperson highlighted the government and NHS England\u2019s recent long-term workforce plan, which would bring a dramatic expansion in homegrown health professionals. The spokesperson added: \u201cThere are already more NHS staff caring for patients than ever before, including 5,800 more doctors and over 14,900 [more] nurses compared to this time last year.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64bef80351ac333624604e6f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/i-have-fought-every-day-since-assa-traores-campaign-for-justice-after-brother-died-in-police-custody", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018I have fought every day since\u2019: Assa Traor\u00e9\u2019s campaign for justice after brother died in police custody", "lead": "Death of Adama Traor\u00e9 in 2016 renewed allegations of racism and violence in French police forces", "author": "Kim Willsher in Paris", "datePublished": "2023-07-24 04:00:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-25 00:15:31.681427", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8ae4a82b615c5e2d409a4ed485384d4576ce965f/0_653_6197_3718/500.jpg", "body": "Assa Traor\u00e9 says her family name means \u201cwarrior\u201d. She is determined to live up to it. Seven years ago this month, her younger brother Adama Traor\u00e9 died in police custody on his 24th birthday. That his death has not been forgotten \u2013 like those of other young black and north African men whose paths have crossed the French police \u2013 is entirely down to Assa. Adama\u2019s death in 2016 sparked protests and rioting, and revived the national debate over tensions between the police and young people in the rundown housing estates that are home to generations of families originally from France\u2019s former African colonies. It also renewed allegations of systemic racism and violence in the country\u2019s forces of law and order. Assa has accused the three gendarmes involved in Adama\u2019s arrest of killing him because of the colour of his skin and was sued, unsuccessfully, for defamation. The officers, who have admitted they put their full weight on Adama while trying to detain him, are still under investigation. \u201cThey chose the wrong family,\u201d she says, speaking in her apartment on the outskirts of Paris. \u201cThe more they threaten us, pick on us, take legal action against us, the more determined we become.\u201d For the last seven years Assa has fought a campaign under the banner \u201ctruth and justice for Adama\u201d, warning the authorities that without either, they \u201cwill have no peace\u201d. In doing so, she has become one of France\u2019s most prominent campaigners for racial justice. To her critics, however, her activism is vexatious. Last month, after the fatal police shooting of Nahel M, a 17-year-old from Nanterre, sparked rioting, violence and vandalism, she encouraged Nahel\u2019s family to organise a public demonstration. The authorities then banned an annual march in commemoration of Adama \u2013 but Assa went ahead with it anyway. The \u201cillegal\u201d protest led to the violent arrest of another Traor\u00e9 brother, Youssouf, 29. Police were filmed singling him out from the crowd. Afterwards, they claimed he had hit an officer; Youssouf emerged from hospital with a swollen face and a half-closed eye. For Assa, it was a terrifying case of deja vu. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s obviously traumatised,\u201d Assa, 38, says. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of daily life for black and north African men in the housing estates. \u201cThe harassment \u2026 is constant. Everyone is afraid of the police and gendarmes. As soon as they enter a neighbourhood, the word goes out to get inside.\u201d She adds: \u201cThey had Youssouf on the ground. It\u2019s a potent symbol: you rise and we will put you down. This is the message being sent to our youngsters. We don\u2019t offer them the best: the best schools; the best facilities; the best opportunities. \u201cYes, they will put all my brothers in prison because they have dared to rise and ask for truth and justice for Adama.\u201d Adama\u2019s death threw a spotlight not just on accusations of police violence and racism but also on France\u2019s failure to fully integrate young people with black and north African roots, often treated as not entirely French despite being born and raised in the country. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has rejected the term \u201cpolice violence\u201d, saying the violence is specific to individual officers rather than the entire force. On the night Adama died, he had made the fatal mistake of running off when gendarmes tried to arrest his brother Bagui. He was caught, held face down and handcuffed. Like George Floyd, the black American murdered by a white police officer in 2020, Traor\u00e9 complained he was having difficulty breathing after bearing the weight of three gendarmes on his prone body. By the time he arrived at the police station he was unconscious, and he was declared dead a few hours later. \u201cThe first thing I did when I heard he was dead was to call the journalists,\u201d says Assa. \u201cIt was the school holidays. I thought everyone will have forgotten by September. I was determined his death wouldn\u2019t become another minor news story. And I have fought every day since.\u201d A first postmortem suggested Adama had had a congenital heart defect that had been worsened by drink and drugs. A second found no trace of drink or drugs and suggested the cause of death was asphyxiation. The following day, the gendarmerie called the family to collect Adama\u2019s body, Assa says. \u201cThey said: \u2018We know you are of the Muslim faith and in Islam you bury the body within three days so we have contacted Air France and the Charles de Gaulle airport and the body of your brother will leave [for Mali] tomorrow.\u2019 \u201cI told them they were talking about a child who was born and grew up in France. It was for us to decide where he would be buried.\u201d Since then, Adama\u2019s death has been mired in conflicting and disputed reports and the exact cause never definitively established. \u201cNo French expert will touch the case because they know we will contest it,\u201d Assa says. \u201cThe experts are charlatans in league with the legal system.\u201d Yassine Bouzrou, the Traor\u00e9 family lawyer, insists there is enough evidence to hold a trial but has accused the judges overseeing the investigation of \u201cnot respecting the law\u201d. France\u2019s independent defender of rights has said the gendarmes should at least face disciplinary action. In the last seven years, Assa, who gave up her job as a special educational needs teacher to become a full-time activist, has become a skilled communicator and instantly recognisable across France. Outside the flat where she lives with her three children, 15, 11 and nine years old, and a tomcat named Simba, locals stop to greet her, calling her \u201cma belle\u201d (\u201cmy lovely\u201d). Assa is one of 17 children from her father\u2019s relationships with four women, and she is routinely challenged over some of her brothers\u2019 run-ins with the law \u2013 questions she has described as insulting. It is all part of an organised campaign, she says, to criminalise and destroy her family because they will not keep quiet. \u201cMy brother [Adama] had done petty criminal things, but nothing of any consequence,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was not a monster. The extreme right tries to justify the deaths of these men because of their crimes, but the death penalty has been abolished in France. \u201cThis is how the authorities work: they dehumanise the victim, criminalise him and incriminate the family.\u201d Assa\u2019s campaign has also brought international attention. In 2020, Time magazine named her one of its Guardians of the Year and the face of France\u2019s movement for racial justice. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting for Assa Traor\u00e9, I\u2019m fighting for Adama Traor\u00e9 and all the Adama Traor\u00e9s whose lives matter,\u201d she says. \u201cI want his death, his name, to change things. It\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about pulling open the curtains to reveal what is happening in France. \u201cWe cannot let our brothers die like this. France has to recognise that there is this racism and violence. It is not a weakness to admit this; it will save lives. If it continues in denial, we will get nowhere.\u201d"}]
