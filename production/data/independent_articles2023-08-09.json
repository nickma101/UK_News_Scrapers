Wolves had the fewest points before his appointment; only nine teams took more after it."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And yet the timing of Lopetegui\u2019s exit means his rescue act from relegation may only be a one-year reprieve. The Spaniard leaves Wolves in a mess and if his departure was by mutual consent, the blame should be shared around, too: it was evident in May that Lopetegui was unhappy and yet dragging things out until August hampered Wolves. Perhaps Gary O\u2019Neil, the other miracle worker of a mid-season appointment in last season\u2019s battle against the drop, can repeat his heroics then but the Wolves board should not bank on getting that lucky if the Englishman, put in charge at Bournemouth after Scott Parker talked himself out of a job, is parachuted in at Molineux after Lopetegui did likewise."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is a breakdown of communication made all the more damning by the amount of time Wolves spent courting Lopetegui last autumn; if that ought to have given the 56-year-old time to assess their position, he claimed he was only made aware of Financial Fair Play concerns in May. It is also a glaring failure of recruitment which left him convinced Wolves needed reinforcing after they spent a fortune. It is a consequence of Financial Fair Play, which meant they needed to sell."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Ruben Neves wanted to go anyway, his years of selfless service in mid-table ending and stripping Wolves of their best player.

There was \u00a327m last summer on Goncalo Guedes, who was so ineffectual he was loaned out in January, looks surplus to requirements now and for whom Wolves may never recoup a penny. There was \u00a315m on Sasa Kalajdzic, the injury-prone striker who promptly got injured on his debut and hasn\u2019t played since. And, under Lopetegui, there was the loan with the commitment to buy Matheus Cunha for \u00a343m, arranged when Wolves needed a centre-forward and a goalscorer.

And beyond that, there is the issue about owners Fosun, who have veered between spending and not in recent years, and the influence of agent Jorge Mendes. If Wolves long bucked the trend, being a rare club who seemed to benefit from having a very close relationship with one agency, there are Mendes\u2019 fingerprints over many of Wolves\u2019 worst deals; it is a category that also includes Nelson Semedo and Fabio Silva, who cost a further \u00a372m between them."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Matheus Nunes has had a slow start to life at Wolves "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Lopetegui nonetheless found a way to win games in a manner that marked him out as a high-class manager.

Never mind that it was a vital victory in the aftermath of two straight losses to Oleksandr Usyk, and that it was a first bout under Joshua\u2019s new coach Derrick James; it was an underwhelming outing, one that left even \u201cAJ\u201d disappointed in himself."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And when comparing Joshua to his heavyweight colleagues, it is easy to find faults in the 33-year-old. He is not a technician like Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk; he has become gun shy, unlike the trigger-happy Deontay Wilder; he no longer holds an unbeaten record or the titles that some of those fighters possess. Yet there is one area in which Joshua has recently, consistently set himself apart from many of the key heavyweight characters."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Simply put, Joshua wants to fight and he does not fear loss in the way that many boxers do. After Dillian Whyte returned an \u2018adverse\u2019 drug test finding last week and his rematch with Joshua was cancelled, there would have been no shame in AJ opting not to fight. That is especially true given how he was burnt in 2019, losing to Andy Ruiz Jr on short notice after Jarrell Miller tested positive for multiple banned substances. It was not only Joshua\u2019s first professional loss but a devastating one \u2013 a TKO on his American debut, in Madison Square Garden.

Of course, his clash with the latter ended violently in the first round \u2013 not in the Finn\u2019s favour \u2013 but was evidence of Helenius\u2019s bravery, which he will draw upon again this weekend. After flirting with retirement following his loss to Wilder, Helenius returned just last Saturday to beat Mika Mielonen inside three rounds.

McKean and Hrgovic, who square off on the undercard of Joshua vs Helenius, would have posed different problems for AJ and his promoter Eddie Hearn: McKean stepping in would have raised eyebrows, while Hrgovic could have raised hell. The former might not have been worth the hassle, while the latter would not have been worth the risk, and Hrgovic himself might not have wanted to risk his status as the mandatory challenger to the IBF title. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Joshua, though, might have argued that either fight would have been worth it. He is intent on fighting this weekend, in a bid not only to stay on track for a possible clash with Wilder but also in an effort to get more experience with James in his corner. Ring time against Helenius will certainly be better than none at all, with a Joshua-Wilder fight unlikely to take place until early 2024, even though Joshua was in action as recently as April."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wilder, meanwhile, does not seem particularly willing to step foot in the ring until he has to, ideally against Joshua. The American, 37, has not fought since his win over Helenius in October and he has appeared opposed to a showdown with Ruiz Jr. In fairness, Wilder is older than Joshua and has lost shine in the same way that the Briton has, but AJ deserves credit for taking even a measured risk against Helenius, who threatens Joshua\u2019s prospective, seismic payday against Wilder."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Joshua during his decision win over Franklin "}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is also worth noting that Joshua publicly accepted a challenge from Fury just days after losing to Usyk for the second fight in a row. At this point, for any and all criticism of Joshua, he does not deserve to have his courage challenged. All the while, Fury has contrived to complicate talks with Usyk, leading to the collapse of that undisputed-title fight and the materialisation of Fury vs Francis Ngannou \u2013 an ex-UFC heavyweight champion, making his pro boxing debut. Usyk, meanwhile, will box mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois later this month and the Ukrainian should not be tarred with the same brush as Fury."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Hearn, too, deserves credit for negotiating this messy episode as best as possible. He has quickly found a decent opponent for Joshua, while avoiding the mistakes he made in the fallout of Conor Benn\u2019s failed drug tests last year. \u201cThe tests, the results, the substances were very different,\u201d Hearn said on talkSport on Tuesday morning, comparing the collapse of Benn\u2019s bout with Chris Eubank Jr in October and Whyte\u2019s failed test this week. Hearn does not represent Whyte in the way that he does Benn, but nonetheless is trying to learn from the saga of the last 10 months.

But is there not surely a fearful and emotional side to any creature on the edge of society, forced to understand the world only through observations made from the shadows? Henry Hoke puts himself in the mind of a mountain lion living underneath the Hollywood sign, whose English is informed by overheard snippets of conversation from LA hipster hikers, who mither about therapy, helicopters and hook-ups, not knowing such danger lurks nearby. This lion just wants a safe home and looks for it in a homeless \u2018tent city\u2019, and in the basement of a celebrity comedian, with diverse and inevitably violent results. Witty, emotional and gripping, Open Throat is a short but savage thrill ride.9/10(Review by James Cann)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "2.

Fear not, for lovers of Shakespeare\u2019s most readily adapted tragedy will not be disappointed by Solomons\u2019 subversive counter-narrative.

Through the eyes of Shakespeare\u2019s neglected Rosaline, cousin to Juliet and former lover to Romeo, readers are invited to contend with an even darker truth surrounding the couple\u2019s fate. Transforming lust into subterfuge and tainting romance with a bitter-sweet morbidity, Fair Rosaline leaves not a stone unturned in its captive untelling. Prepare to see Romeo as you\u2019ve never seen him before.9/10(Review by Scarlett Sangster)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "3.

Patchett has an inimitable ability to cut straight to the heart of human emotion and to capture moments of truth, which lesser writers would struggle to depict without the use of clich\u00e9 or clumsy sentiment. Hauntingly poignant, deft and explorative, the tale of Lara and her former relationship with the actor Peter Duke is testament to the force of first love and how the choices that are made at every turn of the path continue to change us into the future.9/10(Review by Hannah Colby)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "4.

As a GP, Arif knows her stuff \u2013 and is able to communicate everything in an engaging, no-nonsense and understandable way. Cartoons, diagrams and top tips bring this book to life \u2013 which comprehensively covers a vast range of issues you likely didn\u2019t learn anywhere near enough about at school. It\u2019ll go a long way to demistifying and destigmatising these issues, and Arif is thorough in making sure no one is left behind \u2013 making sure anything specific to LGBTQ+ people and ethnic minorities are covered too.8/10(Review by Prudence Wade)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "5.

Indeed, the British public\u2019s affection for Wilko feels rooted in its down-to-earth usefulness, its reasonable prices and lack of flashiness, all while simultaneously feeling a little bit brilliantly silly."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Nina, who works in hospitality, moved to London from her native Germany over 10 years ago and fell in love with Wilko when she was first shopping for supplies for her new home. She was taken aback by the fact she could get everything she needed all in one place \u2013 and so cheaply! \u201cIt is still my number one go-to for everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThe moment I first went there, I loved it instantly because it\u2019s somehow like a chemist\u2019s but also a mini Ikea. They\u2019ve got all the useful things for the home, plus nice decor stuff, all for great prices. From ironing boards to glassware, I have bought everything there \u2013 even plants and plant food.\u201d She also credits Wilko with being the \u201conly store in the UK that sells my favourite mascara from a German brand called Essence\u201d."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Until last week\u2019s announcement, I\u2019m not sure I had ever given the shop a second thought, nor had I grappled with the reality of the nation\u2019s fondness for it.

It\u2019s as if it\u2019s not so much a high street staple as a stalwart companion, something that\u2019s provided supplies for major life moments. Lauren, a dancer from Devon, tells me she discovered Wilko when she moved into her first home and found it was in a dire state. \u201cIt was the nearest store I could drive to and so I panic-bought all my cleaning supplies,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI still use all my dusters from that day.\u201d A fellow journalist friend, Tibbs, shares that Wilko was an essential component of her first days as a freelancer working from home. \u201cI built my routine around it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt was always an exciting excuse to leave the house, but you didn\u2019t feel guilty because you\u2019re going there to buy dishwasher tabs for a total steal.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Ruth, a consultant, says her sharpest memory growing up involved the pick \u2018n\u2019 mix counter and some low-level criminality at her local Wilko. \u201cWe used to do this trick where you put a few sweets in, weigh it, get the sticker for how much you\u2019re meant to pay, then top up the bag with extra sweets,\u201d she says, guiltily laughing about her juvenile indiscretions. \u201cI guess between poor kids and Amazon, Wilko never stood a chance.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "text": "For Will, his Wilko journey began at university. \u201cIt was in first year and we were buying Christmas decorations for our communal kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got something like 100 baubles for \u00a33 \u2013 and they stayed up until March. It was the beginning of a love affair.\u201d Now married and in his thirties, he has never looked back. \u201cOur tree is still a collection of Wilko baubles and inherited tat,\u201d he says, wistfully. \u201cTo me, there is no better place to buy tree filler.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The sad reality, of course, is that Wilko is another victim of the contagiously convenient online world of retailers such as Amazon.

Online shopping, while convenient, only further entrenches feelings of isolation and anxiety \u2013 particularly for those like the elderly.
