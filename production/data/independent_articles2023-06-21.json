The only other people in the house were Mr and Mrs Wahab and their two-year-old son.She later died in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.The judge said Nadia had suffered a \u201chorrific collection of injuries\u201d.This included more than 70 surface injuries and eight rib fractures, which he said could only have been caused by \u201ca significant degree of destructive force\u201d.She also had a fractured collarbone, fractures of the pelvis, a fractured skull, liver and bowel lacerations and a perforated bowel.He said these injuries would have been caused by \u201cheavy blunt impacts\u201d.The judge said prosecution experts had concluded \u201cshe was repeatedly assaulted, that these injuries would have caused her obvious pain and distress and any half-observant parent would have known that\u201d.The judge also said that Mr Wahab now seeks to retract his guilty plea.\n\nShe completely failed Nadia and for that she must be punishedMr Justice O'HaraHe said: \u201cWhat he admitted to is entirely consistent with the overwhelming evidence against him.\u201cIt is distressing and rather pathetic that he now seeks to disavow his guilty pleas.\u201dThe judge continued: \u201cWhat Mr Wahab did to Nadia was brutal, merciless and outrageous.\u201cThe contrast with his untouched son, who was then only two years old, is dramatic and shocking.\u201cI do not believe in any way that Nadia\u2019s injuries relate to her being clumsy or accident prone.\u201cThey are all explained and only explained by a sustained cruelty which his wife knew about and allowed to happen and continue to happen.\u201dMr Wahab had already been given an automatic life sentence but was told he could not be considered for release for 22 years.He was given concurrent sentences for the two GBH offences.Turning to Mrs Wahab, Mr Justice O\u2019Hara said: \u201cI do not accept for a second that she did not know that Nadia was being repeatedly attacked and beaten by her husband.\u201dThe judge continued: \u201cThe unavoidable truth for every parent or adult is that we have an absolute duty to protect children from harm.\u201cMrs Wahab brought Nadia into this world but did not do that.\u201cShe completely failed Nadia and for that she must be punished.\u201dShe was sentenced to 11 years, with half to be served in custody.Public Prosecution Service assistant director Ciaran McQuillan said it had been a \u201cdeeply distressing case\u201d.He added: \u201cBoth defendants maintained throughout the case until close to trial that Nadia was injured accidently.RecommendedStrike disruption warning for cycling world championshipsIrish government \u2018has duty to take legal action against UK over legacy Bill\u2019Man arrested after two people stabbed at hospital\u201cThis, the prosecution argued, was clearly a lie given the sheer number and magnitude of the injuries.\u201cEvery murder is abhorrent, but this was an especially sickening and brutal murder of a young child.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931b9c51ac3318ab2d236d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uk-government-livingston-government-french-boris-johnson-b2361586.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Axed Covid vaccine contract cost taxpayers \u00a3358m", "lead": "The UK Government pulled out of the deal with French firm Valneva in 2021.", "author": "Paul Cargill", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:56:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:47:40.939990", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T14:56:16+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/12/f6139db3322106d777ce9686a190433fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDMzMTU3-2.71021540.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It turns on the interpretation of what are ordinary words in their particular legislative contextHarriet Townsend, representing Surrey County Council Ms Finch has already lost fights in lower courts \u2013 a High Court judge ruled against her, and three Court of Appeal judges dismissed an appeal by a two-to-one majority.Ms Finch, who now lives in Exeter, Devon, says council bosses had failed to assess \u201cthe indirect greenhouse gas impacts\u201d and did not take into account environmental protection objectives.Council bosses, who gave Horse Hill Developments permission to extend drilling at Horse Hill, dispute Ms Finch\u2019s claim.Lawyers representing the council say Ms Finch\u2019s approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements is \u201cmisguided\u201d.Justices were told that an \u201cenvironmental impact assessment\u201d had considered the \u201cimpacts\u201d of \u201cdirect\u201d releases of greenhouse gases but did not assess the impacts of \u201cdownstream\u201d emissions.\n\nThis is a critically important legal challenge that could have significant repercussions for new fossil fuel projects, including the proposed new coal mine in

on the \u201ccorrect interpretation\u201d of the 2017 Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017.They said planning permission could only lawfully be granted in respect of developments which encompassed \u201ccertain extractive industry\u201d developments,\u00a0if\u00a0an environment impact assessment had been carried out.\u201cThe appellant\u2019s case is simple,\u201d they said.\u201cOn the plain language of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, the likely significant effects on climate of the \u2018combustion of material obtained from a development whose sole purpose is to obtain that material for combustion\u2019 are, as a matter of law, \u2018indirect effects\u2019.\u201dA barrister representing Surrey council said the case was \u201cessentially an issue of law\u201d.\u201cThis is not a climate change case,\u201d Harriet Townsend said.\u201cIt turns on the interpretation of what are ordinary words in their particular legislative context.\u201dShe said justices should dismiss the appeal.Ms Finch has also taken legal action against Horse Hill Developments and the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Michael Gove.Barrister Richard Moules, representing Mr Gove, told justices they were not being asked to make \u201cfindings about the science of climate change\u201d.\n\nSarah Finch's legal challenge could ensure that the full climate impacts of new fossil fuel developments have to be taken into account in the environmental impact assessment when planning applications are

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has said he was reassured during his time in the Cabinet Office that the UK was in a \u201cpretty strong state of preparedness\u201d for any future pandemic.And he told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry that preparations for a no-deal Brexit put the country in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond to other challenges.Mr Dowden, who was minister for the Cabinet Office from July 2019 to February 2020 and had previously worked in the department, said he had taken an interest in planning, including for a possible flu pandemic.He said: \u201cI asked for further specific briefing on that \u2013 received that briefing \u2013 and indeed, throughout my time as a minister, received further briefings, all of which were consistent with advice that we were broadly in a pretty strong state of preparedness.\u201dHugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Dowden about a 2019 memo about the National Security Council THRC (threats, hazards and resilience contingencies programmes) which suggested that work on pandemic influenza was expected to be affected by the \u201cstep-up in planning for a no-deal exit from the European Union\u201d.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMr Dowden said: \u201cWe had to ensure that we allocated resources according to where the greatest risk lay.\u201cNow, it was the case at that time that \u2018no deal\u2019 was the default position of the Government, so \u2013 and this is worth remembering the kind of frankly, apocryphal warnings that were being delivered about the consequences of no-deal Brexit, for example in relation to medicine supplies and elsewhere \u2013 it was appropriate that \u2026 we shifted the resilience function to deal with this.\u201cSecondly, it was not a permanent shift; we knew that this thing would come to an end since we had an endpoint for if we didn\u2019t reach a deal, no deal would happen.\u201dHe added that there was a \u201cflip side\u201d to the preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 known as Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 which made the UK \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for the pandemic.\n\nThere was a flip side to this, which was that the preparation, particularly through the Yellowhammer structures, made us match-fit for when ... we did have to deal with the the actual materialisation of the Covid pandemicOliver Dowden\u201cThere was a flip side to this, which was that the preparation, particularly through the Yellowhammer structures, made us match fit for when \u2026 we did have to deal with the the actual materialisation of the Covid pandemic \u2013 that is to say it forced Government departments to work together closely, so there\u2019s a lot more cross-government co-ordination.\u201dHe said around 15,000 extra staff had been employed for work on Brexit \u201cwho then were able to be redeployed once the threat of no deal had passed in order to further step up our preparedness, to contribute to our Covid response\u201d.Asked if the preparations had an impact on the majority of work programmes to deal with a flu pandemic, Mr Dowden said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually, I didn\u2019t fully accept that.\u201cThe core responsibilities that certainly I had respect for in Cabinet Office, in terms of our areas under the pandemic flu preparedness continued \u2013 namely the excess deaths work and the work in respect of pandemic flu Bill drafting, both of which then, subsequently, the learnings from that we used when the Covid crisis hit us.\u201cIt was also the case that there was this constant flexing that that happened, and, when one takes it in the round, in terms of how it essentially tested our ability to work together.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s countless other examples of that. So, for example, the battle rhythm of having these daily \u2018exos\u2019, the fact that we had realtime data coming in and going out again, all of those things actually put us in a strong position.\u201cThe advice that I received was the the core stuff that we had to do was continuing, but in line with a normal reprioritisation that happens; for example, when Salisbury hit there was a reprioritisation \u2013 there is always a flex, if we didn\u2019t have that flex we would not be in such a strong position to respond to challenges as they hit the Government.\u201d\n\nI think operation preparedness is another matter.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEurostar could soon face competition running international rail services through the channel tunnel, under plans being worked up by the government. Rail minister Huw Merriman said on Wednesday that the government would set out steps to encourage other companies to run services to the continent in a bid to drive down ticket prices.Ministers are hoping to emulate the effects of competition on the east coast mainline, where challenger operators like Lumo have driven down fares while increasing ridership.Mr Merriman said High Speed One, the rail link to the channel tunnel, had plenty of spare capacity and that the Department for Transport was having \u201cconversations\u201d about how to use it more effectively.This could include changes to the contract to run the line, he hinted.RecommendedHow Eurostar trains were built to link Manchester to Paris \u2013 and why they never ranRishi Sunak finally gives his verdict on Boris Johnson\u2019s Partygate liesEpstein was \u2018particularly close\u2019 to Peter Mandelson, says reportBut previous attempts by non-Eurostar operators to run services through the tunnel have failed to get off the ground, stymied by the UK's strict border rules and the complexity of using the undersea tunnel.The minister told the transport select committee competition would be \u201ckey\u201d for getting fares down on international services.\u201cThe only way we're actually going to bring prices down, get more people on, it's getting more operators on there. And I think that's my ambition for it,\u201d he said.\u201cThat will actually come into conversations about how we see the actual High Speed 1 infrastructure used as well, because there's a lot more space there that we'd actually like to see used.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe difficulty is it's not just down to this country because obviously it's a route that goes abroad, but we are looking to set out some steps as to what we actually see is possible with that line, because there was a lot more space on it. Huw Merriman, the rail minister, appearing at the transport select committee (UK Parliament)\u201cThat will come into conversations about the existing contract of that line as well. So it's something that we're working on.\u201dAn increase in competition running services through the tunnel would come at a difficult time for Eurostar, whose finances have also already taken a double beating from the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.The cross-channel operator did not benefit from the same Covid-19 bailout as other UK train companies and did not receive the same help as airlines \u2013 forcing it to take out loans at commercial rates, which it is now paying back.It has also been forced to run services with some seats empty because new Brexit border bureaucracy has restricted its ability to process passengers through passport control fast enough to fill trains. As a result the train company has mothballed suburban stations in Ashford and Ebbsfleet and cancelled a longstanding direct service from London to Disneyland Paris. The company has increased ticket prices and says it is focusing on its core routes while it pays down the debt.One likely barrier to running competing services is the physical capacity constraint at St Pancras station, which limits Eurostar\u2019s ability to run more services in the first place. It is not clear how competition could circumvent this limitation.Speaking at the same hearing Mr Merriman rejected emulating France's ban on domestic flights for routes possible by train in under two-and-a-half hours. \u201cIf you bring a policy in like that, then it means that the costs of trains can end up going up even more, because you haven't got the competition from flights,\u201d Mr Merriman said.\n\nUK news in picturesShow all 501/50UK news in pictures\n\nUK news in pictures20 June 2023The sunrises at 04.25am at St Mary\u2019s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, on the North East coast

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn environmental campaigner is staging a Supreme Court fight after objecting to the extension of oil drilling near Gatwick and raising concerns about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.Sarah Finch, 59, has challenged Surrey County Council\u2019s decision to allow a well about six miles from where she used to live in Redhill, Surrey, to be retained and expanded by Horse Hill Developments.She has already lost fights in lower courts \u2013 a High Court judge ruled against her, and three Court of Appeal judges dismissed an appeal by a two-to-one majority.Friends of the Earth has backed Ms Finch, who brought the challenge on behalf of the Weald Action Group and says the case could have widespread implications.Five Supreme Court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began considering arguments at a Supreme Court hearing in London on Wednesday.The hearing is due to end on Thursday.Ms Finch, who now lives in Exeter, Devon, says council bosses failed to assess \u201cthe indirect greenhouse gas impacts\u201d and did not take into account environmental protection objectives.Council bosses, who gave Horse Hill Developments permission to extend drilling at Horse Hill, dispute Ms Finch\u2019s claim.Lawyers representing the council say Ms Finch\u2019s approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements is \u201cmisguided\u201d.\n\nThe amount of oil to be produced over the lifetime of the development is not known, but it was agreed by the parties that: the development could in theory produce up to about 3.3 million tonnes of crude oil over the 20-year production period ...Marc Willers KC and Estelle Dehon KC Justices were told that an \u201cenvironmental impact assessment\u201d had considered the \u201cimpacts\u201d of \u201cdirect\u201d releases of greenhouse gases but did not assess the impacts of \u201cdownstream\u201d emissions.Barristers representing Ms Finch told justices that her case was \u201csimple\u201d.Marc Willers KC\u00a0and Estelle Dehon\u00a0KC said the appeal concerned the \u201cclimate impact of fossil fuel development\u201d and turned on the \u201ccorrect interpretation\u201d of the 2017 Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017.They said planning permission could lawfully be granted in respect of developments which encompassed \u201ccertain extractive industry\u201d developments, \u201cunless an environment impact assessment\u201d had been carried out in respect of that development.\u201cIn this case, Horse Hill Developments Ltd sought planning permission from the council for the large-scale production of fossil fuel (predominantly oil for sale and use as fuel in transportation), on land at Horse Hill, Surrey, for a period of 20 years and certainly beyond the year 2040,\u201d they said, in a written case outline.\u201cThe amount of oil to be produced over the lifetime of the development is not known, but it was agreed by the parties that: the development could in theory produce up to about 3.3 million tonnes of crude oil over the 20-year production period \u2026 \u201dThey added: \u201cThe appellant\u2019s case is simple: on the plain language of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, the likely significant effects on climate of the \u2018combustion of material obtained from a development whose sole purpose is to obtain that material for combustion\u2019 are, as a matter of law, \u2018indirect effects\u2019 \u2026\u201cAccordingly, where, as in this case, planning permission is sought for the extraction of oil for commercial production, such that greenhouse gas emissions will unavoidably result from the inevitable use of the refined oil via combustion, a plain language interpretation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations means it is unlawful for a relevant planning authority to grant planning permission without the benefit of an assessment of the nature and magnitude of the greenhouse gas emissions which would be caused by the combustion of the oil.\u201d\n\nIt is common ground that the question is one of statutory construction. The court is not required to make any findings about the science of climate changeRichard Moules, representing Secretary of State Michael GoveThey said the Court of Appeal was \u201cwrong to find otherwise\u201d.Ms Finch has also taken legal action against Horse Hill Developments and Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.Barrister Richard Moules, representing Mr Gove, told justices they were not being asked to make \u201cfindings about the science of climate change\u201d.He said the issue was whether the downstream greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from the eventual combustion of the refined end products produced from the oil originating from the development, were \u201cindirect effects of the development\u201d which had to be assessed.\u201cIt is common ground that the question is one of statutory construction,\u201d he said in a written case outline.\u201cThe court is not required to make any findings about the science of climate change.\u201dHe said the \u201curgent imperative to address climate change\u201d was the \u201cbasis for legislation\u201d.Ms Finch had said outside court: \u201cThe biggest climate impact from this project will occur when the oil is eventually burned.\u201cIf councils can ignore these \u2018downstream\u2019 impacts when making planning decisions, then we have no hope of staying within safe climate limits.\u201cThe present lack of clarity over environmental impact assessments is dangerous.\u201cI hope that the Supreme Court will confirm that no fossil fuel development \u2013 coal, oil or gas \u2013 should be allowed without consideration of its full climate impact.\u201dSolicitor Rowan Smith had said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of this case.\u201cThe Supreme Court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted.\u201cThere is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.\u201dFriends of the Earth said the case might have implications for a planned coal mine on the outskirts of Whitehaven, Cumbria.\u201cThis is a critically important legal challenge that could have significant repercussions for new fossil fuel projects, including the proposed new coal mine in Cumbria,\u201d said Friends of the Earth lawyer Katie de Kauwe.\u201cSarah Finch\u2019s legal challenge could ensure that the full climate impacts of new fossil fuel developments have to be taken into account in the environmental impact assessment when planning applications are considered.\u201cWe\u2019re in a climate crisis and it\u2019s absurd that this is not happening already.\u201dLocal campaign groups echoed Friends of the Earth\u2019s sentiments.A spokeswoman for the Horse Hill Protection Group said: \u201cHorse Hill matters, not just for the local community but for people and ecosystems everywhere affected by extraction and by climate breakdown.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931ba251ac3318ab2d2382", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/australia-dover-dna-test-kent-bali-b2361638.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Long-lost sisters united after 60 years \u2018slotted together like jigsaw puzzle\u2019", "lead": "Two sisters unknown to each other for more than 60 years finally connect after surprise DNA test.", "author": "Anahita Hossein-Pour", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:17:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:47:46.557375", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:17:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/14/21111804-c3b7f7a6-99b7-4dea-afdf-79fae566998d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

These negotiations are going nowhere and are forcing council workers to face soaring inflation without the pay increase they deserve.\u201cGMB Scotland has been clear: our members need an improved offer which can only be achieved through the intervention of Scottish Government. Otherwise, strike action is inevitable and any disruption to this global event will only further highlight the importance of the local government workforce.\u201dThe GMB Scotland ballot will be posted out to members working in parking and at the velodrome on Monday June 26.Unison Scotland head of local government Johanna Baxter said: \u201cNo-one wants to disrupt the World Cycling Championships. Local government workers have been working hard preparing for the event.\u201cHowever, local government workers in Scotland have suffered over a decade of pay cuts and, along with the rest of the country, are living with the cost-of-living crisis.\u201cThey overwhelmingly voted to reject Cosla\u2019s pay offer and have made it clear they are willing to take strike action to secure an improved offer.\u201dThe UCI Cycling World Championships will take place from August 3 to 13.A Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: \u201cLocal government pay negotiations are conducted nationally through Cosla, not by individual councils.\u201cHowever, the council\u2019s political leadership has made it clear, as it did last year, that Glasgow supports a settlement that works for both our staff and for public services.\u201dCosla said it remains fully committed to meeting with trade unions at any time.A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u201cLocal government pay negotiations are a matter for local authorities as employers and unions \u2013 the Scottish Government has no formal role.RecommendedConsultation launched to strengthen rules allowing care home and hospital visitsIreland will consider taking interstate case if UK legacy Bill passed \u2013 VaradkarMP met with loyalists on \u2018personal\u2019 fact-finding mission\u201cDespite UK Government cuts, the Scottish Government announced further funding as part of this year\u2019s budget for councils to support a meaningful pay rise for local government workers.\u201cThe Scottish Government urges all the parties involved to work together constructively and reach an agreement which is fair for the workforce and affordable for employers.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931ba351ac3318ab2d2387", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/northern-ireland-rishi-sunak-bill-leo-varadkar-taoiseach-b2361624.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ireland will consider taking interstate case if UK legacy Bill passed \u2013 Varadkar", "lead": "The Irish premier said his government were \u2018very much against\u2019 the Bill and had \u2018made that very clear\u2019 to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.", "author": "By Grinne N.

But I don\u2019t want anyone to have to worry about visiting any more, or to face unnecessary restrictions or even bans.\u201cI have listened to campaigners, who have been so courageous in telling their stories.

If you\u2019ve experienced unjust visiting bans, please share your experience.\u201dThe department said that while the CQC has powers to clamp down on unethical visiting restrictions, the expected standard of visiting is not specifically outlined in regulations.Current guidance from Government and the NHS states that care homes and hospitals in England are expected to facilitate visits in a risk-managed way, such as through the use of face coverings in the event of an outbreak or in the reduction of the number of visitors at one time.RecommendedIreland will consider taking interstate case if UK legacy Bill passed \u2013 VaradkarMP met with loyalists on \u2018personal\u2019 fact-finding missionNoises from search area of missing deep-sea vessel \u2018a target for rescuers\u2019The consultation runs until August 16.A CQC spokesman said: \u201cIt is absolutely vital that people are able to spend time with the people that they love.

As a result, markets are now betting more heavily that the central bank will push its base rate to 5 per cent this week instead of a less severe move to 4.75, with chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying that government \u201cwill not hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank as it seeks to squeeze inflation\u201d.With these worsened expectations yet to be priced into existing mortgage deals, Moneyfacts figures showed the average rate of a two-year fixed deal had already risen to 6.19 per cent on Wednesday \u2013 up from the 6.01 figure which prompted warnings of a \u201cmortgage disaster\u201d on Monday.RecommendedInflation remains frozen on 8.7 per cent ahead of Bank decision on interest ratesRental costs now account for over 28% of earnings in decade high \u2013 reportMichael Gove says 25-year fixed rates could ease mortgage crisisKey PointsInflation remains frozen on 8.7 per cent ahead of Bank of England interest rates decisionSpeculation mounts over \u2018shock-and-awe\u2019 0.5% base rate increase tomorrowGilt yields: Cost of government borrowing hits new 15-year high, above Truss spike\u2018Hesitant\u2019 Bank of England \u2018needs to create a recession\u2019, says government adviserInflation at highest levels in 31 years, ONS chief economist warnsChancellor insists government won\u2019t be \u2018pushed off course\u2019 in goal to curb inflationShow latest update \n \n\n1687355192Thanks for following our live update, we are pausing our coverage for the afternoon. Katy Clifton21 June 2023 14:461687354515SNP claims Sunak took \u2018honesty lessons\u2019 from Boris JohnsonThe prime minister has taken his \u201chonesty lessons from Boris Johnson\u201d, the SNP has suggested.The party\u2019s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn questioned Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201ceconomic optimism\u201d over recent months.Consumer Prices Index inflation stayed at 8.7% in May, the same as in April, despite experts forecasting a fall to 8.4%.The Office for National Statistics meanwhile said the increase in food prices slowed from 19.1% in April to 18.4% in May.In the Commons, Mr Flynn said: \u201cIn February the Prime Minister told this here House that borrowing costs are back to where they should be, in March he boasted we are on track to halve inflation by the end of the year, and in May he then said economic optimism is increasing.\u201cGiven the dire economic reality of today, is it not now clear that he has taken his honesty lessons from Boris Johnson?\u201dRishi Sunak replied: \u201cHe also failed to mention that not just the Bank of England, not just the OBR, not just the OECD, but also the IMF, all of them have upgraded their growth outlook for the United Kingdom economy this year.\u201cWhilst he and others were predicting this country would enter a recession, the actions of this Government have meant that we have so far averted that, and we continue to be on track to keep reducing inflation because that is the right economic priority.\u201dCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned Mr Flynn to be a \u201clittle bit more cautious\u201d and not imply Mr Sunak had intentionally misled MPs.Jane Dalton21 June 2023 14:351687352831Sunak still on course to fulfil inflation pledge, No 10 insistsDowning Street has insisted Rishi Sunak is still on course to fulfil his pledge of halving inflation by the end of the year despite it remaining stubbornly high.The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThat remains the target.\u201dAsked if they are on track to fulfil the promise, they added: \u201cYes. Despite some of the coverage at the time [of the announcement of the pledge] this was never something that was straightforward. It was rightly an ambitious target that we remain committed to and it can only be achieved with fiscal discipline.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 14:071687351803Why is inflation so high?Today\u2019s gloomy figures show that inflation struck 8.7 per cent in May, still considerably down from the 11.1 per cent peak it hit late last year but now stagnant since April.Prices rocketed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February caused the price of energy to shoot higher, adding to pressure from supply disruption.It contributed to higher costs for firms making products or offering services, while labour costs also started to rise.Since then, higher food and drink prices are a key reason why inflation has failed to fall as fast as hoped. Olive oil, eggs and cheese are among items to see the sharpest increases over the past year.However, according to the ONS, core inflation \u2013 which excludes items such as food and energy \u2013 is also at its highest level for 31 years.

The UK had the highest growth of any G7 country in both 2021 and 2022. The eurozone is currently in recession, we are not. Is it not time we heard more good news, talking Britain up?\u201dRishi Sunak replied: \u201cHe is quite right to highlight the improvement in our economic outlook and he is right to highlight the good, positive news showing the strength in the underlying economy. I know that he joins with me in saying that our economic priority right now must be to continue to bear down on inflation.\u201cBut while we do that, we are putting the conditions in place to grow this economy. As he said, unlike the party opposite we won\u2019t talk Britain down, we will grow the country\u2019s jobs.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 13:161687348803Sunak accuses Starmer of \u2018dangerous, inflationary\u2019 policies as he is challenged on mortgage risesSpeaking at PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Rishi Sunak on mortgage rises, asking: \u201cHow is an extra \u00a32,900 a year on repayment delivering for homeowners?\u201dHe said: \u201cThe question he refuses to answer, he actually knows the answer to this question, is \u00a32,900 extra. That\u2019s the cost to the average family of the Tory mortgage penalty.\u201cNow he was warned by experts about this as long ago as autumn last year, but he either didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t believe it or didn\u2019t care because he certainly didn\u2019t do anything, and when I raised this a couple of months ago, he had the gall to stand at that despatch box and say he was delivering for homeowners. How is an extra \u00a32,900 a year on repayment delivering for homeowners?\u201dThe PM replied: \u201cPerhaps [he] could explain why interest rates are at similar levels in the US, in Canada, in Australia and New Zealand, why they\u2019re at the highest level in Europe that they\u2019ve been for two decades.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we have a plan to reduce inflation, but in contrast what do we hear from (him). He wants to borrow an extra \u00a328bn a year, that would make the situation worse .... He doesn\u2019t have many policies, but the few that he does have all have the same thing in common, they\u2019re dangerous, inflationary and working people would pay the price.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 13:001687348577Analysis | This has been Rishi Sunak\u2019s worst month as prime ministerOur columnist Andrew Grice writes:Today's worse than expected inflation figures are grim for the government and will increase the pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates tomorrow, therefore compounding the mortgage crisis. With the cost of a two-year fixed rate mortgage now above six per cent, Conservative MPs are increasingly jittery about the political impact of higher payments home buyers. The penny has dropped that the pain is going to last until the general election \u2013 whenever Rishi Sunak calls it.Sunak is not only haunted by Boris Johnson. The mortgage crisis shows he is also struggling to move on from the disastrous Liz Truss regime. Memories of that make it easier for Labour to hang the mortgage crisis round the Tories\u2019 necks rather than allow them to blame external events beyond their control like war in Ukraine.The inflation figures are another black spot in what is becoming Sunak\u2019s cruellest month as PM. They will supplant headlines about Johnson and Partygate \u2013 but only with grim economic news.This has been Rishi Sunak\u2019s worst month as prime minister | Andrew GriceDespite seeing off Boris Johnson, wave after crashing wave of economic turmoil \u2013 from mortage hikes to runaway inflation \u2013 is overwhelming any buoyancy Sunak might be feeling.

He is certainly keeping to that with his answer.\u201cHe knows very well the cause of the mortgage catastrophe - 13 years of economic failure and a Tory kamikaze budget which crashed the economy and put mortgages through the roof.\u201cSo, will the prime minister tell us how much the Tory mortgage penalty is going to cost the average homeowner?\u201dMr Sunak replied: \u201cThe honourable gentleman isn\u2019t aware of the global macroeconomic situation.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have deliberately and proactively increased the generosity of our support for the mortgage interest scheme, we have also established a new FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) ... duty which will protect people with mortgages, for example moving them onto interest-only mortgages or lengthening mortgage terms.\u201cWe have spent tens of billions of pounds supporting people with the cost of living, particularly the most vulnerable.\u201dAndy Gregory21 June 2023 12:311687346523Watch: Hunt vows to follow Tory plan to battle inflation \u2018no matter the pressure\u2019Jeremy Hunt vows to follow Tory plan to battle inflation \u2018no matter the pressure\u2019Andy Gregory21 June 2023 12:22\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a03Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64931ba751ac3318ab2d2390", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/josh-police-newhaven-sussex-police-police-officers-b2361594.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police search for mobile phone in double murder investigation", "lead": "Detectives are keen to find the white iPhone 12 owned by Chloe Bashford, who was found dead along with her husband Josh at their home in Newhaven.", "author": "Anahita Hossein-Pour", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:51:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:47:51.145657", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T11:51:45+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/13/94d39ea5bb9565e18023064f3e15e273Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDMyMjA5-2.72575119.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn obsessive man has been found guilty of suffocating a student with a face mask in a jealous rage then dumping her body in undergrowth inside a large suitcase.Muhammad Arslan, 27, forced a floral patterned mask into the mouth of 21-year-old Hina Bashir after she visited his shared flat in Ilford, east London in July last year.He claimed he had only meant to quieten her after he confronted her over naked photographs of her that he had been sent.The prosecution rejected his explanation as \u201celaborate and concocted\u201d and asserted he had killed her out of anger and jealousy.Arslan admitted manslaughter on the first day of his trial but denied murder and perverting the course of justice by concealing Ms Bashir\u2019s body.\n\nThe police also found on his phone a very large number of photographs of Hina Bashir, some of them having been \u2018photoshopped\u2019 or altered using software or appsProsecutor Gareth PattersonA jury at the Old Bailey deliberated for five hours and 20 minutes to find him guilty of the charges.Ms Bashir\u2019s family in court expressed relief as the verdicts were delivered while Arslan stood impassively in the dock with his arms crossed.The court heard how Arslan and Ms Bashir grew up in the same village in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan.From the age of 11, Ms Bashir had been befriended via text message by the then 17-year-old defendant, it was alleged.At one point, Arslan declared: \u201cHow wonderful it is that I have found my princess in the house right next to mine.\u201dMs Bashir went on to reject his advances and had a boyfriend in Pakistan and another after moving to the UK in November 2021 to study business management at Coventry University\u2019s London campus, the court heard.Within months of her arrival, Arslan had followed her, enrolling at the University of Essex for a masters degree in data science and applications and working part-time in a warehouse, jurors heard.Arslan already had masters degree in maths and quantum physics from the University of Faisalabad and had given up a job as the manager of a pharmacy to travel to the UK, jurors were told.On the evening of July 11 last year, Ms Bashir and two female friends had visited Arslan\u2019s flat to collect some belongings she had left there while moving.When Ms Bashir did not come out, her friends had to leave without her and the student was never seen alive again, jurors were told.Having killed her, Arslan put her body into a suitcase in the bedroom he shared with a friend and stored it there overnight.Arslan then spent hours trawling through her private messages and photographs on her mobile phone, the court was told.Prosecutor Gareth Patterson KC had told jurors: \u201cThe next morning, the defendant set off from his house, dragging behind him a suitcase containing Hina Bashir\u2019s dead body.\u201cHe got a lift from a taxi driver who lived in his house and travelled to an industrial estate by the M25 near Upminster, near a business where he was employed as a warehouse worker.\u201cHe got out of the taxi and dragged his suitcase to the side of a lane where he hid it in some undergrowth. He left the suitcase concealed there in the days that followed.\u201dAfter the killing, Arslan had deleted his contacts from Ms Bashir\u2019s phone, lied to police about Ms Bashir\u2019s disappearance and made inquiries about travelling to Northern Ireland and Birmingham.He initially denied involvement in her death despite the \u201cwealth of evidence\u201d, jurors heard.Ms Bashir\u2019s blood was found on Arslan bedclothes, matching floral face masks were recovered from his home and the taxi driver confirmed taking the defendant and his heavy suitcase to the industrial estate where it was dumped .CCTV footage also captured Arslan leaving his house with the suitcase and then later dragging it along the lane to where it was eventually discovered, Mr Patterson said.Arslan\u2019s DNA was also identified on the suitcase handle and soil from the deposition site was found on his shoes.An examination of his phone revealed the extent of his obsession with Ms Bashir before and after she travelled to the UK.He had repeatedly declared his love for her and reacted with shock on learning she had found someone else.Mr Patterson said: \u201cThe police also found on his phone a very large number of photographs of Hina Bashir, some of them having been \u2018photoshopped\u2019 or altered using software or apps.\u201cThey found pictures of her on which love hearts had been added and they found collages that had been created of her image. The evidence suggests that he was obsessed with her.\u201cHowever, it appears Hina Bashir did not want to be with him and in fact had a relationship after she came here with another young man.\u201dIn his evidence, Arslan claimed that he had been friends with Ms Bashir since she was 11 and romance had followed, even though they could not meet openly for cultural reasons.He admitted it was a \u201cfantasy\u201d that she was his fiancee but he still wanted to have a relationship.Following the guilty verdicts on Wednesday, Judge Richard Marks KC remanded Arslan into custody to be sentenced on Friday."}, {"_id": "64931ba851ac3318ab2d2396", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/church-of-england-kent-gender-inclusivity-b2360009.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Teacher recorded calling pupil \u2018despicable\u2019 during debate on transgender identity", "lead": "<p>TikTok recording of gender identity discussion was shared on social media </p>", "author": "Namita Singh", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:20:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:47:52.967731", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T11:20:24+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/07/GettyImages-1494604032.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn ex-deputy headteacher at Prince George and Princess Charlotte\u2019s former primary school has admitted paying thousands of pounds to teenagers to abuse younger children.Matthew Smith, 34, pleaded guilty to 18 counts of child sex abuse, including commissioning of the abuse of children in India while he lived in Nepal for five years.When the first allegations emerged around seven months ago, Smith was deputy headteacher at Thomas\u2019s prep school in Battersea High Street, south west London. Before taking up the job at the prestigious school, where the Prince and Princess of Wales had previously enrolled their older two children, he worked at a British school in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, between 2017 and July 2022.Investigators discovered last November he was sharing abuse material on the dark web.RecommendedColorado Supreme Court strikes law allowing child sex abuse lawsuits from decades pastThe Idol viewers appalled by \u2018sickening\u2019 Jeffrey Epstein jokeKimora Lee Simmons speaks out on ex-husband Russell Simmons\u2019s \u2018abusive\u2019 behaviour towards daughtersSmith was even online at the time of his arrest, speaking to a teenage boy living in India and asking him to send sexual images of a younger child, in return for money, police said.He also had dark web sites and forums open on his computer dedicated to child sexual abuse, according to the NCA.Detectives analysed chat logs and bank transactions and found Smith paid the same teenager, and another also living in India, a total of \u00a365,398 to abuse children over a five-year period.Before working at the school in Nepal, Smith spent various periods working in orphanages and NGOs across India between 2007 until 2014.He then moved back to the UK last July and began working at Thomas\u2019s prep in September, where he was a deputy head teacher and head of pastoral care. He was sacked two months later when he was charged by police.Prince George and Princess Charlotte, pictured with brother Louis and father William, had had left the school by the time Smith started work (Millie Pilkington/Kensington Pal)The chat logs showed Smith would order the young men to perform sexual acts on boys and would also send them images and videos as examples of ones he would like to see re-enacted.He also gave one of them advice on how to befriend children and build their trust in order to abuse them, police said.There is nothing to suggest he committed abuse against children based in Nepal or the UK, the NCA said.After a raid on Smith\u2018s home in East Dulwich, south east London, officers found over 120,000 indecent images of children saved on his laptop, a SD card and on his phone.Prosecutors charged him with a total of 22 offences, including encouraging the rape of a child under 13, causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, and arranging the sexual abuse of a child.At Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday he pleaded guilty to 17 counts and had admitted five counts at a previous hearing in November.Helen Dore, senior officer of the National Crime Agency, said: \u201cMatthew Smith was a high risk individual and we moved quickly to locate, arrest and remand him so he could no longer pose a threat to children.\u201cUltimately, we were able to prove that he was a prolific offender who manipulated young men to sexually abuse children on his behalf, giving them detailed instructions and financial reward.\u201cWhile conducting his offending, Smith worked at a school in Nepal, then became a deputy head teacher and head of pastoral care in the UK, so his offending is a deep betrayal of the trust placed in him.\u201dNone of the offences relate to his job at the \u00a320,000-a-year Thomas\u2019s primary school, which was attended by Prince George and Princess Charlotte until the end of the last academic year.Both royal children have now moved to Lambrook School, near Ascot in Berkshire, and had left by the time Smith started work in September.Claire Brinton, specialist prosecutor in the CPS\u2019s Organised Child Sexual Abuse Unit, branded Smith\u2018s crimes \u201cparticularly disturbing\u201d given he was a primary school teacher.She said after the hearing: \u201cMatthew Smith\u2018s crimes are particularly disturbing given his role as a primary school teacher entrusted with the responsibility of caring for and safeguarding children.\u201cThousands of images and videos were recovered from his devices which showed an appalling catalogue of sexual abuse being perpetrated on children.\u201cSmith offered individuals payments for indecent images to gratify his own sexual desires, which resulted in the horrifying abuse of young children in India.\u201cThis conviction sends a clear message that the CPS, working alongside the NCA and international partners, will work to bring to justice those who sexually abuse and exploit children, wherever that abuse takes place.\u201dBefore his role at Thomas\u2019s, Smith was assistant head teacher at the British School in Kathmandu, Nepal, for five years.He also taught at St Paul\u2019s School and has degrees from both Oxford as well as Cambridge.A spokesperson for Thomas\u2019s said in light of Smith\u2018s conviction: \u201cWe have been shocked and appalled beyond measure by this matter and are grateful for the work of the police and courts in bringing this man to account.\u201cMr Smith\u2018s employment at the school, which commenced in September 2022, was terminated with immediate effect when the school first learned of the charges against him in November.\u201cWhile the National Crime Agency has confirmed that none of the matters under investigation related to the school or its pupils, these deplorable actions constitute an unforgivable breach of trust and our thoughts are with those who have been impacted or damaged by them.\u201cAs always, we remain absolutely committed to the ongoing safety and wellbeing of our pupils and our whole school community.\u201dSmith will be sentenced at the same court next month."}, {"_id":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs experts warn of \u201cextreme volatility\u201d in the mortgages market, the current uncertainty around property payments is causing concern for many homeowners and renters.With the Bank of England repeatedly raising interest rates in response to stubborn inflation, the average rate of a two-year mortgage topped 6 per cent this week \u2013 as analysis suggests that someone seeking a \u00a3200,000 mortgage could now be asked to pay over \u00a3300 more per month than a year ago.Meanwhile, as many landlords pass on their costs to tenants, data from Zoopla suggested that rental costs now account for an average of 28.3 per cent of people\u2019s pre-tax earnings, the highest level in a decade.While the impact on sky-high house prices has so far been relatively unclear, with Land Registry data showing a 4.1 per cent year-on-year increase in the 12 months to March, some lenders have predicted that prices could fall significantly in the year ahead.Against this backdrop, The Independent has spoken to mortgage experts about their advice for first-time buyers looking to enter the property market.RecommendedMichael Gove says 25-year fixed rates could ease mortgage crisisUK \u2018hurtling into mortgage disaster\u2019 as rates near highs seen during Truss turmoilHow is the current market affecting first-time buyers?While today\u2019s is \u201cnot the easiest\u201d market for first-time buyers, \u201cnor is it the worst market we\u2019ve seen\u201d, according to Thomas Jackson, managing director for Cooper Associates Mortgages.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly harder to borrow money today. Affordability calculations are tighter. Compared to only a few months ago, first-time buyers with the same salaries and expenditure can\u2019t borrow as much,\u201d said Mr Jackson.Lenders have said they stand ready to help anyone struggling with their mortgage payments (Joe Giddens/PA)\u201cWhile it may feel very unfair, this move is in the best interests of the consumer\u201d, he added, given that some may see their expenditure continue to rise with increased interest rates and the cost of living crisis. \u201cLenders don\u2019t want to see borrowers unable to repay mortgages or need to make difficult financial decisions.\u201dHowever, on the other side of the coin, first-time buyers need less deposit than during the pandemic, Mr Jackson said, with 100 per cent products having previously been non-existent and 95 per cent products now widely available having been taken off the market.There is also \u201ca lot more choice of housing\u201d, according to Mr Jackson, who said: \u201cWe\u2019re no longer in the world of huge over-offers which we saw when the Stamp Duty holiday came into effect. There\u2019s good housing stock and there\u2019s more time to make a choice.\u201dHow are other prospective first-time buyers faring?The \u201cvolatility of the last six months to a year has been unsettling for many\u201d, said Felicity Holloway, head of mortgages at Moneybox, pointing a nearly 50 per cent rise in first-time buyers seeking their advice services over the past year.That was despite research the firm published this week by OnePoll finding that nearly six in 10 aspiring homeowners saying the inflationary crisis was making it harder to save for a deposit, with around a third of respondents now planning to buy later than originally hoped.Roughly the same proportion are now seeking to build a larger deposit, or were making compromises on the location and features of their sought property.\u2018Being able to perfectly time buying a house is impossible,\u2019 says Mr Jackson  (PA)While four in 10 of the 1,000 respondents felt their homebuying plans had gone backwards in the last six months, this was down from 68 per cent six months ago. Conversely, nearly a quarter managed to save more towards their deposit than anticipated, while one in five felt buoyed by predictions of falling house prices.\u201cIt is great to see how pragmatic first-time buyers have remained remarkably resilient, adapting to the changing market conditions and remaining optimistic as they do all they can to consistently save towards their goal,\u201d said Ms Holloway.Is now the right time to buy?\u201cBeing able to perfectly time buying a house is impossible. Even in the best market conditions, there are still risks. If you can, take the plunge and buy,\u201d said Mr Jackson, pointing to the fact that rents are also rising and can be more expensive than having a mortgage.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that there\u2019s time to renegotiate. The homebuying process takes around 12 weeks at the absolute minimum, and we know how much can change in just three short months. \u201cUntil you add legal fees to the mix, the process is relatively inexpensive. If the market begins to change before you\u2019ve exchanged, there\u2019s space for renegotiation with your vendor to ensure you are paying a fair value for your property.\u201dMs Holloway, meanwhile, urged people to seek independent expert advice, saying: \u201cWhen it comes to buying your first home, more often than not, the right time to buy is when you are ready. But it can be overwhelming trying to figure out the best options for your needs and the implications of changing market conditions.\u201dIs it worth waiting for house prices to drop?While house prices have dropped in recent months, according to the lenders such as Nationwide and Halifax, Mr Jackson warned that rapidly rising mortgage interest rates could see first-time buyers \u201cpaying more per month for a house that is reducing in price\u201d.The government has been urged this week by the Liberal Democrats to \u2018end this mortgage horror show\u2019 as the average fixed two-year rates topped 6% (Anthony Devlin/PA)\u201cBy waiting, you risk needing to take out a mortgage over a longer-term to make payments affordable and increasing how much interest you pay. In the worst-case scenario, you\u2019re no longer able to afford to buy,\u201d he said.Ms Holloway added: \u201cIf the last year has taught us anything is that it is impossible to predict the future. However, is fair to say that historically property has always proven to be a sound investment in the long term.\u201dWhat are the risks of falling house prices?While a boost to potential first-time buyers, falling house prices can bring a risk of negative equity, when the value of the property falls below the cost of the mortgage, a situation which can result in banks demanding payment to make up the difference if the property is eventually sold at a loss.Falling house prices could also pose an issue for some if they eventually come to remortgage. A signficant decrease in the value of a property could push some owners \u2013 who are left borrowing more in relation to the value of their property \u2013 into a higher loan-to-value bracket, meaning they could face paying a higher premium, according to Riz Malik at R3 Mortgages.According to Mr Jackson, there is \u201ca lot of reassurance in the market that the negative equity risk is negligible\u201d, pointing to the return of 95 per cent mortgages as \u201chighlighting lender confidence\u201d.\u201cLenders are also protecting borrowers from negative equity. Some borrowers on 100 per cent and 95 per cent mortgages are required to tie into five-year fixed terms. A part of this is if they do enter negative equity, there\u2019s time to weather the storm as the market stabilises,\u201d he said.Recommended\u2018This is going to sting\u2019: What would a mortgage crisis mean for homeowners and renters?Jeremy Hunt calls mortgage crisis summit as experts urge banks to help those strugglingBut Ms Holloway warned that, if property prices were to fall by around 10 per cent in the coming years, \u201cthose on high loan-to-value mortgages are at risk of falling into negative equity in the short to mid-term\u201d. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to keep short-term market fluctuations in perspective,\u201d she added. Buying a home is a long-term investment and so if you don\u2019t intend to or need to sell in the coming years the impact will be minimal.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bac51ac3318ab2d23a3", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-office-windrush-government-caribbean-leigh-day-b2361533.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Windrush: Almost \u00a363m paid out but hundreds of claims still in system", "lead": "As of May, 302 claims had been in the system for at least 12 months, including 154 for over 18 months.", "author": "Aine Fox", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:29:51", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:47:56.609372", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T10:29:51+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/11/70c25eb4c66de8e00188c70e48078e9dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDI4NTk4-2.70431828.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Worryingly, core inflation - which strips out volatile price items such as food and energy - increased to a 31-year high of 7.1 per cent, up from 6.8 per cent in April.May\u2019s headline figure, higher than economists had predicted earlier in the year, dashed hopes of a fall in inflation for the third consecutive month. Analysts had expected the Consumer Prices Index, which peaked at 11.1 per cent in October last year, to fall back to 8.4 per cent.But the fact the rate remained unchanged last month will add to growing concern that rising prices are becoming embedded in the economy.Are you concerned about inflation and the rising cost of mortgages?

But the problem now is that core inflation, excluding food and energy, is no longer just \u2018sticky\u2019. Instead, it is actually heading in the wrong direction. \u201cTo some extent, this is driven by temporary factors like the extra Bank Holiday and the large increase in the national minimum wage. The bigger picture, however, is that the UK is still paying for the Bank\u2019s underestimation of inflation and decision to keep monetary policy too loose for far too long.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe government should avoid kneejerk and counterproductive policies like mortgage subsidies or price controls. But they have a role in tax and regulatory reform, including fixing our broken planning system, to ease constraints on the supply side and to boost the economy\u2019s productive potential.\"The chancellor said: \u201cWe know how much high inflation hurts families and businesses across the country, and our plan to halve the rate this year is the best way we can keep costs and interest rates down.\u201cWe will not hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy while also providing targeted support with the cost of living.\u201dLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney claimed Mr Hunt \u201cjust sits on his hands\u201d and said the figures showed that the government is \u201cfailing miserably to bring inflation down\u201d.Calling for a \u00a33bn mortgage protection fund, Ms Olney said: \u201cIt beggars belief that ministers are refusing to support hard-pressed families when it\u2019s this Conservative government\u2019s catastrophic failure to run the economy that caused this crisis.\u201d\u201cThis must be the most uncaring government to ever walk into Downing Street.

Tiredness can effect your concentration, reaction time and the ability to judge risks, which are all things we we need in tip top condition if you\u2019re going to get behind the wheel.Several consecutive nights of disrupted sleep will naturally effect your energy and concentration levels, so, if you\u2019re planning on driving home then you might want to rethink.There are a number of different transport options to get you to and from Glastonbury, so why not opt for a train or bus? Not only will this mean to can enjoy your final night without worrying too much about your energy levels, it\u2019s also a boost to the environment!Recovery day Even if doing all of the above, revellers will no doubt still be worn out by the time they return home, following the long days \u2013 and nights \u2013 of adrenaline and reduced sleep.It\u2019s important to ensure you have an extra day at home to rest and recover after the event. One extra day\u2019s holiday and no plans will help get you back to normal energy levels before taking on your usual routine again.Peony Hirwani21 June 2023 13:15\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a08Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64931bae51ac3318ab2d23a8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nadine-dorries-john-nicolson-parliamentary-standards-commissioner-twitter-snp-b2360821.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MP cleared of bullying after liking tweets calling Nadine Dorries \u2018vacuous goon\u2019 - old", "lead": "An independent panel said John Nicolson had been \u2018unwise\u2019 to like the tweets, but his behaviour did not amount to bullying.", "author": "Christopher McKeon", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:28:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:47:58.013216", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T09:28:16+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/12/e830555d08004eca5ce34b783f1c60fcY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MzQ0NDgy-2.70964671.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA Labour government will be \"pragmatic\" in its dealings with the EU and rejoin neither the single market nor customs union, the shadow foreign secretary has said.Speaking at a trade conference on Wednesday David Lammy said it was \"mistaken\" to believe the next government could bring Britain back into Brussels' orbit.It comes after Keir Starmer said membership of the single market and customs union - which are required for free movement and seamless trade with the bloc -\u00a0were a \"red line\" for him.Mr Lammy told the Trade Unlocked conference that Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe was of \u201cfundamental importance to our future\u201d.But he said he would \u201cbe honest\u201d about Labour\u2019s intentions, adding: \"The next Labour government will not rejoin the EU single market or customs union.RecommendedSunak rules out any new EU trade deal that undermines Brexit freedomsTory MP broke rules over \u00a3150,000 loan from Russian businessmanWhat is the future of the Conservative Party?\"I know that disappoints some people here today.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNoises have been detected from the search area of the missing deep-sea vessel near the wreck site of the Titanic as those on board face a dwindling supply of oxygen.The submersible, named Titan, lost communication with tour operators on Sunday while about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, during a voyage to the shipwreck off the coast of Canada.Titan has five people on board, including British billionaire adventurer Hamish Harding, and on Tuesday the US Coast Guard estimated the 6.7 metres (22ft) long OceanGate Expeditions vessel had just 40 hours of oxygen left.The others on board are Shahzada Dawood, his son Suleman and OceanGate\u2019s chief executive and founder Stockton Rush, reportedly together with French submersible pilot Paul-Henry Nargeolet.The US Coast Guard on Wednesday morning said: \u201cCanadian P-3 aircraft detected underwater noises in the search area. As a result, ROV (remote operating vehicles) operations were relocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cThose ROV searches have yielded negative results but continue.\u201cAdditionally, the data from the P-3 aircraft has been shared with our U.S. Navy experts for further analysis which will be considered in future search plans.\u201dThe Explorers\u2019 Club, of which Mr Harding is a founding member, shared an upbeat message on Wednesday morning.President Richard Garriot de Cayeux said in a statement: \u201cThere is cause for hope, that based on data from the field, we understand that likely signs of life have been detected at the site.\u201cThey precisely understand the experienced personnel and tech we can help deploy\u2026 We believe they are doing everything possible with all the resources they have.\u201dMr Garriot de Cayeux said they are ready to provide the UK-based Magellan\u2019s remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that is certified to travel as deep as 6,000 metres.Meanwhile, US media outlet The Rolling Stone reported an internal US government memo said \u201cbanging\u201d was detected by Canadian search aircraft in 30-minute intervals on Wednesday.It is understood the King is being kept informed of the search efforts, as Shahzada Dawood is a long-time supporter of The Prince\u2019s Trust International and The British Asian Trust, both of which are charities founded by Charles.It comes as a former employee of OceanGate had raised concerns over \u201csafety and quality control issues regarding the Titan to OceanGate executive management\u201d, according to court filings.David Lochridge, OceanGate\u2019s former director of marine operations, claimed in the August 2018 court document he was wrongfully fired after flagging worries about the company\u2019s alleged \u201crefusal to conduct critical, non-destructive testing of the experimental design\u201d.After \u201cissues of quality control\u201d with Titan were raised, the filings say Mr Rush asked Mr Lochridge to conduct a \u201cquality inspection\u201d report on the vessel.During this process, Lochridge \u201cidentified numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns\u201d but he was allegedly \u201cmet with hostility and denial of access\u201d to necessary documents before later being fired.The document claims he became concerned about a \u201clack of non-destructive testing performed on the hull of the Titan\u201d, and that he \u201cstressed the potential danger to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths\u201d.In a November 2022 episode of his Unsung Science podcast, CBS journalist David Pogue interviewed Mr Rush ahead of going on a Titan expedition to the wreckage.In the podcast, Mr Rush told him: \u201cYou know, at some point, safety is just pure waste.\u201cI mean, if you just want to be safe, don\u2019t get out of bed, don\u2019t get in your car, don\u2019t do anything.\u201cAt some point, you\u2019re going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question.\u201cI think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules.\u201dMr Pogue also said he had signed a waiver before going on the dive which allegedly said: \u201cThe experimental submersible vessel has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body\u201d and that the trip could result in death.OceanGate has been approached for comment.On Tuesday David Mearns, a deep-sea shipwreck hunter who is friends with Mr Harding and Mr Nargeolet, said he had seen reports of \u201ctapping\u201d being heard in the water, which he said could indicate the passengers are alive.He told Channel 4 News: \u201cThere\u2019s some reports that I\u2019ve just read from my own club, which is how I know Hamish, is that somebody today has heard some tapping.\u201cNow they\u2019ve got sonar buoys out there, there may be some other hydrophones that the mothership the Polar Prince had in the water.RecommendedAlarm raised over \u2018worsening\u2019

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeQuestions remain about the impact of introducing voter identification for May\u2019s local elections, the Labour chairman of the Commons\u2019 Levelling Up committee has said.Clive Betts, who chairs the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, said the elections watchdog must reveal whether requiring voter ID discouraged people from casting their ballot.May\u2019s local elections were the first time voters in Great Britain were required to show ID before collecting their ballot paper.Passports, driving licences and blue badges were among the IDs permitted, as were the free certificates that could be applied for ahead of the vote.But the move was widely criticised amid concerns about voter disenfranchisement.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe Electoral Commission is expected to publish its initial analysis of the rollout of voter ID this month.Mr Betts told the PA News Agency: \u201cThe questions are \u2013 did it prevent or deter people from voting who otherwise would have voted? And was the impact different among different parts of the electorate?\u201cDifferent people in different circumstances, did they react differently to the restrictions that were put on them?\u201dThe committee chair added: \u201c\u201cWe are going to have the Electoral Commission give evidence and ask them questions about what they found and what they are recommending, because in the end the Electoral Commission has a responsibility to make sure voting is fair and transparent but also to make sure that people are encouraged to vote, not discouraged.\u201dFigures collected by PA from 95% of councils that held elections last month suggest nearly 34,900 people were turned away from polling stations for not having the correct identification, of which more than 21,600 returned later with the right ID and were able to vote.This leaves just over 13,200 people who did not return and who therefore did not cast a vote.Mr Betts has previously raised concerns about the methods used to alert people they needed to bring ID to cast their vote.While clerks at all polling stations were told to remind voters to show their ID, in some areas, greeters at the door also carried out the task.Mr Betts told PA: \u201cWhat the Electoral Commission said to us was they would only take the figures from those polling stations where there was no one who was pre-screened before people actually got to the clerks.\u201cThe problem with that of course is that councils tended to use pre-screening at the busiest polling stations, and they may be ones, say, in particularly built up areas with high concentrations of different types of the electorate.\u201dMr Betts said the picture in his Sheffield South East constituency had been \u201cvaried\u201d, adding: \u201cCertainly in my own constituency, many of the polling stations said virtually nobody turned up without ID.\u201cIn another, 13 women from the Pakistani community were all turned away.\u201cI think there is some evidence that perhaps people from the BME community were less aware of the need or hadn\u2019t got easy access to the particular requirements.\u201dHe also called on the Government to learn from the rollout of voter ID, and introduce more valid identification documents for younger people.The senior Labour MP said: \u201cI think it particularly applies to young people. I think the likelihood is that it could be a much bigger challenge around the general election, because we know at local elections the turnout is lower, and proportionally fewer young people vote at local elections.\u201cI think you will just see enormous problems unless you expand the voter ID potential to more forms of ID for young people at the general election.\u201dFollowing the May elections, the Electoral Commission said its initial assessment was that the polls were \u201cwell run\u201d, but it added it would carry out further work to assess the impact of voter ID.RecommendedSafety fears were raised over Titan vessel before it went missingWhat the papers say \u2013 June 21One in five women \u2018conceive naturally after having baby via fertility treatment\u2019An Electoral Commission spokesman said: \u201cWe already know from our research that the ID requirement posed a greater challenge for some groups in society, and that some people were regrettably unable to vote today as a result.\u201cIt will be essential to understand the extent of this impact, and the reasons behind it, before a final view can be taken on how the policy has worked in practice and what can be learnt for future elections.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bb451ac3318ab2d23c2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cctv-sunderland-b2361279.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man who abused seagull to be sentenced", "lead": "David Lee watched porn on his phone as he committed a sex act while holding a bird he had captured.", "author": "Tom Wilkinson", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 01:45:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:04.627870", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T01:45:08+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/02/b698cba6b96f48178daf4b46619267edY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MzYwOTg4-2.71897962.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

with tour operators on Sunday while about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, during a voyage to the shipwreck off the coast of Canada.Titan has five people on board, including British billionaire adventurer Hamish Harding, and on Tuesday the US Coast Guard estimated the 6.7 metres (22ft) long OceanGate Expeditions vessel had just 40 hours of oxygen left.The others on board are Shahzada Dawood, his son Suleman and OceanGate\u2019s chief executive and founder Stockton Rush, reportedly together with French submersible pilot Paul-Henry Nargeolet.It is understood the King is being kept informed of the search efforts, as Shahzada Dawood is a long-time supporter of The Prince\u2019s Trust International and The British Asian Trust, both of which are charities founded by Charles.RecommendedNo sign of missing Titanic tourist submarine as rescuers confirm only 40 hours of oxygen left \u2013 liveTitanic submarine: Five unanswered questions surrounding the missing deep-sea explorerElon Musk stays mum on Titanic submarine disappearance despite Starlink connectionAs the race to find the vessel intensified on Tuesday, it emerged a former employee of OceanGate had raised concerns over \u201csafety and quality control issues regarding the Titan to OceanGate executive management\u201d, according to court filings.David Lochridge, OceanGate\u2019s former director of marine operations, claimed in the August 2018 court document he was wrongfully fired after flagging worries about the company\u2019s alleged \u201crefusal to conduct critical, non-destructive testing of the experimental design\u201d.After \u201cissues of quality control\u201d with Titan were raised, the filings say Mr Rush asked Mr Lochridge to conduct a \u201cquality inspection\u201d report on the vessel.During this process, Lochridge \u201cidentified numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns\u201d but he was allegedly \u201cmet with hostility and denial of access\u201d to necessary documents before later being fired.The document claims he became concerned about a \u201clack of non-destructive testing performed on the hull of the Titan\u201d, and that he \u201cstressed the potential danger to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths\u201d.In a November 2022 episode of his Unsung Science podcast, CBS journalist David Pogue interviewed Mr Rush ahead of going on a Titan expedition to the wreckage.In the podcast, Mr Rush told him: \u201cYou know, at some point, safety is just pure waste.\u201cI mean, if you just want to be safe, don\u2019t get out of bed, don\u2019t get in your car, don\u2019t do anything.\u201cAt some point, you\u2019re going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question.\u201cI think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules.\u201dMr Pogue also said he had signed a waiver before going on the dive which allegedly said: \u201cThe experimental submersible vessel has not been

with Mr Harding and Mr Nargeolet, said he had seen reports of \u201ctapping\u201d being heard in the water, which he said could indicate the passengers are alive.He told Channel 4 News: \u201cThere\u2019s some reports that I\u2019ve just read from my own club, which is how I know Hamish, is that somebody today has heard some tapping.\u201cNow they\u2019ve got sonar buoys out there, there may be some other hydrophones that the mothership the Polar Prince had in the water.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how they could have heard that but still, they are at least trying to operate or encourage the rescue efforts to continue on and to be redoubled on the fact that they\u2019ve heard something which suggests that the men are alive in the submersible.\u201dOn Tuesday, Captain Jamie Frederick of the US Coast Guard said a \u201cunified command\u201d of multiple agencies was formed on Monday to tackle the \u201cvery complex problem\u201d of finding the missing submersible, which has so far \u201cnot yielded any results\u201d.Speaking at a press conference in Boston, Captain Frederick estimated there was \u201capproximately 40/41 hours\u201d (of oxygen left) on the vessel, which started with 96 hours of breathable air.Captain Frederick was non-committal when asked if there is any way to retrieve the submersible and save the five on board if it can be located.\u201cSo, right now all of our efforts are focused on finding the sub,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat I will tell you is we have a group of our nation\u2019s best experts in the unified command and if we get to that point, those experts will be looking at what the next course of action is.\u201dHe added: \u201cOn Sunday, the co-ordination command centre in Boston received a report from the Canadian expedition vessel Polar Prince of an overdue 21-foot submarine, Titan, with five people on board.\u201cThe Titan was attempting to dive on the wreck of the Titanic, approximately 900 miles east of Cape Cod and 400 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland.\u201cApproximately one hour and 45 minutes into the scheduled dive, the Polar Prince lost all communication with the Titan, Polar Prince conducted an initial search and then requested Coast Guard assistance.\u201cSince Sunday, the Coast Guard has co-ordinated search efforts with the US and Canadian Coast Guard, Air National Guard aircraft and the Polar Prince, which has searched a combined 7,600 square miles, an area larger than the state of Connecticut.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019

This, partnered with the increase in the number of unpaid carers reporting burnout, could have serious impacts for many people who draw on care and support.\u201cThis report shows the impact of a chronically underfunded system and the pressures councils continue to face.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe majority of school leaders who have dropped out of the Government\u2019s flagship tutoring programme, or are planning to this year, have cited funding concerns as the main reason, a report suggests.Nearly half (45%) of school leaders do not believe the National Tutoring Programme (NTP) \u2013 which aims to help pupils catch up on learning missed due to Covid-19 \u2013 is cost-effective, according to a survey.The report by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) found that 55% of the senior leaders who said that they had dropped out of the NTP already, or planned to drop out at the end of the current academic year, cited the reduced Government subsidy rate as a key factor in their decision.The Department for Education (DfE) subsidised 60% of the costs that schools incurred for delivering the NTP in the 2022/23 academic year, but this subsidy is set to reduce further in future years.The DfE originally planned to fund 25% of the cost of the NTP in the 2023/24 academic year, but last month it announced that it would increase it to 50%.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\n\nSchool leaders mostly believe the NTP is helping disadvantaged pupils, but many feel this support comes at too high a cost in terms of finances and administrationBen Styles, NFER\u2019s head of classroom practice and workforceThe survey, of 439 senior school leaders in England between March 10-15, suggests that 76% of those currently using the NTP believe that it is improving the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils.But only 9% of senior leaders currently using the NTP reported that they could continue delivering the same amount of tutoring to disadvantaged pupils when the NTP subsidy decreases to zero.\u201cThis indicates that the reducing subsidies are likely to continue to deter schools from providing NTP tuition to pupils and potentially that the subsidies have reduced too rapidly for tutoring to have become embedded in schools,\u201d the report suggests.The top reasons given by senior leaders for dropping out of the NTP were the reduced subsidy (55%) and annual funding arrangements for the programme making it difficult for them to forward plan (35%).Other factors listed included difficulties sourcing suitable tutors (28%) and the administrative burden required to access the funding was too high (27%).\u201cThe funding arrangements for the NTP are having a significant impact on both the take up of and drop out from the programme and reducing its sustainability,\u201d the report says.But it acknowledges that some views may have now changed as the survey was carried out before the Government announced that the NTP subsidy for 2023-24 would be 50% instead of 25%.\n\nIf the government are serious about making this work, they need to signal that they will invest in tutoring properly and for the long termJames Bowen, assistant general secretary of NAHTThe NFER is calling on the Government to explore how additional financial support can be made available to schools over a longer period to allow tutoring to become embedded in schools.Ben Styles, NFER\u2019s head of classroom practice and workforce, said: \u201cSchool leaders mostly believe the NTP is helping disadvantaged pupils, but many feel this support comes at too high a cost in terms of finances and administration.\u201cTutoring is not yet embedded in schools. Long-term financial support is needed alongside reductions to the administrative burden on staff.\u201cLeaders would also benefit from much more notice on changes to funding arrangements, so they can forward plan and budget properly.\u201cOvercoming these barriers is vital if tutoring is to win the hearts and minds of schools and be seen as a sustainable way of helping to close the attainment disadvantage gap.\u201dGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \u201cAs the Government intends to reduce the subsidy next academic year \u2013 even though by less than it initially planned \u2013 the programme will obviously become unaffordable for an increasing number of schools.\u201dJames Bowen, assistant general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cAs this report shows, the vast majority of schools dropping out of the NTP do so for financial reasons.\u201cIf the Government are serious about making this work, they need to signal that they will invest in tutoring properly and for the long term.\u201dA Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said: \u201cAs this report shows, our National Tutoring Programme is helping those pupils most in need of support, with over three million courses started to date.RecommendedShowers forecast across UK as festival-goers begin to arrive at GlastonburyStem cell transplant \u2018only chance\u2019 for eight-year-old with blood cancerThousands of mental health patients travel more than 60 miles for treatment\u201cSince the evidence from this survey was collected in March, we have announced that the subsidy will increase from 25% to 50% next year, having listened to feedback from schools.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere has been a significant rise in the number of teenage girls diagnosed with eating disorders in recent years, academics have warned.Experts also sounded the alarm over an increase in rates of self-harm among teenage girls.With more girls diagnosed in wealthier neighbourhoods, eating disorder experts said there could be a \u201cpostcode lottery of care\u201d, with those in more deprived communities unable to access the support they need.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in eating disorder diagnoses and self-harm episodes amongst teenage girls during the pandemic are likely to be complexDr Pearl Mok The new study, published in the Lancet Child And Adolescent Health journal, saw experts examine UK GP records for children and young people aged 10 to 24 between 2010 and 2024.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe researchers from the University of Manchester, Keele University, University of Exeter and mental health research charity The McPin Foundation looked at anonymised GP health records of over nine million patients from 1,881 general practices in the UK.Since March 2020, when the pandemic hit, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia were 42% higher than would be expected for teenage girls aged 13-16, and 32% higher for those aged 17-19, they found.The number of cases of self-harm was 38% higher than expected among girls aged 13 to 16.No increase in self-harm was observed among boys or girls of other ages.The researchers said they did not identify a rise in reported eating disorders among boys.But the charity Beat said it had seen \u201csignificant increases\u201d in contacts from young men.And it said the overall figures were \u201cnot surprising\u201d after the charity had a 300% increase in calls to its helpline during the pandemic.The charity also raised concerns over inequitable access to care for patients, with children from wealthier backgrounds more likely to be diagnosed.Even before Covid, a diagnosis of an eating disorder was more common among girls from affluent backgrounds.But after the crisis, the gap rose even further with those in wealthy communities seeing a 52% higher rate of diagnosis compared to previous trends, while those from poorer backgrounds had a 22% rise in cases.Lead author Dr Pearl Mok, from the University of Manchester, said: \u201cThe reasons for the increase in eating disorder diagnoses and self-harm episodes amongst teenage girls during the pandemic are likely to be complex and could be due to a mixture of issues such as social isolation, anxiety resulting from changing routines, disruption in education, unhealthy social media influences, and increased clinical awareness.\u201cOur study is large but episodes of self-harm that were not treated by health services were not captured in our data, so the rise in self-harm incidence might have been even greater than we observed. However, it is also possible that cases of self-harm not coming to the attention of services may have exhibited a different pattern.\u201cWe found that the increase in eating disorders and self-harm was greater in less deprived than in more deprived areas. This may reflect differences in service provision and challenges in accessing clinical care, rather than greater increases in risks for self-harm and eating disorders during the pandemic amongst those living in the least than in the most deprived communities.\u201dCommenting on the study, Tom Quinn, director of external affairs at eating disorder charity Beat, said: \u201cThese figures are shocking but sadly not surprising; during the height of the pandemic we saw demand for our helpline services spike by 300% and it is still remaining high.\u201cWe also know that the NHS is treating more children and young people than ever before, with healthcare professionals under huge amounts of strain.\u201cIt is surprising that there has been no increase in diagnoses in young men, as we have seen significant increases in contact and the latest NHS data shows more demand in both young men and women.\n\nIt is deeply concerning to see such an increase in the number of young women experiencing eating disorders, and facing a postcode lottery when it comes to treatmentGemma Byrne, of mental health charity Mind\u201cThis much-needed research has also raised some pertinent questions around care inequality.\u201cThe rise in diagnoses in less deprived areas cannot be attributed to any one cause, but in general people in those areas will have easier access to primary care, making it more likely that eating disorders will be spotted earlier. We know there is still a postcode lottery and these gaps must be addressed so that everyone can get the help they need as quickly as possible.\u201dGemma Byrne, policy and campaigns manager at mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning to see such an increase in the number of young women experiencing eating disorders, and facing a postcode lottery when it comes to treatment.\u201cAcross the board, from community to acute care, the services are struggling to keep pace with a nation in the grip of a mental health crisis.\u201cYoung people with mental health problems are bearing the brunt of years of under-investment.\u201cThe mental health care system needs a complete overhaul to deal with the level of demand services are facing.\u201dRecommendedWhat we know about the missing Titan submersible and those on boardLabour to force vote on reviving animal welfare BillSunak to pledge \u00a32.35 billion in loan guarantees at Ukraine Recovery ConferenceA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the devastating impact eating disorders can have on an individual and family\u2019s life, which is why we\u2019re investing an additional \u00a32.3 billion a year in NHS mental health services by March 2024, so more adults, children and young people in England can receive appropriate treatment.\u201cCapacity at children and young people\u2019s community eating disorder services is also being increased across the country thanks to an additional government investment of up to \u00a354 million a year by March 2024.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bb751ac3318ab2d23cd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/france-protest-police-violence-group-b2361587.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "France shuts down climate activism group \u2013 claiming it provoked violence", "lead": "<p>Les Soulevements de la Terre say they will fight the decree in court </p>", "author": "Juliette Jabkhiro", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:04:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:07.511885", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T12:04:56+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/12/Gerald-Darmanin.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn attorney for 16 young plaintiffs urged a judge on Tuesday to strike down as unconstitutional a Montana law that prohibits state agencies from considering environmental effects when it weighs permits allowing the release of greenhouse gases.Attorney Nate Bellinger made the plea in his closing argument at the end of a seven-day trial. Plaintiffs say state officials violated their right to a clean and healthful environment, part of the Montana Constitution, by allowing companies to build power plants and expand coal mines, among other things.\u201cLike other monumental constitutional cases before, the state of Montana comes before this court because of a pervasive systemic infringement of rights,\u201d Bellinger said.

Native Americans said climate change affects their ceremonies and traditional food sources, and climate experts warned the window to address the environmental damage is rapidly closing.Montana Assistant Attorney General Michael Russell said on Tuesday that the climate change issue is much larger than Montana can address on its own and that the Legislature had the right to enact the law that limits greenhouse gas reviewsHe said that the calls by plaintiffs to take the lead in addressing climate change was a social statement, not a legal argument.A ruling from state District Judge Kathy Seeley is expected sometime after the parties file their proposed findings in the case, which are due in early July.If Seeley sides with the plaintiffs and declares the state law unconstitutional, it would be up to the Republican-led legislative and executive branches of Montana government to respond. Representatives of Governor Greg Gianforte's administration indicated during the trial that there is no basis under state law for rejecting permits for projects, even if their climate impacts are disclosed.That means a ruling for plaintiffs could increase political pressure on state officials, but it would not have any immediate consequences, said James Huffman, a former professor and dean emeritus at Lewis & Clark Law School who is now living in Montana.\u201cRepublicans in Montana seem pretty fixed in their ways, and I don\u2019t think a decision by this district court is going to change the way that they think about these issues,\u201d Huffman saidA decision against the state also could establish new legal precedent and add to the small number of rulings that have established a government duty to protect citizens from climate change. However, only a handful of states \u2013 including Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts \u2014 have similar environmental protections in their constitutions.Emily Flower, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Austin Knudsen, described the trial as a \u201cpublicity stunt staged by an out-of-state organization that is exploiting well-intentioned children.\u201dThe plaintiffs were represented by attorneys for Our Children\u2019s Trust, an Oregon environmental group that has filed similar lawsuits in every state since 2011 and raised more than $20 million in contributions.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA severe marine heatwave declared around the UK and Ireland has shocked scientists as it poses a major threat to sea life and the entire ecosystem. As the UK witnessed its warmest June in decades, the waters around the country are also smashing records. Large swathes of sea area off the coast of England are up by 5C above usual. This marine heatwave has been categorised as category five, considered \u201cbeyond extreme\u201d west of Ireland, while areas off the UK coast are under \u201ccategory four\u201d, considered \u201cextreme\u201d, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The warmest waters were observed off the UK\u2019s east coast, spanning from Durham to Aberdeen, as well as off the west coast of Ireland. Water temperatures in Seaham were recorded at 15C on Sunday, well above the average of 12C for this time of year. Some parts of the UK coast are even approaching 20C.RecommendedGlobal ocean temperatures hit record level for April and MayThousands of dead fish wash up in Texas after overheated water chokes them of oxygen\u2018Nowhere on Earth to escape\u2019: World breached 1.5C limit temporarily in hottest June on recordWhile the temperatures around the UK are the warmest, the heatwave area extends across a 4,000-mile-long stretch, all the way from the coastal waters off West Africa to those just south of Iceland.Colin McCarthy, the founder of US Stormwatch, called it \u201cone of the most extreme marine heatwave events ever recorded in modern history\u201d.The extreme temperatures come as global sea surface temperatures reached the highest on record for April and May, with scientists raising the alarm over unusually high temperatures in the North Atlantic. The Arctic is experiencing the most rapidly rising number of marine heatwaves than anywhere else and many polar species are being replaced by others that have grown to live in warmer conditions, causing major changes in the ecosystem, scientists said.Earlier this week, temperatures were found to be 1C warmer than average. \u201cWe have not seen the North Atlantic look like this in modern records,\u201d said Scott Dunkan, a Scottish meteorologist.Experts attribute this unusual warming of the ocean temperatures to a combination of factors \u2013 an underpinning of the climate crisis combined with natural variations within the climate system.\u201cThe extreme and unprecedented temperatures show the power of the combination of human induced warming and natural climate variability like El Nino,\u201d said Daniela Schmidt, professor of earth sciences at the University of Bristol.\u201cWhile marine heatwaves are found in warmer seas like the Mediterranean, such anomalous temperatures in this part of the North Atlantic are unheard of.\u201dThe Met Office has warned of further challenges ahead as the eastern tropical Pacific continues to warm due to the emerging El Ni\u00f1o, the phenomenon associated with rising ocean temperatures in the Pacific that brings major changes to the world\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet how long this UK event will last, but we would expect our marine ecosystems to not escape unscathed.\u201d Professor Yueng-Djern Lenn of Bangor UniversityWith this ongoing trend, it is highly likely that global sea-surface temperatures will continue to push new boundaries this year, the forecaster said.Heatwaves of all sorts, terrestrial and marine, are going to increase with a changing climate and rising global temperatures, said scientists.Piers Foster, professor of climate physics at the University of Leeds said oceans are being hit by a \u201ca quadruple whammy\u201d.\u201cThese high temperatures are mainly driven by unprecedented high rates of human-induced warming,\u201d he said. \u201cCleaning up sulphur from marine shipping fuels is probably adding to the greenhouse gas driven warming. The shift towards El Ni\u00f1o conditions is also adding to the heat. There is also evidence that there is less Saharan dust over the ocean this year. This normally reflects heat away from the ocean.\u201d\u201cSo in all, oceans are being hit by a quadruple whammy \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of things to come.\u201dMap of global ocean temperatures by NOAA shows water around the UK hitting category 5 marine heatwave (NOAA)Scientists also warned that the effects of prolonged heatwaves, which persist longer than their inland counterparts due to the slower cooling of water compared to air, can be highly destructive.Marine heatwaves can lead to mass killings of fish and other sea life, and create favourable conditions for storms to last longer. \u201cThere is no escape from the heat for sea creatures \u2013 they can\u2019t turn on air conditioners \u2013 and this can exert heat stress on their bodies that can lead to death,\u201d said Bangor University professor Yueng-Djern Lenn.\u201cIn the case of coral reefs, marine heatwaves increase the risk of coral bleaching where they lose their colourful symbiotic zooxanthallae,\u201d he said.Figure shows classification of marine heatwaves (NOAA)Marine heatwaves around the world have earlier killed millions of fish and seabirds off New Zealand, whittling their population. They were also responsible for coral reef bleaching and its long-term loss in tropical seas. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet how long this UK event will last, but we would expect our marine ecosystems to not escape unscathed,\u201d Mr Lenn said. \u201cAnd if there isn\u2019t enough of a break between such events, allowing the ecosystems time to recover, the only winners will be the open ocean swimmers in the short term.\u201dOver the past 50 years, the global frequency of marine heatwaves has doubled, revealed research. A 2019 study found that by 2050, three fourths of the year will have marine heatwave days globally and by 2100, this will be nearly every day, making for \u201cpermanent\u201d marine heatwaves.Around 93 per cent of the extra heat caused by the greenhouse effect goes into the sea. Scientists said ocean warming and increased frequency of damaging marine heatwaves is inevitable as the Earth continues to warm. \u201cThis [warming] highlights how the continuous warming of the Earth due to greenhouse gas emissions creates the background for extreme events,\u201d said Dr Ali Mashayek, associate professor of climate dynamics at University of Cambridge. RecommendedWhen will the UK heatwave end? Met Office gives fresh updateWhat is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?When it comes to climate change and tornadoes, mysteries remain\u201cWhen the entire system is heating up, positive anomalies [warming due to natural climate variability] can add up to the background warming to result in unprecedented warming,\u201d he said.Without human-induced warming, such events would not be \u201cas extreme\u201d as they currently are, he said.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFirst the romance, then the new reality. N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s eight years in England were bookended by two phenomena, two dramatic shifts in the footballing world. In his debut season, came Leicester\u2019s improbable Premier League win, powered by Kante, destined to be a one-off. As he goes, it is to Saudi Arabia, to Al Ittihad, to a project that has greater funds and may have more longevity. Kante, the footballer who famously drove a Mini, will get a supersized salary, reportedly \u00a386m. Selfless running has proved to be a profitable business.That it came in the same summer Leicester were relegated is a coincidence. Yet an era has ended: the three catalysts for English football\u2019s greatest fairytale may not play in the Premier League again, with Jamie Vardy going down with the Foxes and Riyad Mahrez perhaps destined to join Kante in Saudi Arabia. A new force in the global game now is in the Middle East, not the East Midlands.Kante goes as Leicester and Chelsea\u2019s likeable legend, the unassuming and perhaps inimitable \u2013 though maybe Moises Caicedo will be charged with emulating him at Stamford Bridge \u2013 architect of unexpected triumphs. If xG has been a factor in football in recent years, so has \u2018NG\u2019; the latter was a way of confounding predictions.It says something that winning the World Cup may not rank in Kante\u2019s top three achievements; not given the context, anyway, because France were at least among the favourites in 2018. Their prowess, however, relied upon a recurring theme in Kante\u2019s career: his ability to do the work of two men, which in turn released Paul Pogba to adopt a more attacking brief.Kante became a hugely popular figure at Chelsea (PA )RecommendedJose Mourinho gets four-game ban for Anthony Taylor abuse at Europa League finalJose Mourinho hit by Uefa punishment for abusing referee Anthony Taylor Man Utd see \u00a350m bid rejected for Mason Mount as Chelsea set asking priceBut the Kante hat-trick consisted of his back-to-back Premier Leagues, with Leicester and Chelsea, who had finished 14th and 10th respectively the previous seasons, and then the 2021 Champions League. Arguably, he was the outstanding player in each competition. In 2015-16, the individual honours went to Vardy and Mahrez, before Kante was named both PFA Player of the Year and Footballer of the Year the following season. Aided by Italy\u2019s triumph at Euro 2020, Jorginho won Uefa\u2019s Player of the Year for 2020-21; it is no slight on the regista to say he was not even the best player in Chelsea\u2019s midfield. Kante, man of the match in the final and both legs of the semi-final, was the small man who doubled up as a big-game player, and not merely because a disproportionate share of his few goals came against Chelsea\u2019s peers.Chelsea won the Champions League by conceding two goals in seven knockout games. Thomas Tuchel branded Kante \u201cour Salah, our Van Dijk, our De Bruyne\u201d. He was right: Chelsea\u2019s X-factor footballer was a runner who was playing in France\u2019s third tier when he turned 22. Kante\u2019s defining attributes seemed prosaic: running \u2013 he could cover 13km in a game \u2013 tackling and intercepting, which he did more than virtually anyone else. But he felt flawless: the king of tackles was never sent off for either Chelsea or Leicester. And his brilliance was illustrated by his uniqueness: as others sought their own Kante, players who had similar statistics for regaining possession, such as Idrissa Gueye and Wilfred Ndidi, were acquired, but no one else had the full package.Instructive as Tuchel\u2019s tribute was, it was not the most pertinent praise of Kante. That came from the man who brought him to England, Steve Walsh, who took to whispering \u201cKante\u201d to a sceptical Claudio Ranieri when their paths crossed in corridors and in ultimately successful attempts to persuade the manager to sign him. A year later, with Leicester champions, Walsh reflected that City played three in the heart of midfield in their seemingly anachronistic 4-4-2 formation: \u201c[Danny] Drinkwater in the middle with Kante either side\u201d.Kante was Leicester's most crucial player in their title-winning campaign  (Getty)And Kante, with his extraordinary energy, held back trends in tactics. There was a sense that teams with him had 12 men. A central-midfield trio tends to be a prerequisite at elite level these days: unless, that is, one of a duo is Kante, covering the ground of two men, compensating for the times he was actually outnumbered. The last two teams to win the Premier League with a central-midfield duo are Leicester and Chelsea; the first as a low-possession team, the second sometimes with the immobile Cesc Fabregas alongside the all-action Kante. In the last decade, only one team has won the Champions League with just two out-and-out central midfielders: Chelsea in 2021. Factor in France in 2018 and Kante made tactics and teams work.Al-Ittihad will have to confront the question if such feats are consigned to the past, if a man whose physicality \u2013 along with his reading of the game \u2013 made him so good is now in decline. He only made nine appearances for Chelsea last season. Graham Potter is entitled to feel himself luckless in at least one respect: Kante was only able to play 33 minutes in his ill-fated tenure. Frank Lampard rather strangely used him as a No 10 against Real Madrid and Brentford. It was a glamour position but Kante was the man who long excelled at the unglamorous. He became a miracle worker by being the greatest worker of his generation."}, {"_id": "64931bb951ac3318ab2d23d4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/jose-mourinho-anthony-taylor-ban-punishment-b2361714.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jose Mourinho hit by Uefa punishment for abusing referee Anthony Taylor", "lead": "<p>Mourinho confronted the Premier League official following Roma\u2019s defeat to Sevilla in the Europa League final </p>", "author": "Jamie Braidwood", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:29:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:09.813042", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T15:29:40+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/10/15/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWimbledon has announced that it will become the latest sporting event to utilise artificial intelligence (AI), with the All England Club to use the technology to help produce commentary for video highlights packages.Starting at this year\u2019s Championships, app or website users will be able to watch back highlights from the tournament with audio commentary and captions that have been solely produced by AI.Working with IBM watsonx, the AI commentary will not replace human commentary as of yet, but will instead be used on the app for highlights without commentary and for matches that aren\u2019t available on the show courts.This is not the first time that Wimbledon has used the technology, with their stats packages and power rankings already produced using AI. Still, it will mark a significant step forward in the use of such technology at the tournament, which has evolved and grown greatly over the past year with the release of language learning modules such as Chat GPT-4 prompting calls for a slowdown in AI\u2019s enhancement for fears that it may be misused in the future.Alongside the commentary, Wimbledon and IBM watsonx will also introduce a new feature, dubbed IBM AI draw analysis, which will use machine technology to determine how favourable a player\u2019s route to the final might be based on their ranking and draw for the tournament.This will not be the first time that IBM has rolled out such features, with the company partnering with the Masters \u2013 one of golf\u2019s major championships \u2013 in April to produce AI commentary for the shot-by-shot highlights packages that were housed on the tournament\u2019s app.RecommendedQueen\u2019s order of play and Wednesday scheduleAndy Murray insists he can compete at Wimbledon despite early Queen\u2019s exitQueen\u2019s 2023 LIVE: Andy Murray suffers Wimbledon blow as Alex de Minaur ends winning runIn that case, the AI commentary was not replacing human commentary which was not present on the app and Wimbledon is keen to make clear that AI will not, at present, be used to replace the human voice.IBM Sports Partnerships Leader, Kevin Farrar said: \u201cI see AI as very much complementing the human element, rather than replacing it.\u201dHowever, Farrar did suggest that the software may eventually be used for full commentary on matches. \u201cYou can see in the future, you could train it in different styles and it opens up other possibilities in the future, around different languages, different voices. This is a step on that journey,\u201d he said.Alongside, the use of computer-generated commentary, there is now renewed uncertainty surrounding the future of line judges on the court, with electronic calling systems set to be widely adopted on the men\u2019s ATP tour by 2025.RecommendedQueen\u2019s 2023 LIVE: Latest updates as Cameron Norrie in action against Jordan ThompsonWimbledon announce wild cards for 2023 ChampionshipsQueen\u2019s order of play and schedule for WednesdayWimbledon has confirmed that line judges will remain on the court for the tournament this summer but their future remains unclear with the US and Australian Open \u2013 two of tennis\u2019s other grand slams \u2013 having already moved away from human judges to adopt the technology in their tournaments.All England Club\u2019s technology director Bill Jinks said: \u201cWho\u2019s to say what might happen in the future?

Intellogent ran really well in it last year \u2013 well treated and hopefully he\u2019s on the right side in stall 31. If you want to be on the other side, the far side, Wanees will run well at a big price \u2013 hopefully one of those hit the board.

I liked Relief Rally\u2019s wins at Windsor and Salisbury \u2013 and she can outrun her odds. I was also really impressed with Princess Chizara when she won at Bath last time out. Visually, she looks brilliant and she\u2019s overpriced after bolting up in a really good time.15:05 \u2013 CRYSTAL CAPRICECrystal Caprice, Tamarama and Indian Wish are all drawn really high and I can feel a tricast coming on! Farhh To Shy could also be thrown in too. I can\u2019t decide so take your pick!15:40 \u2013 JUMBLY (NAP)I was at the Curragh on the weekend that Jumbly ran and she tried to come way off the pace. Jumbly did well to even deliver a challenge and she will have improved. I\u2019m with her to go one better.16:20 \u2013 LUXEMBOURGI watched Luxembourg make his seasonal reappearance and I thought he was finished, however, he bounced back and was unrecognisable when winning the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh last month. He looked a different horse and while he got a good ride, he was brilliant. He can improve from that win and land the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes.17:00 \u2013 INTELLOGENTI\u2019ve got five that I fancy: Perotto,Intellogent, Atrium, Bless Him and Sonny Liston. In terms of picking the winner, I\u2019m keen on Intellogent with James Doyle on board for Jane Chapple-Hyam. He ran a blinder last year and he was eye-catching on his last start at Newbury.17:35 \u2013 PEKING OPERAI\u2019m with Peking Opera for Ryan Moore and Aidan O\u2019Brien. It looks like he\u2019s done just enough to win on his last two starts but he won with plenty in hand at Navan last time out. I don\u2019t like Gregory as the favourite so I\u2019m on Peking Opera instead.18:10 \u2013 BARNWELL BOYI like the favourite Barnwell Boy. I was really impressed with him at Goodwood and I\u2019m not worried about the drop to 5f.

Pre-season is hard enough but if you are in good physical state, as you need to be in this day and age, then it will be of benefit to me.\u201dThe defender\u2019s return to club duty might have been delayed at one point as the Euro 2024 qualifier looked in severe doubt because of a waterlogged pitch, with rules stating any abandoned game continues the next day.Porteous got away from Hampden after midnight but the fans were not far in front of him after a near two-hour delay while water was swept off the pitch following a torrential downpour.Speaking after a 2-0 win for the Group A leaders, the 24-year-old said: \u201cWe wanted the game to go on because there were 50,000 fans there. For them to come to the game, spend all that money on travel and tickets and then go home very disappointed that the game was the next day, wasn\u2019t what we wanted.\u201cWe wanted to play the game. We understand why they (Georgia) wouldn\u2019t because they were 1-0 down, that\u2019s completely understandable, but most of the fans stayed to the end.\u201cThe fans were brilliant, because it was a late night for a lot of kids and working people as well.\u201dThe victory made it four wins from four in Group A, Scotland\u2019s best start to any qualifying campaign, and sent them eight points clear halfway through their schedule.Porteous said: \u201cIt\u2019s exactly where we want to be, but the manager keeps reiterating to us and the press that we have done nothing yet.RecommendedAlmost two thirds of football fans oppose VAR, survey findsLeicester and Sale to face holders La Rochelle in Heineken Champions Cup poolRange of armband options for Women\u2019s World Cup as FIFA aims to avoid repeat row\u201cWe have put ourselves in a fantastic position but it\u2019s one game at a time that will get us there.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeVAR has been given a massive thumbs-down in a new fans\u2019 survey published on Wednesday.Almost two thirds (63.3 per cent) of supporters said they oppose the use of VAR, with only 26.8 per cent saying they were absolutely or somewhat in favour of it. The National Supporters Survey was commissioned by the Football Supporters\u2019 Association and covered 9,645 fans, running online in March and April.Only one in 20 (5.5 per cent) of fans who had experienced the technology being used in stadiums rated their experience of it as good or very good.The survey also found overwhelming support for the introduction of an independent regulator for English football, with 88.2 per cent of those surveyed agreeing on the need for the regulator to ensure the game is run more sustainably.The negativity towards VAR in 2023 contrasts with the 2017 FSA survey \u2013 prior to VAR\u2019s introduction \u2013 which found 74.6 per cent of fans favoured the use of video referees to support on-field officials with game-changing decisions.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMore than three quarters of match-goers (79.1 per cent) and two thirds of TV viewers (65.4 per cent) now rate their experience of VAR as either poor or very poor.Almost 92 per cent said decisions were taking too long to make, while 80 per cent said fans should be able to hear discussions between theVAR and the on-pitch referee.Referees\u2019 chief Howard Webb is determined to provide greater transparency around VAR in the English game, within the bounds of what is allowed by the laws of the sport.He appeared on Sky Sports\u2019 Monday Night Football programme on May 15 to talk through how a number of decisions from earlier in the season had been made, and often how complex these decisions can be and why time is needed to ensure accuracy.He also pointed out that, under the game\u2019s current laws, the conversations between referees and VARs cannot be broadcast live.FIFA trialled a system where referees communicated the final outcome of VAR decisions to fans in the stadium and those watching on television at the Club World Cup in February, and is considering continuing the trial at this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup.While Webb\u2019s MNF appearance was a one-off for last season, it is understood this could become a more regular feature next season.

While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.RecommendedBehind the scenes, laughter is turning to anger in the Fury vs Usyk sagaTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesTyson Fury promises \u2018imminent\u2019 announcement of \u2018big fight\u2019The Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings10. Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight. RecommendedJoe Joyce on knockouts, oil painting, and teaching 60-year-olds to swimJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesWhat is an exhibition fight and how is it different to a professional bout?With that second victory over Donaire, Inoue added the WBC belt to his collection of bantamweight titles, and he also surged to the top of this list from No 5. The 30-year-old then stopped Paul Butler in the 11th round in December to take the WBO strap and become undisputed champion \u2013 and Asia\u2019s first boxer to hold four world titles in a weight class at once.The three-weight world champion has plenty left ahead of him, including a move to super-bantamweight in July, when he will challenge unified champion Stephen Fulton."}, {"_id": "64931bbe51ac3318ab2d23e7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/ufc-rankings-fighters-p4p-list-2023-b2355821.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UFC rankings: The Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound fighters list", "lead": "<p>Here are our top 10 men\u2019s fighters in the UFC, in a list to be updated throughout the year </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:41:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:14.836273", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:41:24+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/03/20/11/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UFC is home to some of the best mixed martial artists on the planet, so it is no surprise that fans often debate how the elite fighters compare to one another.Alongside its weekly-updated rankings for each weight class, the UFC has its own pound-for-pound rankings, containing 15 names \u2013 as with each list for every division.Here, The Independent has constructed its own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s UFC fighters, to be updated throughout the year. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.Before diving into the top 10, here are a couple of honourable mentions:RecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearBest seat in the house: UFC\u2019s commentary team on what it\u2019s like to be cageside for the biggest fights in the world\u2018The only rules? No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornColby Covington (17-3, welterweight)The former interim welterweight champion is one of the best 170lbers on the planet. While the American, 35, has lost both of his shots at undisputed gold, he pushed then-champion Kamaru Usman to the brink in both fights. Covington, a wrestling specialist, responded to his second defeat by Usman with a dominant points win over friend-turned-rival Jorge Masvidal in March 2022. He has not fought since.Stipe Miocic (20-4, heavyweight)The consensus heavyweight GOAT, the part-time firefighter holds the record for most successful title defences in the division \u2013 the hardest weight class at which to put together a sustained run. The American surrendered the belt to Francis Ngannou and the French-Cameroonian\u2019s freakish knockout power in March 2021, but prior to that achieved back-to-back wins against one of the greatest ever in Daniel Cormier. The veteran, 40, also holds a decision victory over Ngannou, plus wins against more UFC champions in Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Werdum and Andrei Arlovski. However, he has dropped out of our top 10 due to two years of inactivity. Miocic is expected to return in July, to challenge current heavyweight champion Jon Jones.Brandon Moreno (20-6-2, flyweight champion)Mexico\u2019s first ever UFC champion has just one loss in the last five years, though he has also competed in two competitive draws in that period \u2013 the most recent kickstarting the most entertaining run of his career. There was no winner when Moreno challenged Deiveson Figueiredo in 2020, but the \u201cAssassin Baby\u201d submitted the Brazilian in their 2021 rematch to win the gold. Figueiredo wrestled the belt back in a close trilogy bout last year, but Moreno claimed the interim title by stopping Kai Kara-France and went on to stop Figueiredo again this January. In doing so, he became a two-time undisputed champion.Top 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally.9. Robert Whittaker (24-6, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just twice in the last eight years. Both of those losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but each has come against a former world champion, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around). An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (25-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski is riding a 22-fight winning streak  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro loss came against a welterweight champion, until this February. Seven of the Australian\u2019s last eight fights have pitted him against \u2018elite\u2019 fighters, and in 2022 Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that title \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as Chad Mendes and Brian Ortega.RecommendedHow Ciryl Gane\u2019s Jon Jones dream turned into a nightmareJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "64931bbf51ac3318ab2d23e8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/next-ufc-fight-event-june-schedule-2023-b2360142.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Next UFC Fight Night: Event start time, card and how to watch", "lead": "<p>All you need to know about the MMA promotion\u2019s upcoming fights</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:41:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:15.061733", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:41:16+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/19/23/8645f6e4df4978f3841fa564059b776aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ3ODE3Nzgx-2.65946822.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAnother year of UFC action is upon us, as fans anticipate Conor McGregor\u2019s long-awaited return to the Octagon as well as some major title fights.McGregor, who remains the face of the sport, has not competed since breaking his leg in July 2021 but is due to fight Michael Chandler this autumn, though new stars have emerged elsewhere to help keep audiences engaged.In one of the biggest fights of 2023, lightweight champion Islam Makhachev retained his title against featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski, narrowly winning a decision on the latter\u2019s home turf in Australia in February. Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAustralia\u2019s two-wicket victory over England in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston ranks alongside some of the greatest matches played between cricket\u2019s oldest rivals.Here, the PA news agency highlights some key stats from an incredible game.Culture clashA big part of the allure surrounding this match and the rest of the series relates to the styles of cricket that both teams play, which could hardly be more different.Australia play tough, attritional cricket designed to grind down their opposition, while England have adopted an ultra-aggressive style under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, aimed at generating results \u2013 whether that be a win or a loss.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThis clash of ideologies was on full display in Birmingham.Australia and England scored a near-identical number of runs (668 compared with 666) and lost the same number of wickets (18), but Pat Cummins\u2019 side faced 1,252 deliveries compared with England\u2019s 866.Australia were happy to bide their time, scoring at a rate of 53.35 runs per 100 balls on average, while Stokes\u2019 men looked to force a result by striking at 76.91.The difference in approach was embodied by the teams\u2019 key batters \u2013 England\u2019s reverse-ramping Joe Root faced just 207 balls for his 164 runs across both innings, while Australia\u2019s stoic Usman Khawaja scored his 206 runs from 518 deliveries and became the 13th player in history to bat on all five days of a Test match.Ebb and flowAustralia\u2019s win was especially thrilling because of the way the match seemed to swing back and forth throughout.Just seven runs separated the sides after the first innings, in which England surprisingly declared on 393 for eight and Australia lost their last four wickets for 14 runs to be bowled out for 386.The drama went up a notch in the second innings, however, as both teams repeatedly threatened to get ahead before losing a wicket.Eighteen of the 19 second-innings\u2019 partnerships reached double figures but only four passed 50, with the highest being Australia\u2019s opening stand of 61 between Khawaja and David Warner.Similarly, 19 of the 21 batters scored 10 or more runs, with only Zak Crawley (seven) and Steve Smith (six) falling in single digits.RedemptionAustralia captain Cummins and spin bowler Nathan Lyon were key figures in the thrilling Edgbaston victory, having also played a central role in a heartbreaking defeat at Headingley in 2019.Cummins conceded the winning runs four years ago as Stokes led England to an unlikely win, while Lyon missed a crucial run-out chance in the penultimate over.This time, the pair inspired their side to victory with an unbroken partnership of 55 from a perilous position of 227 for eight when Alex Carey \u2013 the last recognised batter \u2013 was dismissed.RecommendedArsenal pull new home shirt while \u2018design error\u2019 is rectified by AdidasHarry Maguire retrial at Greek court to be held in FebruaryArsenal edge closer to Kai Havertz deal and gear up for third Declan Rice bidCummins and Lyon had already performed heroics with the ball to limit Australia\u2019s target to 281.They took a combined eight wickets for 143 runs from 42.2 overs in England\u2019s second innings, compared with two for 121 from 24 overs by Australia\u2019s remaining bowlers \u2013 Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Cameron Green."}, {"_id": "64931bc051ac3318ab2d23ee", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-adidas-premier-league-b2361612.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Arsenal pull new home shirt while \u2018design error\u2019 is rectified by Adidas", "lead": "The shirt honours Arsenal\u2019s \u2018Invincible\u2019 season, with a thin white stripe down the side detailing the results of the club\u2019s 38 games that term.", "author": "Mark Mann-Bryans", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:26:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:16.542847", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T12:26:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/13/ae34e9f374c69c0fffd38648a9dd45d4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDM1NzEz-2.47910310.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe heavyweight division is a bad pantomime now with Tyson Fury, Oleksandr Usyk, a chorus of fighters, a few promoters and some hefty backers all trying to work out what part of the dancing horse they are. Moving away from the ugly sisters, there is every chance that the gap between the last championship fight and the next will be the longest in over 50 years. This break is not common, ignore people telling you that. Fury defended his WBC title last December against his old, old friend, Derek Chisora, and Usyk beat Anthony Joshua for the second time last August in Saudi Arabia to retain his IBF, WBA and WBO titles. Fury has no date, just social media plans, and Usyk is due to defend in Poland in late August against Daniel Dubois. It is hard to find a solitary reason for the break and even more difficult to put the blame on just one single person. There are a lot of people on the stage, and they all have a role to play. And to be honest, during the last six months they have all said too much. Sure, greed, rivalries, stupidity, lies and ego are at the very core of the problem, but boxing at the highest level has always had the same flaws, the same fluid obstacles. The standard excuses are there to overcome - that is how boxing works. RecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesWhy has Saudi Arabia become big player in world sport and what does future hold?Fury and Usyk for all the tarnished marbles was meant to have been signed and sealed last September. It was scheduled for April and is now a plan for December. Both boxers have insulted the other, and the theme of their mutual abuse is simple: greed. Obviously, both deny they are the greedy, money-grabbing party in the sad affair. Actually, the righteous outrage from both sides is comedy gold at times. Fury\u2019s father, the unstoppable \u201cGypsy John\u201d Fury, has demanded that Usyk apologise for his criticism. He has warned that if there is no apology, there might be a straightener in a field somewhere, man-to-man. There is honour at stake. It is endless mirth, it really is. Fury (right) beat Derek Chisora in December to stay unbeaten and retain the WBC heavyweight title (Zac Goodwin/PA) (PA Wire)c. Some of boxing\u2019s wisest, richest and smartest brains have been involved in this ongoing lunacy. The men and women in the Fury camp blame Usyk, and the men and women in the Usyk camp blame Fury. The two main players in the Fury business, Bob Arum and Frank Warren, have a combined total of 98 years of promotion; they are both battling this madness. There is, according to some insiders, a one-off offer on the table from the government of Saudi Arabia for Fury and Usyk to fight there at the end of the year. Usyk has signed his deal. This offer is non-negotiable, and we know this because the media flown out to Saudi by the Saudi government have reported it as fact. As a guide to the way boxing works, there are seldom any facts involved when deals are being made, broken and made again. The real insiders are furious that Usyk and Fury, the biggest fight in boxing, is not yet across the line. The sanctioning bodies, who get paid a fee for fights, have promised to get tough with their heavyweight champions, but have not said a word or done a thing; everyone is holding out for a slice of the Saudi cash pie. \u2018Hey, it\u2019s a business,\u2019 they will say, but that little claim is wearing very thin. Usyk (right) last fought in August, outpointing Anthony Joshua for the second fight in a row  (Getty Images)Fury, meanwhile, has mentioned 10 possible opponents in his social media rants in the last few weeks, including a plan to fight two UFC icons in one night. Usyk and Dubois went to purse bids, which is one of boxing\u2019s ancient rituals, and Usyk\u2019s team won. The fight is scheduled for August. Looking in from the side of the crowded stage is Joshua. His fight with Fury was announced by Fury on 10 June, 2020; it would have been a fight for the ages, for all the belts and all the bragging rights. It never happened and it has come close a couple of times since then. Joshua, meanwhile, will fight in August and it might be Dillian Whyte. There is a rumour that Whyte wants too much for the fight; the flip side of that rumour is that Whyte was offered too little. In America, Deontay Wilder, twice beaten in classics by Fury, has not fought since last October. There is a plan, under the Saudi deal, for Wilder to fight Joshua in Saudi Arabia on the same night as Usyk and Fury fight. There is, so the paid publicists insist, a total purse of $400million on the table for the four boxers to split. It must be a strong table.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cOne month before the fight, we were so happy; it was a dream,\u201d Ciryl Gane reminisces. Then comes a laugh. \u201cOne minute after the fight, it was a nightmare.\u201dIt is easy to forget, but the hype around Gane\u2019s title fight with Jon Jones in March was not based on the latter\u2019s long-awaited return alone. There was genuine anticipation for what could have been an intriguing contest between a light-heavyweight great, in Jones, and a heavyweight contender who moves like a welterweight, in Gane. Once the fight started, however, that intrigue was extinguished within moments. Gane, failing to do himself justice \u2013 as he would tell you \u2013 was taken down early and submitted as the clock ticked past the two-minute mark. \u201cMy coach told me every day, every time, every training [session]: \u2018Don\u2019t throw the backhand,\u2019\u201d Gane tells The Independent. \u201c\u2018If you want, [throw] the jab \u2013 maybe the uppercut \u2013 but not the backhand.\u2019 I threw the backhand, he caught me.\u201dRecommendedTyson Fury claims UFC has offered him \u2018hybrid fight\u2019 with Jon JonesJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesJared Cannonier breaks UFC record in win over Marvin VettoriTopuria vs Emmett live stream: How to watch UFC Fight Night online and on TV this weekendIndeed, Jones dipped his head off the centre line as Gane overcommitted to a left cross, then engulfed the 33-year-old, hauling him to the canvas \u2013 weighing down on Gane with every ounce of his new, 248lbs heavyweight frame. Once Gane had been forced to the fence, there was no escape. Jones locked in a guillotine choke, and before the fans in Las Vegas had time to comprehend what had happened, the American had forced his opponent to tap. The vacant heavyweight title was vacant no longer.To many onlookers, Jones\u2019s status as the greatest ever was confirmed within those 124 seconds. And what of Gane, the former interim champion who was sitting with his back against the cage, staring up at his victorious opponent, and coming to terms with a second loss in an undisputed-title fight? The Frenchman was, suddenly, no longer an example of the \u2018modern\u2019 heavyweight, and instead a kickboxer with a gaping hole in his game\u00a0\u2013 a gap that Jones had exploited mercilessly.Ciryl Gane reveals key coaching tip that he ignored in Jon Jones loss\u201cI was confident in this position [on the mat],\u201d Gane insists, \u201cbut I did [something] wrong. When we went back to the gym after the fight, we did only wrestling and grappling, every day. I was already confident, but I know it\u2019s really normal to be more confident and have better reflexes when you do something every day. This is gonna help me for sure.\u201dTechnical faults can be addressed, of course, but fighters sometimes suffer from intangible issues in bouts of this magnitude \u2013 in moments of this magnitude \u2013 that can define results and careers, and that are less easily expelled. \u201cIt was really difficult to explain,\u201d Gane says. \u201cPeople asked me if I felt a lot of pressure during the fight, during the press conference, the waiting... Did you see me afraid? No, I was really happy to be there! I wanted to fight against the GOAT and prove that I\u2019m a good fighter. In the cage, in front of the opponent, everybody saw me really confident. But when we started, and during the fight, something switched \u2013 I don\u2019t know exactly why. I couldn\u2019t manage the distance, I was not there. I think when you have a bad feeling, it\u2019s harder to be good technically.Jones controls Gane before submitting the Frenchman to win the vacant UFC heavyweight title  (Getty Images)\u201cI was not \u2018here\u2019,\u201d Gane stresses again. \u201cIt was not me, it just was not me \u2013 everybody knows that. That\u2019s why today, when everybody asks me if I want revenge: Yes, I want revenge, just because I want to prove that I\u2019m better than that and can put Jon Jones through more adversity.\u201dIt is unclear whether Jones will still be around by the time Gane earns a prospective third shot at the UFC heavyweight title. The American, 35, was absent from the Octagon for three years before returning to fight Gane, and his plan to face heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Stipe Miocic before the end of the year looks fragile. Jones has also continually exchanged verbal barbs with Francis Ngannou \u2013 his predecessor as UFC heavyweight champion, and a former teammate and opponent of Gane.Prior to his loss to Jones, Gane knocked out Tai Tuivasa in Paris last September  (AFP via Getty Images)But while Jones\u2019s next step is ambiguous, Gane\u2019s is clear. The Frenchman, a year on from headlining the UFC\u2019s first-ever French card, will once again fight in a main event in Paris this September. Sergey Spivak, the Moldovan heavyweight with three stoppage wins in his last three fights, will be the tormented tourist at the Accor Arena.\u201cThis is my mindset: Every time people ask who I want to fight next, it doesn\u2019t matter who,\u201d Gane says. \u201cI just want to fight, do my job, my mission. I\u2019m a competitor, so any opponent you put in front of me is going to be my mission. Spivak is well rounded \u2013 good ground game, good wrestler \u2013 so yes, it\u2019s gonna be a test.

He was not beaten far in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury when he tried to bite Modern Games and William Buick as they passed him Jockey Pat Dobbs felt he was in front too soon that day so this straight mile is perfect for him. He can pull off a bit of a surprise in the first race at Royal Ascot.\u201d15:05 \u2013 Army Ethos - 14/1 (each-way)\u201cTrainer Archie Watson won this last year with Bradsell for the same connections. He sent Army Ethos up to Ayr to win his maiden and he made no mistake. It was the manner of the victory that impressed and he has to be a player in this contest.

She has the services of Royal Ascot regular James McDonald, which is a plus. Highfield Princess is an unbelievable story and it would be remarkable were she to win but the Aussie raider can repel her.\u201d16:20 \u2013 Paddington - 9/4\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to go much of a gallop in the early part of the Irish 2,000 Guineas but Paddington quickened up very smartly to put the race to bed at the business end. The St James\u2019 Palace Stales is run on the round course and the best horse doesn\u2019t always win. However, Paddington has plenty of speed which will stand him in good stead and help the Ballydoyle runner edge it over Chaldean.\u201d17:00 \u2013 Calling the Wind - 9/1\u201cRichard Hughes was no stranger to the winner\u2019s enclosure as a jockey at Royal Ascot and it would mean the world to him to have a winner as a trainer.

He is the retained rider for Qatar Racing and Buckaroo got beaten in a Derby Trial last year at Leopardstown.

He is versatile as regards the ground so should cope with whatever conditions are thrown at him on the day.\u201d18:10 \u2013 Vauban - 6/4\u201cIt is hard to get away from the Willie Mullins and Ryan Moore combo again. They have been the punters\u2019 pals at Royal Ascot for the last few years in the long distance races and Vauban has run some good races at the top level over hurdles, including when winning the Triumph Hurdle, and had some smart Flat form in France.

Why aren\u2019t you doing football, you know, the generic sports?'\u201d he said.\u201cBut as I\u2019ve grown and developed and I\u2019ve got a few medals in the bank, they definitely more respect what I do, now they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a really cool thing you do\u2019.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveTomblin\u2019s ambitions to erase stigma and stereotype around his chosen sport, once known as synchronised swimming, extend well beyond his circle of friends.Artistic swimming is, like a duck gliding smoothly across a lake, an illusion of effortlessness when in reality it is anything but. Asked about the biggest misconception people hold, Tomblin\u2019s answer comes immediately.\u201cThat it is easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. A lot of people just think it\u2019s having a play about in the water. It\u2019s really not.\u201dTraining comprises working on everything from strength and conditioning to flexibility, knee extensions, toe points, breath-holding, swimming, stamina and timing.Consider the feeling of, as American synchro coach Joyce Lindeman once put it, \u201crunning a marathon while holding your breath\u201d.Also it is set to music, and you are judged on how good you look doing it.Tomblin spent nearly a decade in gymnastics and it was only by fluke that the woman coaching his \u201cnormal\u201d swimming lessons at Atlantis Flamingos also happened to be the synchro coach.Hearing about his gymnastics background, she asked if he wanted to give artistic swimming a go.\u201cI immediately loved it. It\u2019s really grown from there,\u201d said Tomblin, though he admits there was an adjustment period, adding: \u201cIt definitely did feel a bit weird, especially with the first team I joined.\u201cThere were no boys, it was full of girls and it was a bit awkward and it was hard to make friends, but I feel like after I joined the national squad everyone\u2019s really lovely. We\u2019re all good friends.\u201dA landmark December 2022 World Aquatics decision paved the way for male artistic swimmers to compete at next summer\u2019s Paris Olympics, which will now allow up to two men in the eight-athlete team event.Tomblin won silver at the inaugural male free solo event at the 2022 LEN European Junior Championships as well as bronze alongside Cass and, while he is certainly open to the possibility of the team event, mixed duet \u2013 appearing for the first time at a European Games \u2013 is Tomblin\u2019s speciality.Mixed duet is not on the programme for Paris, but December\u2019s announcement allowed Tomblin to be cautiously optimistic that his event could feature at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\u201cWhen I first heard that, I felt really excited and hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh there\u2019s loads of boys so let\u2019s let them in the Olympics\u2019\u2026 then hopefully that will lead towards the mixed duet going into the Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nI'd like to inspire someone.Ranjuo TomblinRecommendedWhat do England need to do to win the Ashes?England and Australia fined and deducted two WTC points for slow over-ratesOn this day in 2015: Jordan Spieth wins US Open to claim second straight majorWhile records will fall and champions change, there can only ever be one person who does something first, and Tomblin is delighted by the role he could play in ensuring he will not be the last.\u201cIt would mean so much to me,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m working so hard because I\u2019ve seen males older than me, like (Team USA\u2019s) Bill May.

It\u2019s the place where he rode his \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d winners in one day at odds of 25,095-1. A feat that cost the betting industry an estimated \u00a340m and earned Dettori a statue at Ascot to mark the achievement.He is a jockey like no other, propelled to stardom off the back of those seven winners, he remained in the limelight due his personality, charisma, and knack for winning big races. Ask anyone on the street to name a horseracing jockey and the response you\u2019ll get more than most is: \u2018Frankie Dettori.\u2019Outside racing circles, Dettori is the name and face of horse racing. His persona transcended the sport and reached a wider audience. The type of people who tune in each year for Cheltenham or the Grand National but show no interest outside the bigger events all know who Frankie Dettori is.A racegoer takes a phone call near the Frankie Dettori statue at Ascot Racecourse (PA)They\u2019ll have a vague picture or memory of the little jockey leaping off his horse, arms stretched wide with a cheeky grin on his face, celebrating yet another triumph.His flying dismount is an iconic image, created by a horseracing superstar. Dettori has been racing in Britain since the 1980s. He started as an apprentice jockey earning a first win in at\u00a0Goodwood\u00a0on 9th June 1987. At 19, Dettori became the first teenager since Lester Piggott to win more than 100 races in a season and finished fourth in the Champion Jockey table.He partnered with\u00a0Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s\u00a0newly-founded\u00a0Godolphin Racing\u00a0in 1994, earning the first of his Champion Jockey titles that same year and followed up with two more wins in 1995 and 2004.He spent 18 years and earned many successes allied with Godolphin \u2013 including the previously mentioned seven winners in a day at Ascot in 1996 \u2013 but they parted ways in 2012 just months before Dettori was suspended for failing a drug test.He admitted to using cocaine stating: \"Things were going bad, I was depressed and I guess a moment of weakness and I fell for it and I\u2019ve only got myself to blame\".King Charles III, Queen Camilla and John Warren speak with Frankie Dettori (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)Over such a long career there are bound to be failures and mistakes like this but greatness is measured by how a person responds.Dettori served his time away from the sport - six months in total - and came back in style, riding Asian Trader to victory at Sandown just one week into his return.The latter end of his career saw him pair up with trainer John Gosden and brought him more success. Atop Stadivarius, Dettori won three consecutive Ascot Gold Cups between 2018-2020, though jockey and horse were beaten by a length into third place in the 2022 Gold Cup race.Three Champion Jockey triumphs and 286 Group 1 winners, including 23 winners in the British Classics, brings Dettori up to date and facing his final rides at Royal Ascot this week. The Italian will have to overcome a frustrating opening day after being given a nine-day careless riding ban by the stewards.There is still time for Dettori to land a 78th winner at this meeting but perhaps a different prize will take precedent.He\u2019ll drink in the adulation and the applause. He\u2019ll make sure to remember the feel of the turf as the horses thunder across it, he\u2019ll note the noise of the crowds as they cheer and the tingly sensation that shoots through the body as the thrill of racing to finish line kicks in.His last races here will truly make this week a special one for the Italian.RecommendedProtester removed from Epsom Derby track following arrestsLGBT+ sports fans call for more inclusivity as Derby Day to host drag showTrain strikes announced on day of FA Cup final and Epsom DerbyWhether he wins or not, the watching crowds at Royal Ascot will celebrate a man who has brought smiles, tears, and joy to this most thrilling of sports.They\u2019ll back him, as they have many times before, and maybe, just maybe, their reward will be that Frankie Dettori\u2019s final performance at Royal Ascot is his greatest one yet."}, {"_id": "64931bc551ac3318ab2d2401", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/england-jonny-bairstow-jack-leach-ashes-australia-b2361458.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What do England need to do to win the Ashes?", "lead": "Australia took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series with a thrilling victory at Edgbaston.", "author": "Rory Dollard", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 08:37:48", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:21.822098", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T08:37:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/09/c16382eaff80d7d484f771c76c1d6146Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3NDIxODc1-2.72690641.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland are waking up to defeat in the first Test against Australia for the third Ashes series in a row.The tone of the game may have been different, with Ben Stokes\u2019 side making most of the running across five enthralling days to set up a finish, but the end result was the same as 2017, 2019 and 2021.Australia held the urn aloft in each of those series, flexing their muscles in matching 4-0 wins on home soil and retaining after a 2-2 draw on tour four years ago.England will now need to overturn a 1-0 deficit with four games to play, but what should they do to make that happen?Keep the faith in \u2018Bazball\u2019RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveDefeat against their bitter rivals will hurt, but now is not the time to rip up a playbook that has delivered 11 wins from 14 Test matches under Ben Stokes\u2019 captaincy.In particular, England have proven that their ultra-aggressive batting style can hurt an Australia attack who hoped they would be immune.They scored at a rollicking 5.03 an over in the first innings and kept it up at 4.11 on a trickier surface in the second and landed important blows along the way.Scott Boland went around the park for the first time in his Test career and Joe Root\u2019s reverse ramps will have tested the egos of the Australian quicks.Fix Moeen\u2019s finger or find a replacementThere was always going to be an element of risk in summoning Moeen Ali out of international retirement when Jack Leach went down with a stress fracture.The 36-year-old last played first-class cricket almost two years ago and his lack of conditioning came back to haunt England when his right index finger blistered then burst open.He found it difficult to grip and rip the ball from that point onward and was able to offer just seven overs on day five as part-timer Joe Root picked up the bulk of the work.If the medical staff are confident they can rectify the situation in the coming days Moeen should get another chance at Lord\u2019s, but if there is a chance of history repeating then Surrey\u2019s Will Jacks looks like the next man in and should be called up.Dial down the declaration addictionFor the second game in a row England have lost a Test match after declaring eight down in the first innings.New Zealand edged them by a single run in Wellington back in February and now Australia have snuck across the line.Stokes\u2019 penchant for calling an early end to his side\u2019s run-scoring has been a fascinating facet of his captaincy and at times has worked brilliantly \u2013 including three Tests ago in Mount Maunganui.But pulling out after just 78 overs, the earliest ever declaration in the Ashes, may have been slightly too radical. Root was racing along on 118 not out and it would not have taken him long to score enough runs to alter the final outcome.Rally around BairstowBy choosing to drop Ben Foakes, a player Stokes has frequently described as the best wicketkeeper in world cricket, England opened themselves up to criticism. But with Harry Brook undroppable after a prolific winter and the star performer of 2022, Jonny Bairstow, fit again, Foakes was the fall guy.Bairstow is an experienced gloveman but put down at least three chances that he would have hoped to take, racking up a tab that his dashing 78 in the first innings did not fully clear.Those who advocate a Foakes recall at Lord\u2019s can think again, with the squad already announced and Bairstow going nowhere.For now they need to get behind a player who thrives on confidence and certainty over his role. Neither he nor England can afford any more costly slip-ups, but showing faith might be the best way to avoid them next week.Let Wood make his markOne thing England lacked in their XI at Edgbaston was outright pace, a quality Mark Wood brings in abundance. With Jofra Archer and Olly Stone both out injured, he is the only man available who can routinely clear 90mph.He is best used in short, sharp spells and concerns over Stokes\u2019 ability to share the workload may have played a part in him missing out in the first Test. But on a Lord\u2019s pitch that can play flat, he might be just the tonic.RecommendedEngland and Australia fined and deducted two WTC points for slow over-ratesOn this day in 2015: Jordan Spieth wins US Open to claim second straight majorFirst Ashes Test: Australia riding high after thrilling win in series openerWood was England\u2019s most impressive performer Down Under in the 2021-22 Ashes and already has Australia\u2019s respect.After an unusually quiet outing, record wicket-taker James Anderson could be in line to stand down but it might also be possible to lean on Root\u2019s spin and choose a four-strong pace cartel. Either way, it feels like Wood is a game breaker they cannot afford to overlook."}, {"_id": "64931bc651ac3318ab2d2402", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/queens-order-of-play-schedule-b2360073.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Queen\u2019s order of play, schedule", "lead": "<p>Everything you need to know ahead of the grass court tournament </p>", "author": "Harry Latham-Coyle", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 07:56:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:22.138395", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T07:56:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/09/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Australia picked up 12 points for their Cummins-inspired win, so drop back to 10.All 22 players have also lost 40 per cent of their match fees, which equates to around \u00a36,000 for the English contingent.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live"}, {"_id": "64931bc751ac3318ab2d2407", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news-arsenal-kai-havertz-b2361412.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Transfer news and rumours: Arsenal offer \u00a360m in second attempt to sign Kai Havertz", "lead": "<p>The extra funds could be just enough for the deal to get over the line, as the Blues seek to bolster finances for their own recruitment plans</p>", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 07:23:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:23.393669", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T07:23:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/07/c363e196368aa821975ad08f48beeb45Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3Mzk2OTM2-2.72352660.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

rainstorm in the lead-up to the Group A fixture had rendered the match farcical in the opening stages, before midfielder Callum McGregor scored in the sixth minute with a drive through the puddles.Hungarian referee Istvan Vad immediately halted the game, with an announcement confirming an initial 20-minute delay for the pitch to be cleared of water before an inspection.Supporters kicked their heels in the stands until the pitch was declared playable, with the players warming up again before restarting at the 10th minute mark \u2013 over 90 minutes after it had been halted.On resumption, midfielder Scott McTominay added a second goal two minutes after the restart \u2013 his fifth in four qualifiers \u2013 before Georgia star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia missed a VAR-awarded

the pitch drew gasps from supporters as passes stopped in puddles, with players leaving the ball behind as they tried to drive forward.Scotland\u2019s opening goal came when John McGinn\u2019s corner from the right was partially cleared to McGregor and the Celtic captain\u2019s drive from 12 yards was parried into the net by Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.Referee Vad did not restart the game, instead stepping off the pitch to speak to an official before returning to inform the players that the game was to be stopped while groundsmen\u00a0\u2013 and then some of the ball boys \u2013 brushed water from the pitch.Fans had booed the initial announcement of a 20-minute delay and that of a pitch inspection 10 minutes later and there was relief when the game eventually got under way again just after 9.30pm following a few more delays.The pitch was still far from perfect but the Scots adapted slightly better, albeit the delay appeared to have dampened the enthusiasm of the home support.Five minutes from the break McGinn came close with a header from a Kieran Tierney cross before completely missing the ball eight yards from goal.Then McTominay\u2019s angled-drive was tipped around a post by Mamardashvili but the visitors held out.The second half had barely begun when McTominay pounced on a loose ball on the edge of the box and fired a low drive past Mamardashvili to re-energise the flailing Tartan Army.Georgia\u2019s Otar Kiteishvili thundered a shot from distance just over the crossbar on the hour but there was no real sign of a comeback.Scotland defender Ryan Porteous headed a Gilmour cross over from close range in the 72nd minute, before Georges Mikautadze hit the side-netting with an effort at the other end.RecommendedTransfer news and rumours: Arsenal

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOnly four Englishmen have been named in the team of the tournament for a European Championships in the 21st century. Gareth Southgate ended the international career of the first, even if Wayne Rooney did lose his place 13 years after he was among the pick of the players in Euro 2004.As England can start to prepare for Euro 2024, Southgate\u2019s loyalty to two others will be tested. They have been talismanic figures for him, faces of his improvement of England. A difficult season for each threatens a loss of status.Not Kyle Walker, even if the treble winner sometimes finds himself outside Pep Guardiola\u2019s strongest side and turns 34 before the tournament in Germany next summer begins. But Harry Maguire and Raheem Sterling, twin success stories for Southgate but a duo who will harbour few fond memories of 2022/23.Maguire at least had a fine World Cup but seems to face a bleaker future with his current club.Sterling may not need a transfer but neither can afford another season like the last.RecommendedWhy England will head into 2024 with their sense of optimism restoredEngland vs North Macedonia LIVE: Euro 2024 qualifier result and reactionBukayo Saka cements his place as England\u2019s leading man with first career hat-trickMaguire surely needs a change of scenery, Sterling a change of fortune after a change of manager; yet another, given that this is Chelsea. The winger is proof that seeking pastures new can backfire. The defender, however, has suffered by staying, relegated to the ranks of Manchester United\u2019s last-choice centre-back. With Erik ten Hag\u2019s preference for Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez evident, Maguire lingers in limbo. He has only started six of United\u2019s last 36 league games.\u201cHe is captain of an incredible football club so that is a difficult situation, he will obviously be frustrated not to play as much as he would like but I think he has handled that really well,\u201d said Southgate diplomatically.But Maguire has to play to protect his international place. \u201cIt is clear, really,\u201d Southgate added. \u201cI think him and Kalvin [Phillips] are the two who have played the least in terms of guys in this squad this season but we have gone with them because in these two positions we think they are still ahead of others that might have played more. But it is then hard when that competition gets more even and you are not playing regularly to see their form and see their fitness.\u201dMaguire has benefited from a lack of options: there has felt a drop-off between him and John Stones and the supporting cast of Eric Dier, Tyrone Mings and Conor Coady so he has been given the benefit of the doubt. But the emergence of Marc Guehi and Levi Colwill threatens to change that; as Southgate suggested, Maguire\u2019s fine service over an international career of 57 caps can only protect him for so long. (The FA via Getty Images)Sterling has suffered because of the higher calibre of alternatives. He finished the World Cup on the bench, albeit partly because his tournament was interrupted by a burglary at home that necessitated a brief return to England. He sat out the June games after talks with Southgate, looking to recuperate after his troubled season. England did not miss him.Bukayo Saka scored a hat-trick against North Macedonia. Marcus Rashford got a goal. His tally of 30 club goals this season was a career best. Sterling got 31 himself in 2019/20 and was Chelsea\u2019s joint top scorer in his first year at Stamford Bridge, but with a mere nine.While Southgate stopped short of guaranteeing Saka one of the spots either side of Harry Kane, the Arsenal winger seems a shoo-in. It leaves Sterling probably competing for one position with a more potent Rashford, two treble winners in Jack Grealish and Phil Foden, plus the considerable talents of James Maddison.\u201cThere is now a more even competition,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cIn the past he was the name on the teamsheet. If we have all of those players available when we need them then that\u2019s brilliant but it rarely happens. What we know is he\u2019s scored an incredible amount of goals for us, important goals. His goals were critical.\u201d (The FA via Getty Images)Will they be again? Perhaps Mauricio Pochettino will prove to be what Sterling needs, whereas Graham Potter certainly was not. The shifting dynamics of Chelsea\u2019s attack \u2013 with Joao Felix gone and Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Kai Havertz perhaps to follow, but with Christopher Nkunku and maybe Nicolas Jackson joining \u2013 makes his future for club and country shrouded in uncertainty.He has to first get back in the England squad, then the side.RecommendedMarcus Rashford\u2019s complicated England relationship could be at turning pointEngland stars must ignore transfer talk, says Gareth SouthgateMidfield role my best shot of becoming England regular \u2013 Trent Alexander-ArnoldSouthgate draws on the experience of his time working with Sterling to predict a renaissance. \u201cI will expect him to respond,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not been happy with this season at his club this year, the part he has to get right this summer is his physical fitness and I would expect him to be flying next year. He\u2019s a fighter.\u201dSterling may need to be, just as Maguire will, if two of the team of Euro 2020 are to get into the England team for Euro 2024."}, {"_id": "64931bc851ac3318ab2d240b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-fred-kai-havertz-sam-johnstone-the-sun-b2361379.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football rumours: Arsenal offer \u00a360m in second attempt to sign Kai Havertz", "lead": "The extra funds could be just enough for the deal to get over the line, as the Blues seek to bolster finances for their own recruitment plans.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 06:20:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:24.472295", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T06:20:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/07/c363e196368aa821975ad08f48beeb45Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3Mzk2OTM2-2.72352660.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Ben Stokes\u2019 audacious declaration to set up the game had a similar effect.Stokes looked to have set up an England triumph when he defied his long-standing knee injury to remove player-of-the-match Usman Khawaja for 65, but in the end they could not finish the job and will head to Lord\u2019s down 1-0 with four to play.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSelection gamble leaves England in a spinWhen England persuaded Moeen Ali to come out of retirement after almost two years as a white-ball specialist, they knew it was a roll of the dice. In the end the gamble cost them during a tense finale as the all-rounder was unable to play a full role due to a painful open blister on his right index finger. He was able to contribute just seven overs at a time when he should have been a key weapon, with Joe Root\u2019s part-time off-breaks accounting for 15. Moeen did manage to dismiss Travis Head, but he was also the team\u2019s most expensive bowler and was a bystander at the business end. Will England double down in the second Test or send for back-up?Half-chances add to England\u2019s missed opportunitiesWicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow faced criticism for his glovework earlier in the match, with four possible chances getting past him. But England saw another couple of fiendishly difficult openings go begging off Australia\u2019s match-winning duo. Root got a hand to a low return catch while Cummins was still in single figures, but could only parry it, while Stokes came desperately close to a sensational take in the deep as Lyon hit out. He leapt into the air and plucked the ball out of the sky, but could not keep it under control as he came crashing to the ground. Had either of those fiendishly hard chances stuck, England would surely have been celebrating at the close.Australia\u2019s best ever Ashes chases404/3 - Headingley, 1948315/6 - Adelaide, 1902287/5 - Melbourne, 1929282/8 - Edgbaston, 2023276/4 - Sydney, 1898Big numberView from the dressing room\n\nLosing sucks.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBen Stokes was \u201cdevastated\u201d as England fell behind in the Ashes after a gripping climax to the first Test at Edgbaston but he was resolute that their style of play can topple Australia.An unbroken 55-run stand between Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon saw Australia snatch victory from under England\u2019s noses in a dramatic denouement to an LV= Insurance series opener that ebbed and flowed.While smarting from a two-wicket defeat leaves England with an uphill task, Stokes has seen enough from the last five days to convince him that their attacking approach can reap dividends in the weeks ahead.The big question amid all the pre-series hype was how the philosophy styled under captain Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum would cope with the world Test champions, but from the moment Zak Crawley thumped the first ball of the match for four, England have shown they are up for the battle ahead.\u201cI am devastated we\u2019ve lost that game but in terms of what it\u2019s done for the series, it\u2019s hard to not be too disappointed because it has set up a great series,\u201d Stokes said.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cIt\u2019s not a psychological blow at all.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost but if you look at the way we\u2019ve played, compared to how the last few Ashes series have gone, proves what we\u2019re capable of doing against Australia.\u201cLosing sucks but the way we applied ourselves literally from ball one proves we\u2019re able to stand up to Australia.\u201cEven if we\u2019re on the wrong end of the result here, we proved we can go toe-to-toe throughout the whole game against Australia. We\u2019ve got four games left and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be concentrating on.\u201dOne of the major talking points from the Test came with England declaring late on day one on 393 for eight \u2013 despite Joe Root flying after bringing up his first Ashes century since 2015.But Stokes was unrepentant \u2013 reasoning there was a chance to eat into Australia\u2019s batting, which was ultimately unsuccessful \u2013 and argued doing so may have laid the groundwork for the thrilling finale.\u201cI\u2019m a captain who saw it as an opportunity to pounce on Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way in which we played and took Australia on actually allowed us to be able to do that.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t declare, would we have got that excitement like we did at the end? I\u2019m not 100 per cent sure but I\u2019m not going to be looking back at this game as what ifs. We just didn\u2019t manage to get over the line.\u201dAfter rain wiped out the morning session, Australia resumed on 107 for three in pursuit of 281 at the 25,000 sell-out in Birmingham, where both sides seemed to be in the ascendancy at various stages.Stokes winkled out Usman Khawaja as Australia lurched to 209 for seven then 227 for eight after Root snared Alex Carey but Cummins (44no) and Lyon (16no) defied the building tension to see Australia home.The match-defining partnership might have been broken but Stokes was unable to hang on to what would have been a wonder catch when Lyon was on two.Stokes admitted his thoughts drifted back to Headingley in 2019, when he and England were reprieved after Lyon flubbed a run-out chance at a crucial stage.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the world comes around and I drop that catch and then he\u2019s not out at the end,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cIt\u2019s mad how things go round. It was in my hand, just didn\u2019t managed to stick.\u201cIt was an emotional roller coaster to be out in the middle, especially the person having to make decisions but I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way in which we\u2019ve operated from the start of this game.\u201dThe make-up of England\u2019s bowling attack will be scrutinised with only eight days separating the end of the first Test and the start of the second at Lord\u2019s but Stokes was non-committal about changes.While Moeen Ali suffered a blistered spinning finger on his Test recall, limiting his impact on Tuesday, Stokes, who has had concerns about a longstanding left knee injury, was content with getting through 14 overs over the course of the Test.\u201cI think seven days is quite a lot of time to give everyone a good rest,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet up again in three or four days\u2019 time and we\u2019ll assess how everyone\u2019s going.RecommendedArsenal edge closer to Kai Havertz deal and gear up for third Declan Rice bidAlmost two thirds of fans oppose VAR, according to survey of 9,645 supportersManchester City agree deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea\u201cBut I put my body through more than what it\u2019s been through over the last year which is a great sign for myself and a confidence boost for me.\u201cGetting through that knowing we\u2019ve still got four games to come has given me a massive boost.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bcb51ac3318ab2d2417", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/pat-cummins-australia-edgbaston-england-headingley-b2361194.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pat Cummins elated to lead Australia over the line in Ashes thriller", "lead": "Skipper Cummins hit a match-clinching 44 not out during a nerve-jangling final session at Edgbaston.", "author": "Rory Dollard", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 20:54:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:27.578829", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T20:54:07+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/22/c2b6d9c70955ddf1ffcbbddca92af9a7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MzgwMTY4-2.72690866.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAustralia captain Pat Cummins was elated to lead his side over the line in an Ashes nailbiter, four years after ending up on the wrong side of Ben Stokes\u2019 Headingley miracle.Cummins hit a match-clinching 44 not out during a nerve-jangling final session at Edgbaston, finishing off a chase of 281 in ice-cool fashion during a ninth-wicket stand of 55 with Nathan Lyon.Both men had been in the thick of the action during another classic finish in 2019, when England skipper Stokes reeled off a heroic century alongside last man Jack Leach.Lyon, who held firm for 16 not out, botched a run out that would have won that game for Australia and it was Cummins who conceded the winning runs when Stokes pummeled him through the covers.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveIn the afterglow of a two-wicket victory that will live long in the memory, Cummins embraced the chance to square the ledger.\u201cYeah, I would be lying if I said it didn\u2019t (cross my mind),\u201d he said.\u201cWe were on the other side of one in the last series here. When you\u2019re on the other side it feels like one that\u2019s got away and it really hurts.\u201cIt\u2019s a really happy dressing room in there. A lot of those guys were there at Headingley and to clinch one that was perhaps out of our grasp for a little while there is pretty satisfying.\u201cIt\u2019s about having that belief that anyone is a match-winner, you could be the one to step up and win it. When you\u2019re in the backyard playing as a kid you wish to be in these moments, to be here in an Ashes series, that\u2019s what you want and it\u2019s great to be on the winning side.\u201dNeither side ever felt fully in control of a match that stayed remarkably even across five tightly-wound days, but England were the team who did most to propel things towards an exciting finish.The combination of a stubborn pitch and time lost to rain would have killed the prospects of a result had the hosts not moved things forward with rapid run-scoring and a risky declaration on day one.Cummins\u2019 men were much more careful throughout and rode their caution all the way to the winning line, leaving a hollow ring to the chants of \u201cboring, boring Aussies\u201d that rang out from the Eric Hollies Stand.\u201cThe fans were pretty noisy out on the hill. Win or lose we are pretty comfortable with how we go about it,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really good for the last 20 Test matches over two years. Winning is nice. We are at our best when we play at our own pace and tempo. We\u2019re a stable team, we know what we need to be at our best and we\u2019ll keep doing it.\u201dCummins, whose mother Maria died earlier this year, was seen celebrating with his father Peter on the balcony and signed off with an emotional moment.RecommendedBen Stokes \u2018devastated\u2019 as England fall behind after opening Ashes Test defeatRicky Ponting: Australia\u2019s method has stood up and worked against \u2018Bazball\u2019Test cricket the winner after thrilling Ashes clash \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s sporting social\u201cDad\u2019s been here all week, I feel really lucky to have him here because it\u2019s been a tough few months,\u201d he said.\u201cDad was here in 2019 with Mum, so having him here was really special.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt almost happened in slow motion. Pat Cummins sprinted off for a half-lap of honour around the square, the ball trickled over the boundary, and Australia drew first blood in the Ashes with the narrowest two-wicket victory.Some Ashes Tests take on an almost mythological status. England\u2019s two-run victory at Edgbaston in 2005 was one of them, the Headingley Test in 2019 another. People remember where they were, and for those lucky enough to have tickets, they are treasured and displayed.Edgbaston 2023, as it may be known in the future, was perfectly poised to become one of those famous nail-biting conclusions, and unfortunately for England in the evening session, the balance just tipped in favour of Australia, and a 55-run partnership between Cummins and Nathan Lyon was enough for the tourists to chase down the required 281 to win.When play resumed following a rain delay at 2.15pm on the fifth day, all results were still possible. Australia needed 174 runs and England needed seven wickets, in a game known for its intricacies and complexities, it was a straightforward occasion.What unfurled however, was a thrilling contest that ebbed and flowed, the momentum shifted throughout the day.RecommendedThe Pat Cummins delivery that symbolised Australia captain\u2019s importanceEngland vs Australia LIVE: Cricket scorecard and Ashes Test updates from thrilling day fiveOllie Robinson defends Ashes send-off for Usman Khawaja after criticismAt 6pm, Australia needed 63 runs to win, and England three wickets. Every ball was filled with anticipation, fingernails \u2013 if they existed by this point \u2013 were being bitten down to shreds, and there was the prospect of a famous victory for the hosts.Usman Khawaja, the player of the match, put in a mammoth effort to just stay at the crease and try and edge his side over the line with an innings filled with incredible patience, but when he departed for 65 from 197, England gained the upper hand.They had toiled as Australia edged closer, but it was when the captain Ben Stokes brought himself on to bowl that he provided the Midas touch. (Getty Images)His change of pace and style forced Khawaja into an error, and he chopped on, Australia were 209 for seven.With Moeen Ali in trouble with a severely blistered finger, England turned to Joe Root. He took a stunning reaction catch to dismiss Alex Carey for 20. Carey drove and the ball flew towards the former captain who got his hands there in time to take the catch, leaving Australia 227 for eight.Pat Cummins showed intent and kept attacking with two wickets left rather than playing for the draw.It was almost written for Stokes to pull off the impossible, and he came close to taking a one-handed screamer to dismiss No 10 Nathan Lyon, and had it in his hand, but it spilled out in the landing to leave Stokes in agony, flat on his back. (Getty)For England it might have come down to those half-chances, the drop from Stokes, a half-chance that went wide of Ollie Pope at extra cover.The wicket of Alex Carey almost brought a shift in tactics from Cummins, from the defensive well-watched style of Khawaja, he started to hit.

It would have been a stunning diving effort, but as he landed the ball spilled out, and that was it.At that point Australia needed 36 runs to win, but Nathan Lyon would offer no more chances and, with Pat Cummins, he led Australia to victory as they chased 281 to win.RecommendedEngland suffer heartbreak but thrilling Edgbaston Test shows the magic of the AshesRicky Ponting: Australia\u2019s method has stood up and worked against \u2018Bazball\u2019A look at other close finishes in Test history as Australia win Ashes openerIt may go down as one of the greatest Ashes victories from an Australian side not known for their wins by close margins.The match had already evoked strong memories of the 2005 Ashes, where at Edgbaston, England won by just two runs, it is worth noting however, that the home side lost the first match of that series as well, before going on to win in one of the moments that inspired a generation to pick up a cricket bat.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously devastating to be on the losing end of that, going down to the wire with the emotions of that whole day... to get to the end there, eight down with 50 to win you\u2019re thinking we\u2019re just one wicket away but you can never count Australia out,\u201d Stokes said.\u201cPat [Cummins] has dug in there and got them over the line.

I knew coming in here that I would be on the back foot body-wise, which is a place I actually want to be because it means I\u2019m testing myself and pushing myself having played a lot of matches.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI didn\u2019t want to skip a week and I\u2019m proud of myself for going out there and I gave it absolutely everything I had.\u201cUnfortunately I was on the losing side today but I pick myself up and we get ready for the next few events.\u201dBoulter certainly had her chances against Zhu, ranked 39, but she was unable to convert enough of them in a 7-5 7-5 defeat.Boulter began well, opening up a 3-1 lead, but Zhu responded strongly and took her second set point in the 12th game.The second set was a rollercoaster featuring seven breaks of serve and 17 break points.Boulter was only able to take three of her 10 opportunities, though, and \u2013 after saving two match points at 4-5 \u2013 she sent a backhand long on the third, two games later.The quick turnaround meant Boulter was not able to celebrate her big victory, the British number one saying with a smile: \u201cI wish.\u201cI had a team dinner. I was actually getting treatment during that dinner. It was completely normal. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to take some time once I\u2019ve completed all these weeks and I will have a nice team dinner again.\u201dThe player Boulter beat in the final in Nottingham, compatriot Jodie Burrage, also fell at the first hurdle, losing out 4-6 6-2 7-5 in an all-British clash with Harriet Dart.It was nip and tuck throughout, with Dart finally making the breakthrough at the end after Burrage, who played a series of long matches in Nottingham, rolled her right ankle.The 24-year-old is hopeful the injury is not serious, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve just been in to see the doctors and luckily the brace I was wearing saved me. I\u2019ve done that ankle badly twice before so I think a bit of shock got me in the match.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it worse so it hindered me a little bit. I\u2019m sure it will be fine. I think I\u2019m just exhausted and my emotions are a little bit all over the place.\u201dDart, who has been battling tonsillitis, lost to Boulter in the quarter-finals last week before a tense exchange at the net when Dart took exception to her opponent pointing at her head.The British women have spoken often about the friendly atmosphere between them but that appears to be being tested, with Dart and Burrage sharing nothing more than a brief handshake.\u201cI thought she directed something at me so I wasn\u2019t best pleased,\u201d said Dart of Boulter. \u201cI just said to her well played but I didn\u2019t think it was necessary, and that was it.\u201dRecommendedRicky Ponting: Australia\u2019s method has stood up and worked against \u2018Bazball\u2019Test cricket the winner after thrilling Ashes clash \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s sporting socialA look at other close finishes in Test history as Australia win Ashes openerPlay did not get under way until 1.30pm on Tuesday because of rain, with second seed Jelena Ostapenko battling to a three-set win over Czech teenager Linda Noskova in the opening match.The final action saw Russian fourth seed Anastasia Potapova defeat Ukraine\u2019s Marta Kostyuk 6-7 (6) 7-5 6-4 in a match that ended with no handshake or acknowledgement between the players."}, {"_id": "64931bcc51ac3318ab2d241b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-result-queen-s-wimbledon-b2361160.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Andy Murray insists he can compete at Wimbledon despite early Queen\u2019s exit", "lead": "<p>The Scot was comfortably beaten 6-3 6-1 by Alex De Minaur at the LTA\u2019s cinch Championships </p>", "author": "James Reid", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 20:11:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:28.516481", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T20:11:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/20/2023-06-20T182502Z_597231995_UP1EJ6K1E0CIN_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-LONDON.JPG?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The Scot was comfortably beaten 6-3 6-1 by Australian world No.18 Alex De Minaur at the LTA\u2019s cinch Championships, halting his 10-match unbeaten run that saw him win both the LTA\u2019s Lexus Surbiton Trophy and Rothesay Open Nottingham over the past fortnight. The defeat also likely spells an end to any hope of Murray receiving a seeding for Wimbledon, meaning a tough draw likely awaits the two-time champion at SW19, but the 36-year-old is confident he will be ready for whatever comes his way. RecommendedAndy Murray suffers major blow to Wimbledon hopes with defeat at Queen\u2019sRyan Peniston springs another Queen\u2019s surprise with win over Ugo HumbertQueen\u2019s order of play, schedule\u201cRight now the priority is to take a few days rest, physically and mentally recharge a little bit and then go to work on my game,\u201d said Murray. \u201cThe last few weeks there have been lots of positives, I served very well across the two weeks, that wasn\u2019t so much the case today but it is something I will definitely work on. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overanalyse today. There are definitely some things I can do better but at the same time I have done lots of good things over the last couple of weeks and I want to keep going in that direction. \u201cI felt okay going into the match, I just didn\u2019t play very well. \u201cI did pretty much everything that I could do give myself the best chance of playing well. You have to find a bit of balance, I probably would have liked to practice for a bit longer yesterday but you do that and you probably take a bit of energy out of the next day. \u201cI won the tournament last week without dropping a set, only lost one set in Surbiton, was holding serve comfortably, was moving well so there are a lot of positive signs there. \u201cI know my level is there to compete with the top players, I just need to take a few days and get a good week or 10 days work in and I am sure I will be playing well on the first Monday of Wimbledon.\u201d Alex De Minaur was too good for Andy Murray at Queen's (Action Images via Reuters)Murray arrived at Queen\u2019s knowing a run to the quarter-finals would likely raise his ranking enough to secure a Wimbledon seeding, but De Minaur was ultimately too strong, breaking midway through the first set before running away with the second despite Murray saving three match points. It means only injuries and withdrawals can help Murray, who is ranked No.38 in the world, secure a seeding but the three-time Grand Slam champion revealed he is not overly concerned about a potentially difficult draw in the knowledge that few players enjoy playing on grass as much as him. \u201cI knew what the situation was going into the grass season in terms of which tournaments I was going to play and pretty much what I was going to have to do,\u201d he added. \u201cThat didn\u2019t really change, I knew I was pretty much going to either make a final here if I didn\u2019t do well in Surbiton or Nottingham or if I won those events, it was looking like at least a quarter final to do it.\u201cI was aware of that before all of the matches I have played these last few weeks. I dealt with it fine the last two weeks so I don\u2019t think it had any bearing on how I played today. \u201cThere are less players that are comfortable on the surface than clay or hard courts. Some of the seeded players are maybe not that comfortable on the grass so there are some draws that are better than others. \u201cBut there are also some guys like Jordan Thomas who are not seeded who love the grass courts and it\u2019s their favourite surface so we will see what happens when the draw is done.\u201d Murray is now targeting a good run at Wimbledon  (Action Images via Reuters)Murray\u2019s defeat means just two British players remain in the men\u2019s singles draw, with wildcard Liam Broady also suffering defeat on Tuesday. Broady found himself a set up and a break to the good against Adrian Mannarino was slowly reeled in by the experienced Frenchman, who broke decisively at the end of the second set before eventually winning 1-6 6-4 6-3. Elsewhere, there was no plain sailing for world No.2 Carlos Alcaraz, as the Spaniard fought back from a set down to eventually edge past lucky loser Arthur Rinderknech 4-6 7-5 7-6(3). And the 20-year-old admits his expectations are low this grass court season as he looks to gain more experience on the surface. He said: \u201cHonestly my expectations for this tournament are not too high. I have played two tournaments on grass in my [senior] career. It was two Wimbledons, \u201cI have played just five or six matches [on grass] in my career. I have to put in the hours on grass and have more experience.\u201d But while Alcaraz was run close, there were no upsets on the second day in West London with second seed Holger Rune setting up a second-round tie against British wildcard Ryan Peniston with a 7-6(4) 7-6(3) win over Maxime Cressy.

People remember where they were, and for those lucky enough to have tickets, they are treasured and displayed.Edgbaston 2023, as it may be known in the future, was perfectly poised to become one of those famous nail-biting conclusions, and unfortunately for England in the evening session, the balance just tipped in favour of Australia, and a 55- run partnership between Cummins and Nathan Lyon was enough for the tourists to chase down the required 281 to win.England suffer heartbreak but thrilling Test shows magic of the AshesAustralia edged England in a gripping first Ashes Test at Edgbaston thanks to captain Pat Cummins\u2019 final stand with Nathan LyonMike Jones20 June 2023 19:571687288157Australia defeat England by two wickets to win first Ashes TestMore from Ben Stokes: \u201cI am very proud to take it to the end of day five.

Everyone was on the edge of their seat.\u201cWe are not a results-driven team. We are, of course, absolutely devastated. The lads are in pieces up there. But if that\u2019s not attracting people to the game we love then I don\u2019t know what will.\u201cYou have never won a game until you have won it. It was still massively in the balance. We had to come up with different ideas, keep changing things. And it just comes down to small margins in the end. A few chances go our way, there were a few drops as well. But we have four matches to go.\u201cI thought that was a time to pounce [when declaring in the first innings]. I am not going to change the way I have gone about my cricket because it is the Ashes. Who knows we could have got an extra 40 runs or lost two wickets in two balls. I am not a captain who gets by on what ifs.\u201cWe were in control of most of the game and managed to produce a result. Obviously we wanted to be on top. We are devastated but that\u2019s sport. It is great and an emotional rollercoaster.\u201dMike Jones20 June 2023 19:541687287055Australia defeat England by two wickets to win first Ashes TestAustralia opener Usman Khawaja has been named player of the match. He scored 206 runs in the match and helped his team get over the line with a watchful 65 in the final innings. Mike Jones20 June 2023 19:501687286878Australia defeat England by two wickets to win first Ashes TestEngland bowler James Anderson to BBC Test Match Special: \u201cWe are gutted not to get over the line but over the next few days when we look back at what we have done we can be really proud. We have tried to dominate from ball one. \u201cThe declaration was really positive. We fought and fought on a really placid pitch. But credit to Australia they were just to good for us.\u201cThere\u2019s areas we can improve. There always is and in tight games those chances do get put in the spotlight. But we will let it soak in, get over the disappointment and look at the positives.\u201cWe have played some great cricket. We have had five sold out days and everyone has gone home happy. Both sets of fans can go home saying they have been to one of the great Test matches.\u201dMike Jones20 June 2023 19:471687286557Australia defeat England by two wickets to win first Ashes TestAustralia bowler Josh Hazlewood to BBC Test Match Special: \u201cIt was a long hour. I was just sitting in the back of the room watching.\u201cWhen Carey got out we probably thought that was it but Patty (Pat Cummins) is a class batter. An outstanding effort.\u201cIt was an amazing game of cricket. It is still a long series but it is a big swing. The first game is always important.\u201dMike Jones20 June 2023 19:421687286035Australia defeat England by two wickets to win first Ashes TestThe winning moment for Australia: Mike Jones20 June 2023 19:331687285801Australia defeat England by two wickets to win first Ashes TestThe Australian team swarmed the pitch at the end of the game with Nathan Lyon and Pat Cummins leading the celebrations.

Is Andy Murray vs Alex de Minaur on TV? Time, channel and how to watchThe 24-year-old certainly knew his way around a grass court; he is a former Eastbourne champion and reached the fourth round at Wimbledon last year.He was simply too strong for 36-year-old Murray, sending him spinning to a defeat which means, barring an unlikely raft of withdrawals, that he will not be seeded at Wimbledon next month.Murray probably needed to reach the quarter-finals at least to have a chance of being one of the top 32 players at SW19, but now the two-time champion \u2013 currently ranked 38 \u2013 is at risk of facing one of the big guns in the early rounds.Murray\u2019s appearance in the singles may have been fleeting, but tournament organisers will at least be relieved he has opted to play doubles with British number one Cameron Norrie; they face Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram on Wednesday evening.They were breathing a sigh of relief earlier on Tuesday when Carlos Alcaraz survived a scare.The top seed and world number two insisted he can challenge on the grass this summer despite needing a third-set tie-break to beat French journeyman Arthur Rinderknech.The 20-year-old was playing only his seventh match on the surface, and his first outside of Wimbledon.Lucky loser Rinderknech only found out he was playing the Spaniard shortly before midday after fellow Frenchman Arthur Fils, Alcaraz\u2019s scheduled opponent, withdrew from the tournament.But the 27-year-old almost knocked the headline act out, taking the first set and giving Alcaraz an uncomfortable afternoon before going down 4-6 7-5 7-6 (3) in just over two-and-a-half hours.Alcaraz, the US Open champion who was playing his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals at Roland Garros, said: \u201cIt has been a really tough match, he has played four or five matches on the grass and this was my first one.\u201cIt was really difficult to adapt my game to the grass. For me it\u2019s tough to play here, but Queen\u2019s is a tournament I really wanted to play.\u201cI couldn\u2019t play tennis on grass at home but I practised the movement on grass. I practised here a little bit before the tournament and I felt really good, even though it was the first match.\u201cI would say I\u2019m going to be better in the next round.\u201dBritain\u2019s Liam Broady was denied a notable win after world number 46 Adrian Mannarino came from a set down to win in three.RecommendedRyan Peniston springs another Queen\u2019s surprise with win over Ugo HumbertAndy Murray ready for Queen\u2019s and hidden Wimbledon prize withinAndy Murray\u2019s road back as he reaches top 40 with hope of Wimbledon seedingBroady, ranked 97 places behind the Frenchman at 143, raced away with the first set but was pegged back in a 1-6 6-4 6-3 defeat.Fellow Brit Ryan Peniston \u2013 who beat Ugo Humbert on Monday \u2013 will face second seed Holger Rune in round two after the Danish youngster won 7-6 (4) 7-6 (3) against Maxime Cressy for his first career victory on grass."}, {"_id": "64931bcd51ac3318ab2d2420", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/pat-cummins-australia-ben-stokes-england-nathan-lyon-b2361124.html", "primaryCategory": "Cricket", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pat Cummins leads by example as Australia beat England in thrilling Ashes opener", "lead": "The tourists were two-wicket winners at Edgbaston.", "author": "Rory Dollard", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 18:53:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:29.822008", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T18:53:34+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/19/170f8b00f4ab4e0d39dfb82547c10157Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MzcyNTkw-2.72690660.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt almost happened in slow motion. Pat Cummins sprinted off for a half-lap of honour around the square, the ball trickled over the boundary, and Australia drew first blood in the Ashes with the narrowest two-wicket victory.Some Ashes Tests take on an almost mythological status. England\u2019s two-run victory at Edgbaston in 2005 was one of them, the Headingley Test in 2019 another. People remember where they were, and for those lucky enough to have tickets, they are treasured and displayed.Edgbaston 2023, as it may be known in the future, was perfectly poised to become one of those famous nail-biting conclusions, and unfortunately for England in the evening session, the balance just tipped in favour of Australia, and a 55-run partnership between Cummins and Nathan Lyon was enough for the tourists to chase down the required 281 to win.When play resumed following a rain delay at 2.15pm on the fifth day, all results were still possible. Australia needed 174 runs and England needed seven wickets, in a game known for its intricacies and complexities, it was a straightforward occasion.What unfurled however, was a thrilling contest that ebbed and flowed, the momentum shifted throughout the day.RecommendedThe Pat Cummins delivery that symbolised Australia captain\u2019s importanceEngland vs Australia LIVE: Cricket scorecard and Ashes Test updates from thrilling day fiveOllie Robinson defends Ashes send-off for Usman Khawaja after criticismAt 6pm, Australia needed 63 runs to win, and England three wickets. Every ball was filled with anticipation, fingernails \u2013 if they existed by this point \u2013 were being bitten down to shreds, and there was the prospect of a famous victory for the hosts.Usman Khawaja, the player of the match, put in a mammoth effort to just stay at the crease and try and edge his side over the line with an innings filled with incredible patience, but when he departed for 65 from 197, England gained the upper hand.They had toiled as Australia edged closer, but it was when the captain Ben Stokes brought himself on to bowl that he provided the Midas touch. (Getty Images)His change of pace and style forced Khawaja into an error, and he chopped on, Australia were 209 for seven.With Moeen Ali in trouble with a severely blistered finger, England turned to Joe Root. He took a stunning reaction catch to dismiss Alex Carey for 20. Carey drove and the ball flew towards the former captain who got his hands there in time to take the catch, leaving Australia 227 for eight.Pat Cummins showed intent and kept attacking with two wickets left rather than playing for the draw.It was almost written for Stokes to pull off the impossible, and he came close to taking a one-handed screamer to dismiss No 10 Nathan Lyon, and had it in his hand, but it spilled out in the landing to leave Stokes in agony, flat on his back. (Getty)For England it might have come down to those half-chances, the drop from Stokes, a half-chance that went wide of Ollie Pope at extra cover.The wicket of Alex Carey almost brought a shift in tactics from Cummins, from the defensive well-watched style of Khawaja, he started to hit. Inspired by one six down the ground, Australia were on their way.Cummins may score more runs, but he might not ever play such significant innings. Having come to the crease with Australia needing 72, he scored 44 from 73 to drag his side over the line.

The crowd were almost in stunned silence as Cummins roared and jumped into the air in celebration.It was a contest of the highest quality and can only raise interest and attention for the rest of the series.

The hosts rallied from 74 for seven, chasing 186, but Ambrose had the final say, finishing with a 10-wicket match haul when he debatably flicked the glove of last man Craig McDermott with Australia needing just two to seal a series win.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveEngland beat Australia by two runs \u2013 Edgbaston, August 2005\u201cJones\u2026Bowden\u2026Kasprowicz the man to go, and Harmison has done it.\u201d Richie Benaud welcomed a legion of new cricket followers in arguably the greatest Test in the greatest series of all. Australia had recovered from being seven wickets down with plenty to get to set up a grandstand finish. But Michael Kasprowicz fended a Steve Harmison bouncer to Geraint Jones and umpire Billy Bowden raised his crooked finger in a thrilling climax. Almost lost amid the frenzied finish is the fact Kasprowicz should not have been given out as the ball brushed the glove with his hand off the bat. Now, it is regarded as a mere subplot in the narrowest win \u2013 in terms of runs \u2013 in Ashes history.England beat Australia by one wicket \u2013 Headingley, August 2019A matter of weeks after his World Cup final heroics against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s, Ben Stokes produced what may gone down as his magnum opus with an unbeaten 135 which helped England reel in 359 to complete their highest ever run-chase in Tests. An unbroken 76-run stand with last man Jack Leach, who resisted Australia for 17 balls in his one not out, had its fair share of drama but England completed a scarcely-believable victory. Australia, though, retained the urn after a 2-2 series draw.West Indies beat Australia by one wicket \u2013 Barbados, March 1999While the Windies dynasty was crumbling all around them with Australia by now the dominant force in world cricket, Brian Lara rolled back the years with one of his finest innings. Set 308, the Windies lurched to 105 for five but Lara was able to withstand the dual threat of Glenn McGrath, who claimed a five-for, and Shane Warne, wicketless in the fourth innings. Lara\u2019s 153 not out got the Windies over the line after number 11 Courtney Walsh was able to keep out five balls. The series finished 2-2.Sri Lanka beat South Africa by one wicket \u2013 Durban, February 2019With Sri Lanka a fading force after the retirement of several all-time greats in the previous decade, there was only one favourite for this series. And when Sri Lanka slid to 226 for nine in pursuit of 304, that notion was reinforced. But Kusal Perera\u2019s unbeaten 153 helped Sri Lanka to an incredible, against-all-odds victory. His unbroken 78-run partnership with Vishwa Fernando went down as the highest last-wicket stand in a successful fourth-innings chase in first-class cricket. Sri Lanka went on to triumph in Port Elizabeth to become the first Asian side to win a Test series in South Africa.RecommendedPat Cummins leads by example as Australia win thrilling Ashes openerAndy Murray suffers major blow to Wimbledon hopes with defeat at Queen\u2019sEngland waiting to discover where Ukraine Euro 2024 qualifier will be hostedNew Zealand beat England by one run \u2013 Wellington, February 2023England were downed by one run in Wellington as New Zealand became just the fourth side ever to win a game after following on.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePerhaps it was the most successful unsuccessful season ever. Kalvin Phillips has ended his first year at Manchester City with a historic haul of medals. Yet his three trophies outnumbered his two league starts. In all competitions, he only began four games, City lost two of them and the first of those defeats \u2013 to Nathan Jones\u2019 Southampton \u2013 ended up costing them the quadruple.A year like no other at least ended on a personal high, Phillips scoring his first England goal in the 7-0 thrashing of North Macedonia. Then he reflected: \u201cI came to Manchester City to win trophies and we won the trophies but I didn\u2019t play as much as I wanted to do.\u201d If the last part is an understatement, it has only stiffened his resolve.Phillips is adamant he does not want to quit City. To walk away now, he believes, would be to admit defeat. He could attract interest \u2013 maybe from Newcastle or West Ham \u2013 but he hopes to sit out the summer transfer market. \u201cMy intention is to stay there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have just won the treble, so there is no reason for me to leave other than if I am not playing. I will obviously have to think about it. I cannot give it 12 months and say, \u2018I am not playing so I am going to leave\u2019. As you have seen with many players at City, it can take quite a while to cement yourself into the team.\u201dThe decision is not just his. Pep Guardiola made it public that Phillips came back from the World Cup overweight. While the former Leeds man was understudying one of the world\u2019s best defensive midfielders, in Rodri, it was damning that Guardiola also preferred Ilkay Gundogan in the holding role. Some of Phillips\u2019 cameos were so brief \u2013 his last four substitute appearances in the Premier League lasted a grand total of 17 minutes \u2013 to suggest he was not trusted. City\u2019s \u00a342 million outlay to Leeds bought them an expensive fringe player.\u201cI will definitely speak to Pep,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it will be in the summer because everyone enjoys their downtime and everyone wants their space away from football so I\u2019ll probably leave it until I go back for pre-season.\u201dRecommendedThe no-impact substitute: Kalvin Phillips\u2019 ongoing humiliation gives Man City a problemPep Guardiola: It\u2019s up to Kalvin Phillips to show he deserves a Man City futureMan City\u2019s Premier League coronation shows how far their rivals have fallenGuardiola can exile some players but persevere with others. City have their own version of second-season syndrome, where players improve after a year to get used to his methods and tactics. Rodri is a case in point; so are Bernardo Silva and Jack Grealish. Nathan Ake\u2019s breakthrough year was his third. Phillips has been consulting some of those who did not enjoy an immediate impact.\u201cI just know how difficult it is to understand the way Pep wants to play and how quickly you need to adapt to play in his system,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to quite a few of the players about it. Nathan Ake being one, Jack [another]. They all said the same, they all said the first 12 months were the hardest of their City careers but after that it\u2026 it doesn\u2019t become easy, but easier.\u201dA fundamental difference is that, without necessarily flourishing, Phillips\u2019 predecessors featured far more in their debut campaigns than he has; each commanded more of their manager\u2019s faith. Guardiola\u2019s history as a holding midfielder adds intrigue: there are some he feels are naturals for his demands \u2013 like Sergio Busquets and Philipp Lahm \u2013 and others, such as Rodri, who are grooved into the role. Phillips\u2019 time under Marcelo Bielsa, one of Guardiola\u2019s managerial heroes, was expected to stand him in good stead. Instead, he has required another vast learning curve. \u201cI am on the brink of almost getting it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously there is a little bit of work in pre-season and hopefully [I will] be alright.\u201dKalvin Phillips celebrates Man City\u2019s treble during a parade  (PA Wire)His has been an ill-fated first year in one respect \u2013 sidelined at the end of his Leeds career with a hamstring problem, then requiring shoulder surgery when he went to City \u2013 and a fortunate one in another, with three medals from minimal contributions.If staying at City comes with some risks, particularly to his place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s plans, leaving may seem like giving up. A player who worked his way up from being a Championship midfielder to one bought by Pep Guardiola has made his decision. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go away for the off-season and enjoy myself with my family and girlfriend and friends,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then come back fighting.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bcf51ac3318ab2d2427", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/formula-e/season-10-calendar-dates-2024-tokyo-b2360981.html", "primaryCategory": "Formula E", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Formula E announce first-ever Tokyo race in expanded 2024 calendar", "lead": "<p>Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, USA and Mexico all feature on the race plan for season ten </p>", "author": "Karl Matchett", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:34:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:31.594663", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T16:34:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/16/GettyImages-1246622853%20%281%29.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

One of our players was racially abused and it certainly upset and annoyed a lot of our players.\u201cWhen I found the details about it, we as a whole group decided that there was no way we were going to play this game, and I do have to commend the level of maturity that our players showed.\u201cEverybody was calm about it and we stepped aside, we waited out on the pitch \u2013 Kuwait had left the dressing room earlier \u2013 and it was a really disappointing end to our international window.\u201cBut I do think we cannot tolerate this type of behaviour in society, in sport, and for me what we did was the right thing to do and it\u2019s something that we \u2013 certainly with the Under-21s group \u2013 something that we stand for.\u201dThe Kuwaiti federation posted a tweet in which Olympic football team director Jarrah Al Ateeqi claimed the match had been abandoned \u201cdue to roughness and excessive tension between the players\u201d.Monday\u2019s senior international between New Zealand and Qatar, also in Austria, was cut short after the New Zealand Football Association said one of its players, Michael Boxall, had a racist remark directed at him in the first half by a Qatari opponent, and FIFA is set to look into both incidents.Even though the Ireland match was a tier-two friendly and did not require formal approval from the world governing body to be played, the FAI\u2019s determination to report it means they will be obliged to investigate.The New Zealand match was played under FIFA jurisdiction, meaning the referee\u2019s report will be sent to them as a matter of course and they would be expected to take a tough stance if one or both of the allegations were found proven.President Gianni Infantino said last week: \u201cIt\u2019s very important not just to talk about racism and discrimination, but to take action in a decisive and convincing manner \u2013 zero tolerance.\u201cThere is no football if there is racism \u2013 so let\u2019s stop the games.RecommendedYaya Toure leaves Tottenham Academy to join Standard Liege as assistant coachEngland and Australia set up a thrilling finale in first Ashes Test\u2018Devil Baby\u2019 influencer who stalked Chelsea players avoids prison\u201cThe referees have this opportunity in FIFA competitions as we have this process for stopping the game, and actions have to be taken at every level, at national level as well.\u201dInfantino made the remarks after meeting with the Brazil squad in Barcelona, including Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior who has been on the receiving end of repeated racial abuse in Spain this year."}, {"_id": "64931bd051ac3318ab2d2429", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/kalvin-phillips-man-city-england-transfer-b2361012.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Three trophies and four starts: How Kalvin Phillips can bounce back at Man City", "lead": "<p>The England international had more trophies than league starts in his debut season after a \u00a342m move from Leeds</p>", "author": "Richard Jolly", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 16:13:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:32.045345", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T16:13:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/16/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticePerhaps it was the most successful unsuccessful season ever. Kalvin Phillips has ended his first year at Manchester City with a historic haul of medals. Yet his three trophies outnumbered his two league starts. In all competitions, he only began four games, City lost two of them and the first of those defeats \u2013 to Nathan Jones\u2019 Southampton \u2013 ended up costing them the quadruple.A year like no other at least ended on a personal high, Phillips scoring his first England goal in the 7-0 thrashing of North Macedonia. Then he reflected: \u201cI came to Manchester City to win trophies and we won the trophies but I didn\u2019t play as much as I wanted to do.\u201d If the last part is an understatement, it has only stiffened his resolve.Phillips is adamant he does not want to quit City. To walk away now, he believes, would be to admit defeat. He could attract interest \u2013 maybe from Newcastle or West Ham \u2013 but he hopes to sit out the summer transfer market. \u201cMy intention is to stay there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have just won the treble, so there is no reason for me to leave other than if I am not playing. I will obviously have to think about it. I cannot give it 12 months and say, \u2018I am not playing so I am going to leave\u2019. As you have seen with many players at City, it can take quite a while to cement yourself into the team.\u201dThe decision is not just his. Pep Guardiola made it public that Phillips came back from the World Cup overweight. While the former Leeds man was understudying one of the world\u2019s best defensive midfielders, in Rodri, it was damning that Guardiola also preferred Ilkay Gundogan in the holding role. Some of Phillips\u2019 cameos were so brief \u2013 his last four substitute appearances in the Premier League lasted a grand total of 17 minutes \u2013 to suggest he was not trusted. City\u2019s \u00a342 million outlay to Leeds bought them an expensive fringe player.\u201cI will definitely speak to Pep,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it will be in the summer because everyone enjoys their downtime and everyone wants their space away from football so I\u2019ll probably leave it until I go back for pre-season.\u201dRecommendedThe no-impact substitute: Kalvin Phillips\u2019 ongoing humiliation gives Man City a problemPep Guardiola: It\u2019s up to Kalvin Phillips to show he deserves a Man City futureMan City\u2019s Premier League coronation shows how far their rivals have fallenGuardiola can exile some players but persevere with others. City have their own version of second-season syndrome, where players improve after a year to get used to his methods and tactics. Rodri is a case in point; so are Bernardo Silva and Jack Grealish. Nathan Ake\u2019s breakthrough year was his third. Phillips has been consulting some of those who did not enjoy an immediate impact.\u201cI just know how difficult it is to understand the way Pep wants to play and how quickly you need to adapt to play in his system,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to quite a few of the players about it. Nathan Ake being one, Jack [another]. They all said the same, they all said the first 12 months were the hardest of their City careers but after that it\u2026 it doesn\u2019t become easy, but easier.\u201dA fundamental difference is that, without necessarily flourishing, Phillips\u2019 predecessors featured far more in their debut campaigns than he has; each commanded more of their manager\u2019s faith. Guardiola\u2019s history as a holding midfielder adds intrigue: there are some he feels are naturals for his demands \u2013 like Sergio Busquets and Philipp Lahm \u2013 and others, such as Rodri, who are grooved into the role. Phillips\u2019 time under Marcelo Bielsa, one of Guardiola\u2019s managerial heroes, was expected to stand him in good stead. Instead, he has required another vast learning curve. \u201cI am on the brink of almost getting it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously there is a little bit of work in pre-season and hopefully [I will] be alright.\u201dKalvin Phillips celebrates Man City\u2019s treble during a parade  (PA Wire)His has been an ill-fated first year in one respect \u2013 sidelined at the end of his Leeds career with a hamstring problem, then requiring shoulder surgery when he went to City \u2013 and a fortunate one in another, with three medals from minimal contributions.If staying at City comes with some risks, particularly to his place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s plans, leaving may seem like giving up. A player who worked his way up from being a Championship midfielder to one bought by Pep Guardiola has made his decision. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go away for the off-season and enjoy myself with my family and girlfriend and friends,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then come back fighting.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bd051ac3318ab2d242a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/exhibition-fight-explained-professional-bout-difference-b2289095.html", "primaryCategory": "Boxing", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What is an exhibition fight and how is it different to a professional bout?", "lead": "<p>Here are the key pieces of information around professional and exhibition fights </p>", "author": "Sports Staff", "datePublished": "2023-02-24 17:57:12", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:32.288507", "dateUpdated": "2023-02-24T17:57:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/09/25/06/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoxing matches tend to be organised as one of three types: professional, amateur or exhibition. But what is the difference between them?Generally speaking, most \u2018major\u2019 fights \u2013 including title fights \u2013 are professional bouts, while exhibition contests are those staged with more of a focus on the audience and entertainment. Most professional fighters have an amateur career before turning pro, and Olympic fights count as amateur bouts.For example, Anthony Joshua\u2019s Olympic gold-medal win in 2012 was part of his amateur career. Meanwhile, his heavyweight title fights with Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 and 2022 were professional bouts. Elsewhere, Floyd Mayweather\u2019s recent matches against YouTubers Logan Paul and Deji were exhibitions.All fights \u2013 professional, amateur and exhibition \u2013 must be licensed by a commission (e.g. fights in Las Vegas are regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission), but exhibition bouts do not need to be sanctioned by a governing body. In contrast, the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioned Tyson Fury\u2019s three fights with Deontay Wilder, as the WBC heavyweight title was on the line.Professional fights do not need to be title bouts, but they tend to have an effect on the rankings in the weight class in which they take place, as seeded by the governing body sanctioning the fight. I.e. Andy Ruiz Jr is the World Boxing Organization (WBO)\u2019s No 1-ranked fighter below its champions, while Wilder is ranked sixth. If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings.RecommendedFloyd Mayweather vs John Gotti III fight ends with mass brawl in ringThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound boxing rankingsThis is what it\u2019s really like to get punched by Anthony JoshuaFurthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men\u2019s boxing \u2013 a professional bout \u2013 will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women\u2019s world title fight will always be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples).Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter\u2019s record \u2013 and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared.Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib. Readers might expect such fights to be exhibitions, but they have in fact been organised as professional bouts, meaning Paul has a 6-0 record (4 KOs).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe first Ashes Test was balanced on a knife-edge heading into the final session at Edgbaston, with England needing five more wickets and Australia 98 runs short of the winning line.Australia \u2013 chasing 281 \u2013 reached the tea break at 183 for five, with first-innings centurion Usman Khawaja not out for an obdurate 56 and Cameron Green in support on 22no.The start of play was delayed for more than three hours by rain but there was plenty of time for both teams to push for victory when things did get under way at 2.15pm.Stuart Broad removed nightwatchman Scott Boland to raise the volume in the sold out stands and Moeen Ali defied a painful open blister to conjure the wicket of Travis Head for 16.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe wind was with the hosts at that stage, but they could not find a way to disrupt Khawaja\u2019s concentration as he led Green in an unbroken stand worth 40.Australia began in deliberately pedestrian fashion, more intent on soaking up balls than applying any pressure of their own.Their caution kept England at bay for half-an-hour, but while Khawaja looked secure there was always a limit on how long his partner would linger. Boland gave an expectant crowd the release it was looking for when he drove at an inswinger from Broad and sent a thick edge through to Jonny Bairstow.Broad raced away as the stands erupted, once again revelling in his role as the Barmy Army\u2019s ringmaster.Australia\u2019s most free-flowing batter, Head, was next up but he was unable to raise the tempo as he took 13 balls to get off the mark. After an hour\u2019s play there had been just 21 runs, Australia making only the slightest dent in their target.Ben Stokes tossed the ball to Moeen in an attempt to mix things up and the plan paid off almost immediately. Moeen\u2019s first three deliveries cost 10, with two drag downs and a thick edge, but the fourth was a charm. Dipping and turning away from the left-handed Head, it flicked the bat and rested safely with Joe Root at slip.Moeen\u2019s ongoing discomfort was obvious but he allowed himself a broad smile as Head trudged towards the pavilion.Recommended\u2018Devil Baby\u2019 influencer who stalked Chelsea players avoids prisonHappiness key to \u2018best season\u2019 of my career, says England\u2019s Rachel DalyEngland bowler Kate Cross ready for Ashes despite illness during preparationEngland were briefly right on top but the trail quickly went cold.

The 58-year-old actor has been a Hollywood mainstay since the 1980s, having made an impression in films such as Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). In his early career, Downey faced substance addiction and various drug charges. He has been sober since July 2003.Downey was featured on Monday\u2019s edition (19 June) of the Armchair Expert podcast to promote his forthcoming Max show Downey\u2019s Dream Cars.He spoke to co-host Dax Shepard about the time he was sentenced to three years in prison in 1999, aged 34, after repeatedly missing court-ordered drug tests.RecommendedExtraction 2 viewers spot \u2018ridiculous\u2019 blunder in Chris Hemsworth sequelStepson of Titanic submarine\u2019s billionaire passenger Hamish Harding attends Blink-182 gig: \u2018My family would want me to be here\u2019Glastonbury 2023 \u2013 live: Immigration enforcement officers spotted near festival site at Castle Cary stationDowney began to recount the story, claiming that he was \u201cover-sentenced by an angry judge\u201d.\u201cAt some point, he said something in Latin and I thought he was casting a spell on me,\u201d he added, to the amusement of Shepard and co-presenter Monica Padman.The story then jumped to two weeks later, when Downey was in Delano, California at North Kern State Prison, which he described as a \u201creceiving centre where they decide where you\u2019re going to go\u201d. As the location was mainly for organisation purposes, inmates were not separated depending on their crime, meaning that Downey was in the presence of people who had committed severely violent acts. \u201cYou could just feel the evil in the air, and that was no trouble at all because it was kind of like just being in a really bad neighbourhood,\u201d Downey explained, adding: \u201cThere was no opportunity there.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0premiered on HBO in 1998, it was like nothing on TV. A metatextual pastiche of the newspaper advice column, it followed four friends \u2013 Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) \u2013 through the trials and tribulations of being rich, successful, and beautiful in turn-of-the-millennium New York. Whether the show\u2019s candour was an expos\u00e9 of its characters\u2019 lack of self-awareness, or whether the show\u2019s lack of self-awareness imbued its characters with a strange candour, was immaterial: it was a hit. It\u2019s striking, then, that its reboot,\u00a0And Just Like That\u2026\u00a0(Sky Comedy),\u00a0seems entirely ambivalent about all the things that made its forebear great, event TV.Returning now for\u00a0the second series, Carrie is still dealing with the death of her husband and Miranda has transplanted to California and given up her corporate lifestyle. Charlotte, as ever, is given a few taffeta-thin plotlines, and Samantha remains, conspicuously, offscreen. The gang, no longer in their thirties, are dealing with problems from the fag-end of mid-life: truculent teenagers, devious divorcees, marital malaise. \u201cMany years ago I thought I\u2019d start poaching eggs,\u201d Carrie tells her hunky podcast producer, from the rumpled sheets of their bed. \u201cBut I was 30: too busy to slow my roll for a three-minute egg.\u201dThe roll is not much slowed here: Carrie is still on the hunt for a Big replacement, even as her podcast, Sex and the City, flounders. Miranda, having left Steve (David Eigenberg), is discovering herself thanks to non-binary comedian Che (Sara Ramirez). And Charlotte is still finding the slightest excuse to fuss about things. Around them, the new additions to the core cast revolve like wayward satellites: realtor Seema (Sarita Choudhury), professor Nya (Karen Pittman), and Charlotte\u2019s fellow helicopter parent Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker). They\u2019re all invited to the brunches, allowed to sip their Bloody Marys, but never given much of an emotional look-in. \u201cI\u2019m done supporting this pity party for a brilliant, tenured Ivy League professor,\u201d Miranda tells Nya, and that\u2019s, essentially, the show\u2019s position.Much was made when And Just Like That\u2026 first appeared of the attempt to retrofit modern social norms on to the rather dated Sex and the City structure. The inclusion of non-white and non-binary characters, as a foil to the show\u2019s whiteness and straightness, was done with all the subtlety of a climate change theme at Milan Fashion Week.

Lines such as that aside, the new season is actually more sensitive to its prescriptive political correctness (Miranda, for example, engages in a beach-cleaning exercise, only to lose her phone in a mass of seaweed), but it still cannot overcome the cognitive dissonance of combining a hectoring tone with a vision of capitalistic America that would make a Rockefeller blush. In the end, it\u2019s all affirmative and no action.RecommendedBlack Mirror season six review: Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi mishmash needs to stop messing with a winning formulaBest Interests review: Unflinching Sharon Horgan drama imagines parents\u2019 ultimate nightmareThe Crowded Room review: Tom Holland works hard in clich\u00e9d, generic muddleThis would be less of a problem if Darren Star and co\u2019s writing was able to recapture the zingy tone of its predecessor.

Tiredness can effect your concentration, reaction time and the ability to judge risks, which are all things we we need in tip top condition if you\u2019re going to get behind the wheel.Several consecutive nights of disrupted sleep will naturally effect your energy and concentration levels, so, if you\u2019re planning on driving home then you might want to rethink.There are a number of different transport options to get you to and from Glastonbury, so why not opt for a train or bus? Not only will this mean to can enjoy your final night without worrying too much about your energy levels, it\u2019s also a boost to the environment!Recovery day Even if doing all of the above, revellers will no doubt still be worn out by the time they return home, following the long days \u2013 and nights \u2013 of adrenaline and reduced sleep.It\u2019s important to ensure you have an extra day at home to rest and recover after the event. One extra day\u2019s holiday and no plans will help get you back to normal energy levels before taking on your usual routine again.Peony Hirwani21 June 2023 13:15\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a08Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64931bd251ac3318ab2d2432", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/no-hard-feelings-review-jennifer-lawrence-b2361514.html", "primaryCategory": "Reviews", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No Hard Feelings review: Jennifer Lawrence comedy didn\u2019t need the full-frontal nudity and slapstick violence", "lead": "<p>There is complex character work and a pair of brilliant performances here, if you can get past the \u2018outrageous  setpieces\u2019 </p>", "author": "Clarisse Loughrey", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:43:10", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:34.580639", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T13:43:10+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/21/09/DF-05617.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNo Hard Feelings was marketed in the most unappealing way \u2013 as a bad-taste stick prodded into the ribs of its supposedly puritanical audience; a raunchy comedy in which Jennifer Lawrence attempts to seduce a 19-year-old boy. But rarely do films that call themselves \u201cedgy\u201d ever turn out to be more than mildly immature. Director Gene Stupnitsky\u2019s last film, the Jacob Tremblay-headlined Good Boys, heralded itself as the new Superbad. In reality, it was a good-natured, adorable-to-boot adventure into pre-teen befuddlement. His follow-up is no different: all bark, and far better with no bite. Behind the lazy, shock-tactic humour lies a streak of genuine humanity, something to carry the film beyond mere butts and boobs.Here\u2019s an Oscar-winning actor, one of the best of her generation, in the role of Maddie, a 32-year-old native of Montauk, a favoured summer retreat of the New York elite. She can\u2019t keep up with the area\u2019s rising property taxes and is now at risk of losing her late mother\u2019s home. Then she stumbles across a personal ad, posted by a wealthy couple (Laura Benanti and Matthew Broderick) and asking for a woman to date their introverted son Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman) before he shoots off to Princeton University. If she\u2019s successful in bringing Percy out of his shell, she\u2019ll take home a second-hand Buick. Maddie thinks, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She\u2019s had sex for far more frivolous reasons in the past.Maddie was tailor-made for Lawrence by Stupnitsky and his co-writer John Phillips. And it certainly feels like one of the first times we\u2019ve ever seen a film actually attempt to capture the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence, the celebrity: confident, but a little gawky. She\u2019s the head cheerleader if she actually turned out to be nice. Her physical comedy is pristine, as she stomps up the front steps of a house in rollerskates, or tries to seductively scooch a couch across an office. But she\u2019s even better when Maddie\u2019s antics falter, and we\u2019re shown the very lonely person behind them \u2013 a millennial existentially horrified to have reached the \u201cma\u2019am\u201d age, while still feeling as vulnerable and inadequate as the Gen-Zers whose world she\u2019s trying to infiltrate.Maddie and Percy are separated not only by generation but by class, and Stupnitsky and Phillips\u2019s script is surprisingly adept at navigating the somewhat complex power dynamics of this decade-age-gap, sex-work-aligned situationship. Feldman, known mostly for being cast in Broadway\u2019s Dear Evan Hansen at the age of only 16, allows Percy to have emotions beyond \u201cdorky\u201d and \u201chorny\u201d. He\u2019s fully rounded in a way that defies Maddie\u2019s description of him, that he\u2019s \u201cencased in bubble wrap\u201d.The fact Lawrence and Feldman feel so comfortable and honest in their work makes it all the more clumsy, then, when No Hard Feelings rampages into its \u201coutrageous comedic setpieces\u201d. There\u2019s slapstick violence and full-frontal nudity. Someone, inevitably, gets maced. None of it\u2019s silly or clever or even shameless enough to actually be funny. It\u2019s a little ironic that Lawrence\u2019s big showcase of her comedic talent would probably have been a better film if all the jokes had been cut out.RecommendedAndrew Barth Feldman spent a whole summer being (badly) seduced by Jennifer LawrenceAsteroid City review: Wes Anderson\u2019s enrapturing cosmic comedy is an offbeat Close EncountersThe Flash review: Muddled, poignant and \u2013 because of Ezra Miller \u2013 morally trickyDir: Gene Stupnitsky.

In contrast, he suggested that he would have to use more caution if he created it today.\u201cWe weren\u2019t confined in any manner when making Rocky,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cWe made it the way we wanted to make it without anybody looking over our shoulders or even second-guessing ourselves.RecommendedNetflix viewers frustrated after watching new Chris Hemsworth movie Extraction 2Daniel Radcliffe shares feelings about new actor playing Harry PotterOppenheimer historian still \u2018emotionally recovering\u2019 from Christopher Nolan\u2019s film\u201cBut today, there are different areas we have to be careful that we don\u2019t upset people for different reasons.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEven some of Wes Anderson\u2019s most die-hard fans were put off by his 2021 film The French Dispatch, with its three-story structure and stilted, self-conscious evocation of literary France. Anderson hasn\u2019t changed his storytelling technique in the slightest for his new film Asteroid City, but his recent detractors will be relieved nonetheless: this is his most enrapturing feature since The Grand Budapest Hotel nearly a decade ago.As in many of Anderson\u2019s films, the plot comes with multiple framing devices. We first see Bryan Cranston in black and white as an Edward R Murrow-esque TV host who introduces us to an earnest playwright called Conrad Earp (Edward Norton), who is working on the story we are about to watch. Asteroid City, then, is a film within a play within a TV show, or something like that. It is, we are told early on, an \u201capocryphal fabrication\u201d \u2013 and it even has an optional intermission.As soon as the action begins in earnest, the director switches his palette to iridescent Kodak colour. The main setting is Asteroid City, a desert town in the American southwest known for its observatory and enormous meteor crater. The military uses the empty plains to test atomic weapons, while junior stargazers and space cadets flock here to look at the night-time sky. Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman), a pipe-smoking photographer, rolls into town in his station wagon with his children in tow. His wife has recently died and he has her ashes with him. Then the car conks out, meaning he is stuck here. The genial but dim-witted local mechanic (a strong cameo from Matt Dillon) can\u2019t do anything to help. Augie asks his father-in-law Stanley (Tom Hanks), with whom he doesn\u2019t get on, to drive over and rescue them.Anderson has put together one of his huge, familiar ensemble casts. Much of the pleasure here comes from the perfectly calibrated and very deadpan performances from his actors, even those in the minor parts. Rupert Friend excels in a cameo as a singing cowboy with a nice line in folksy, homespun wisdom. Jeffrey Wright is very funny as the gruff military commander who locks down the town after an alien (Jeff Goldblum) puts in an appearance. (The spaceship scenes seem intended as a gentle parody of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.) Steve Carrell is the manager of the motel where our heroes are staying, a place where new settlers can buy themselves parcels of land from vending machines. Tilda Swinton is a scientist in a white coat, desperate to crack the secrets of the universe.While junior stargazers are peering through telescopes or having their first experiences of young love, Augie starts up a strange romance with Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Midge, a suicidal Hollywood star staying in the cabin opposite to him. Johansson is brilliant, embuing her character with both sex appeal and pathos.RecommendedIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, review: Harrison Ford carries this ragged exercise in nostalgiaMay December, Cannes review: Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore are tremendous in this Todd Haynes melodramaJeanne du Barry, Cannes review: Johnny Depp comeback film is surprisingly greatMany of the actors here are Anderson regulars. Newcomers, including a late-arriving Margot Robbie as a worldly stage actor and Maya Hawke as a prim school teacher, adapt brilliantly to the minimalist comedic style that the director favours. Some of the best scenes here involve fellow Anderson neophyte Tom Hanks and his on-screen grandchildren debating what precisely they should do with their mother\u2019s ashes.In its own offbeat way, Asteroid City is an Anderson patchwork of Cold War paranoia and American family values in all their often hypocritical glory.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGlastonbury Festival 2023 is officially underway, with speculation rife as to who might turn up for the mythical \u201csecret sets\u201d that take place over the course of the weekend.The 2023 schedule already includes huge names like Arctic Monkeys, Lizzo and Blondie, but there are still a few spaces left for some surprise performances. Glastonbury recently added Rick Astley and Queens of the Stone Age to the bill, among several other new names.Past secret sets have seen the likes of Lady Gaga, Franz Ferdinand and George Ezra perform.Aside from word of mouth, news about who the TBA performers might be after often shared via the Twitter account @Secretglasto, which claims to notify followers of suspected performances a few hours before they start.The account, which has more than 52,000 followers at the time of writing, has previously been correct on past Glastonbury surprises such as The Killers (2017), The Libertines (2015) and Glass Animals (2017).RecommendedGlastonbury 2023 \u2013 live: Michael and Emily Eavis welcome festival-goers as gates to Worthy Farm openGlastonbury weather: A day-by-day guide to Worthy Farm forecastHow to get tickets for Glastonbury 2024Who are the most rumoured acts for 2023?Sheffield britpop band Pulp is among the frontrunners of acts who might perform secret sets at this year\u2019s Glastonbury.The speculation comes after Glastonbury shared their line up times, and included a random band called The ChurnUps on the Pyramid Stage ahead of the Arctic Monkeys. As a result, many festivalgoers seem to think The ChurnUps is in reference to Pulp, whose reunion tour, which began earlier this month, has a free slot on 23 June. They also think this might be the Sheffield band because if you churn something up, it becomes pulp.Should a Pulp secret set come to fruition, it seems likely that Jarvis Cocker could duet with fellow Sheffield-born musician Alex Turner when Arctic Monkeys headline later that evening. Perhaps even Richard Hawley, who is supporting Pulp on certain dates and has worked with Turner in the past, will make an appearance?Pulp drummer Nick Banks addressed the rumours, writing: \u201cThough it\u2019s very tempting to tease you lot again.

Everything\u2019s Fine by Cecilia Rabess is published in hardback by Picador, priced \u00a316.99 (ebook \u00a37.99). Available nowCecilia Rabess\u2019s debut novel Everything\u2019s Fine has already caused quite a stir online. If it isn\u2019t already at the top of your summer reading list, then it should be. To call it a romance would do the novel a disservice \u2013 it is much more complex than that. It highlights a necessary and familiar debate \u2013 how do you square the circle of having vastly different political beliefs to your loved ones? Jess \u2013 who is black \u2013 and Josh \u2013 who is white \u2013 first meet at university, and once again when they start working at Goldman Sachs. Their working relationship blossoms into a friendship and then, inevitably, a relationship. The novel attempts to reckon with America\u2019s not too distant past and shows the polarisation experienced by American society in the dawn of the Trump age with the eventual strain in the protagonists\u2019 relationship. Intensely readable and relatable, with snappy, smart dialogue, you will stay up to the wee hours devouring this.10/10(Review by Lauren Gilmour)RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live2. The Fire by Daniela Krien is published in hardback by MacLehose Press, priced \u00a316.99 (ebook \u00a39.99). Available nowDon\u2019t go into The Fire expecting a fast-paced, plot-driven book \u2013 instead, it\u2019s a deeply engaging look at one woman\u2019s experience of middle age. Set over three weeks in a remote country house in Germany, Rahel finds herself at a crossroads with her husband Peter: does she still love him? Does he still want her? This is a subdued book, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less captivating. Through Rahel\u2019s not always likeable but very realistic perspective, we learn about her complex relationship with her children and the changing world around her as someone who grew up in a divided Germany. It\u2019s beautifully written, subtle and shines a light on the feelings and desires of middle-aged women \u2013 a group too often ignored.8/10(Review by Prudence Wade)3. The Summer Skies by Jenny Colgan is published in hardback by Sphere, priced \u00a314.99 (ebook \u00a38.49). Available nowThird-generation pilot Morag is ticking off what she\u2019s internalised as a good life: a nice boyfriend, a well-paid promotion and the glamour of long haul. Then her Scottish roots call her home for one last job for her family-owned, island-hopping flight path. Jenny Colgan\u2019s portrayal of the highland archipelago is beautifully done, while the characterisation has real warmth, and Morag comes alive when she finds herself off-the-grid \u2013 and at the mercy of nature \u2013 on the island of Inchborn. The Summer Skies takes at least 100 pages to draw you in but when it finally does, it\u2019s full of comedic details, thought-provoking questions about identity, inner strength and life\u2019s pivotal moments. The ending may have that romantic-comedy predictability but you\u2019ll be racing through the pages to get there nonetheless \u2013 and possibly booking a holiday to the northern Scottish islands too.7/10(Review by Lauren Taylor)Non-fiction4. This Is Not America: Why Black Lives In Britain Matter, by Tomiwa Owolade is published in hardback by Atlantic Books, priced \u00a318.99 (ebook \u00a39.99). Available June 22This Is Not America starts strongly, with a few compelling points \u2013 too long has racism in Britain seen through an American lens, which is unhelpful as the black British experience is vastly different to the black American; and the black British experience is varied and cannot be reduced to one homogenised story. Owolade then goes onto explore this in a bit more detail \u2013 looking at racism in America, where black people largely trace their roots back to violence and slavery, compared to the UK, where black communities broadly come from peaceful immigration. While Owolade makes sure to emphasise he doesn\u2019t want to diminish racism in the UK, some readers might find certain points somewhat controversial, such as Owolade suggesting the incident at a Buckingham Palace event where Ngozi Fulani was asked repeatedly where she\u2019s really from wasn\u2019t necessarily racism.6/10(Review by Prudence Wade)Children\u2019s book of the week5. The Family Tree By Kate Ferdinand, illustrated by Emma Randall, is published in paperback by Puffin, priced \u00a37.99 (ebook \u00a35.99). Available nowEx-TOWIE star and wife of Rio, Kate Ferdinand presents her first children\u2019s book, The Family Tree. This preschool age picture book offers a gentle introduction to the often tricky topic of blended families through a soothing story about fairies, with helpful tips at the end. Brother and sister, Ash and Willow, live harmoniously with their dad, until Dad\u2019s new friend Hazel enters the picture and they worry she is starting to take the place of their beloved mum, who they miss greatly. Especially when Hazel wants to help them bake \u2013 the thing their mum loved most. Ferdinand has clearly reflected on her own experiences \u2013 as viewed in the BBC documentary Rio And Kate: Becoming A Stepfamily \u2013 and it\u2019s a sensitively written book as a result. Though the \u2018fairies baking\u2019 subject matter may be a bit too saccharine (and overdone) for even a preschool audience, the book is sweet and helpful nonetheless.6/10(Review by Holly Cowell)BOOK CHARTS FOR THE WEEK ENDING JUNE 17HARDBACK (FICTION)1.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt takes a lot to make Alice Lowe flinch. As an actor and writer who excels in playing loved-up sociopaths (Sightseers), pregnant widows on killing sprees (Prevenge) and murderous therapists (Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), Lowe, it\u2019s fair to say, is at home in horror. And so it takes something truly awful \u2013 truly horrific, even \u2013 to frighten her. Like, say, learning from Take That\u2019s Mark Owen that he and the rest of his band of Nineties dreamboats have seen videos of her grooving to their greatest hits. \u201cYou\u2019re saying Take That have all watched me be really, really s*** at dancing?\u201d Lowe cringes as she recalls Owen breaking the news to her recently.For what it\u2019s worth, \u201creally s***\u201d isn\u2019t how I would describe it. \u201cYou only saw the best cuts!\u201d the 46-year-old actor and filmmaker protests, sinking deeper into the sofa of the hotel room where we\u2019re chatting. Indeed, only the best cuts made it past Take That\u2019s quality control checks and into Greatest Days, a big screen adaptation of their 2017 jukebox musical. Owen, Gary Barlow and Howard Donald serve as executive producers \u2013 hence their interest in Lowe\u2019s boogying capabilities.Shuttling between the Nineties and the present day, the film follows a group of teenage girls who reconvene in their late thirties to attend their one-time favourite band\u2019s reunion tour. It is a sweet, schmaltzy nostalgia-fest \u2013 and thus a completely left-field choice for Lowe who, since starring in Channel 4\u2019s Garth Maranghi\u2019s Darkplace, has cultivated a specific brand of grisly comedy that tends to involve a little more bite, and a lot more blood. Against the megawatt sunshine of Greatest Days, Lowe is nearly unrecognisable. Even today, I do a double take when I realise the owner of the blonde bouffant in the room was, in fact, Lowe. Her signature pitch black dye-job is no more. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she laughs.Lowe is fine with weird. In fact, it\u2019s been her wheelhouse since she was a nerdy teenager in Coventry listening to Cat Stevens and sketching Medusa in her notebook. The staples of her work \u2013 hybrid genres, complex female leads, unlikeable protagonists \u2013 may be on-screen mainstays by now, but they, too, had once been a weird (and tough) sell. \u201cI was pitching this stuff so long ago and people would say, \u2018What are you talking about? We wouldn\u2019t put comedy and murder together; we wouldn\u2019t put two women fighting each other onscreen\u2019. And now those things get made and they become massive hits, so I feel a mixture of joy that it\u2019s happening but also\u2026 I was wanting to do this for ages!\u201d She slams a fist on the cushion in front of her in mock furore.Lowe did manage to sneak a few past the gatekeepers, though. Most notably, there was Prevenge, a comedy-horror she wrote, directed and starred in as a pregnant serial killer obeying orders from her malicious foetus. Lowe was barely a month shy of her own due date when she shot it. The film debuted to rapturous reviews and jimmied open new doors in the industry for her. \u201cBut even now you meet resistance,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople often want you to write exactly what you\u2019ve written before. There is a pressure \u2013 and I think it\u2019s connected with all this AI stuff \u2013 to make shows and films more uniform, as if you\u2019re obeying an algorithm. It can\u2019t have any anomalies to it.\u201dRecommendedGreatest Days review: The Take That musical film is every bit as nicely generic as you\u2019d imagine\u2018I wanted to use violence in excess\u2019: How women filmmakers reclaimed the revenge movieAndrew Barth Feldman spent a whole summer being (badly) seduced by Jennifer LawrenceEarly on, Lowe didn\u2019t imagine herself on camera. She was studying Classics at Cambridge University when she became interested in experimental theatre, costume design, sound design and set design. Notably, she did not audition for the Footlights, the prestigious sketch comedy troupe whose alumni include Peter Cook, Hugh Laurie, Richard Ayoade, Emma Thompson and Olivia Colman (\u201cI literally had no idea what Footlights was. I just thought it was people in straw boater hats.\u201d) Her memories of Cambridge are a mixed bag. \u201cGod, it was really sexist, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she exclaims with an eye roll. \u201cWithout a doubt, it was a massive privilege to have gone there but at the same time, I came from a comprehensive school, and it was another world. So many posh boys putting you down and making you feel like you can\u2019t amount to anything. I think I carried that with me for quite a long time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s right that things get cancelled. It doesn\u2019t have to be this dreadful thingIn 2001, Lowe found herself at the Edinburgh Fringe in Garth Marenghi\u2019s Netherhead, a low-budget comedy-horror show written by Ayoade and Matthew Holness. It spoofed the works of Stephen King and won the Perrier award, which in turn landed Lowe an agent. Then came a string of sitcom appearances through which Lowe became, if not a recognisable name, then certainly a recognisable face on British telly. The Mighty Boosh, The IT Crowd, Little Britain and Horrible Histories have all welcomed Lowe\u2019s delightful deadpan at one point or another. A number of those shows, though, have faced scrutiny in the time since they\u2019ve aired. Episodes of The IT Crowd and Little Britain were recently removed from their respective streaming services due to offensive material. What does Lowe make of it all? \u201cIt\u2019s funny because in some ways I think things change and we just roll with it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s right that things get cancelled. It doesn\u2019t have to be this dreadful thing \u2013 you don\u2019t have to think of it as censorship. Stuff changes, that\u2019s fine and it\u2019s good. It\u2019s healthy to change.\u201dLowe has noticed a different, equally troubling shift in the industry, in which bigwigs are making up for years of ignoring marginalised groups by greenlighting their features \u2013 but with a catch. \u201cThere is a rigidity about what you\u2019re allowed to make [in those situations],\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019ve got to make a film about being a woman. And it\u2019s got to have a political message that they agree with because that\u2019s the reason they\u2019ve given you the money. You\u2019re not allowed to make whatever you want in the same way a male filmmaker is. It\u2019s not perfect where we\u2019re going. I think it will balance out at some point, but we\u2019re in a flux right now and that flux is going to create carnage. There\u2019s going to be organisations dying and it\u2019s going to be a big change, but you do hope that we\u2019re leading somewhere better... eventually.\u201d The goal, she says, is creativity for creativity\u2019s sake \u201cwithout a policing of what the content is\u201d. Lowe huffs, sounding exasperated by it all.Superfans: Amaka Okafor, Aisling Bea, Jayde Adams and Alice Lowe in \u2018Greatest Days\u2019 (Bron Releasing)Later this year, Lowe will release her second film, Timestalker. It\u2019s a romcom \u2013 \u201cor my deluded, dark version of a romcom\u201d \u2013 which follows a heroine\u2019s pursuit of love across several centuries. \u201cWhen I was writing it, I thought it was about love and fantasy but now I think I\u2019ve just made a film about a woman who has to keep reviving her career.\u201d Lowe lets out a cackle. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what it is to be an actress.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeIt\u2019s for this reason that Lowe wrote Prevenge \u2013 to get herself out there after she was written off for daring to become pregnant and therefore apparently useless. Her experiences as a working mother have been better. \u201cI think if people do have prejudices, they\u2019re quite well hidden.\u201d One thing she\u2019s noticed, though, is a general distrust by some actors of filmmakers like herself. \u201cThis is something that people don\u2019t talk about... if you don\u2019t get star power behind your film, depending on the budget, you can\u2019t make it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think subconsciously there is a trust issue against female independent filmmakers sometimes. It\u2019s like, \u2018Ooh, Ben Wheatley, that\u2019s exciting! Oooh, Ari Aster is exciting!\u2019 and then it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh... Alice Lowe...\u2019\u201dKiller foetus: Lowe in her horror-comedy \u2018Prevenge\u2019  (Shutterstock)Why does she think that\u2019s been the case? \u201cI think female independent film directors are a more risky proposition, and I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s got anything to do with being a mum but I do think there\u2019s a general fear that \u2013 as a female director \u2013 you\u2019re going to be emotional or overly stressed out, or that it\u2019s just going to be a bit worrisome a job.\u201d She continues: \u201cIt\u2019s not directly about being a mother but it does also have something to do with actors worrying that what we\u2019re doing is not as cool. It\u2019s not kewl,\u201d she mews the last word, dousing it in sarcasm. \u201cMums are a bit looked down on generally, [and] culturally in a way that\u2019s a bit buried. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re a mum then you\u2019re not cool \u2013 and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s applied to dads. You don\u2019t go, \u2018Oh that director\u2019s got kids! He\u2019s ancient!\u2019\u201dAgeism undoubtedly feeds into it. Lowe recalls attending meetings with people who were shocked (read: disappointed) to learn she is older than they had previously thought. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that young female directors are tapped into the modern trendy things,\u201d she says, suggesting that\u2019s why industry bosses tend to favour them. \u201cBut really a director should have their unique perspective on everything.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGlastonbury Festival 2023 is officially underway, with speculation rife as to who might turn up for the mythical \u201csecret sets\u201d that take place over the course of the weekend.The 2023 schedule already includes huge names like Arctic Monkeys, Lizzo and Blondie, but there are still a few spaces left for some surprise performances. Glastonbury recently added Rick Astley and Queens of the Stone Age to the bill, among several other new names.Past secret sets have seen the likes of Lady Gaga, Franz Ferdinand and George Ezra perform.Aside from word of mouth, news about who the TBA performers might be after often shared via the Twitter account @Secretglasto, which claims to notify followers of suspected performances a few hours before they start.The account, which has more than 52,000 followers at the time of writing, has previously been correct on past Glastonbury surprises such as The Killers (2017), The Libertines (2015) and Glass Animals (2017).RecommendedGlastonbury 2023 \u2013 live: Michael and Emily Eavis welcome festival-goers as gates to Worthy Farm openGlastonbury weather: A day-by-day guide to Worthy Farm forecastHow to get tickets for Glastonbury 2024Who are the most rumoured acts for 2023?Sheffield britpop band Pulp is among the frontrunners of acts who might perform secret sets at this year\u2019s Glastonbury.The speculation comes after Glastonbury shared their line up times, and included a random band called The ChurnUps on the Pyramid Stage ahead of the Arctic Monkeys. As a result, many festivalgoers seem to think The ChurnUps is in reference to Pulp, whose reunion tour, which began earlier this month, has a free slot on 23 June. They also think this might be the Sheffield band because if you churn something up, it becomes pulp.Should a Pulp secret set come to fruition, it seems likely that Jarvis Cocker could duet with fellow Sheffield-born musician Alex Turner when Arctic Monkeys headline later that evening. Perhaps even Richard Hawley, who is supporting Pulp on certain dates and has worked with Turner in the past, will make an appearance?Pulp drummer Nick Banks addressed the rumours, writing: \u201cThough it\u2019s very tempting to tease you lot again.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeI wasn\u2019t conceived at Glastonbury, but for the first decade of my life I may as well have been. I was, in many respects, a Glastonbury baby. Born and raised in nearby Bristol, I first visited in 1994, aged two with potty in hand, and attended for the five years that followed. I have not been back since. But even if Glastonbury has changed hugely in the decades in between, it still exists as a joyous, creative paradise of jugglers, acrobats and enormous fire-breathing spiders for those lucky enough to experience it as a child. Enough to grant it an almost mythical hold over many of the children who have passed through over the years, like a soothing imprinton the soul.Back then, against the withering judgements of outraged co-workers, my parents saw it as an adventure and an education, for themselves and for me. My dad sometimes worked there as a steward, picking up litter and ushering in guests in exchange for a free ticket. But the tickets themselves were also relatively affordable \u2013 around \u00a350 each, picked up from a local ticket shop, with under-12s getting in for free. Too broke to afford any sort of overseas holiday, Glastonbury was our version of an annual family sojourn, and a bargain considering what was on offer.Music lovers and former punks, my parents felt at home there primarily for political reasons. As alien as it might appear today in the era of Wayne and Coleen Rooney arriving by private helicopter, Glastonbury was formally the main fundraiser for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and widely recognised as a space for anarchist bands and protest, both of which my parents were active in. To me, unaware of the anti-capitalist ethos that historically underpinned it all, it was mainly a land full of pretty colours and loud noises, a sensory dream factory that felt earthy and magical and escapist.It was also terrifying. I was a nervous child at the best of times, but there was something in Glastonbury\u2019s lawless energy that felt particularly disquieting, with every part of it somehow ripe with danger. I remember spending the entirety of REM\u2019s headlining set in 1999 with my eyes locked on the chunky yellow lantern we had bought from Woolworths several weeks earlier, so sure that someone would come along and scoop it up. And that same paranoia permeated my time there over the years. It appeared whenever I ventured into the site\u2019s long drop toilets, erected above enormous communal pits holding a festivals\u2019 worth of human waste, with seats wide enough that I felt constantly at risk of falling in. And the tents in which we rested were natural incubators for childhood fear; I was certain that they would be unzipped and rifled through by maniacs, likely when we were sleeping. And that was only if they hadn\u2019t been stolen altogether while we were out exploring. Every walk back from one stage or another was buoyed by a persistent feeling of dread. I\u2019d be certain that we\u2019d return to a gaping patch of grass where our makeshift home used to be, the tent having been pilfered by some imagined criminal hippie.The irony of it all is that Glastonbury has long been safe for kids. Certainly it is now, having become about as dangerous as your average Hay Festival. But even 25 years ago and in the last gasps of its more unpredictable youth, where the only newspaper headlines Glastonbury regularly spawned involved criminality and overdoses, it was always strictly PG unless you went out of your way to look for the badness. And for the children there, many of us being exposed for the first time to alternative lifestyles or individuals under the influence, it served as an unparalleled education.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Live updates as Arctic Monkeys headline set in doubt over Alex Turner\u2019s acute laryngitis30,000 steps a day and \u2018Glasto Lip\u2019: What it\u2019s like to work at Glastonbury FestivalGlastonbury weather: Latest Met Office forecast predicts sunny festival with the odd showerFreelance arts worker and PhD student Megan Vaughan regularly went to Glastonbury with her dad throughout the Nineties, and remembers a specific moment from one of their first trips there. \u201cIt started raining one afternoon and everyone obviously ran for shelter under the nearest tree or marquee,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut there were a group of people who stayed dancing in the rain outside a burger van, and I remember my dad stopping me and pointing out that those people were \u201con drugs\u201d.\n\nMy parents skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J\u201cI threw more awkward questions at him in those four days every summer than at any other time in his life as a father. I was hearing new terminology for different kinds of drugs, new swear words and new sexual references \u2013 I had certainly never encountered anything like that back in Macclesfield. I guess I was very lucky that I had a cool dad who was ready to answer those difficult questions in an adult way for me.\u201dOne of the odd side effects of the Glastonbury experience for a child is that sudden dissolving of shame, where sights or words that we recognise, consciously or not, as \u201cadult things\u201d suddenly become less frightening or at least OK to be talked about. It\u2019s likely a product of so much forced intimacy \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen each other caked in mud, and heard the neighbours in the next-door tent make noises that no four-year-old should ever hear, so what difference would an awkward question make?And it applies to the music, too. The acts I have vivid memories of seeing as a kid are often of the more commercial Top of the Pops variety, purely because those were the big pop anthems I unashamedly loved as a kid. I have absolutely no memory of seeing Johnny Cash on the Pyramid Stage in 1994, which my mum always insists that I witnessed, but I sure as hell remember sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders while Heather Small sang \u201cMoving on Up\u201d the day before.

But being a child at Glastonbury also means a brilliant absence of good taste, with no awareness of what it means to be cool or the importance of being seen at the right places.Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cWe used to print off a clash list and highlight what we all wanted to see and compare what sacrifices we had to make,\u201d recalls film journalist Millicent Thomas, who went to Glastonbury three times with her parents between the ages of 11 and 13. \u201cBecause obviously they couldn\u2019t let me just go off and see the bands I wanted to see. I can\u2019t remember who it was they skipped, but I remember they were really gutted about it because they skipped this really big band they loved so that 12-year-old me could see Jessie J. I feel so bad looking back on it.\u201dMillicent, aged 11, with her dad at Glastonbury 2011  (Millicent Thomas)Most of all, childhood is the best way to spot just how transformative Glastonbury can be, its excess and noise not only creating a vast new world unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before, but shifting how you see yourself.Glastonbury threw me into a state somewhere between childhood and adulthood. I had never felt more young, nor more aware of my physical size, but I also remember feeling oddly defiant and assertive. Glastonbury was terrifying in its loose recklessness, but not so much that I didn\u2019t feel like it could bend to my will if I thought hard enough. Here was a space where typical rules didn\u2019t apply, where my parents wouldn\u2019t be as firm or as protective as they were at home, I thought. I recall being genuinely hurt that they refused to let me see Scream 2 at the festival\u2019s cinema tent in 1998, as if merely being at Glastonbury meant it would be OK for a six-year-old to watch.And it\u2019s a strange power that feeds into why I\u2019m in no rush to go back. Those years were so formative that the idea of returning would feel like the worst kind of nostalgia, with its inevitable disappointment and awareness of the changes that have occurred. And where once speculation that Kate Moss had been spotted walking around the campground was written off as an unlikely rumour, the festival is now so bombarded with celebrities, gourmet food trucks and luxury tents that there\u2019s little chance of it feeling the same.Millicent agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself wanting to go again,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are different kinds of crowds that go now, and it\u2019s got a lot bigger \u2013 I just don\u2019t think I could manage it. I think I\u2019d be very anxious there now.\u201dA far younger Adam White, aged around 2 or 3, at an early 1990s Glastonbury (Adam White)But Glastonbury still lingers in other ways, regardless of how alien it is to me today. I still get a nostalgic rush from seeing a truly pitch-black night sky unburdened by street lights or buildings, throwing me back to seeing it for the first time in Pilton, and the acts I remember enjoying back then are still in semi-regular rotation on my phone. And that includes, with zero shame, The Corrs.Megan has gone back with friends as an adult, her trips with her dad brought to a close after a year in which she \u201cgot off with a teenage boy a couple of years older than me on the second day and then completely disappeared\u201d. But how it\u2019s changed in the interim or whether she\u2019s physically there every year are also largely irrelevant, with Glastonbury long having seeped into her everyday life.\u201cI work in the most experimental edges of fringe performance now,\u201d she explains, \u201cand I can absolutely see that the things that I was discovering at Glastonbury in those theatre and circus fields, or the late-night cabaret stuff or the weird X-rated spoken word, and all the weird subcultural, surreal visuals in those performance areas, all informed my taste as an adult but also my career. It was totally an appetite that I developed when I was a kid there.\u201dFor a few years as a teenager, I was sure that I might have imagined my time at Glastonbury, existing as it did in arbitrary images or strange flashes, while our photo albums laid untouched for a decade. But found buried at the bottom of an old suitcase, when I was 20 or so, was a child-sized T-shirt from Glastonbury 1999, the festival\u2019s logo on the front and that year\u2019s line-up printed on the back. It was partly infuriating, decorated in the names of bands I love today that I could have seen then but didn\u2019t. But it was heartwarming most of all, a physical object confirming what an unusually exciting time I had for a few summers when I was barely a person. I no longer understand how I could have ever fit inside of it, but it brings me unparalleled joy knowing for a fact that I once did.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Full line up and stage times How to watch the BBC\u2019s live Glastonbury coverageGlastonbury weather forecast \u2013\u00a0all the updates you needThis piece was originally published in June 2019Glastonbury 2023 is held from Wednesday 21 June to Sunday 25 June"}, {"_id": "64931bdf51ac3318ab2d245c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/worthy-farms-children-music-glastonbury-festival-b2361370.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The earthy magic and lawless energy of being a child at Glastonbury festival", "lead": "<p>Adam White recalls the years he was more interested in seeing The Corrs than Courtney Love, and when the colours, noise and fire-breathing spiders gripped his imagination</p>", "author": "Adam White", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 06:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:47.280076", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T06:00:39+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/26/17/meglasto3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I recall being genuinely hurt that they refused to let me see Scream 2 at the festival\u2019s cinema tent in 1998, as if merely being at Glastonbury meant it would be OK for a six-year-old to watch.And it\u2019s a strange power that feeds into why I\u2019m in no rush to go back. Those years were so formative that the idea of returning would feel like the worst kind of nostalgia, with its inevitable disappointment and awareness of the changes that have occurred. And where once speculation that Kate Moss had been spotted walking around the campground was written off as an unlikely rumour, the festival is now so bombarded with celebrities, gourmet food trucks and luxury tents that there\u2019s little chance of it feeling the same.Millicent agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself wanting to go again,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are different kinds of crowds that go now, and it\u2019s got a lot bigger \u2013 I just don\u2019t think I could manage it. I think I\u2019d be very anxious there now.\u201dA far younger Adam White, aged around 2 or 3, at an early 1990s Glastonbury (Adam White)But Glastonbury still lingers in other ways, regardless of how alien it is to me today. I still get a nostalgic rush from seeing a truly pitch-black night sky unburdened by street lights or buildings, throwing me back to seeing it for the first time in Pilton, and the acts I remember enjoying back then are still in semi-regular rotation on my phone. And that includes, with zero shame, The Corrs.Megan has gone back with friends as an adult, her trips with her dad brought to a close after a year in which she \u201cgot off with a teenage boy a couple of years older than me on the second day and then completely disappeared\u201d. But how it\u2019s changed in the interim or whether she\u2019s physically there every year are also largely irrelevant, with Glastonbury long having seeped into her everyday life.\u201cI work in the most experimental edges of fringe performance now,\u201d she explains, \u201cand I can absolutely see that the things that I was discovering at Glastonbury in those theatre and circus fields, or the late-night cabaret stuff or the weird X-rated spoken word, and all the weird subcultural, surreal visuals in those performance areas, all informed my taste as an adult but also my career. It was totally an appetite that I developed when I was a kid there.\u201dFor a few years as a teenager, I was sure that I might have imagined my time at Glastonbury, existing as it did in arbitrary images or strange flashes, while our photo albums laid untouched for a decade. But found buried at the bottom of an old suitcase, when I was 20 or so, was a child-sized T-shirt from Glastonbury 1999, the festival\u2019s logo on the front and that year\u2019s line-up printed on the back. It was partly infuriating, decorated in the names of bands I love today that I could have seen then but didn\u2019t. But it was heartwarming most of all, a physical object confirming what an unusually exciting time I had for a few summers when I was barely a person. I no longer understand how I could have ever fit inside of it, but it brings me unparalleled joy knowing for a fact that I once did.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Full line up and stage times How to watch the BBC\u2019s live Glastonbury coverageGlastonbury weather forecast \u2013\u00a0all the updates you needThis piece was originally published in June 2019Glastonbury 2023 is held from Wednesday 21 June to Sunday 25 June"}, {"_id": "64931bdf51ac3318ab2d245d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/how-to-watch-glastonbury-live-bbc-stream-b2360652.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glastonbury Festival 2023: How to watch the BBC\u2019s live coverage", "lead": "<p>Arctic Monkeys, Lizzo, Guns N\u2019 Roses and Elton John will all be taking to the Pyramid stage for this year\u2019s event</p>", "author": "Megan Graye", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 06:56:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:47.556385", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T06:56:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/18/09/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Tiredness can effect your concentration, reaction time and the ability to judge risks, which are all things we we need in tip top condition if you\u2019re going to get behind the wheel.Several consecutive nights of disrupted sleep will naturally effect your energy and concentration levels, so, if you\u2019re planning on driving home then you might want to rethink.There are a number of different transport options to get you to and from Glastonbury, so why not opt for a train or bus? Not only will this mean to can enjoy your final night without worrying too much about your energy levels, it\u2019s also a boost to the environment!Recovery day Even if doing all of the above, revellers will no doubt still be worn out by the time they return home, following the long days \u2013 and nights \u2013 of adrenaline and reduced sleep.It\u2019s important to ensure you have an extra day at home to rest and recover after the event. One extra day\u2019s holiday and no plans will help get you back to normal energy levels before taking on your usual routine again.Peony Hirwani21 June 2023 13:15\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a08Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64931be051ac3318ab2d2460", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/extraction-2-chris-hemsworth-netflix-b2360785.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Extraction 2 viewers spot \u2018ridiculous\u2019 blunder in Chris Hemsworth sequel", "lead": "<p>Australian actor returns as Tyler Rakes in the new Netflix sequel </p>", "author": "Louis Chilton", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 04:27:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:48.791343", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T04:27:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/11/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Now, however, the movie has also faced mockery on social media after a clip was shared highlighting a regrettable filming blunder.In the footage, which occurs roughly 45 minutes into the scene, Hemsworth\u2019s character can be seen exchanging gunfire with an enemy helicopter.RecommendedNetflix viewers frustrated after watching new Chris Hemsworth movie Extraction 2Oppenheimer historian still \u2018emotionally recovering\u2019 from Christopher Nolan\u2019s filmDaniel Radcliffe shares feelings about new actor playing Harry PotterAs he tries to avoid getting shot, Rakes takes cover behind a ladder \u2013 offering almost no barrier whatsoever between his body and the oncoming bullets.\u201cI\u2019m watching Extraction 2 and Chris Hemsworth has just taken cover behind a ladder,\u201d one person wrote, sharing a clip of the moment on Twitter.Others piled in with amused reactions to the incongruous scene, sharing comments on social media.\u201cIt worked, didn\u2019t it,\u201d one person joked, while another described the moment as \u201cridiculous\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s taking steps to protect himself,\u201d punned another, while someone else remarked: \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s bad luck to hide behind a ladder.\u201dIrish comedian Dara \u00d3 Briain jokingly explained: \u201cThis would work because the wavelength of the bullets is longer than the gaps in the ladders.

The crew heard banging sounds every 30 minutes on Tuesday and again four hours later, after additional sonar devices were deployed.Here\u2019s what we know so far:What happened?On Sunday morning (18 June) at 9am Atlantic Daytime Time, the Titan, a submersible owned by OceanGate Expeditions, set off on its excursion to the Titanic\u2019s underwater grave with the research vessel the Polar Prince. The expedition began with a 400-nautical-mile journey out into the Atlantic Ocean, about 900 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Titan prepares to launch from its submersive platform on a test run (OceanGate/YouTube)The submersible was then released from its surface ship and began its descent 13,000 feet below the water\u2019s surface to the wreckage. The vessel is supposed to transmit a signal back to the Polar Prince every 15 minutes but it lost contact around 11.47am ADT, one hour and 45 minutes into the submerge.What happened to the sub and its occupants remains a mystery.Former British Navy Rear Admiral Chris Parry told Sky News that the OceanGate Expeditions vessel could have fallen foul of a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d or even have become tangled up in the debris of the famed shipwreck.\u201cThere\u2019s an optimistic option and that\u2019s that it\u2019s either lost an umbilical communication with the surface or indeed there\u2019s been a malfunction and the submarine continues to operate but obviously out of contact with its mother ship,\u201d Mr Parry said.\u201cObviously on the other end of the scale, there could have been an accident. It could have become entangled in the wreckage of the Titanic. It could indeed have had a catastrophic failure.\u201dThe OceanGate Expeditions submersible vessel named Titan (PA Media)OceanGate Expeditions alerted the US Coast Guard around 6.40pm ADT after the missing sub after failed to surface and its expected time, 4pm ADT. Immediately, a search effort began for the overdue submersible. Where did it go missing?It is unclear where exactly the sub went missing but the= US Coast Guard said it was searching 900 miles east of Cape Cod \u2013 where the famed Titanic shipwreck lies beneath the surface.The Titanic shipwreck sits approximately 12,500 feet at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, about 380 nautical miles south of Newfoundland, Canada and 1,240 nautical miles east of New York City. The shipwreck\u2019s coordinates are 41\u00ba43\u201932\u201dN, 49\u00ba56\u201949\u201dW.The US Coast Guard said it was searching in water depth of \u201croughly 13,000 feet\u201d.In a press conference on Monday (19 June), Rear Admiral John Mauger said the area the submersible went missing is \u201cremote\u201d which makes the search challenging.

He gave a damning estimate that those on board the vessel now have just 40 hours of oxygen supply left inside the sub.While Captain Frederick hammered home that it is \u201can estimate\u201d, under the parameters, the oxygen supply will run out by 5.30am ET on Thursday.The world\u2019s deepest under sea search and rescue missionMultiple agencies, multiple nations and both private and public entities are desperately working together to locate and rescue the five missing on board the Titan submersible.The search is unlike anything that has ever been executed before \u2013 making this the deepest underwater search and rescue mission in the world.Search and rescue efforts are being led by the US Coast Guard in Boston but the Canadian Coast Guard, Canadian Armed Forces, US Navy and others are involved in the search. The US Coast Guard deployed two C-130 aircrafts, the New York Air National Guard deployed another C-130, the Canadian Coast Guard deployed one C-130 and one P-8 aircraft.A US Navy Curv-21, an unmanned submersible vessel that can reach a depth of 20,000 feet, is being used in the search for the missing Titanic wreck vessel (US Navy)In addition, several Canadian Coast Guard ships, a French research vessel L\u2019Atalante and commercial vessels are being used in the search.The Royal Canadian Navy has also deployed HMCS Glace Bay, which carries a medical team specialising in dive medicine. Onboard the ship is a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber that can be used to treat or prevent decompression sickness.As of Tuesday (20 June), over 10,000 square miles had been searched.But, despite the multi-agency mission, David Concannon, an attorney and explorer who pulled out of the Titanic expedition at the last minute, claimed that the rescue efforts have been hampered by red tape, bureaucracy and a lack of urgency by the US government.Banging noises overheard One Canadian P-8 aircraft reportedly detected intermittent banging noises from the area the divers disappeared on Tuesday (20 June).On Twitter, the US Coast Guard based in Boston said it \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area. As a result, ROV operations were relocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises.Internal email updates sent to Department of Homeland Security leadership read: \u201cThe P-8 deployed sonobuoys, which reported a contact in a position close to the distress position. The P8 heard banging sounds in the area every 30 minutes. Four hours later additional sonar was deployed and banging was still heard.\u201dThe memo however did not state exactly when the banging was heard. The Coast Guard wrote: \u201cThose ROV searches have yielded negative results but continue.\u201dWho are the five missing?Hamish Harding is one of the people aboard the Titan.Mr Harding, 58, previously travelled on the Challenger Deep to the bottom of the ocean and on Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin into space.

Perched on a mountaintop near the city of Da Nang, the distinctive bridge is designed to look as if it is being held up by a giant pair of hands.Pont du Gard Aqueduct, FranceThe Pont du Gard was built in Roman times (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Claiming the title of the oldest bridge in this list, the Pont du Gard aqueduct is a Roman monument built in the first century AD. Originally designed to supply the city of N\u00eemes with water, this three tier aqueduct is 50 metres in height. Constructed from soft, yellow limestone rock, this remarkable edifice was declared a historical monument by the French government in 1840. Golden Gate Bridge, USAThe Golden Gate Bridge has become an iconic structure (Getty Images/iStockphoto)A contender for the world\u2019s most famous bridge, San Francisco\u2019s iconic crossing opened in 1937 \u2013 just six months after the city\u2019s other main bridge, the (Oakland) Bay Bridge \u2013 at a cost of $35m at the time. Painted in international orange, the opening of the structure to the public resulted in a week-long celebratory fiesta. Last year, the US government approved a $400m project to help protect the bridge against earthquakes. Hartland/New Brunswick Bridge, CanadaNew Brunswick Bridge is the longest covered bridge in the world (Rex)Opened in 1901, the longest covered bridge in the world was declared a National Historic Site in 1980. Also known as a \u201ckissing bridge\u201d, the 391m long structure dates back to when young men \u201ctrained\u201d their horses to stop halfway across the bridge in order to steal a few kisses, before continuing on to the other side. This one-way bridge was covered over in 1922 despite opposition from local people, who worried that \u201ccovering\u201d the bridge was a threat to the moral fibre of the young people. In 1995, a Canadian postage stamp was issued honouring the bridge. Eshima Ohashi, JapanThe Eshima Ohashi Bridge connects Matsue, Shimane and Sakaiminato over Nakaumi lake (Getty Images)Looking at a picture of this infamous bridge, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for some sort of endurance run for racing cars. Proof that you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover, this seemingly incredibly steep motorway only has a maximum gradient of 6.1 per cent. For comparison, cyclist\u2019s favourite Box Hill in Surrey has an average gradient of five per cent. At just over one mile, the Eshima Ohashi Bridge connecting Matsue and Sakaiminato is the largest rigid frame bridge in Japan. 1915 Canakkale Bridge, TurkeyA view of the 1915 Canakkale Bridge (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Opened in March last year, the 1915 Canakkale Bridge is now the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a distance of 2,023 metres on its main span. Overall, the structure measures 2.9 miles long, and was built over five years at a cost of \u00a32.1bn. It won the record from the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan, and will serve a connecting link on Turkey\u2019s new K\u0131nal\u0131-Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7anakkale-Bal\u0131kesir motorway. Sky Bridge, Czech RepublicSky Bridge 721 opened in May 2022 (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The world\u2019s longest suspension footbridge opened in May 2022 in the Dolni Morava region in the east of the country. Measuring 721 metres long and just 1.2 metres wide, it overtook the recently-opened Arouca 516 in Portugal by 154 metres, and sits 95 metres above a steep valley for a unique, if perhaps unsettling, walk in the Dolni Morava resort.George Washington Bridge, USAThe George Washington Bridge is the busiest in the world (Getty Images)One of several famous bridges in the Big Apple, the George Washington bridge is the busiest bridge in the world, reportedly carrying over one hundred million vehicles per year (or up to 250,000 per day). The original structure was completed in 1927, though a lower level was opened in 1962, meaning that today the bridge shuttles vehicles over 14 different lanes of traffic (the most of any bridge in the world).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNestled high in the Baltics, Estonia\u2019s burgeoning popularity has long moved beyond simply the stag party crowd. Step outside the culture-filled cities, all steeped in medieval history, and you\u2019ll find half of this compact country is pure nature, covered in dense coniferous forest and preserved peat bogs, while just off the west coast are 2,000 virtually uninhabited islands dotted with wooden windmills, blinking lighthouses and the occasional isolated community. With its famously clean air and rich cultural heritage of handicrafts and folk music, Estonia is peaceful, natural, and entirely unexpected.Travel restrictions and entry requirementsThere are no Covid-19 restrictions for travellers entering Estonia.

Each season has its benefits: the crisp air of spring and early autumn are beautiful times to visit, when nature comes to the fore but tourist numbers reduce.

Kadriorg Art Museum is housed in a Baroque palace, Toompea Castle plays host to parliament, and street parades regularly dance between the perfectly preserved Viru Gates. The best way to explore? Get lost on foot in Tallinn\u2019s walled Old Town, following needle-sharp Gothic church spires and steep alleyways that open into large courtyards lined with pastel painted Hanseatic merchant houses. Find modern life wrapped in history in Estonia\u2019s capital  (Getty Images)For panoramic rooftop views, walk along the city\u2019s still-intact defensive walls to climb the six-storey rotund guard towers \u2013\u00a0or take the modern route with the 314m-high TV Tower\u2019s observation deck. Tallinn\u2019s vibrant cafe culture and teeming nightlife of subterranean bars explains its stag party popularity (check out former fishing village Kalamaja, now a popular student neighbourhood), but the edges of the capital offer the nature Estonia\u2019s known for: Stroomi beach is primed for surfing, Paljassaare Peninsula is a birdwatcher\u2019s paradise, and the dramatic J\u00e4gala waterfall is surrounded by hiking trails.TartuKnown as Estonia\u2019s second city, Tartu is famous for its lively student population thanks to the historic and still operational 17th-century university. A boisterous and creative energy runs rampant in Tartu, past bronze statues and down wide bicycle-friendly streets that lead to playgrounds, museums and huge green spaces. The Botanical Garden is a must, as are the Gothic ruins of Tartu cathedral at Toome Hill. The Supilinn district \u2013\u00a0\u201cSoup Town\u201d \u2013 was once a 19th-century slum, and\u00a0still features original wooden houses on streets named for soup ingredients, such as peas and potatoes.

Try to visit for Tartu\u2019s \u201cStudent Days\u201d, held biannually in spring and autumn, when students hold boat rallies and water jousting across the city.Here\u2019s why Tartu, Capital of Culture 2024, should be on everyone\u2019s lipsSaaremaa islandEerie and ethereal Saaremaa is Estonia\u2019s largest island, and a historian\u2019s dream. Over time, Saaremaa has been home to pirates and Vikings, ruled by four different nations, and even contains 7,000-year-old craters and Bronze Age stone walls at the Kaali meteorite site \u2013\u00a0all of which have led to a wealth of mythology on the island. Explore the dolomite stone castle in Saaremaa\u2019s capital (the best-preserved medieval castle in the country) and chase ancient traditions inside the wooden Anga windmills, before immersing yourself in the adventures at Asva Viking Village. The tranquil S\u00f5rve Peninsula, created when Estonian hero Great T\u00f5ll threw rocks at the devil, according to legend, is a haven for birdwatchers and hikers. But the best views are from the striking black and white S\u00f5rve lighthouse: at 52m, it\u2019s the tallest on the Baltic Sea.Get away from it all with a visit to Saaremaa  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)P\u00e4rnuOnce a coastal summer retreat for the wealthy then a sanatorium town during Soviet occupation, P\u00e4rnu\u2019s faded glamour still launches into life each summer. Jazz festivals held on the expansive white sand beach attract young families and \u201calternative\u201d crowds, while hikers explore coastal meadows right on the seafront. P\u00e4rnu\u2019s centrepiece, a grand neoclassical spa, sets the tone for wandering past brightly painted wooden villas set on wide, tree-lined boulevards. It\u2019s classic seaside fun, just two hours from the capital.Best under-the-radar destinationsNarvaCalled the \u201cwild east\u201d, frontier city Narva teeters close to Russia\u2019s border, divided only by a river of the same name. It\u2019s a fascinating spot for Soviet history and architecture fans; heavily bombed in WWII, Narva experienced a rather Stalinist rebuild that is still visible today. Hermann Castle still stands despite the bombing \u2013\u00a0a 13th-century relic amid the industrialism \u2013 and offers good views of Ivangorod castle on the Russian riverbank. The city\u2019s promenade along the river is particularly beautiful at sunset.KihnuAn hour\u2019s ferry ride from P\u00e4rnu is Kihnu, an island home to just 500 inhabitants. Cultural heritage is strong here: women wearing striped woollen skirts drive sidecar motorbikes and open trucks through impossibly tall pine tree forests, explaining their uniquely traditional lifestyle to visitors. At night, a lack of light pollution means spectacular stargazing, and the island\u2019s end-of-summer bonfire festival in August \u2013 which spans the entire Baltic coastline \u2013 reveals dozens of international fires flickering on the horizon.Summer solstice celebrations on Kihnu  (Getty Images)Soomaa National ParkHumans have lived in the wetlands of Soomaa since the Stone Age, and this ancient wilderness of peat bogs and rivers is now home to a wealth of wildlife. Visitors can spot brown bears, wolves, elk, and golden eagles, and the Beaver Trail leads past a number of dams. Soomaa\u2019s 40,000 hectares are best explored during Estonia\u2019s \u201cfifth season\u201d, when annual springtime floods allow for kayaking, canoeing and bog-shoe hikes through the watery meadows. Raised wooden walkways are built above the boggier parts for cyclists to traverse, and Sooma\u2019s historic farmhouses are on stilts for when the floods transform them into impromptu islands.Best things to do\u201cBikepack\u201d along the Baltic coastThe shoreline may be rocky but Estonia\u2019s well-maintained roads are loved by cyclists, particularly the flat terrain in the north and west. The clearly marked EuroVelo 10 route takes \u201cbikepackers\u201d north from P\u00e4rnu, along 981km (610 miles) of Estonia\u2019s coast (including three islands accessed by ferry) until it reaches the Russian border at Narva.

Locals bring their own whisks of birch twigs (called vihta) to hit their skin with; you can purchase your own for a few euros.Find a local festivalFor a true taste of local culture and tradition, attend one of Estonia\u2019s many festivals, like P\u00e4rnu\u2019s beachside jazz festival each July or Saaremaa\u2019s food festival in September. Viljandi\u2019s folk music festival is held in the town\u2019s medieval castle, while Kihnu\u2019s bonfire festival marks the end of summer, ushering in Tallinn\u2019s wintertime Black Nights Film Festival. Most special of all is the 30,000 strong choir that joins the Estonian Song Festival once every five years, filling Tallinn with a chorus of unmatched proportions (the next iteration is in 2025).Getting aroundEstonia\u2019s tiny size means domestic flights aren\u2019t common or necessary. Trains link Tallinn with various larger towns, and LuxExpress buses cover the rest of the country\u2019s long-distance routes. There are well established public transit networks in major cities.A baroque palace houses Kadriorg Art Museum  (Getty Images)Ferries departing from Estonia\u2019s west coast service many of the islands, and taking a hire car on board is no issue. Estonia was the first country in the world to implement nationwide charging points for electric vehicles \u2013 including on the islands \u2013\u00a0so rent-a-car road trips are particularly eco-friendly.How to get thereThe cheapest way to get to Estonia is a direct flight to Tallinn Airport, which takes three hours from London Stansted (Ryanair) or London Gatwick (easyJet). AirBaltic and WizzAir fly indirect routes from the UK.Though there are no direct trains running from Western Europe into Estonia, fans of overlanding can arrive by taking the Eurostar, catching onward trains to Hamburg and Stockholm, then a ferry to Tallinn.Money-saving tipSummer in Estonia is packed with Scandinavian tourists, particularly in July. To take advantage of the warm weather and daylight hours for hiking and cycling, aim for the shoulder seasons: either in April/May or late August into September. Prices and people reduce but the cooler temperatures are still comfortable for outdoor pursuits.FAQsWhat\u2019s the weather like?Temperate, warm summers (18\u201322C) and cold, snowy winters, with a fair amount of rain throughout the year. Humidity is rather high due to forested land and proximity to the sea, and it can get much colder and windier on the coast.What time zone is it in?GMT+2.What currency do I need?Euros.

The five passengers aboard were hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, getting to view the Titanic wreckage.Follow the latest updates on the missing Titanic submarine hereBut, in a chilling echo of the fate of the doomed 1912 vessel, the adventure took a dramatic turn.Just one hour and 45 minutes into the journey, the submersible lost contact with the surface ship.Five things we know about the missing Titanic submersibleNow, more than three days on, the watercraft is nowhere to be found.RecommendedTimeline of missing OceanGate Titanic sub\u2018Banging\u2019 heard in search for missing Titanic tourist submarine with less than 24 hours of oxygen left \u2013 liveWhere is the Titanic wreck \u2013 and how far down is it?In a press conference on Tuesday (20 June) afternoon, Captain Jamie Frederick of the US Coast Guard assured people that authorities are doing everything possible to locate the missing vessel as the search intensified with more technology.Mr Frederick confirmed that the vessel has\u201c40 to 41 hours\u201d of oxygen supply left, meaning it is expected to run out around 5.30am ET on Thursday.He also acknowledged that officials do not know if crews will be able to rescue the people on board even if they do manage to find the sub before the oxygen runs out.In a dramatic turn, a Canadian aircraft searching for the missing sub detected intermittent banging noises from the vicinity where the divers were last located. The crew heard banging sounds every 30 minutes on Tuesday and again four hours later, after additional sonar devices were deployed.Here\u2019s what we know so far:What happened?On Sunday morning (18 June) at 9am Atlantic Daytime Time, the Titan, a submersible owned by OceanGate Expeditions, set off on its excursion to the Titanic\u2019s underwater grave with the research vessel the Polar Prince. The expedition began with a 400-nautical-mile journey out into the Atlantic Ocean, about 900 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Titan prepares to launch from its submersive platform on a test run (OceanGate/YouTube)The submersible was then released from its surface ship and began its descent 13,000 feet below the water\u2019s surface to the wreckage. The vessel is supposed to transmit a signal back to the Polar Prince every 15 minutes but it lost contact around 11.47am ADT, one hour and 45 minutes into the submerge.What happened to the sub and its occupants remains a mystery.Former British Navy Rear Admiral Chris Parry told Sky News that the OceanGate Expeditions vessel could have fallen foul of a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d or even have become tangled up in the debris of the famed shipwreck.\u201cThere\u2019s an optimistic option and that\u2019s that it\u2019s either lost an umbilical communication with the surface or indeed there\u2019s been a malfunction and the submarine continues to operate but obviously out of contact with its mother ship,\u201d Mr Parry said.\u201cObviously on the other end of the scale, there could have been an accident. It could have become entangled in the wreckage of the Titanic. It could indeed have had a catastrophic failure.\u201dThe OceanGate Expeditions submersible vessel named Titan (PA Media)OceanGate Expeditions alerted the US Coast Guard around 6.40pm ADT after the missing sub after failed to surface and its expected time, 4pm ADT. Immediately, a search effort began for the overdue submersible. Where did it go missing?It is unclear where exactly the sub went missing but the= US Coast Guard said it was searching 900 miles east of Cape Cod \u2013 where the famed Titanic shipwreck lies beneath the surface.The Titanic shipwreck sits approximately 12,500 feet at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, about 380 nautical miles south of Newfoundland, Canada and 1,240 nautical miles east of New York City. The shipwreck\u2019s coordinates are 41\u00ba43\u201932\u201dN, 49\u00ba56\u201949\u201dW.The US Coast Guard said it was searching in water depth of \u201croughly 13,000 feet\u201d.In a press conference on Monday (19 June), Rear Admiral John Mauger said the area the submersible went missing is \u201cremote\u201d which makes the search challenging. Combined with the fact that the sub could be on the surface of the ocean or underneath makes for a challenging operation.OceanGate said in a statement: \u201cOur entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families\u201d.It added that the company is \u201cdeeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to establish contact with the submersible.\u201dAt Tuesday\u2019s press conference, US Coast Guard Captain Jamie Frederick confirmed that there is still no sign of the Titan. He gave a damning estimate that those on board the vessel now have just 40 hours of oxygen supply left inside the sub.While Captain Frederick hammered home that it is \u201can estimate\u201d, under the parameters, the oxygen supply will run out by 5.30am ET on Thursday.The world\u2019s deepest under sea search and rescue missionMultiple agencies, multiple nations and both private and public entities are desperately working together to locate and rescue the five missing on board the Titan submersible.The search is unlike anything that has ever been executed before \u2013 making this the deepest underwater search and rescue mission in the world.Search and rescue efforts are being led by the US Coast Guard in Boston but the Canadian Coast Guard, Canadian Armed Forces, US Navy and others are involved in the search. The US Coast Guard deployed two C-130 aircrafts, the New York Air National Guard deployed another C-130, the Canadian Coast Guard deployed one C-130 and one P-8 aircraft.A US Navy Curv-21, an unmanned submersible vessel that can reach a depth of 20,000 feet, is being used in the search for the missing Titanic wreck vessel (US Navy)In addition, several Canadian Coast Guard ships, a French research vessel L\u2019Atalante and commercial vessels are being used in the search.The Royal Canadian Navy has also deployed HMCS Glace Bay, which carries a medical team specialising in dive medicine. Onboard the ship is a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber that can be used to treat or prevent decompression sickness.As of Tuesday (20 June), over 10,000 square miles had been searched.But, despite the multi-agency mission, David Concannon, an attorney and explorer who pulled out of the Titanic expedition at the last minute, claimed that the rescue efforts have been hampered by red tape, bureaucracy and a lack of urgency by the US government.Banging noises overheard One Canadian P-8 aircraft reportedly detected intermittent banging noises from the area the divers disappeared on Tuesday (20 June).On Twitter, the US Coast Guard based in Boston said it \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area. As a result, ROV operations were relocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises.Internal email updates sent to Department of Homeland Security leadership read: \u201cThe P-8 deployed sonobuoys, which reported a contact in a position close to the distress position. The P8 heard banging sounds in the area every 30 minutes. Four hours later additional sonar was deployed and banging was still heard.\u201dThe memo however did not state exactly when the banging was heard. The Coast Guard wrote: \u201cThose ROV searches have yielded negative results but continue.\u201dWho are the five missing?Hamish Harding is one of the people aboard the Titan.Mr Harding, 58, previously travelled on the Challenger Deep to the bottom of the ocean and on Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin into space. He wrote on Facebook on Saturday to announce that he was joining OceanGate Expeditions for its Titanic mission this week.\u201cI am proud to finally announce that I joined OceanGate Expeditions for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic. Due to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023,\u201d Mr Harding wrote.Hamish Harding  (Jannicke Mikkelsen via REUTERS)He has not posted online since.On Monday \u2013 as news of the missing submersible broke \u2013 Mr Harding\u2019s stepson Brian Szasz confirmed that his stepfather was on board the vessel when it went missing.The father-of-two is a seasoned explorer and holds three Guinness World Records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel when in March 2021, he and ocean explorer Victor Vescovo dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench. In June 2022, he went into space on Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket.Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, is also one of the five. A friend \u2013 and fellow Titanic expert \u2013 Larry Daley confirmed to CBC that Mr Nargeolet, French diver, was also on the vessel. Mr Nargeolet is described by OceanGate as the \u201cTitanic\u2019s greatest explorer\u201d and has done 35 dives in the submersible.Paul Henri Nargeolet, director of underwater research at Premier Exhibitions, Inc (Getty)Shahzada Dawood, a 48-year-old businessman and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood were also on the Titan to visit the Titanic wreckage.The Dawood family released a statement about the father and son saying: \u201cWe are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety.\u201dShahzada Dawood is confirmed missing on the submarine (WEF)The fifth person was confirmed to be OceanGate Expeditions CEO Stockton Rush \u2013 the company confirmed in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.Mr Rush, 61, began his career as a pilot before obtaining an undergraduate and MBA.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf you\u2019re looking for a fresh take on city life in the 21st century, Florida is definitely the state for you. From eclectic Key West to ritzy Palm Beach, and historic St Augustine to happening Tampa, this is an urban landscape of rich variety and surprising cultural influences.True, there\u2019s still a heavy beach vibe in places, as befitting a state with 8,426 miles of tidal shoreline \u2013 second only to Alaska in the US \u2013 but that coastal mindset is subordinated in most instances, giving rise to a proliferation of different styles and regional variations.State capital Tallahassee, in the north-west, is actually far removed from most of its city brethren in both geographic and cultural terms, while much of southern Florida can feel more like the Caribbean than the US. It makes for a compelling destination that is easy to explore and throws up a multitude of unexpected experiences, especially in history and the arts.For eight highly contrasting examples, here\u2019s our cross-section of contemporary conurbations.Read more on Florida travel:RecommendedIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksBest cheap hotels in New York to stay for style, location and valueBest hotels in New York: Where to stay in Manhattan, Brooklyn and moreBest beaches in FloridaThe ultimate guide to Orlando\u2019s best theme parksHow to explore Wynwood, Miami\u2019s coolest neighbourhoodOrlandoIt\u2019s worth getting beyond the theme parks and experiencing the real Orlando (Simon and Susan Veness)For the majority, the biggest draw in the US is not a city so much as a collection of theme parks, which is a major loss on their part, as the actual city of Orlando is a bright, modern setting of parks, museums, performing arts and excellent restaurants (with 44 in the 2023 Michelin Guide). The downtown is a m\u00e9lange of thriving districts, studded with immigrant cultures from Cuba, Vietnam and Latin America, as well as craft breweries, while the city suburbs of Winter Park and Winter Garden are inviting destinations in their own right, with a distinct caf\u00e9 society vibe.Best hotels in OrlandoKey WestKey West has a 'Floribbean\u2019 flavour (Simon and Susan Veness)Known as the principal hangout of full-time drinker and part-time writer Ernest Hemingway, the US\u2019s southernmost city of the contiguous 48 is a bubbling concoction of bars, brews and beaches, plus has a thriving LGBTQ+ scene. Built on its signature sunsets and the big game fishing that first attracted Hemingway, Key West most exhibits the \u2018Floribbean\u2019 flavour that mixes Florida with the Caribbean and treats flip-flops as de rigueur. But whisper it quietly, this is also now the place for fine dining and luxury resorts, in sharp contrast to Duval Street \u2013 the city\u2019s version of New Orleans\u2019 Bourbon Street.TallahasseeTallahassee is Florida\u2019s political hub (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Virtually all of Florida\u2019s politics are centred on this idiosyncratic city of 200,000 souls that has more in common with its southern neighbours Alabama and Georgia than it does with the rest of the Sunshine State below it. Its numbers are also boosted by around 70,000 during college term time as one of the biggest university towns in the south-east, including Florida State and Florida A&M universities. The latter ensure there\u2019s a healthy arts and cultural scene to go with a rich African-American heritage that includes the Frenchtown and Smokey Hollow districts, along with the John G Riley House Museum.St Augustine St Augustine is the US\u2019s oldest city (Simon and Susan Veness)Not many people know this, but America\u2019s oldest city is not in Virginia or Massachusetts, but the east coast of Florida. Dating back to 1565, St Augustine was founded by the Spanish conquistadores on the look-out for the Fountain of Youth, leading to an almighty colonial scramble in this part of the world. The upshot was superb monuments like Castillo de San Marco and Fort Matanzas, idiosyncratic St George Street, and a cuisine that borrows as much from Mallorcan influences as American. It is also a supremely graceful city with some of the best architecture in the state.Palm Beach Palm Beach is the epicentre of Florida shopping chic (Getty Images/iStockphoto)California has Rodeo Drive, and Florida counters with Worth Avenue, the epicentre of Florida shopping chic. This city was established as a hot-spot for well-to-do northerners by railroad baron Henry Flagler in 1888, and it has retained its cachet of exclusivity ever since, including Flagler\u2019s former mansion that is now a museum. Its beachy coastline is studded with modern-day mansions, chief among them the Mar-a-Lago Club (home of a recent former president). Restaurants are equally stylish, most notably at Flagler\u2019s mega 1926 resort, The Breakers, Florida\u2019s answer to historic Hotel del Coronado in California.Tampa With new flight routes from the UK, Tampa is in vogue (Simon and Susan Veness)When it comes to mixing 19th-century heritage with contemporary sensibilities, nowhere beats the city by the bay in 2023. With both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic now offering direct flights to this west coast gem, you know it has to be an in-vogue destination, and here\u2019s why. Its Riverwalk axis is one of the most eye-catching in Florida; it is the state\u2019s powerhouse for craft breweries; it is fast assembling a catalogue of upscale resorts, including the unique Epicurean Hotel, which fully lives up to its gourmet name; and it boasts a captivating back-story as the Cigar Capital of the World.Where to experience the hip side of TampaMiamiMiami mixes Latin American culture with Art Deco architecture (Peter W. Cross)You could be forgiven for thinking Miami is both North and South American in origin. The Latin vibe is unmistakable, fuelled by Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants and exhibited in unabashed style in creative cuisine and glittering nightlife. But then there\u2019s the fab beach-fringed Art Deco district, testament to a 1930s boom, and a modern arts culture so highly regarded it stages America\u2019s annual artistic tour de force, the Art Basel show. Add in designer shopping, thrilling sports teams and the natural wonderland of the Everglades on Miami\u2019s doorstep, and this is a multi-hued city experience indeed.Best hotels in MiamiJacksonville Jacksonville is Florida\u2019s biggest city (Simon and Susan Veness)Recommended\u2018Drunk\u2019 woman jumps off Disney World ride and starts screaming at other visitorsThe ultimate guide to Orlando\u2019s best theme parksIn defence of Disney\u2019s $2,400-a-night Star Wars hotel \u2013 from the ultimate superfanIf you thought any of the above were Florida\u2019s largest city, here\u2019s another surprise \u2013 it is Jacksonville, and it\u2019s not even close, with more than twice the metro residents to nearest contender Miami (one million to 480,000).

What we do know of course is the wreck site is off the grand banks, it\u2019s a long way from anywhere and the nearest rescue facility will be on the East Coast of the United States.\u201dOceanGate Expeditions, a company offering eight-day tourist missions to see the Titanic wreckage at a cost of $250,000 per person, confirmed on Monday that its submarine was lost at sea with crew members on board.The company said in a statement to CBS News that it is \u201cexploring and mobilizing all options to bring the crew back safely.\u201d\u201cOur entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families,\u201d it said, adding that it is \u201cdeeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible\u201d.The exact number of people missing remains unclear but the company\u2019s submersibles can carry up to five people at a time. An OceanGate Expeditions submersible like the one missing in the Atlantic Ocean  (OceanGate/YouTube)It is also unclear if they are all crew members or if some are paying tourists.There has been no communication from the sub for more than seven hours, according to Sky News. It usually sends signals to its mother ship every 15 minutes.The submersible operates by being launched from a mother ship which then later recovers it at the end of its mission.A search and rescue operation led by the Boston Coast Guard is currently under way in the Atlantic Ocean.The Titanic wreckage at the bottom of the ocean  (Gamma-Rapho/Getty)The rescue mission will be \u201cvery difficult\u201d, said Mr Parry \u2013 pointing to the \u201cundulating\u201d sea bed, the fact the Titanic lies in a trench on the sea floor and that the debris of the shipwreck will make it challenging to locate the sub using sonar. \u201cThe only hope I think one has is that the mother ship will have a standby craft that will be able to go down and investigate immediately what is going on,\u201d he said.When asked how quickly this could happen, he said that \u201cany responsible organisation would have another submersible ready to go down at an hour\u2019s notice\u201d. If the company doesn\u2019t, he said it could take up to a couple of days for search teams to send such a craft from the east coast.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFrancois Le Doze, chief commercial officer for Eurostar, was candid when I spoke to him earlier this year. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of need to do \u00a329 promotions,\u201d he said.The cross-Channel intercity rail firm has not had a great few years. Eurostar depends on large numbers of passengers shuttling from London to Paris, a fair number to Lille and Brussels, and rather fewer to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.During the Covid pandemic, traffic dried to a trickle. At the start of 2021, for example, the UK imposed a 19-week ban on all international leisure and family travel; by the end of that year, France was excluding British holidaymakers in an obviously futile attempt to slow the spread of Omicron.As travel restrictions unravelled, anyone at the company who dared to imagine \u201cthings can only get better\u201d clearly hadn\u2019t heard of Brexit. As part of the UK showing Europe who\u2019s boss, our government demanded that British travellers should be regarded as \u201cthird country nationals\u201d by the European Union \u2013 hugely increasing the processing time at EU borders.There happens to be just such a frontier at London St Pancras International, the Eurostar hub. It was constructed at a time when no one imagined French frontier officials would need to do anything other than check every UK passenger had a valid passport.RecommendedSunak rules out any new EU trade deal that undermines Brexit freedomsTory MP broke rules over \u00a3150,000 loan from Russian businessmanWhat is the future of the Conservative Party?Our negotiators valiantly insisted on subjecting us to rules that require the border staff to check the total time spent in the European Union in the past 180 days, possibly ask about our financial means and stamp our passports. This, as you will understand, takes far more time; in the confines of a cramped area beneath a Victorian rail station, that translates to more space required.As a result, Eurostar is having to cap the number of passengers who can be carried on its trains. In a near-monopoly market, when the supply of seats goes down, fares go up commensurately. Which is why Francois was frank about cheap seats.Since the end of the Covid era, I have seen no \u00a329 one-way seats on sale. But in a suddenly announced summer flash sale, until 11pm BST on Thursday 22 June, some \u00a335 tickets are available from London to Paris, Lille and Brussels \u2013 subject to tight terms and conditions.You can travel between 10 July and 7 September, but not at weekends. This shows squarely the trains that Eurostar is seeking to fill. For most of July, all of August and the beginning of September, business travellers who would normally take their seats on the Channel Tunnel trains vanish for the beach, leaving some seats unfilled.Weekends, conversely, are busier than normal as families and other tourists tend to head for the continent on Saturdays and Sundays.A sprinkling of other \u201cblack-out\u201d dates applies: typically from London at the start of the main summer holidays in the third week in July, and over the August bank holiday weekend.Even so, says Eurostar: \u201c29,000 tickets are up for grabs.\u201dThat looks a large number. But is it? Well, assuming people go for \u00a335 each-way deals then it represents 14,500 travellers, spread over about 38 days, or about 380 per day \u2013 less than half a Eurostar train.To complicate matters, there are 7,500 outbound tickets from London to Paris \u2013 yet 10,000 inbound. Going out from London to Lille or Brussels (it\u2019s all the same to Eurostar), we have to fight over 5,000 tickets, while there are 6,000 coming back.How elusive are they? I am looking at Tuesday 1 August for a week. Outbound to Paris, only the 8.01pm is available. With an arrival shortly before midnight in the French capital, this plainly does not suit anyone hoping to make an onward connection. Coming back a week later, five trains are currently available \u2013 either the first of the day (7.13am) or one of four late afternoon/early evening departures. To/from Brussels on the same dates, even though there are fewer trains you can choose from a wider spread of departures.RecommendedEurostar could be forced to stop running London-Amsterdam trains for almost a yearRescuers race to find missing Titanic tourist sub that has less than 2 days of oxygenWoman booked on Gatwick-Edinburgh flight told by easyJet to travel via BerlinSo hurry \u2013 in terms of cheap travel this summer, things can\u2019t get any better.Listen to Simon Calder\u2019s podcast on the latest Eurostar deal"}, {"_id": "64931be751ac3318ab2d2478", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/easyjet-cancelled-flights-gatwick-edinburgh-berlin-b2360133.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "EasyJet tells passenger booked on Gatwick-Edinburgh flight to travel via Berlin after storms cancel services", "lead": "<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Passenger had not brought her passport for the domestic flight </p>", "author": "Simon Calder", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 15:59:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:55.487326", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T15:59:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/19/13/easyJetLGWBEREDI.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

For the tarka: This blend uses whole spices; simply mix the seeds together and store in a jar for when you need them.2. For the garam masala: Put any whole spices into a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar. Grind. Then add in any powdered ingredients and mix by hand to combine. Label and store in a clean jar in a cool, dark place for up to six months.3. For the harissa: Put any whole spices into your coffee grinder or pestle and mortar. Grind to your desired consistency. Then add in any powdered ingredients and your chilli flakes, garlic granules and salt. Mix by hand to combine. Label and store in a clean jar in a cool, dark place for up to six months.4. For the time-saving ginger-garlic: Peel and roughly chop your ginger and garlic and add to your blender with the salt and oil. Blend until you have a smooth paste. Either scoop into a clean jar or bottle and store in the fridge or freeze in ice-cube trays and pop out a cube when you need to cook.5. For the butter chicken: First make the marinade by combining all the ingredients in a large, non-metallic bowl. Add the chicken and give everything a good stir to combine. Cover and leave in the fridge overnight if you can, or for at least two hours to permeate the meat.6. When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chicken pieces with the marinade, and fry until browned, turning just once and resisting the urge to move them around the pan. They will need about three minutes on each side (you will finish cooking the chicken later in the sauce). Set aside.7. Give the pan a quick wipe and put it back over the heat. Add the ghee and, when hot, add the tarka and allow the seeds to sizzle and pop for around 30 seconds, being careful not to burn. Next, add in your onion slices and stir to coat them in the spice-infused ghee. Cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Once the onions have started to sweat and become translucent, add in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for about a minute. When the raw smell has disappeared, add in the garam masala. Cook for a further 10 seconds, stirring to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan and burns.8. Next, add the tomatoes, harissa and salt. Cook over a low-medium heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool a little, then, using a stick blender directly into the pan, carefully blend your sauce until it is completely smooth. If you\u2019re finding the sauce is splattering around too much, transfer it into a deeper pan for this step.

That\u2019s before there\u2019s any mention of the amount of waste each used cartridge can amount to.That\u2019s where the Epson EcoTank ET-2820 All-in-One Wireless Inkjet Printer (Was \u00a3209.99, now \u00a3179.99, Currys.co.uk) comes in. Featuring Epson\u2019s EcoTank technology, The et-2820 replaces proprietary plastic cartridges with refillable ink tanks that can have a serious saving on your printing costs while still being able to print, all without the added hassle of cartridge reloads.Save up to 90 per cent on your printing costsRefilling printer ink can be a fiddly and messy process, not to mention the added difficulty of where to responsibly dispose used cartridges once they have been depleted. EcoTank technology means that each tank can be individually topped up from a bottle, which not only saves on the amount of plastic used per refill but also significantly reduces the cost of ink. It\u2019s no small bonus that as an inkjet, EcoTank has a positive impact on your energy bills as well, particularly compared to more energy-intensive laser printers.Each printer comes bundled with four refillable bottles \u2013 one for each tank \u2013 which provides up to three years worth of printing, or 7,500 colour pages to be more precise. Ink levels are also clearly displayed in transparent containers at the front of the printer, so there\u2019s no need for second guessing when the ink might run dry midway through a printing job.When you do eventually make it through each bottle, they can simply be disposed of with household recycling, so there\u2019s no need to plan a trip to your local recycling point or feel a pang of guilt for throwing it out with your household waste.No more messy cartridges (Currys)The \u201cjust fill and chill\u201d mentality, courtesy of none other than Usain Bolt, Epson\u2019s brand ambassador, is central to the EcoTank experience that places convenience and affordability at its centre, while still able to print up to ten pages per minute.It\u2019s why the ET-2820 is designed with the busy household in mind. Whether that\u2019s transferring documents from your hybrid office or printing off homework assignments, its all-in-one scanning, printing and copying capabilities make it well suited to a variety of different tasks all around the home, from the comfort of your smart device or the printer\u2019s 3.7cm LCD display.The Epson Smart Panel app enables you to control your printer with great ease. You can print, copy and scan documents and photos, set up, monitor and troubleshoot your printer, and let the creativity flow with a range of artistic templates to choose from. The ET-2820 also features Apple AirPrint, for even easier printing from your Apple device of choice.What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no physical connection needed \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as connecting the printer to your home wi-fi in order to print from anywhere in your home.Buy Now \u00a3179.99 at Currys.co.ukTo find out more information about EcoTank you can find it at https://www.epson.co.uk/en_GB/for-home/ecotank"}, {"_id": "64931be851ac3318ab2d247d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/let-nature-in-with-tom-schneider-furniture-inspired-by-the-beauty-of-the-natural-world-b2349056.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Let nature in with Tom Schneider furniture, inspired by the beauty of the natural world", "lead": "<p> Contemporary classics using natural woods and curvaceous lines   </p>", "author": "", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:42:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:48:56.982084", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T14:42:18+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/31/16/Crest_dining_table_scene_tom_schneider-01.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "If you\u2019re searching for some high quality, contemporary furniture with a natural look and feel, then take a look at the ranges from designer Tom Schneider.

The actor\u2019s transformation is the result of more than a decade of hard work, after he reportedly started working on his health back in 2007.In a new interview with Rolling Stone published on 17 June, Goodman revealed that he has lost a total of 200 pounds, ever since he first revealed to David Letterman in 2011 that he was \u201cpushing 400\u201d pounds when he was at his heaviest. \u201cI\u2019d get off of Roseanne every spring.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s the ideal time to pick up a new Xbox console to make the most of what those new titles have to offer.But investing in a new gaming device can be a costly endeavour, having to pay upfront for a console before any new games can be factored into that equation means that it can get prohibitively expensive.But picking up a new Xbox no longer has to be a daunting purchase, as customers can spread the cost through Xbox All Access at GAME.Xbox All Access allows new players to pick up either an Xbox Series X (\u00a3449.99, Game.co.uk) or an Xbox Series S (\u00a3249.99, Game.co.uk) from \u00a320.99 a month over 24 months, with zero per cent APR, no upfront cost and no additional cost compared to purchasing equivalent products outright.Not only that, it also includes a Game Pass Ultimate subscription (worth \u00a310.99 a month) for the duration of the 24 months period, Game.co.uk. Xbox Game Pass works much like a typical subscription service but instead of streaming films and shows, it allows players to play over 100 titles ranging from reimagined classics such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection to popular new releases like Minecraft Legends that the whole family can enjoy, all at no extra cost.Other Microsoft-exclusive titles, such as Forza Horizon 5 and the upcoming sci-fi role-playing game Starfield, are also regularly added to the service as soon as they are released, meaning that there\u2019s always new titles to play on a monthly basis. Those games aren\u2019t limited to your new Xbox either. Select titles can also be played across PC, console, mobile and tablet devices as well.So which console is right for you?

You could start off by reading things like company policies and procedures at work. You could raise your awareness of your own unconscious biases and explore strategies to reduce or eliminate those. Watch films and documentaries, listen to podcasts, attend events, webinars, seminars focused on inclusion or allyship.\u201dGet informedAby Hawker, founder of TransMission PR, a communications consultancy specialising in trans and non-binary inclusion and awareness, also believes educating yourself is important \u2013 especially when it comes to learning about issues and challenges surrounding the community.\u201cTrans people represent 1% of the population. They are a marginalised community being disproportionately targeted by some very loud voices in order to stoke hatred and division,\u201d says Hawker, who started a \u2018TransAlly365\u2019 campaign on TikTok this year, posting daily tips.\u201cAnd there are loads of other resources to help,\u201d she adds. \u201cSubscribe to QueerAF, a media outlet dedicated to changing the narrative and championing queer talent.

Ask them questions like: what do you experience at work or socially, or when you\u2019re on public transport or on holiday \u2013 that kind of thing. And then ask: what can I do to help and support you? Super simple questions most people don\u2019t ask.\u201dBe mindful of what you\u2019re asking too. \u201cI have a general rule of thumb: If you wouldn\u2019t ask your grandma that question, don\u2019t ask [an LGBTQ+ person] it!\u201d Battye adds. \u201cYou get the idea. Don\u2019t ask questions that you wouldn\u2019t also ask somebody who is heterosexual or cisgender.\u201dJust listenFinn says: \u201cListen to trans and non-binary people\u2019s experiences without questioning them, particularly if they are reporting transphobia or discrimination. We are the experts of our own experience and can tell the difference between problematic discrimination vs good-faith questions.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to fully understand someone\u2019s identity to respect it, including using a person\u2019s correct pronouns. If someone tells you the language they use to talk about themselves and their experience of gender, use it.\u201dAnd if you accidentally say the wrong thing? \u201cApologise quickly and move on,\u201d adds Finn. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make it a big deal!\u201dSpeaking upYou can also show support by being \u201cwilling to have conversations with those around you to educate them on issues and challenges and how to be supportive\u201d, Battye adds. \u201cYou can start by just sharing the information you\u2019re learning, that\u2019s quite an easy thing to do.\u201cAnother thing is being aware of non-inclusive behaviours in conversations. If you hear or see other people being exclusive, if it\u2019s safe and you\u2019re comfortable to do so, then speak up. It might be as simple as saying something like, \u2018You know what, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate\u2019, or \u2018I don\u2019t think we should be talking in this way, maybe we should change the conversation\u2019.\u201dBattye says speaking with people privately is better than calling them out in front of others. \u201cDon\u2019t do it publicly \u2013 take them to one side and just have a conversation about why it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about what they\u2019ve been talking about. They might not realise, first of all, but also it can be really embarrassing and can go against what you\u2019re trying to do if you do it publicly.\u201dAnd if it\u2019s yourself being non-inclusive: \u201cApologise, correct yourself, and continue with the conversation,\u201d Battye adds. \u201cDon\u2019t dig a hole and continue to get yourself in it!\u201dHave a think afterwards about what that experience is showing you \u2013 is there a bias or privilege you need to be more aware of? \u201cDo that inner work to make sure you\u2019re not continuously making the same mistake,\u201d she says.Visibility and celebrationRecommendedThe wild and wonderful hats of Royal Ascot 2023King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at first Royal Ascot in their new rolesPrince William to celebrate first birthday as Prince of Wales as he turns 41Visibility is about \u201csignalling that you are an ally\u201d, says Battye. There are lots of ways you can do this in work and education settings \u2013 such as adding pronouns to email signatures, wearing inclusive badges and lanyards. You could attend network and community events to actively show support.Finally, celebrating \u2013 find out about important holidays, awareness events, anniversaries etc. \u201cThis is the bit most people do without doing the other bits, which can get quite frustrating at times!\u201d says Battye. \u201cBut certainly celebrate with your colleagues [and friends].\u201d"}, {"_id": "64931bec51ac3318ab2d248a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/next-management-model-esmeralda-seay-reynolds-b2361179.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Whistleblower ex-model claims agent once told her to swallow cotton balls to suppress her appetite", "lead": "<p>Former fashion model worked for the agency as a teen </p>", "author": "Amber Raiken", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 09:20:15", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:49:00.446896", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-21T09:20:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/21/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRobert* knew it was over at a party. \u201cI found myself watching the way she interacted with everyone,\u201d he recalls of his then partner of seven years. \u201cHer eyes lit up, and she smiled at people in a way that I hadn\u2019t seen directed at me in as long as I could remember. That was the moment I realised the love had gone.\u201d Robert stayed in that relationship for another year, trying to make things work. \u201cI had convinced myself this was because I was so in love with her, but the truth was that I was actually just scared to be alone.\u201d Staying in an unhappy relationship might sound like a fate worse than death. You\u2019re lonely but horny. Exhausted but argumentative. Emotionally drained but armed for your next WhatsApp battle. And yet, it\u2019s remarkably common. In his 2012 book, You Can Be Right or You Can Be Married, author Dana Adam Shapiro wrote that just 17 per cent of couples are content with their partner. Meanwhile, in 2015, research claimed that 20 per cent of married people felt \u201ctrapped\u201d in their relationship, while a quarter admitted that they were no longer in love with their spouse. More recently, a survey in 2021 found that almost half of married couples are only still together because of their children, while one-sixth said their relationship is only hanging on because they can\u2019t afford to be single. These figures paint a bleak picture. But it\u2019s one that is quickly becoming a reality for many, particularly in the UK, where the cost of living crisis continues to force people into making significant sacrifices in order to cope. It\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility that one of those sacrifices could be love. After all, with rent prices and mortgage rates going through the roof, sometimes living with a partner is the only affordable option. Plus, after enjoying the somewhat chi-chi lifestyle that can come with cohabiting with someone (You can watch what you want on TV!), who wants to return to a flatshare with strangers that may or may not eat their toenails?That said, money worries are hardly the only thing keeping people together. Succession\u2019s Tom Wambsgans and Shiv Roy are television\u2019s most cash-rich, happiness-poor couple, whose struggles couldn\u2019t be further from the quotidian (fighting over who gets to use the private jet is hardly a relatable experience). Yet their stoical perseverance still translated to layman\u2019s emotional and romantic disaster. There was infidelity. Betrayal. And even a little biting.By the end of the HBO drama\u2019s four-season run, which ended last month, the voracity of hatred between these two characters was undeniable. \u201cI think you are incapable of love,\u201d Tom tells her during their most memorable fight. \u201cAnd I think you are maybe not a good person to have children with.\u201d But even after all the nuclear arguments, the ruthless character assassinations, and the fact that Tom usurped the mother of his child (yes, she was pregnant when he said that to her) to the role of CEO, the two of them remained together. RecommendedI couldn\u2019t climax, so I let \u2018big testosterone\u2019 take me for a rideDirty talk isn\u2019t always mortifying, but it can \u2013 and should \u2013 be betterThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationIn the most resounding image of the finale, we saw them in the back of a car, Shiv putting her hand out to her husband, who quietly returns the gesture, a silent promise of their mutual despair. Tom and Shiv are far from pop culture\u2019s only unhappy couple. In fact, once you start to look closely, they all seem pretty miserable. There\u2019s Mad Men\u2019s Don and Betty Draper. Tony and Carmela Soprano. Gone Girl\u2019s Nicholas and Amy Dunne. Blue Valentine\u2019s Dean and Cindy. And of course, the poster couple for marital disharmony: Charles and Diana, whose acrimonious relationship was dramatised in The Crown. Remember Charles\u2019s infamous response to an interviewer who asked if he was in love with his then wife? \u201cWhatever \u2018in love\u2019 means,\u201d he replied. Why, then, are so many of us resigning ourselves to loveless relationships? \u201cWhen people stay in unhappy relationships, it\u2019s often because their cost-benefit analysis indicates that by leaving, they may be worse off,\u201d explains clinical psychologist Sally Austen. \u201cWhat constitutes the \u2018cost\u2019 and \u2018benefit\u2019 will depend on the individual and could range from housing and financial stability to physical safety and social circumstances. \n\nHe\u2019d made me feel totally unworthy of being loved and I\u2019d lost all my confidence, so I just existed\u2018Claire'If you are responsible for children, you will also need to factor their wellbeing into the equation. Another layer of difficulty is that we are strongly influenced by what we think others will think of us. \u201cA lot of people will consider how separating might impact relatives or parents who spent a lot of money on the wedding and so on,\u201d adds Austen. There is also the fear of having to start over, emotionally and logistically. \u201cI am currently experiencing a deep depression, which I had anticipated as it always happens to me when a relationship ends,\u201d says Robert, who has had to move back in with his parents at the age of 40 following his breakup. \u201cIt truly does feel as though I am starting from scratch again.\u201d There is also a chicken and egg scenario at play, given that the longer you stay in an unhappy relationship, the more it will itch away at your self-worth, putting you in a state of emotional paralysis.This was the case for Claire, 45, who spent seven years of a 17-year relationship feeling utterly miserable. \u201cI think by that point, he\u2019d made me feel totally unworthy of being loved and I\u2019d lost all my confidence, so I just existed,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough to leave but my parents could see I was fading away so, in the end, my dad pulled me out of it. I didn\u2019t even fight because I had nothing left inside.\u201d As for why she persisted with the relationship for as long as she did, Claire explains she was fuelled by hope. \u201cI was just waiting for the person I fell in love with to look at me with the same eyes again,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he never came back, nor did he even fight for me to stay when I left. He was probably thrilled because I made it easier for him.\u201dTom and Shiv in the \u2018Succession\u2019 finale  (HBO)Sometimes, staying in an unhappy relationship can also act as a shield for your own underlying issues. \u201cIn some cases, being with a partner is easier because you can throw the things you\u2019re not happy about at someone else,\u201d says Ammanda Major, head of clinical practice at the relationships charity Relate.The trouble is that if you\u2019re going to leave an unhappy relationship, the first step is recognising \u2013 and accepting \u2013 your own unhappiness. This is easier said than done. \u201cIf you get way more excited to spend time by yourself than you do when it comes to spending time with your partner, not feeling validated by your partner, or envying what other couples have, then you might be in a loveless relationship,\u201d says Callisto Adams, dating and relationships coach. The more specific you can be about what\u2019s fuelling the disharmony the better. Because once you\u2019ve identified what it is that\u2019s making you unhappy, you can communicate this to your partner and try to work out a way forward. \u201cIf people can sit down and share those vulnerabilities with one another, they might be able to find a way through it,\u201d says Major.\u201cBut you have to be ready to hear what the other person has to say, too. And then you can make a decision together.\u201d In many cases, though, the best decision might be to accept that the relationship has broken beyond repair and walk away. And that\u2019s a leap of faith you might have to take on your own. \u201cI think everyone knows in their heart when the love is gone but you almost cling to the hope that it will come back,\u201d says Claire, who has forged a successful career in music since leaving her last relationship, and found love with someone else. \u201cYou can make bad choices after leaving a loveless relationship because you are in a fragile state and desperate to be loved, but I recognised my pattern and stopped it, which was a sign of me becoming stronger. My heart goes out to people who are in the same boat but I\u2019m proof that amazing things can happen the minute you start to love yourself.\u201d Recommended8 dating red flags experts warn to look out forExperts say this is the ideal relationship \u2018age gap\u2019 (if you want it to last)Pharrell Williams makes his Louis Vuitton debut in star-studded Paris showIt has been a similar journey for Robert, who, since leaving his unhappy relationship, has found himself feeling positive about what the future holds. \u201cIt has been very difficult, but I have never felt more determined in my life to become a healthier, more rounded human being,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not doing it for anybody else; I am doing it for myself.\u201d *Names have been changed.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJohn Goodman stunned fans as his weight loss was made apparent over the weekend, but his journey didn\u2019t \u201chappen overnight\u201d.The Big Lebowski star, who turned 71 on 20 June, recently attended the 2023 Monte-Carlo Television Festival in Monaco on Sunday (18 June) where he debuted his slimmed-down figure on the red carpet.In photos from the event, Goodman looked sharp in a navy blue double-breasted suit and khaki pants, which he paired with a yellow tie, brown loafers, and round-framed sunglasses. The actor\u2019s transformation is the result of more than a decade of hard work, after he reportedly started working on his health back in 2007.In a new interview with Rolling Stone published on 17 June, Goodman revealed that he has lost a total of 200 pounds, ever since he first revealed to David Letterman in 2011 that he was \u201cpushing 400\u201d pounds when he was at his heaviest. \u201cI\u2019d get off of Roseanne every spring. I\u2019d lose 60 pounds every spring [but] I\u2019d gain it back and then some, every year,\u201d he told the late-night host at the time.At the start of his journey, Goodman hired health coach Mackie Shilstone who helped him to give up sugar and work out six days a week. The actor, who\u2019s been open about his struggles with alcoholism in the past, also stopped drinking after checking into a rehabilitation center in 2007.RecommendedGlastonbury 2023: Gates at Worthy Farm to open today as new \u2018secret set\u2019 announcedExtraction 2 viewers spot \u2018ridiculous\u2019 blunder in Chris Hemsworth sequel\u2018What in the wingardium leviosa?\u2019: Emma Watson shocks fans with \u2018levitating\u2019 dress\u201cIt takes a lot of creative energy to sit on your a** and figure out what you\u2019re going to eat next,\u201d he said in an interview with People in 2010. \u201cI wanted to live life better.\u201dFive years later, Goodman\u2019s health coach revealed to the New York Post that the Roseanne star had lost 100 pounds through a combination of diet and exercise.

At the time, Goodman\u2019s then-100 pound weight loss took around two years.In an interview with ABC News, Goodman revealed that he decided to make a change to his habits after he would look in the mirror and not like what he saw in his reflection. \u201cI just got tired, sick and tired of looking at myself. You\u2019re shaving in the mirror and you don\u2019t want to look at yourself.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSanjay Aggarwal\u2019s now-booming business was based around a family heirloom: a 100-year-old spice mill.He started selling spice blends with his mother in 2012 almost by accident.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be a business,\u201d the 40-year-old admits. \u201cIt was only started as a retirement hobby for my mum. What started off as a silly little idea, so to speak, just grew. We started online and moved after a few years to selling in shops.\u201dSpice Kitchen has been wildly successful, and now Aggarwal is adding another string his company\u2019s bow by writing a cookbook. Above all the success, he\u2019s really just appreciated spending time with his 72-year-old mother, Shashi.\u201cShe\u2019s incredible \u2013 she\u2019s a whirlwind. She was born in Kenya and raised in India, so she\u2019s got a really eclectic mix of culture. And she\u2019s a real spice expert \u2013 we\u2019ve got a 100-year-old spice mill in our family that\u2019s travelled the world and I\u2019ve got it here now; we started the business using that.\u201dRecommendedMissing Glastonbury? Here\u2019s how to have a festival feast at homeFour berry sweet recipes that go beyond strawberries and creamCan you whip up the perfect burger in just five minutes?Aggarwal says it felt \u201cnatural\u201d to work with his mother, after helping his parents run their Birmingham shop when growing up.But he\u2019s \u201clearned loads\u201d from her during their new venture.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly made me realise how entrepreneurial my mum is, how creative she is\u2026 I\u2019ve been really impressed by how similarly we think.\u201dHe says: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly closer for it. It\u2019s got the ups and downs and challenges that everything has, but we\u2019re still talking!\u201dWhile there are plenty of flavour-packed Indian dishes in the new cookbook \u2013 including coriander and tandoori fishcakes, chickpea curry and tarka dal \u2013 the recipes have a decidedly global outlook. Think fish tacos, jerk-inspired pork, crispy duck with pancakes \u2013 and Aggarwal credits this to growing up in the diverse city of Birmingham.\u201cI was born and brought up there, so for me, that was all I knew. But for my mum, it was very much a big influence on her,\u201d he explains.When she came to the UK as a young married woman, \u201cher cuisine and culture was all very Indian\u201d \u2013 something that soon changed.\u201cMy mum has really seen that development of food and culture, and that cosmopolitan nature of Birmingham. It\u2019s had tidal waves of immigration \u2013 my mum being one of them from India \u2013 and from West Africa and Asia and all different places. She\u2019s witnessed that, when she came to the UK.\u201dAggarwal recounts how in the early days of living in Birmingham, Shashi would grind her own spices \u2013 you couldn\u2019t buy blends at the time \u2013 which \u201creminded her of home and made her less homesick\u201d, but then her palate expanded.\u201cShe\u2019s vegetarian, but got to try all these amazing different sorts of vegetarian food from all around the world, be it Middle Eastern, Chinese or Japanese or whatever. Some of those things weren\u2019t accessible when she first came, but were as time went on \u2013 and my mum\u2019s very experimental.\u201cShe\u2019s a real foodie. She loves trying new things and experimenting \u2013 probably more than anyone else I know. I think she\u2019s quite unique, because I think a lot of people from cultures where they\u2019ve got a really strong food culture \u2013 certainly like Indian culture \u2013 a lot of my aunts and uncles, they don\u2019t really eat or experiment outside of Indian food. They find it quite scary, not very flavoursome, or quite bland. But my mum really gets it \u2013 she\u2019s got a really deep palate, and she can really appreciate different cultures.\u201dThis love of different cuisines means both mother and son are quite free with the way they cook\u2013 and they want other people to be the same.For example, if you\u2019re making a frittata and you don\u2019t have any Italian seasoning, Aggarwal says: \u201cTry it with Mexican [spice blends], try it with jerk and you could still create something amazing. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment.\u201dOne of the more unusual combinations he\u2019s tried? Mexican spices in a shepherd\u2019s pie: \u201cIt actually tastes amazing in there. We\u2019re just trying to get people to be a bit more free thinking and adventurous. What\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201dAggarwal says he\u2019s often asked how to make an \u201cauthentic\u201d dish \u2013 a question he struggles to answer.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to understand what they mean by that \u2013 what is the meaning of authenticity? I\u2019m a second-generation British-born person\u2026 Food has evolved over time. We wanted to make sure the dishes [in the cookbook] were authentic in terms of linking back to the original recipes and what they\u2019re all about, and especially the blends being as authentic as possible \u2013 trying to respect the tradition.\u201cBut we\u2019re also trying to say, we can only take our take on things. I can take my take on things and my mum can take her take on things \u2013 and things have changed over time.\u201dThat\u2019s why Aggarwal advises against getting \u201ctoo hung up on authenticity, because there is no way of achieving it\u201d.RecommendedThese are the viral TikTok recipes you have to make this Father\u2019s DayEddie Huang: \u2018I\u2019ll never eat at BAO London \u2013 I know mine\u2019s better\u2019BBQ salad recipes without a soggy lettuce leaf in sightInstead, he recommends taking a dish you like and \u201cplay with the flavours a little bit\u201d to \u201cmake it your own\u201d.\u2018Spice Kitchen\u2019 by Sanjay Aggarwal (Quadrille, \u00a322)."}, {"_id": "64931bf051ac3318ab2d249a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/starbucks-food-waste-video-tiktok-b2361162.html", "primaryCategory": "Food and Drink", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Starbucks barista documents coffee chain\u2019s alleged food waste in viral video: \u2018Made me feel sick\u2019", "lead": "<p>\u2018This should be illegal,\u2019 one viewer claims </p>", "author": "Amy Walters", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 21:15:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-21 17:49:04.707536", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-20T21:15:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/20/20/starbucks.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to IndyEat's free newsletter for weekly recipes, foodie features and cookbook releasesGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

At the reunion, she catches Chase\u2019s gaze from across the room and he immediately bumps into a pole \u2013 even though he\u2019s brought his own date to the nuptials.The trailer eventually sees Zoey and Chase sitting on a beach together as they reminisce about their days back at school. \u201cWhen did life get so messy?

Abby Wilde has also returned as Stacey Dillsen, along with Jack Salvatore as Mark Del Figgalo.However, absent from the trailer was Victoria Justice, who played Lola Martinez, and Alexa Nikolas, who starred as Zoey\u2019s roommate Nicole Bristow. Recent Oscar nominee Austin Butler also got his start on the Nickelodeon comedy series, though he will not reprise his role as Zoey\u2019s former boyfriend James Garrett.Following the release of the trailer, many fans of the original Zoey 101 took to social media to share their thoughts about the sequel film. \u201cThis looks so good to be honest,\u201d said one fan on Twitter.Others were ecstatic to learn that their favourite on-screen couple from their childhood, Quinn and Logan, get married in the reboot. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Quinn and Logan generally ended up together and are still so happy after all these years,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cThe only enemies-lovers I liked from Nick.

The rise means egg and embryo freezing is now the most rapidly growing fertility treatment in the UK.RecommendedWhat is egg freezing and how does it work?How was a baby born with three people\u2019s DNA?Dramatic rise in the number of women freezing their eggs\u2018I did a DNA test and found out I had 7 siblings I didn\u2019t know about\u2019Egg freezing and thawing costs an average of between \u00a37,000 and \u00a38,000, while a single cycle of IVF can cost over \u00a35,000, making it out of reach for many.PhD student Hannah, who has undergone three rounds of egg collections, opted to do the \u201cfreeze and share\u201d programme at London Egg Bank. This meant she only paid \u00a3160 to get her eggs frozen in exchange for her donating some of her eggs.She said while she could have afforded to pay the full cost of treatment herself, it would have wiped out her life savings, so egg-sharing was the more viable option. Hannah said freezing her eggs made her feel like she has given herself \u201canother five years to find someone\u201d she wants to have children with or to make sure she\u2019s in a more financially secure situation.\u201cIt makes the dating process more enjoyable.

In the video, West said he\u2019d had a discussion with Kardashian about North\u2019s TikTok, as he did not want his daughter to be \u201cused by TikTok\u201d.Following North\u2019s Ice Spice video, many viewers sided with West, with some suggesting that the father of four was \u201cright\u201d to be concerned about his child\u2019s TikTok videos.RecommendedKanye West\u2019s daughter North and \u2018wife\u2019 Bianca Censori hold hands at rapper\u2019s birthday partyKim Kardashian \u2018assumes everything she texts Kanye West will go on the internet\u2019Kim Kardashian makes candid admission about parenting struggles: \u2018It has been the most challenging thing\u2019While speaking to Time, Kardashian also admitted that West may have been right \u201cin that instance\u201d, as she recalled removing the video \u201cas soon as [she] saw the words\u201d.\u201cAs soon as I saw the words, I was like: \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re taking this down,\u2019\u201d Kardashian said, before adding: \u201cI saw on the internet, [people saying] \u2018Kanye was right,\u2019 and maybe he was in that instance.\u201dHowever, despite agreeing with her ex-husband in that specific instance, Kardashian defended her daughter\u2019s use of the app while noting that she will \u201cfight for her to be creative\u201d.\u201cBut she loves making slime videos and doing her little hair tutorials, and I will fight for her to be creative,\u201d she said.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA man has been applauded for refusing to allow his sister to have her wedding at their family\u2019s property after she tried to book the venue at the last minute. In a recent post shared on the popular \u201cAm I The A**hole?\u201d Reddit forum, Reddit user u/Throwrasistaplz asked if he was in the wrong for not letting his sibling get married at the space. In the post, he explained that, at the age of 14, his mother sent him to live with his grandparents, who were the owners of the property.\u201cMy grandparents owned an amazing property in the mountains that has an amazing view. We also have some horses and other critters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey were also quite wealthy as well.\u201dThe Reddit user noted that when his grandparents passed away about four years ago, they passed the property down to him because they thought he\u2019d \u201cappreciate and respect it more\u201d. He also claimed that his mother and sister got \u201cmoney and other assets\u201d from his grandparents that \u201cvalued more than the property\u201d.He described how he\u2019s made use of the space over the last four years, writing: \u201cI turned part of the property into a venue for mainly weddings (grandparents knew of this idea and thought it was a good one).

In response, he told her that she could use it but had to know the date as soon as possible, in order to make sure that the venue wasn\u2019t booked.The Reddit user noted that while he \u201cnever got\u201d a wedding date, despite how many times he followed up with his sister, he later received an invitation for the event. He then revealed that the invite listed the family property as the wedding\u2019s venue.\u201cTwo weeks ago I got the wedding invitation, stating the property is the location and the date. Which is in September of this year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI immediately called her to say that we are booked for that date and can\u2019t accommodate her.\u201dHe claimed that his mother and other family members got upset about the venue being booked, and started \u201ccalling and writing reviews for [his] business\u201d. He said that he proceeded to contact his sister about the situation and explained that she should have gotten back to him about her wedding date before sending the invite. However, according to the Reddit user, his sibling then accused him of \u201cruining\u201d her day.\u201cI asked them to stop and call my sister, telling her that literally all she had to do was tell me when she knew her date so I could block it and I would take care of everything else,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe went off on how I am ruining HER day. It is OUR family\u2019s property. How she already sent out the invitations and couldn\u2019t go back now. I should just tell the other couple to cancel (they have been on the books for over a year now, and I actually like them). Family is more important.\u201dThe man explained that after his \u201clast big blow-up\u201d with his sister, he started communicating with them \u201cstrictly through the business\u2019\u201d phone and email lines. He also claimed that although he recommended \u201cother dates around the same time,\u201d his sibling still told him that he\u2019s \u201cbeing resentful and an a**hole\u201d.The Reddit post has quickly gone viral, with more than 20,600 upvotes. In the comments, many users have defended the OP [original poster], while criticising his sister for sending out invitations without confirming the date with the venue.\u201cYour sister is a giant a**hole for expecting you to cancel another couple\u2019s date for\u2026what?\u201d one person claimed. \u201cSelfish family? She needed to tell you the date and didn\u2019t, that\u2019s on her.\u201d\u201cWho [the f***] sends out invitations for a date before even contacting the venue?\u201d another asked. \u201cIt is really as simple as sending an invite for a date without even asking the venue.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAs the class of 2023 prepares to take on the real world, a new report has shown that Generation Z is having a harder time adapting to in-person workplaces.For recent graduates, most of their college career was upended by the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to virtual classes and online internships. As a result, many Gen Zers have begun taking courses in order to brush up on their work skills, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.The WSJ found that many companies, universities, and recruiters are training new hires on developing their soft skills \u2013 common interpersonal skills or traits that allow workers to interact harmoniously with others in the workplace.At KPMG, one of the world\u2019s biggest accounting firms, full-time hires this summer are expected to attend the firm\u2019s training facility in Florida, where they will practice talking in person through sample scenarios. The company told the WSJ that they\u2019ve found new hires are \u201cstiff, talk too fast, or rely too much on filler words like \u2018um\u2019 as they presented\u201d.At the training facility, Gen Z workers will receive training on how to maintain eye contact and take pauses during conversations.RecommendedWhy Gen Z could be the answer to your workforce woesFired employee returns work laptop in Gucci bag \u2018so they don\u2019t know I\u2019m screwed without the job\u2019Millennial boss praised for response to employee who accused her of \u2018undermining\u2019 her\u201cGraduates\u2019 disrupted college experience might mean they struggle with the basics reading colleagues\u2019 cues or navigating a meeting,\u201d Heidi Brooks, a senior lecturer in organisational behavior at Yale University\u2019s School of Management, told the outlet.Other major companies have needed to inform young workers on appropriate office culture, according to the WSJ. At Protiviti, a global consulting firm, executive vice president of global human resources Scott Redfearn said they\u2019ve had to remind new employees about avoiding casual clothing, like ripped jeans, in the office.The company has also included a series of small-group virtual meetings in its onboarding process. Some meetings focus on developing conversational skills, followed by in-person social gatherings so Gen Zers can put their training to the test.Meanwhile, Michigan State University has begun requiring business students to take classes on soft skills in the workplace, after observing that \u201cstudents are more awkward and unsure\u201d while networking than they were before the pandemic.While many Gen Z workers may need extra support in adapting to workplace culture, an April survey by TimelyCare found that 53 per cent of 2023 graduates said they wanted a fully in-person job, with only 21 per cent saying they wanted to work fully remotely.Another recent survey of 1,300 managers suggested that Gen Z is harder to work with than other generations, so much so that 65 per cent of employers said they have needed to fire them more than employees of other generations. In addition, one in eight managers said they\u2019ve fired a Gen Zer within just a week of their start date.Although Gen Zers are eager to enter the workforce, many adults of older generations have recently criticised Generation Z \u2013 the group of people born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s \u2013 for some of their social media habits. John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of New York City grocery stores Gristedes Foods, recently claimed Gen Z was \u201ctoo busy on TikTok\u201d to work on their careers.In an interview, Catsimatidis said he used to work 70 hours a week at a supermarket and ridiculed young workers for not doing the same. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the problems we are having in our country these days, the kids are busy playing TikTok,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re working 100 hours a week, and it\u2019s not working, you\u2019d better work 120. You can\u2019t win if you\u2019re afraid of losing.\u201dA New York University professor also received backlash after saying that young people \u201cshould never be home\u201d if they want to be successful. \u201cYou should never be at home. That\u2019s what I tell young people. Home is for seven hours of sleep and that\u2019s it,\u201d said marketing professor Scott Galloway. \u201cThe amount of time you spend at home is inversely correlated to your success \u2013 professionally and romantically. You need to be out of the house.\u201dHowever, many reports suggest that Gen Zers simply view the workplace differently from previous generations. A McKinsey report from last October found that \u201cemployed Gen Z respondents are more likely to report that the pay they receive for their work does not allow them a good quality of life and are less likely than others to report feeling fairly recognised and rewarded for their work\u201d.RecommendedGen Z, like Boris Johnson, has it all wrong when it comes to socksMy teenager gets all their news from TikTok \u2013 should I worry?Royal Ascot attendees bring colour and vibrancy to big race dayWhile Gen Z employees may need additional training when it comes to soft career skills, some Gen Zers have gone viral for sharing the nontraditional ways they sign off emails in the workplace.In a video posted to TikTok last year, one Gen Z employee signed off their email with \u201cthat\u2019s all,\u201d while another simply wrote, \u201chehe, bye\u201d. A third rejected use of commas, writing, \u201calright alright alright,\u201d while one employee went so far as to tell his colleague: \u201cF**k you, I\u2019m out.\u201d"}]
