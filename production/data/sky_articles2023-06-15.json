I'm backing fairness and justice - not kangaroo courts.\"Esther McVey also said it was \"absolutely absurd and unnecessary\" for Mr Johnson to be denied a pass to the parliamentary estate, while former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke said he was \"amazed at the harshness\" of the committee's report.\n"}, {"_id": "648b34fa51ac3328bdb3e579", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/johnson-verdict-is-a-hammer-blow-to-sunaks-hopes-of-maintaining-a-fragile-peace-in-the-tory-civil-war-12903069", "primaryCategory": "uk", "subCategories": "test", "title": "<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-verdict-is-a-hammer-blow-to-rishi-sunaks-hopes-of-maintaining-a-fragile-peace-in-the-tory-civil-war-12903033\">Johnson verdict is a hammer blow to Sunak's hopes of maintaining a fragile peace in the Tory civil war</a>", "lead": "", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:46.304093", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/04/70x70/skynews-beth-rigby-politics-hub_6128951.jpg?20230505193758", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "648b34fa51ac3328bdb3e57a", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/nottingham-attacks-city-prepares-for-another-vigil-after-families-of-victims-unite-in-grief-12902872", "primaryCategory": "uk", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nottingham attacks suspect is ex-university student, police say, as they get more time to question him", "lead": "Police have revealed the man suspected of the triple murders in Nottingham is a former student of a university in the city - as detectives were granted another 36 hours to question him.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:46.416139", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-nottingham-major-incident_6185871.jpg?20230613101713", "body": "\nPolice have revealed the man suspected of the triple murders in Nottingham is a former student of a university in the city - as detectives were granted another 36 hours to question him.A 31-year-old man was tasered and arrested on suspicion of murder after the attacks and remains in custody.University of Nottingham students Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, both 19, were found stabbed to death in Ilkeston Road at around 4am on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA CCTV image of the man believed to be the suspect in the Nottingham killings\n        \n\n\n\nSchool caretaker Ian Coates, 65, who was described by his sons as \"everyone's friend\", was then found dead in Magdala Road after his van was allegedly stolen by the suspect.Another three people were hurt, one critically, when they were run over by a van.Police said on Thursday that the suspect is a former University of Nottingham student, but added: \"This is not believed to be connected with the attack\".A spokesperson for the university said: \"We are devastated that the suspect is a former University of Nottingham student.

This can happen for various reasons including an MP resigning, dying or being declared bankrupt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, such as if an MP is suspended from parliament for more than 10 days, a by-election can also be triggered by a \"recall petition\".

Instead, they must be disqualified from holding their seat.To be disqualified, the MP must apply for a role in the paid office of the Crown. This means they automatically lose their seat because working for the Crown is not seen as impartial.Essentially, the process ensures that the government is kept separate from the monarchy.There used to be several roles used for this reason, but only the titles of the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds and the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead remain.These roles don't come with any responsibility or pay.Mr Johnson is one of few people in history who has now held both titles, having used this process to resign when he was elected mayor of London in 2008.Ms Dorries has not yet applied for one of the offices of the Crown, meaning she is still a sitting Tory MP, despite announcing her resignation \"with immediate effect\".Moving the writThe official process of an MP being disqualified from their seat is triggered by \"moving the writ\". This is when the chief whip of the political party the resigning MP belongs to puts forward a motion to the Speaker.They ask \"that the Speaker do issue his Warrant to the Clerk of the Crown to make out a new Writ for the electing of a Member to serve in this present Parliament for the constituency of... in the room of...\"The Speaker puts this to MPs and if they agree, the writ then passes through the Commons and ends up with the Returning Officer in the local constituency who oversees the by-election.The writ is typically issued within three months of the MP resigning from their seat and in doing so, the date of the by-election is fixed.\n"}, {"_id": "648b34fc51ac3328bdb3e582", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/british-man-fears-relatives-among-the-missing-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-coast-of-greece-12903024", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "British man fears relatives are among missing after migrant boat sinks", "lead": "A British man has told Sky News he fears his relatives are among the hundreds who are missing after a fishing boat overloaded with migrants sank off the coast of Greece.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:48.276632", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-aftab-khan-greece-relatives_6188220.jpg?20230615132451", "body": "\nA British man has told Sky News he fears his relatives are among the hundreds who are missing after a fishing boat overloaded with migrants sank off the coast of Greece.Aftab Khan, from Wolverhampton, travelled to Greece following the tragedy in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\nAt least 78 people drowned and 104 were rescued after the fishing vessel capsized about 50 miles from the southern coastal town of Pylos.Charity Alarm Phone, which received frantic calls from some of those on board, said up to 750 people may have been on the vessel at the time and a massive search operation for survivors is continuing.Mr Khan told Sky News' Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall that one of his male cousins had been found alive but he had been unable to find two others.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking in the port city of Kalamata, where survivors have been brought by rescuers, he added: \"We don't know where the rest of them are at the moment.\"We're just trying to find out.\"Greek officials said the boat got into difficulties when its engine stopped and it began veering from side to side.

When we got there, it was an extraordinary sight - a fishing boat that had been converted to carry as many people as possible.It looked almost exactly the same as the one that has sunk off the southern Greek coast - a similar rich blue paintwork, apparently the same structure, with an upper deck and then a hugely crowded main deck.On the boat we filmed, there was a lower area, called an underbelly, in which hundreds more people were crowded. On both boats, you can see the signs that it had previously been a fishing vessel, and you can also see the rust and wear of a long life.My guess is that you could probably get about 40 people on to a boat like that before it started to feel too crowded.At the end of a rescue mission we saw, which lasted several hours, more than 600 people had been transferred off the boat, and on to the Geo Barents.When we spoke to some of those who were rescued, a story emerged that is now being echoed by survivors in Greece - of a boat that set off from the Libyan port of Tobruk, under the control of a captain. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunger, thirst and fearOn the Geo Barents, people told me that they had initially left the port with even more passengers on board but the vessel was so heinously overloaded that it could not be moved safely.So, at gunpoint, around 150 people were then ordered off before the trip could start again.They told a story of food and water running out; of people having to sit in the underbelly cramped together and of being ordered to stay in place so the boat would not sway from side to side. And of fearing that they would die on the journey.We were also told that the captain left the ship one night, collected by a small boat that arrived alongside. After that, the passengers were left to their own devices, even though none of them knew how to control the boat.Already, similar reports are emerging from the shipwreck - of a captain abandoning his ship, and those on board.Read more:'This is my chance': The aftermath of mass migrant rescueOn board the mission to rescue 600 peopleMediterranean boat disaster survivors say they were left to die - how the night's tragedy unfoldedIn both cases, the boats had actually been tracked by Frontex, the European Union's border agency.They scan the Mediterranean for vessels such as this and try to monitor their progress, handing on the information to the various nations that run search and rescue operations in the area.But what is different is that the people we encountered were happy to be rescued.

At times like this, there is a surfeit of questions and a paucity of answers.Whatever - the sight of a dangerously overloaded vessel that won't ask for help places the authorities in a difficult position.Maritime law dictates that you must attend to a vessel that says it is in distress, or which is sinking or on fire.But when a boat denies there's a problem, then things become more complicated. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts'A night-time rescue is the worst'To an extent, all you can do is watch, hope for the best and prepare for the worst. The problem for the rescue teams is that the worst happened at 2am.The rescue that we filmed happened on a sunny afternoon on a relatively flat sea. But operations at night, especially with so many people in the water, are notoriously difficult.A person does not have to drift far before they are effectively out of sight. And it is incredible how the break of a wave can hide what's behind it.\"A night-time rescue is the worst,\" one of the crew told me, shaking his head.This is really a tale of two boats: that look the same, were just as packed as each other and set off from the same place.On both of them, there were points where the people on board thought they were going to die.On one of them, everyone survived. On the other, they didn't. Migration across the Mediterranean really can be a brutal throw of the dice.\n"}, {"_id": "648b34fd51ac3328bdb3e584", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/egypt-dive-boat-fire-first-british-victim-named-as-christina-quinn-12902600", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "'Missed beyond words': British victim of Egypt dive boat fire named as family pays tribute", "lead": "One of the three British passengers who died after a dive boat caught fire in Egypt has been named.", "author": "\nReemul Balla\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-14 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:49.055255", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-christina-quinn-egypt_6187609.jpg?20230614205742", "body": "\nOne of the three British passengers who died after a dive boat caught fire in Egypt has been named.Christina Quinn, 58, was chief executive of St Luke's Hospice Plymouth, and had a long career in the NHS.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for her family said: \"It is with great sadness that we confirm the tragic death of Christina Quinn in Egypt.\"She was a sister, daughter, wife, aunty, friend, and rock to many.

the latest criminal case brought against him. Chasing Horse, 47, remains in jail in Las Vegas as he awaits trial in a sexual abuse case.He is best known for his role as the young Sioux tribe member Smiles A Lot in Kevin Costner's Oscar-winning 1990 film, Dances With Wolves.Tsuut'ina Nation Police Service Sergeant Nancy Farmer said Chasing Horse faces nine charges in Alberta, including three counts of sexual exploitation and four counts of sexual assault.The crimes in their jurisdiction date back to 2005, she added.At a virtual news conference on Wednesday, she acknowledged that the Alberta case is largely symbolic, as Chasing Horse may never return to Canada to face the charges.But Sgt Farmer said: \"At the end of the day, it is important for us to have these warrants in the system so our victims know they've been heard.\"It's extremely important that we continue to support them that way.\" \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChasing Horse's public defender in Las Vegas, Kristy Holston, said she has no comment on the new charges.It was not immediately clear whether Chasing Horse has a lawyer in Canada who could comment on his behalf.Chasing Horse faces not only decades in a Nevada prison if convicted in the Las Vegas case but criminal prosecution in a total of five jurisdictions.He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.After starring in Dances With Wolves in 1990, Chasing Horse made a name for himself among tribes in the US and Canada as a self-proclaimed medicine man who claimed he could communicate with higher beings.Police and prosecutors in Las Vegas have accused him of using that position to lead a cult, gain access to vulnerable Indigenous women and girls, and take underage wives from the early 2000s onwards.In the Las Vegas case, he is charged with 18 felonies that include sexual assault of a minor, child abuse and kidnapping.He also faces criminal prosecution in the British Columbia village of Keremeos, the US District Court in Nevada, and on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana.Court proceedings in the Las Vegas case have been put on hold indefinitely as Chasing Horse awaits a decision on his appeal filed last month to the Nevada Supreme Court asking for his indictment to be thrown out.Chasing Horse and his public defenders have said in legal filings that his accusers wanted to have sex with him.One of the women was younger than 16 - the age of consent in Nevada - when she says Chasing Horse began abusing her.\n"}, {"_id": "648b34fe51ac3328bdb3e587", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/3000-year-old-mummy-found-in-peru-12902899", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "3,000-year-old mummy found in Peru", "lead": "A mummy approximately 3,000 years old has been found in Lima, Peruvian archaeologists have said.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:50.050319", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-archaeologist-manchay_6187810.jpg?20230615083215", "body": "\nA mummy approximately 3,000 years old has been found in Lima, Peruvian archaeologists have said.Initially, researchers and students from San Marcos University discovered remains of the mummy's hair and skull.\n\n\n\nAs their excavation continued, they uncovered the rest of the ancient figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person \"had been left or offered (as a sacrifice) during the last phase of the construction of (a) temple,\" archaeologist Miguel Aguilar said.\"It is approximately 3,000 years old.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItems buried with the body, including corn, coca leaves and seeds, are believed to have been part of an offering.The mummy was probably from the Manchay culture, which developed in the valleys of Lima between 1500 and 1000 BC, Mr Aguilar said.Read more:Archaeologists in Egypt unearth Sphinx-like statue and shrineRoman burial site unearthed in 'extraordinary' excavation of hidden cemetery \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was associated with the construction of temples built in a U-shape that pointed towards the sunrise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mummy is a dead body which has been preserved from decay after being treated with substances and wrapped in cloth.\n"}, {"_id": "648b34fe51ac3328bdb3e588", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/nick-kyrgios-reveals-he-contemplated-suicide-after-2019-wimbledon-loss-12902666", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nick Kyrgios reveals he contemplated suicide after 2019 Wimbledon loss", "lead": "Nick Kyrgios has revealed he ended up in a psychiatric ward following a loss at Wimbledon in 2019 because he felt suicidal.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:50.451565", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-nick-kyrgios-tennis_6187694.jpg?20230615042204", "body": "\nNick Kyrgios has revealed he ended up in a psychiatric ward following a loss at Wimbledon in 2019 because he felt suicidal.The tennis star went to a hospital in London to \"figure out my problems\" after the loss to Rafael Nadal four years ago at Wimbledon, where he wore a compression sleeve over his right arm during his singles matches to conceal his scars from self-harming.\n\n\n\n\"I was genuinely contemplating suicide,\" Kyrgios said, in the latest season of Netflix's tennis documentary series Break Point.\"I lost at Wimbledon.

He didn't offer voters a boring programme of policies, he offered something far more mercurial - himself.\nUsing his skill as an orator and his media power he created a cult of personality and became an electoral juggernaut.\nOften embroiled in legal battles he railed against elites, portraying himself as an outsider and a victim.\nIn death though - afforded a state funeral and a national day of mourning - he has cemented his place, for better or worse, as a towering figure of the political establishment.\nCertainly he was one of the biggest political figures since Benito Mussolini.\n\n\nThey were joined by former England manager, Fabio Capello; the president of Lazio, Claudio Lotito; and Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis.The outpouring of grief comes as Italians remain split over whether Mr Berlusconi's influence was for the better or worse - and whether he deserved a state funeral.Read more:Many loved him, many hated him - reaction to scandal-hit premier's deathWhat happened when Berlusconi invited the media to the 'bunga bunga'Berlusconi leaves long-term girlfriend for woman 53 years younger \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nMr Berlusconi's partner Marta Fascina in February 2022.

Shares of both now languish deep below their flotation price. So do those of other high-profile flotations of recent years - including Moonpig and Deliveroo.Accordingly, companies looking to come to market need to do a great deal more to convince investors to buy their shares.And, that, ultimately, comes down to valuation.Stock markets, in essence, involve a price discovery process in which buyers attempt to establish the price at which vendors are prepared to sell and where vendors try to establish the price at which they will find buyers.What appears to have happened in the case of WE Soda is that the current owner of the business, the industrialist Turgay Ciner, looks to have wanted too much.On the face of it, WE Soda had a good tale to tell. It claims to be the biggest and one of the lowest cost producers of the world's tenth most consumed industrial ingredient, boasting impressive operating margins of 60%. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nPic: WE Soda\n        \n\n\n\nIts growth prospects were also enviable: the business was looking to more than double its total soda ash production from 5 million tonnes per year to 11 million tonnes per year by the end of the decade.The company assumed that these metrics were sufficient to justify seeking a premium against its sector peers such as Solvay, the \u20ac11.4bn Belgian company, which is valued by the market at an enterprise value (a company's stock market valuation taking into account its debt) of 4.6 times its expected EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation).At a stock market valuation of $7.5bn, WE Soda was looking at an enterprise value of more than 7 times its expected EBITDA this year.That was a valuation too rich for the market's blood and particularly at a time when soda ash prices have been pumped up by inflated demand following the reopening of economies around the world post-pandemic. There were plenty of signs of soda ash prices coming off the boil and particularly with new supplies becoming available around the world.None of this is to decry WE Soda. It is obviously a decent business with exciting growth prospects and which - another key selling point in an environmentally-conscious investor community like London's - could point to some solid credentials in sustainability.But, ultimately, buyers were not prepared to pay the price that the seller - Mr Ciner - was looking for.That's not an indication that investors were being overly cautious or, necessarily, the blow to the London market that some have suggested.\n"}, {"_id": "648b350051ac3328bdb3e58f", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/workplace-dress-codes-should-be-relaxed-during-hot-weather-health-and-safety-executive-says-12902854", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Workplace dress codes should be relaxed during hot weather, officials say", "lead": "Bosses should relax workplace dress codes to help staff cope with the current hot weather, officials have urged.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:52.977677", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/22/07/70x70/skynews-bakerloo-line-underground_5838172.jpg?20220718121458", "body": "\nBosses should relax workplace dress codes to help staff cope with the current hot weather, officials have urged.The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said employers should also consider measures such as allowing staff to work at cooler times of the day, as well as providing shade and free water.\n\n\n\nThe regulator said it was vital for employers to introduce \"simple and cheap measures\" to protect workers -

I'm backing fairness and justice - not kangaroo courts.\"Esther McVey also said it was \"absolutely absurd and unnecessary\" for Mr Johnson to be denied a pass to the parliamentary estate, while former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke said he was \"amazed at the harshness\" of the committee's report.\n"}, {"_id": "648b350351ac3328bdb3e597", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/johnson-verdict-is-a-hammer-blow-to-sunaks-hopes-of-maintaining-a-fragile-peace-in-the-tory-civil-war-12903069", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-verdict-is-a-hammer-blow-to-rishi-sunaks-hopes-of-maintaining-a-fragile-peace-in-the-tory-civil-war-12903033\">Johnson verdict is a hammer blow to Sunak's hopes of maintaining a fragile peace in the Tory civil war</a>", "lead": "", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:55.228884", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/04/70x70/skynews-beth-rigby-politics-hub_6128951.jpg?20230505193758", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "648b350351ac3328bdb3e598", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/partygate-report-the-key-findings-of-privileges-committee-that-sealed-boris-johnsons-fate-12902734", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The key findings of privileges committee report that sealed Boris Johnson's fate", "lead": "After months of investigation, the report into whether Boris Johnson lied to parliament over partygate has finally been published.", "author": "\nFaith Ridler\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:55.695584", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-boris-johnson-partygate_6187916.jpg?20230615094909", "body": "\nAfter months of investigation, the report into whether Boris Johnson lied to parliament over partygate has finally been published.Mr Johnson sensationally resigned as a Conservative MP on Friday with immediate effect.\n\n\n\nHe furiously claimed a \"witch-hunt\" was under way to \"take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result\".

rules and guidance were followed in No 10,\u2022 the following week on 8 December, when he repeated that assertion,\u2022 and in January,\u2022 and in May the following year when he was questioned about leaving parties for his staff.Politics latest: Johnson 'complicit in attempted intimidation of committee', report saysThe crux of Mr Johnson's defence is that others advised him that the gatherings - some of which he did not attend - were within the rules.But the MPs blow this out of the water, finding not only that he knew more than he let on, but that the impression that \"those assurances had been overarching and comprehensive\" was, in the MPs' view, misleading in itself.Those assurances were given \"in haste\", as a line to take by his media advisers, and only in relation to one event - but were applied by the former prime minister more widely.Their conclusion is that a \"serious contempt\" occurred and that he misled the house not just recklessly, but knowingly, too - and that this is all the more serious because he was the most senior member of the government.Mr Johnson's angry representations are included by the committee in full.Read more:Johnson 'deliberately'

This can happen for various reasons including an MP resigning, dying or being declared bankrupt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, such as if an MP is suspended from parliament for more than 10 days, a by-election can also be triggered by a \"recall petition\".

Instead, they must be disqualified from holding their seat.To be disqualified, the MP must apply for a role in the paid office of the Crown. This means they automatically lose their seat because working for the Crown is not seen as impartial.Essentially, the process ensures that the government is kept separate from the monarchy.There used to be several roles used for this reason, but only the titles of the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds and the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead remain.These roles don't come with any responsibility or pay.Mr Johnson is one of few people in history who has now held both titles, having used this process to resign when he was elected mayor of London in 2008.Ms Dorries has not yet applied for one of the offices of the Crown, meaning she is still a sitting Tory MP, despite announcing her resignation \"with immediate effect\".Moving the writThe official process of an MP being disqualified from their seat is triggered by \"moving the writ\". This is when the chief whip of the political party the resigning MP belongs to puts forward a motion to the Speaker.They ask \"that the Speaker do issue his Warrant to the Clerk of the Crown to make out a new Writ for the electing of a Member to serve in this present Parliament for the constituency of... in the room of...\"The Speaker puts this to MPs and if they agree, the writ then passes through the Commons and ends up with the Returning Officer in the local constituency who oversees the by-election.The writ is typically issued within three months of the MP resigning from their seat and in doing so, the date of the by-election is fixed.\n"}, {"_id": "648b350551ac3328bdb3e59f", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/nadine-dorries-insists-its-still-my-intention-to-resign-after-being-accused-of-dragging-out-process-12902592", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nadine Dorries 'still intends to resign' after being accused of 'dragging out' process", "lead": "Nadine Dorries has said she will not formally resign until after she gets answers from Downing Street about why she did not get her peerage.", "author": "\nFaye Brown\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-14 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:57.677399", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-nadine-dorries-honours-list_6182400.jpg?20230609103232", "body": "\nNadine Dorries has said she will not formally resign until after she gets answers from Downing Street about why she did not get her peerage.In a Twitter thread, the former culture secretary responded to the \"speculation\" as to why she is yet to formally quit the Commons, after announcing her intention to do so on Friday.\n\n\n\nShe insisted it is \"absolutely my intention to resign\" following suggestions she is dragging out the process to cause political pain for Rishi Sunak.However, she said she is \"awaiting responses\" to information she has requested from the House of Lords Appointments Committee (HOLAC), the Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and the Cabinet Office.She said: \"I have requested copies of WhatsApp's, text messages, all emails and minutes of meetings both formal and informal with names of senior figures unredacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\n\"It is absolutely my intention to resign, but given what I know to be true and the number of varying and conflicting statements issued by No10 since the weekend, this process is now sadly necessary.\"Ms Dorries has suggested \"sinister forces\" were behind the decision not to include her on Boris Johnson's controversial resignation honours list.She had been chosen by the former prime minister for a peerage, along with Tory MP Nigel Adams and former COP26 president Sir Alok Sharma.But when the list was finally revealed, the three names were absent - prompting a bitter war of words between Mr Johnson and his successor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowning Street has said it is \"entirely untrue\" to say that Mr Sunak or members of his Number 10 team blocked the peerages from happening - an accusation levied by the Johnson camp.Ms Dorries has claimed Number 10 officials failed \"to pass on vital information\" from the Lords' vetting body that she needed to agree to stand down from the Commons and join the upper chamber within six months, or face being left off.In a combative column for the Daily Mail on Tuesday, she wrote: \"I'm not going to lie.

to debate the regulatory \"guardrails\" that will mitigate future risks from AI, which Mr Sunak compared to the COP climate summits.The EU is already moving ahead with its own guardrails, with the European Parliament approving proposed AI regulation on Wednesday.The draft legislation seeks to set a global standard for the technology, which is used in everything from generative models like ChatGPT to driverless cars.Companies that do not comply with the rules in the proposed AI Act could face fines of up to \u20ac30m (\u00a325m) or 6% of global profits, whichever is higher. That would put Microsoft, a large financial backer of OpenAI's ChatGPT, at risk of a fine exceeding $10bn (\u00a37.9bn).The proposals will now be debated by EU member states before being signed into law.\n"}, {"_id": "648b350751ac3328bdb3e5a3", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/astronomers-make-rare-star-wars-style-planetary-discovery-12900891", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Astronomers make rare Star Wars-style planetary discovery", "lead": "Astronomers have made only the second ever discovery of a multi-planet system that orbits two stars.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-12 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:57:59.425232", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-planet-discovery-space_6184968.jpg?20230612114521", "body": "\nAstronomers have made only the second ever discovery of a multi-planet system that orbits two stars.The planet BEBOP-1c was found by a team at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\n\nIt is part of a multiplanetary circumbinary system, the catchy name given to a system that contains planets that orbit around two stars in the centre.Star Wars provides an apt point of comparison (honest) - while there's only one sun in the sky above our planet, because there's just one sun in our Solar System, the fictional desert world of Tatooine has two.Indeed, the university itself describes the newly discovered system as \"Tatooine-like\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBEBOP-1c is named more like a droid than a planet, though.

we spend multi-millions of dollars on hosting fees and Reddit needs to be fairly paid to continue supporting high-usage third-party apps,\" it said in a statement to Sky News.\"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs.\"The company said developers could make their apps \"more efficient\" to reduce the number of API calls required, adding that access would also remain free for moderator tools and bots.It added: \"We're committed to fostering a safe and responsible developer ecosystem around Reddit - developers and third-party apps can make Reddit better and do so in a sustainable and mutually-beneficial partnership, while also keeping our users and data safe.\"Reddit chief Steve Huffman doubled down on the company's stance in a Q&A on the platform on Saturday, saying it needs to be \"self-sustaining\" and \"can no longer subsidise commercial entities that require large-scale data use\".It comes as the company lays off 90 employees, about 5% of its workforce, to cut costs.\n"}, {"_id": "648b350851ac3328bdb3e5a5", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/lucy-the-worlds-most-famous-human-ancestor-could-walk-just-like-us-new-research-suggests-12902139", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "World's most famous human ancestor 'could walk just like us'", "lead": "The world's most famous early human ancestor could walk upright like a modern-day human thanks to fully bendable knee joints, research suggests.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-14 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:58:00.196737", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-human-ancestor-museum_6186971.jpg?20230614104042", "body": "\nThe world's most famous early human ancestor could walk upright like a modern-day human thanks to fully bendable knee joints, research suggests.'Lucy' was from an extinct ape-like species that lived in Africa more than three million years ago.\n\n\n\nShe was dug up in Ethiopia in 1974, and at the time was the most complete known early human ancestor.But only now have her lower limb muscles been fully digitally reconstructed, by researchers hoping to put an end to a decades-old debate among scientists regarding how she walked.The results from a team at the University of Cambridge, published in the Royal Society Open Science journal, show Lucy could straighten her knee joints, stand upright, and walk on two legs like we do today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut her legs were also found to be far bigger and more powerful than ours, allowing her to live in trees like apes, meaning she was equally well-equipped to adapt to life in open grasslands and dense forests alike.The Cambridge scientists said the findings may help shed light on how physical movement has evolved in humans, \"including those capabilities we have lost\". \n\nMore from Science & Tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Scientists create synthetic human embryos using stem cells in major breakthrough\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  AI helps discover three drugs which could fight effects of ageing\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  British projects given tens of millions in funding to develop 'safe and trustworthy' AI\n                \n\n\n\n\n\nHow Lucy's legs were reconstructedA team led by Dr Ashleigh Wiseman made a 3D model of Lucy's legs and pelvis muscles, with 36 in each leg. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major muscles in her calves and thighs were more than twice as large as those in modern humans - the only remaining animal that can stand upright with straight knees.Dr Wiseman, of Cambridge's McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: \"Lucy's ability to walk upright can only be known by reconstructing the path and space that a muscle occupies within the body.\"She added: \"Lucy's muscles suggest that she was as proficient at bipedalism as we are, while possibly also being at home in the trees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLucy's leg and pelvis muscles were digitally recreated.

In the state of Montana, it has been banned from being installed on any device.The Information Commissioners Office said last month that around 1.4 million under-13s in the UK are routinely using the

Chasing Horse, 47, remains in jail in Las Vegas as he awaits trial in a sexual abuse case.He is best known for his role as the young Sioux tribe member Smiles A Lot in Kevin Costner's Oscar-winning 1990 film, Dances With Wolves.Tsuut'ina Nation Police Service Sergeant Nancy Farmer said Chasing Horse faces nine charges in Alberta, including three counts of sexual exploitation and four counts of sexual assault.The crimes in their jurisdiction date back to 2005, she added.At a virtual news conference on Wednesday, she acknowledged that the Alberta case is largely symbolic, as Chasing Horse may never return to Canada to face the charges.But Sgt Farmer said: \"At the end of the day, it is important for us to have these warrants in the system so our victims know they've been heard.\"It's extremely important that we continue to support them that way.\" \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChasing Horse's public defender in Las Vegas, Kristy Holston, said she has no comment on the new charges.It was not immediately clear whether Chasing Horse has a lawyer in Canada who could comment on his behalf.Chasing Horse faces not only decades in a Nevada prison if convicted in the Las Vegas case but criminal prosecution in a total of five jurisdictions.He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.After starring in Dances With Wolves in 1990, Chasing Horse made a name for himself among tribes in the US and Canada as a self-proclaimed medicine man who claimed he could communicate with higher beings.Police and prosecutors in Las Vegas have accused him of using that position to lead a cult, gain access to vulnerable Indigenous women and girls, and take underage wives from the early 2000s onwards.In the Las Vegas case, he is charged with 18 felonies that include sexual assault of a minor, child abuse and kidnapping.He also faces criminal prosecution in the British Columbia village of Keremeos, the US District Court in Nevada, and on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana.Court proceedings in the Las Vegas case have been put on hold indefinitely as Chasing Horse awaits a decision on his appeal filed last month to the Nevada Supreme Court asking for his indictment to be thrown out.Chasing Horse and his public defenders have said in legal filings that his accusers wanted to have sex with him.One of the women was younger than 16 - the age of consent in Nevada - when she says Chasing Horse began abusing her.\n"}, {"_id": "648b350c51ac3328bdb3e5b1", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/nine-women-file-sexual-assault-suits-against-bill-cosby-after-nevada-abolishes-statute-of-limitations-for-civil-cases-12902661", "primaryCategory": "entertainment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nine women file sexual assault suits against Bill Cosby after Nevada abolishes statute of limitations for civil cases", "lead": "Nine women have filed a sexual assault lawsuit against Bill Cosby in Nevada, just weeks after the state abolished the statute of limitations for civil cases.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 00:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 17:58:04.675312", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-bill-cosby-court_6187691.jpg?20230615024111", "body": "\nNine women have filed a sexual assault lawsuit against Bill Cosby in Nevada, just weeks after the state abolished the statute of limitations for civil cases.The lawsuit accuses Cosby of using his \"enormous power, fame and prestige\" to isolate and sexually assault each of the women named in the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nJanice Dickinson, Lise-Lotte Lublin, Janice Baker Kinney, Lili Bernard, Heidi Thomas, Linda Kirpatrick, Rebecca Cooper, Pam Joy Abeyta and Angela Leslie all claim the actor and comedian attacked them.Cosby has been accused of sexual abuses ranging from groping to rape by more than 60 womenMany of the allegations are decades old, but are being revived as states change statutes defining how courts handle sexual misconduct cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Wyatt, Cosby's spokesperson, accused the women suing the comedian of being motivated by their \"addiction to massive amounts of media attention and greed\".\"From this day forward, we will not continue to allow these women to parade various accounts \u2026 against Mr. Cosby anymore without vetting them in the court of public opinion and inside of the courtroom,\" Wyatt said in a statement. \n\nMore on Bill Cosby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Bill Cosby: Comedian found liable for sex assault of teen at Playboy Mansion\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Bill Cosby denies sexually abusing teenage girl at Playboy Mansion in 1970s\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Bill Cosby civil trial: Best friend of Cosby accuser Judy Huth says teenage girl left 'crying' after alleged assault\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nBill CosbyNevada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nModel and TV presenter Janice Dickinson is one of the women suing Bill Cosby Pic: AP\n        \n\n\n\nThe 85-year-old comedian has consistently denied all allegations of sexual abuse.He did spend more than two years in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting a woman in 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, that conviction was overturned in 2021 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the prosecuting district attorney was obliged to stand by his predecessor's promise not to charge the actor after he gave potentially incriminating testimony in a civil suitCosby was found civilly liable in 2022 for molesting Judy Huth at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in 1975, when she was 16.

executive, faced questions on Schofield's departure from This Morning alongside managing director Kevin Lygo and general counsel Kyla Mullins, during a culture, media and sport committee session in parliament.\n\n\n\nThey told the hearing that both Schofield and the younger male colleague, referred to as Person X, \"repeatedly denied\" having a relationship until the presenter's shock admission in May, and pushed back against claims it was an \"open secret\" - as made by people including former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan.ITV bosses questioned by MPs - as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn said bosses \"were repeatedly told nothing was happening\", and both men denied it \"both formally and informally\", with Person X being questioned on 12 occasions over a period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was only hearsay and rumour and speculation,\" ITV's chief executive said. \"Nobody on the board would have turned a blind eye to something as serious as this.\"If evidence had emerged about the relationship, bosses \"would have acted very swiftly\", she said.During the session, the ITV bosses also responded to allegations of a \"toxic\" environment on ITV's daytime shows, and faced questions about other issues such as the suicides of Love Island contestants and presenter Caroline Flack, and allegations about \"abuse\" and \"bullying\" on The X Factor. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSinger Rebecca Ferguson recently hit out over allegations of 'abuse' on The X Factor. Pic: Ken McKay/Talkback Thames/Shutterstock\n        \n\n\n\nThe hearing was called after Schofield, 61, resigned from ITV and admitted to the \"unwise but not illegal\" affair which started when Person X was 20. The presenter was subsequently dropped by his talent agency, YMU. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDame Carolyn told MPs that the \"imbalance of power, the imbalance of dynamics\" made the relationship \"deeply inappropriate\".ITV bosses deny NDAs and gagging ordersThe hearing was told the matter was looked into at around the time when Schofield came out as gay on This Morning in February 2020, supported by his then co-presenter Holly Willoughby.Read more:Phillip Schofield: Timeline of ITV departureKey extracts from ITV chief executive's letter on Schofield departureDame Carolyn confirmed Schofield has been \"receiving counselling\" since his exit from the show and that she is \"very concerned\" about his welfare.She also confirmed there is \"no gagging order or NDA\" to stop Person X from speaking out about the situation, and denied he was given a \"pay-off\" when he left ITV. The hearing was told he received a standard redundancy payment. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:11\n\n\n\n\n\nSchofield's interviews explained\n\n\n\nThe ITV bosses were also asked about how the young man came to work at ITV. MPs heard he applied for work experience and listed Schofield as a family friend, but this was not that unusual and the application did not ring \"alarm bells\".Person X carried out work experience at This Morning for about two weeks when he was 19, and \"impressed people\" before he was later offered a longer-term fixed contract, the politicians were told. \n\n\nITV boss is no stranger to drama - but is she aware of everything happening behind the scenes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Spencer\n\nArts and entertainment correspondent\n@SkyKatieSpencer\n\n\n\nBeing the big boss Dame Carolyn McCall has had to steer ITV through a sizeable chunk of off-screen drama - from Piers Morgan quitting and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host Jeremy Clarkson's controversial columns, to the axing of Jeremy Kyle and Love Island's post-show care.\nShe is no stranger to helping the channel ride out the headlines, and - subject to more than two hours of questioning from MPs - she claimed she welcomed the opportunity to \"set out some of the facts\" of what's been happening at ITV.\nShe has needed to. ITV bosses tried persistently, she claimed, to find out what was going on between former This Morning star Phillip Schofield and a young runner.\nThe broadcaster's argument about why no action was taken effectively boiled down to: how can you properly investigate with no concrete evidence?\nSchofield's fragile mental state surrounding his coming out as gay was also cited as a reason they felt they had to tread carefully. There was a focus on welfare, which is no doubt a key concern, and particularly in recent years after the death of Love Island presenter Caroline Flack.\nAccusations that the runner in question had been made to sign a non-disclosure agreement were dismissed, while a \"pay-off\" that has been speculated about was explained as a standard redundancy payment after the COVID pandemic.\nIs there a toxic working environment at This Morning? The bosses insisted no, and presented a rosy picture of how staff, when surveyed, gave glowing assessments of their employer. Whistleblowing numbers were widely displayed in staff toilets, they said, and in lifts, and every effort is made to make sure staff feel comfortable enough to express their concerns.\nProfessional boundaries were crossed, the power balance was \"inappropriate\",  Dame Carolyn admitted.\nBut her shocked reaction to claims brought up that viewers, on occasion, were referred to as \"Tower Block Traceys\" in production meetings was indicative of the fact that while she is across policy on a corporate level, management are unlikely to be aware of what's being said further down the food chain.\nClearly, there is a disconnect there.\n\n\nIs there a 'toxic' culture at This Morning?Later in the session, MPs asked about allegations of a toxic culture at This Morning, and Dame Carolyn described these as \"deeply\" disappointing.She confirmed the show has received two complaints about bullying or harassment in five years, and said these were \"both taken very seriously\". One of these was from the show's former resident doctor Dr Ranj Singh, who raised concerns about \"bullying and discrimination\" and afterwards said he felt like he was \"managed out\" for whistleblowing.\"It deeply disappoints me but we do not recognise that at This Morning, we have tangible evidence to tell you where the vast majority of people at daytime at This Morning are extremely engaged and very motivated,\" Dame Carolyn said.Read more:Holly Willoughby's full statement in This Morning returnAlison Hammond breaks down on This MorningSchofield apologises over affair - and says he has 'lost everything' \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP John Nicholson told the panel he had received many messages from employees past and present at ITV talking about the bullying culture at the broadcaster, with one describing daytime TV as \"particularly toxic\".Dame Carolyn replied: \"They're very disappointing to hear. Deeply distressing. I've said we've had two official complaints, both of them investigated - it does not fill me with anything but sorrow.\"She also described comments from This Morning editor Martin Frizell as \"foolish\", after he referred to aubergines when asked about allegations of a \"toxic\" work environment on the programme. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:37\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Morning boss: 'Do you like aubergine?' \n\n\n\n\"I think Martin has made a mistake, I think he knows he made a mistake, I don't think he intended to say that. It was a foolish comment; an ill-advised comment, I absolutely agree,\" she said.An independent review into the facts by a barrister, commissioned by ITV, was also discussed during the hearing, with Dame Carolyn saying: \"There will be things to learn.\"The barrister will review complaints made since 1 January 2016, and consider whether steps taken to deal with them were \"appropriate and adequate\".The review is expected to be completed by the end of September. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\nDue to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.\nOpen Privacy Options\n\n\nThe session ended with chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage saying the committee wants to be confident that \"ITV isn't letting star power and favouritism damage the lives or careers of those working there\".Dame Carolyn responded by saying that ITV takes \"every allegation about our culture seriously, but I think it would be very wrong to depict ITV as having an issue\".\n"}]
