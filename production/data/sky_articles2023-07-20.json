The toilet was an open drain in the corner of a cell which he shared with 42 people, some of them hardened criminals. He had to pay some of them for protection.Brian's brother John, who dropped everything to help coordinate his release, said: \"In his words, they were al Qaeda terrorists.

The couple's three children are growing up without their father.\"I am angry,\" Zeynure told Sky News. \"My children ask every day: where is my dad?\"Idris is a computer scientist who spread the word about China's treatment of his people. Human rights groups have called China's treatment of Uyghurs a genocide. The Chinese authorities accused Idris of what they call \"terrorism\".He was arrested at an airport in Morocco after China requested a red notice through Interpol. Although Interpol quickly cancelled the notice - admitting that it was in breach of its own rules against political, religious and racial persecution - it was too late. Idris was already in a Moroccan prison. Despite claiming asylum, he is still in prison and fighting against extradition to China.\"If the Moroccan government send me to China, this would be equal to death for me,\" Idris told us on the phone from prison, where he's in solitary confinement. \"Maybe I am forever in prison. I cannot see my children and my family - forever.\"The Moroccan government says Idris Hasan's extradition has been suspended whilst appeals by his legal team are ongoing. It confirmed the red notice which led to his arrest has been cancelled.Authorities in China were also approached for comment. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n Pic Sahar Zand \n        \n\n\n\nTalking to InterpolInterpol is a membership organisation for the world's police forces.It was founded in the wake of the First World War, when global powers came together to combat cross-border crime. As global travel has become easier, and technology more sophisticated, fighting international crime is harder than ever. Interpol will celebrate its 100th anniversary later this year, and the challenges it faces have never been greater.\"If a murderer is on the run, time matters. It's a time-sensitive thing. Somebody can jump on a plane in a few hours, be somewhere else and commit the next crime. So we need to act fast,\" Interpol's secretary-general, Jurgen Stock, told Sky News.The red notice system is the cornerstone of Interpol's toolkit. A police force in one country can issue a red notice request to Interpol for a fugitive. Interpol then pins that red notice to an internal message board visible to police around the world. Each country then acts on the information according to their own protocols. These can vary significantly. Some countries don't generally act on them, others treat them as if they were arrest warrants.Despite Interpol's own guidelines saying that notices can't be actioned if they have political, ethnic, military or religious intent, it's clear that some of this nature are still getting through. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n Jurgen Stock from Interpol spoke to Sky News\n        \n\n\n\nMr Stock took the helm in 2014 and will leave office next year. To combat abuses of red notices, he created a new taskforce to check them prior to circulation and beefed up the review council that investigates the worst cases. He sees his red notice reforms as defining his legacy.But cases are still slipping through the net, and human rights lawyers and advocates claim the system is open to error and abuse.In an interview at Interpol's French headquarters, Mt Stock described the red notice system as \"very robust\" but admitted it can break down - decrying every abuse as \"one case too many\".The organisation has improved its transparency under his leadership, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the success of his reforms within the notice system from the available data.The secretary-general isn't willing to be drawn on the specifics of any individual cases, and won't name the countries with the worst track records. Instead he points to the challenge of ensuring cooperation between countries with very different legal systems, who are sometimes locked in thorny diplomatic relations, and occasionally even at war with each other.He also defends the red notice system as a whole, for its \"unique capability\" for catching the world's most wanted international fugitives.\"The percentage of international-related organised crime and terrorism is increasing all around the world - that makes this a mechanism only Interpol can provide.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nBrian Glendinning\n        \n\n\n\n'I've lost my way'Interpol has a two-step process for preventing misuse.The Notices and Diffusions Taskforce examines notices before they are published.In 2022, it concluded that 304 notices contravened its rules against political, racial or religious persecution or were otherwise in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and declined to issue them.The data for the secondary review body is more limited. The latest report shows that hundreds of people apply each year to have a red notice removed.In 2021, Interpol's post-publication review body concluded that 296 cases weren't compliant with their own rules and were deleted.Experts like Ted Bromund, an Interpol historian, maintain that this figure only represents the tip of the iceberg.\"If you see a cockroach on the floor of your kitchen and you stamp on it, what are the odds that there are no more cockroaches under the fridge, behind the range or in the walls?\" he said.There are very few countries around the world where a relatively small amount of unpaid bank debt would result in imprisonment. But Interpol inadvertently provides the tools for countries to \"export their justice system\" abroad, according to Radha Stirling, an advocate who has helped the Glendinning family navigate his detention.\"Interpol is their bypass, it allows them to export their justice worldwide at the click of a button,\" she told us.Radha runs Detained in Dubai, an organisation that advocates for people detained abroad. Interpol notice cases are an increasing part of her workload. She has seen hundreds of clients' lives change beyond recognition.\"A lot of the time the Interpol notice is the punishment,\" she says. \"It's a method of state harassment.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b9408f51ac3320013100cf", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/coutts-bank-hits-back-amid-nigel-farage-account-row-12924062", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Coutts hits back amid Nigel Farage bank account row", "lead": "Coutts has said it does not close customer bank accounts \"solely on the basis of legally held political and personal views\" as it comes under heavy criticism for terminating its relationship with Nigel Farage.", "author": "\nAlexandra Rogers\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:41:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:11:27.246741", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-nigel-farage-cpac_6208430.jpg?20230705125913", "body": "\nCoutts has said it does not close customer bank accounts \"solely on the basis of legally held political and personal views\" as it comes under heavy criticism for terminating its relationship with Nigel Farage.A number of Conservatives publicly criticised the bank after the former UKIP and Brexit Party leader claimed his account was closed down because his views did not align with the firm's \"values\".\n\n\n\nIn light of the row, the Treasury is preparing to force banks to give customers three months' notice of account closures and to provide a full explanation.Banks also face losing their licences if they close accounts because they do not agree with a customer's political beliefs, amid concerns over free speech.Strikes hit railways and NHS; parliament's final day before summer recess - politics latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new statement issued on Thursday, a Coutts spokesperson acknowledged the \"substantial interest\" in the Farage case but said it could not comment in detail because of customer confidentiality obligations.However, they stressed \"it is not Coutts' policy to close customer accounts solely on the basis of legally held political and personal views\". \n\nMore on Nigel Farage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Nigel Farage on 'vitriol' in document he claims shows why Coutts bank account was closed\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Banks face Treasury clampdown in Farage account closure row\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  What are PEPs and are banks allowed to close their accounts?\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nNigel Farage\n\n\n\n\n\nCoutts added: \"Decisions to close an account are not taken lightly and involve a number of factors including commercial viability, reputational considerations, and legal and regulatory requirements.\"We recognise the critical importance of access to banking.

But he had paid most of it off, and figured he would settle it eventually. \n\nMore on Interpol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Dirty Work: The Misuse of Interpol Red Notices - Episode One: Russian Roulette \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Dirty Work: The Misuse of Interpol Red Notices\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nInterpol\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the bank took the father of three to court - and a warrant was issued for his arrest. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nBrian Glendinning and his family\n        \n\n\n\nBrian was arrested while on his way to a job in Iraq in September 2022 - and his wife Kimberley recalled the moment when she found out he was being held at the airport. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My heart actually missed a beat,\" she said, her voice quavering.Nobody knew when or how Brian would be released. He was moved from Basra to a prison in the capital, Baghdad.He was able to convince the prison guards to let him call home occasionally, but his family never knew when the phone would ring.Conditions inside the jail were poor. The toilet was an open drain in the corner of a cell which he shared with 42 people, some of them hardened criminals. He had to pay some of them for protection.Brian's brother John, who dropped everything to help coordinate his release, said: \"In his words, they were al Qaeda terrorists. People who have murdered their own father. And Brian's in for about the last \u00a34,000 to 5,000 of a loan. It doesn't make sense.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nBrian and his granddaughter\n        \n\n\n\nKimberley was equally stunned. Her husband is a good guy, she says, and has never been in trouble before.Her mind kept racing with dark thoughts about what he might be going through. She was afraid that even if she did get her husband back - he might never be the same again.\"Brian said to me that there's things that he's seen in that cell ... he never thought he'd see in his lifetime.\"Unlike many others, Brian's nightmare did eventually end. He spent nine weeks in prison before striking a deal with the bank to get them to drop the notice. He had to pay more than \u00a330,000 - a sum far larger than the original debt. But he had a supportive family and assistance from the British government.His return home hasn't been easy. It's clear this experience has shaken him deeply.Read more: North Korea 'not responding' over soldier who illegally crossed border'Lioness' on the loose in Berlin sparks stay inside alert\"I've lost my way,\" he said in his first interview since returning from Iraq. \"I had a plan, a route that I was going down.

Will I ever put it behind me?\" he asked.Representatives of the Qatari government and the national bank were approached for comment and have not responded. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nA protest to free Brian Glendinning.

The couple's three children are growing up without their father.\"I am angry,\" Zeynure told Sky News. \"My children ask every day: where is my dad?\"Idris is a computer scientist who spread the word about China's treatment of his people. Human rights groups have called China's treatment of Uyghurs a genocide. The Chinese authorities accused Idris of what they call \"terrorism\".He was arrested at an airport in Morocco after China requested a red notice through Interpol. Although Interpol quickly cancelled the notice - admitting that it was in breach of its own rules against political, religious and racial persecution - it was too late. Idris was already in a Moroccan prison. Despite claiming asylum, he is still in prison and fighting against extradition to China.\"If the Moroccan government send me to China, this would be equal to death for me,\" Idris told us on the phone from prison, where he's in solitary confinement. \"Maybe I am forever in prison. I cannot see my children and my family - forever.\"The Moroccan government says Idris Hasan's extradition has been suspended whilst appeals by his legal team are ongoing. It confirmed the red notice which led to his arrest has been cancelled.Authorities in China were also approached for comment. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n Pic Sahar Zand \n        \n\n\n\nTalking to InterpolInterpol is a membership organisation for the world's police forces.It was founded in the wake of the First World War, when global powers came together to combat cross-border crime. As global travel has become easier, and technology more sophisticated, fighting international crime is harder than ever. Interpol will celebrate its 100th anniversary later this year, and the challenges it faces have never been greater.\"If a murderer is on the run, time matters. It's a time-sensitive thing. Somebody can jump on a plane in a few hours, be somewhere else and commit the next crime. So we need to act fast,\" Interpol's secretary-general, Jurgen Stock, told Sky News.The red notice system is the cornerstone of Interpol's toolkit. A police force in one country can issue a red notice request to Interpol for a fugitive. Interpol then pins that red notice to an internal message board visible to police around the world. Each country then acts on the information according to their own protocols. These can vary significantly. Some countries don't generally act on them, others treat them as if they were arrest warrants.Despite Interpol's own guidelines saying that notices can't be actioned if they have political, ethnic, military or religious intent, it's clear that some of this nature are still getting through. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n Jurgen Stock from Interpol spoke to Sky News\n        \n\n\n\nMr Stock took the helm in 2014 and will leave office next year. To combat abuses of red notices, he created a new taskforce to check them prior to circulation and beefed up the review council that investigates the worst cases. He sees his red notice reforms as defining his legacy.But cases are still slipping through the net, and human rights lawyers and advocates claim the system is open to error and abuse.In an interview at Interpol's French headquarters, Mt Stock described the red notice system as \"very robust\" but admitted it can break down - decrying every abuse as \"one case too many\".The organisation has improved its transparency under his leadership, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the success of his reforms within the notice system from the available data.The secretary-general isn't willing to be drawn on the specifics of any individual cases, and won't name the countries with the worst track records. Instead he points to the challenge of ensuring cooperation between countries with very different legal systems, who are sometimes locked in thorny diplomatic relations, and occasionally even at war with each other.He also defends the red notice system as a whole, for its \"unique capability\" for catching the world's most wanted international fugitives.\"The percentage of international-related organised crime and terrorism is increasing all around the world - that makes this a mechanism only Interpol can provide.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nBrian Glendinning\n        \n\n\n\n'I've lost my way'Interpol has a two-step process for preventing misuse.The Notices and Diffusions Taskforce examines notices before they are published.In 2022, it concluded that 304 notices contravened its rules against political, racial or religious persecution or were otherwise in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and declined to issue them.The data for the secondary review body is more limited. The latest report shows that hundreds of people apply each year to have a red notice removed.In 2021, Interpol's post-publication review body concluded that 296 cases weren't compliant with their own rules and were deleted.Experts like Ted Bromund, an Interpol historian, maintain that this figure only represents the tip of the iceberg.\"If you see a cockroach on the floor of your kitchen and you stamp on it, what are the odds that there are no more cockroaches under the fridge, behind the range or in the walls?\" he said.There are very few countries around the world where a relatively small amount of unpaid bank debt would result in imprisonment. But Interpol inadvertently provides the tools for countries to \"export their justice system\" abroad, according to Radha Stirling, an advocate who has helped the Glendinning family navigate his detention.\"Interpol is their bypass, it allows them to export their justice worldwide at the click of a button,\" she told us.Radha runs Detained in Dubai, an organisation that advocates for people detained abroad. Interpol notice cases are an increasing part of her workload. She has seen hundreds of clients' lives change beyond recognition.\"A lot of the time the Interpol notice is the punishment,\" she says. \"It's a method of state harassment.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b9409151ac3320013100d8", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/mystery-continues-over-deaths-of-more-than-3500-birds-on-aberdeenshire-coast-amid-suspected-avian-flu-outbreak-12924147", "primaryCategory": "uk", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bird flu or something else?

The toilet was an open drain in the corner of a cell which he shared with 42 people, some of them hardened criminals. He had to pay some of them for protection.Brian's brother John, who dropped everything to help coordinate his release, said: \"In his words, they were al Qaeda terrorists.

The couple's three children are growing up without their father.\"I am angry,\" Zeynure told Sky News. \"My children ask every day: where is my dad?\"Idris is a computer scientist who spread the word about China's treatment of his people. Human rights groups have called China's treatment of Uyghurs a genocide. The Chinese authorities accused Idris of what they call \"terrorism\".He was arrested at an airport in Morocco after China requested a red notice through Interpol. Although Interpol quickly cancelled the notice - admitting that it was in breach of its own rules against political, religious and racial persecution - it was too late. Idris was already in a Moroccan prison. Despite claiming asylum, he is still in prison and fighting against extradition to China.\"If the Moroccan government send me to China, this would be equal to death for me,\" Idris told us on the phone from prison, where he's in solitary confinement. \"Maybe I am forever in prison. I cannot see my children and my family - forever.\"The Moroccan government says Idris Hasan's extradition has been suspended whilst appeals by his legal team are ongoing. It confirmed the red notice which led to his arrest has been cancelled.Authorities in China were also approached for comment. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n Pic Sahar Zand \n        \n\n\n\nTalking to InterpolInterpol is a membership organisation for the world's police forces.It was founded in the wake of the First World War, when global powers came together to combat cross-border crime. As global travel has become easier, and technology more sophisticated, fighting international crime is harder than ever. Interpol will celebrate its 100th anniversary later this year, and the challenges it faces have never been greater.\"If a murderer is on the run, time matters. It's a time-sensitive thing. Somebody can jump on a plane in a few hours, be somewhere else and commit the next crime. So we need to act fast,\" Interpol's secretary-general, Jurgen Stock, told Sky News.The red notice system is the cornerstone of Interpol's toolkit. A police force in one country can issue a red notice request to Interpol for a fugitive. Interpol then pins that red notice to an internal message board visible to police around the world. Each country then acts on the information according to their own protocols. These can vary significantly. Some countries don't generally act on them, others treat them as if they were arrest warrants.Despite Interpol's own guidelines saying that notices can't be actioned if they have political, ethnic, military or religious intent, it's clear that some of this nature are still getting through. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n Jurgen Stock from Interpol spoke to Sky News\n        \n\n\n\nMr Stock took the helm in 2014 and will leave office next year. To combat abuses of red notices, he created a new taskforce to check them prior to circulation and beefed up the review council that investigates the worst cases. He sees his red notice reforms as defining his legacy.But cases are still slipping through the net, and human rights lawyers and advocates claim the system is open to error and abuse.In an interview at Interpol's French headquarters, Mt Stock described the red notice system as \"very robust\" but admitted it can break down - decrying every abuse as \"one case too many\".The organisation has improved its transparency under his leadership, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the success of his reforms within the notice system from the available data.The secretary-general isn't willing to be drawn on the specifics of any individual cases, and won't name the countries with the worst track records. Instead he points to the challenge of ensuring cooperation between countries with very different legal systems, who are sometimes locked in thorny diplomatic relations, and occasionally even at war with each other.He also defends the red notice system as a whole, for its \"unique capability\" for catching the world's most wanted international fugitives.\"The percentage of international-related organised crime and terrorism is increasing all around the world - that makes this a mechanism only Interpol can provide.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nBrian Glendinning\n        \n\n\n\n'I've lost my way'Interpol has a two-step process for preventing misuse.The Notices and Diffusions Taskforce examines notices before they are published.In 2022, it concluded that 304 notices contravened its rules against political, racial or religious persecution or were otherwise in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and declined to issue them.The data for the secondary review body is more limited. The latest report shows that hundreds of people apply each year to have a red notice removed.In 2021, Interpol's post-publication review body concluded that 296 cases weren't compliant with their own rules and were deleted.Experts like Ted Bromund, an Interpol historian, maintain that this figure only represents the tip of the iceberg.\"If you see a cockroach on the floor of your kitchen and you stamp on it, what are the odds that there are no more cockroaches under the fridge, behind the range or in the walls?\" he said.There are very few countries around the world where a relatively small amount of unpaid bank debt would result in imprisonment. But Interpol inadvertently provides the tools for countries to \"export their justice system\" abroad, according to Radha Stirling, an advocate who has helped the Glendinning family navigate his detention.\"Interpol is their bypass, it allows them to export their justice worldwide at the click of a button,\" she told us.Radha runs Detained in Dubai, an organisation that advocates for people detained abroad. Interpol notice cases are an increasing part of her workload. She has seen hundreds of clients' lives change beyond recognition.\"A lot of the time the Interpol notice is the punishment,\" she says. \"It's a method of state harassment.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b9409351ac3320013100df", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/travis-king-north-korea-not-responding-to-us-over-soldier-who-illegally-crossed-border-12924045", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "North Korea 'not responding' to US after soldier illegally crossed into the country", "lead": "US officials have attempted to contact North Korean counterparts over an American soldier who bolted across the border from South Korea - but say they are yet to hear back from Pyongyang.", "author": "\nJames Robinson\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 10:43:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:11:31.550398", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-travis-king-north-korea_6224049.jpg?20230720075739", "body": "\nUS officials have attempted to contact North Korean counterparts over an American soldier who bolted across the border from South Korea - but say they are yet to hear back from Pyongyang.Private Second Class Travis T King was on a tour of the Joint Security Area (JSA), on the border of the village of Panmunjom, when he suddenly made a dash between the iconic blue buildings and crossed into the secretive country.\n\n\n\nThe 23-year-old was reportedly facing disciplinary action by the US military at the time.

That portfolio includes most of the seabed around the UK.\nAlthough it all belongs to the King, the net profits go straight to the Treasury, which then gives a percentage back to the monarch to pay for his official duties.\nThat percentage was set at 25%, which includes an extra 10% to pay for the renovation of Buckingham Palace.\nThe reason that percentage is dropping to 12% is because of swelling income from offshore wind farm projects, which are significantly increasing Crown Estate profits.\nBack in January, the King asked his treasurer - also known as the Keeper of the Privy Purse - to tell the Treasury he wanted profits from wind energy to be used for \"the wider public good\".\nPut simply, the King's income from the Crown Estate stays the same, but the Treasury gets a multimillion-pound boost.\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b9409751ac3320013100ea", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/trains-to-europe-may-be-better-for-the-climate-but-theyre-four-times-more-expensive-than-flying-12924080", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Trains to Europe may be better for the climate, but they're four times more expensive than flying", "lead": "Taking the train to holiday spots in Europe is four times more expensive than flying on average, according to new research.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-07-20 12:54:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:11:35.613771", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-plane-flying-sun-aviation_6224249.jpg?20230720104357", "body": "\nTaking the train to holiday spots in Europe is four times more expensive than flying on average, according to new research.

The Tories have failed the country. They can't be trusted to run London.\"The Tory contest was a two-horse race itself between Ms Hall and Mr Hossain after the third candidate, Daniel Korski, quit the contest last month when a TV producer accused him of groping her a decade ago - an allegation he denies.At the time, Ms Hall said Mr Korski \"fought a hard campaign with lots of fresh ideas\" but that the allegations against him were \"serious and it is right that they are investigated in the proper way\". \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nSadiq Khan \n        \n\n\n\nWho is Susan Hall?Ms Hall is from Harrow in northwest London, where she owns a hair salon and raised her family.She worked in her father's garage after finishing school and said she originally wanted to be a mechanic but struggled to get into technical college as a woman.She was elected to Harrow Council in 2006 and went on to lead the council from 2013 to 2014.In 2017 she was elected to the London Assembly, replacing now cabinet minister Kemi Badenoch after she took up her seat in parliament.She became deputy leader for the London Assembly Conservatives in 2018 and served as leader from 2019 to 2023. \n\n\nAnalysis: Result will be relief for Tories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Akass\n\nPolitics and business correspondent\n@amandaakass\n\n\n\nFor many voters, the response to the Conservatives' London mayoral candidate Susan Hall may be: Susan Who?\nMs Hall has been a member of the London Assembly for five years and previously served as the Conservative group leader.\n\n\nMozammel Hossain, the defeated candidate, was even less well-known - a criminal barrister with no previous political experience at all.\nBut perhaps the lack of reputation may prove to be an advantage in a contest against Labour's Sadiq Khan, one of the UK's most well-known politicians - and increasingly notorious with some voters angry about his plans to expand ULEZ to all London boroughs at the end of August.  \nMr Khan, bidding for his third term in office, argues the policy is needed to fight air pollution and protect Londoners' health. It means people will have to pay \u00a312.50 a day to drive old polluting vehicles and is likely to be the key battleground of the mayoral election next May.\nMs Hall has promised to halt ULEZ expansion on day one.\nThe Conservatives' efforts to choose a candidate has been bumpy.\nPaul Scully, the minister for London, had widely been seen as the Tory frontrunner but wasn't shortlisted (perhaps because Rishi Sunak could ill-afford yet another by-election in an suburban seat, Sutton and Cheam, which had previously been a Liberal Democrat stronghold).\nThe third shortlisted candidate,  former Downing Street advisor Daniel Korski, had to quit the race last month, after he was accused of groping a TV producer a decade ago. He denies the claim.\nAfter all the turmoil the Conservatives will be glad to have settled on a fresh candidate to rally around.\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b9409c51ac3320013100f5", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/who-is-susan-hall-the-hair-salon-owner-and-london-mayor-hopeful-who-says-sadiq-khan-fears-her-most-12900878", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Susan Hall: The hair salon owner who claims she's who Sadiq Khan 'fears most'", "lead": "Susan Hall has been announced as the Tory candidate who will challenge Sadiq Khan in next year's London mayoral election.", "author": "\nJosephine Franks\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-19 15:40:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-20 16:11:40.111719", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/07/70x70/skynews-susan-hall-london-mayor_6223221.jpg?20230719113920", "body": "\nSusan Hall has been announced as the Tory candidate who will challenge Sadiq Khan in next year's London mayoral election.As a member of the London Assembly for five years, she is no stranger to City Hall and has regularly faced off against the current leader at Mayor's Question Time.\n\n\n\nMs Hall was chosen by London Conservative party members after running on a platform of safety and \"fears\".Her tagline is \"Safer with Susan\" and during the selection race, she called herself \"the candidate Sadiq Khan fears the most\".London Labour has called her a \"hard-right politician who couldn't be more out of touch with our city and its values\".With an election scheduled for May 4 next year, Sky News looks at her political career and campaigning priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCouncillor Susan Hall speaks to the media at the Battle of Britain Bunker after being named as the Conservative Party candidate for the Mayor of London\n        \n\n\n\nParty: ConservativeCampaigning priorities: Reverse the ULEZ expansion, crack down on crimeNotable achievements: Leader of the London Conservatives on the London Assembly from 2019 until May 2023Hair salon owner who wanted to be a mechanicMs Hall is from Harrow in northwest London, where she owns a hair salon and raised her family. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has said she originally wanted to be a mechanic and worked in her father's garage after finishing school, but struggled to get into technical college as a woman.She was elected to Harrow Council in 2006 and went on to lead the council from 2013 to 2014.London AssemblyMs Hall has been a member of the London Assembly since 2017, replacing now cabinet minister Kemi Badenoch after her election to parliament.The London Assembly is part of the Greater London Authority and is made up of 25 elected individuals who scrutinise the actions of the mayor and investigate issues of importance to Londoners.She became deputy leader for the London Assembly Conservatives in 2018 and served as leader from 2019 to 2023.Read more:Daniel Korski drops out of race to become Tory candidate for London MayorCampaigning prioritiesTackling crime, the housing crisis and ULEZ are all high on Ms Hall's list of priorities, detailed on her campaign website.She said she will \"hunt down and lock up\" muggers and burglars by creating a special team within the Met tasked with tackling them.She promised to stop the ULEZ expansion on day one, \"no ifs, no buts\".Ms Hall also said she will address the housing crisis by \"building a lot more homes in the right places\".Her words after being selected In a statement, Ms Hall said it was a \"huge honour to be the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London\".She said Mr Khan, who is in his second term as London Mayor, has made no significant achievements during his time in office and has no \"interest in loving others\".\"He (Sadiq Khan) goes on trips while young people get stabbed on our streets,\" she said.\"He's more interested in selling his book than he is helping Londoners with the cost of living.\"When things go wrong, he hires an army of spin doctors to convince you it's actually not his fault.\"I'll do whatever it takes to win.\"ControversiesAfter Ms Hall's selection was announced, London Labour hit back with a scathing assessment about her record and views, branding her a \"hard-right politician who couldn't be more out of touch with our city and its values\".She has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, tweeting in 2020: \"Make sure you win and wipe the smile off [Sadiq Khan's] face\".She also compared the former's presidents' supporters who stormed the Capitol to \"remainers\" refusing to accept the result of the Brexit referendum.Other controversial comments on Twitter include her backing of Home Secretary Suella Braverman's use of the word \"invasion\" when it came to small boats crossing the Channel, with Ms Hall posting: \"Well the term invasion is correct.

clear, junior doctors & nurses striking for fair & decent pay isn't the cause of our NHS in crisis - it's the symptom of 13 years of Tory Govt underfunding, understaffing & undervaluing it.\"More than half a million hospital appointments have been cancelled due to the wave of NHS strike action which began in December, involving nurses, paramedics, physiotherapists and doctors.The row comes ahead of a 48-hour strike by hospital consultants starting on Thursday, which NHS leaders have warned will leave routine care \"at a standstill\".This follows the longest period of industrial action in the history of the NHS by junior doctors, which lasted five days from last Thursday to Tuesday morning.Disruption is expected to continue throughout summer after the BMA rejected the government's \"final offer\" of a 6% pay rise, calling the increase \"a savage real-terms pay cut\".During PMQs Mr Sunak said doctors should accept the proposal and called on Sir Keir to back the government's position.\"On this crucial issue, while his MPs are back on the picket lines, yet again on this issue he simply refuses to take a position,\" he said.However Mr Sunak was then reprimanded by the Speaker of the House, who reminded him the prime minister is the one who should be answering questions.Sir Keir went onto attack the government's NHS workforce plan, which he claimed was \"nicked\" from Labour but not fully costed, and also raised a report which showed the government is on track to break a key promise to build 40 new hospitals by 2030.The PM insisted: \"Not only are we going to deliver on our manifesto commitment to build 40 new hospitals across the country by 2030, we're not just stopping there, we're also delivering 100 hospital upgrades across the country and crucially over 100 new community diagnostic centres to speed up treatment for people.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64b9409d51ac3320013100f7", "url":

so would be neither onerous nor time-consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe requirement for secondary, rather than primary, legislation should also shorten the timetable for implementing the changes, they added.Bank customers would also retain their right to appeal against their lender's decision to close an account, with the presumption that a fixed notice period and greater transparency about the reasons for the bank's decision would facilitate a more effective appeal. \n\nMore on Nigel Farage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Coutts hits back amid Nigel Farage bank account row\n

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, he disclosed documents produced by Coutts - which is part of the taxpayer-backed bank NatWest Group - showing that his accounts had been

concerns that banks might be disenfranchising customers for ideological reasons.\"There is a real concern about the precedent that this could set,\" said one insider.In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, Mr Griffith said: \"It would be of serious concern if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech.\"Businesses have the right to protect against reputational risks - eg criminal activity - but the privilege of a banking licence in a democracy should imply a duty not to 'debank' because you disagree with someone's views.\"Mr Farage wrote in

'correct' views are allowed to fully participate in society.\"A Coutts spokesperson said: \"Our ability to respond is restricted by our obligations of client confidentiality.\"Decisions to close

I got some weird questions afterwards from people who could hear me in the next room. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phone needs plenty of time to process the voice as it's all done on the device itself, rather than uploaded to powerful computers somewhere at Apple HQ.It needs to be locked and kept on charge, so probably best you leave it to work overnight.With the voice ready for action, you enable the \"live speech\" function in settings and pick your personal voice. Triple tapping the phone's side button will open a text box, and anything you enter will be spoken aloud.Read more:'Holy Grail' iPhone sells for \u00a3145,000Apple to tweak 'ducking' autocorrect \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nIt requires the user to speak aloud 150 random phrases\n        \n\n\n\nIs it convincing?Without wanting to expose certain relatives' lack of tech know-how, it very much depends.Digital me checked with my sister about the status of Taylor Swift tickets in a WhatsApp voice message and she seemed none the wiser. My mum replied to a cinema invitation with no qualms at all, until I asked whether anything about the message had sounded off.Tech-savvy friends and loved ones were more immediately suspicious.\"Who are you and what have you done with Tom?\" asked one.\"It kind of sounded like you, but as if someone made a robot version,\" said another.

The paper did not name him at the time.Five days later, the Metropolitan Police said they did not believe any criminal activity had taken place and would be taking no further action.Following intense speculation over the identity of the BBC presenter, Edwards' wife, Vicky Flind, confirmed him as the man at the centre of the allegations.In a statement, she said he was \"suffering from serious mental health issues\" and was \"receiving in-patient hospital care\".The Sun - who say they never alleged criminality - say they have no plans to publish further allegations against Edwards.The young person at the centre of the controversy has said - via their lawyer - that their mother's claims are \"rubbish,\" and that \"nothing inappropriate or unlawful\" has taken place.Edwards, who has since been suspended, is also facing separate allegations from several other people in their early 20s. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpreaker\n\n                This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and other technologies.\n                To show you this content, we need your permission to use cookies.\n                You can use the buttons below to amend your preferences to enable Spreaker cookies or to allow those cookies just once.\n                You can change your settings at any time via the Privacy Options.\n            \n\n                Unfortunately we have been unable to verify if you have consented to Spreaker cookies.\n                To view this content you can use the button below to allow Spreaker cookies for this session only.\n            \n\nEnable Cookies\nAllow Cookies Once\n\n\n\nClick to subscribe to Backstage wherever you get your podcastsAt the weekend, Sir Tony Blair told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the BBC should \"stand up for itself more\" when asked about its response to the situation.As the face of BBC News At 10, the 61-year-old has previously led election night coverage, and broke the news of Queen Elizabeth II's death.

He was a staunch defender of Victorian architecture, helping to save London's St Pancras Station from demolition.\nCecil Day-Lewis: A poet and novelist, one of Day-Lewis' pieces was Walking Away, which explored fatherhood and broken relationships.
