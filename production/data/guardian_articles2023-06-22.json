Here is a wrap of the day\u2019s biggest stories: Greens senator David Shoebridge has said PwC won a contract with the Australian federal police without a tender process and public discussion, and was ironed out between \u201ctwo mates, some other partners from PwC and the chief operating officer from the AFP\u201d. The Senate has set up an inquiry into the rental crisis, a process designed by the Greens to pressure the Albanese government to agree to freeze or cap rising rents. Deputy leader of the Liberal party, Susan Ley, accused the prime minister of having a \u201cbullying attitude\u201d towards Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather. Australia\u2019s eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has issued a legal notice to the social media giant headed by Elon Musk demanding an explanation about what it is doing to tackle online hate. The NSW government has been accused of bowing to pressure from gambling lobbyists after confirming its promised expanded cashless gaming trial was delayed. Newcrest\u2019s Cadia Hill goldmine in central west NSW \u2013 one of the largest goldmines in the world \u2013 is releasing \u201can unacceptable level of dust\u201d and failing to meet clean air standards. More than 1,000 private schools will be overfunded by $3.2bn as inequity in the education system deepens, documents released through freedom of information reveal. Prominent Indigenous voice campaigner and senior Australian of the Year, Professor Tom Calma, has lashed out at politicians for deliberately \u201cpeddling misinformation\u201d about the referendum, saying they \u201cshould know better, if they\u2019ve got a conscience\u201d than to \u201cmislead\u201d voters. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has confirmed a decision on who will take on the role of Reserve Bank for the next term will be made next month. Speakman queries police explanation for silence over Tasering of Claire Nowland NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, today again questioned the police commissioner\u2019s explanation for why the public was not told for two days about the Tasering of 95-year-old Claire Nowland. NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the priority was to ensure Nowland\u2019s family was informed directly and the integrity of the investigation was maintained. But Opposition leader Mark Speakman cast doubt on that theory today: You can put plenty of labels on it but there is a lack of accountability and a lack of transparency. There was an initial failure to disclose that Mrs Nowland had tragically been Tasered. That delay took up to 54 hours and although a reason has been offered that they needed to talk to the family, it hasn\u2019t been explained why it took up to 54 hours. Following AAP revealing yesterday that several key details were slashed from the first public statement about the incident, Speakman said police could have mentioned the Taser and other details while de-identifying Nowland. Police minister Yasmin Catley deflected a barrage of questions in parliament today about when she saw the first police statement and when Nowland\u2019s next of kin were informed. The minister reiterated the police decision to not release \u201cgraphic details\u201d until the family was fully informed and stressed the steps police took to ensure the incident was properly investigated. Greens oppose bill that would require ACT to hold inquiry into Calvary hospital takeover, senator says The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John has said the party supports the ACT government\u2019s planned takeover of Calvary hospital and does not support Matt Canavan\u2019s bill that, if passed, would require the territory to have an inquiry into the proposed takeover. It comes after the Greens and Coalition voted in the Senate to refer Matt Canavan\u2019s bill about the Calvary hospital takeover to an inquiry. Jordan Steele-John said: We support the ACT Greens approach to Calvary hospital and we oppose the Canavan bill. The Greens support private senator\u2019s bills being referred to committees, as is the normal practice, even where we don\u2019t support the bill itself. ABC\u2019s international budget should grow as China spends billions on information war, inquiry told China is spending billions to win the information war in the region, a committee inquiry has heard, and greater funding for the ABC would allow it to be a stronger presence in the Asia-Pacific. Claire Gorman, the ABC\u2019s head of international services, told the inquiry into supporting democracy in the region that China is spending at least $3bn a year on international media, compared with $11m for the ABC. Extra funding due to roll out from July means the national broadcaster \u201cstands ready\u201d to do more to advance democracy, civil society and peace, she said. Read the full story here: UN report criticises religious exemption laws for increasing anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination A report by the UN has called out Australia\u2019s religious exemption laws for increasing discrimination against LGBTQ+ people by faith-based service providers and religious schools. The report, by independent expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, said it had learned of several cases in Australia where religious schools in Australia have fired teachers because of their sexual orientation. Madrigal-Borloz wrote: Some States justify their acquiescence of such dismissals on the grounds that religious institutions should have autonomy in their internal administration, admissions policies, and curricula. This claim, however, can hinder the successful implementation of plans and programs intended to promote diversity-oriented education, comprehensive sexuality education, and gender equality. Equality Australia legal director, Ghassan Kassisieh, said the report showed protections were urgently needed for LGBTQI+ people: These discriminatory practices are not theoretical or academic. One in three students and almost two in five school employees are employed in non-government schools, most of which are religiously affiliated. Two out of the four adoption providers in NSW explicitly state on their website that you are unable to adopt a child if you are a same-sex couple, thanks to gaps in our legal protections. New higher education loan program to aid startups A new higher education loan program that will help students bring startup ideas to life will soon launch after the education legislation amendment bill passed today. Called START-UP HELP, 1,000 eligible students will have access to the program in a first-year pilot starting early next year. This will later be expanded to 2,000 students. The education minister, Jason Clare, said: The Startup Year means more Australians will have the opportunity to turn their ideas into businesses. The government will work closely with the higher education community and industry to implement the program from early 2024. Labor under pressure to freeze rents as Greens and Coalition back inquiry into housing crisis The Senate has set up an inquiry into the rental crisis, a process designed by the Greens to pressure the Albanese government to agree to freeze or cap rising rents. On Monday the Greens voted with the Coalition to delay consideration of Labor\u2019s $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff) until 16 October, despite pressure from housing groups to pass the bill after the government pledged $2bn of direct funding for social and affordable housing. The Greens and Coalition teamed up again on Thursday to establish the inquiry, which will provide an interim report by 23 September to provide input into the national cabinet process considering renters\u2019 rights set up by the Albanese government.

On Thursday afternoon, the ACCC announced it had issued a draft determination proposing to authorise Qantas (including Jetstar) and Emirates to continue their coordination operation for a further five years. The codeshare alliance was first authorised in 2013, and has allowed the airlines to coordinate passenger and cargo transport operations across their respective networks. The ACCC commissioner, Anna Brakey, said public benefits would include \u201cincreased connectivity and convenience and greater loyalty program benefits for consumers\u201d. \u201cThe coordination will give customers greater choice of flight times and flexibility when travelling on routes where the operations of Qantas and Emirates overlap.\u201d However, the ACCC flagged the continued alliance could harm competition on flights between Sydney and Christchurch, because Air New Zealand is the only other airline operating on that route. \u201cWe have included a condition in the draft approval, requiring Qantas and Emirates to provide the ACCC with information so we can monitor the competitive dynamics on this route during the term of authorisation,\u201d Brakey said. Ballet dancers to take first industrial action in more than four decades Dancers of the Australian Ballet will take industrial action for the first time in more than four decades, after negotiations with management over a new workplace agreement reached an impasse on Monday. Dancers will \u201chold the curtain\u201d at this Friday\u2019s performance in Melbourne, meaning the show Identity, a program of two original works, will be delayed by 15 minutes. In response, ballet management has decided to cancel a one-off bonus performance of a new short work that was scheduled to take place after Friday night\u2019s show, in a move the dancers\u2019 union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, has called \u201cpunitive\u201d, but management said was unavoidable, given the scheduled performance would now run overtime. Read more: Jordyn Beazley will take you through the next little bit as I walk into the night (the sun looks like it is almost down on this, the shortest day of the year) and put Politics Live away until 31 July. There will be a general news blog filling the gap as usual, and please check back to see what we are up to Canberra with Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst leading the way. Parliament might be (almost) adjourned for a while, but the politics doesn\u2019t stop \u2013 I do hope that somewhere in between all of this, you find time to have a small switch-off. And find some fun. As perhaps the ashiest person in this building at the moment, I hope to find some myself at some point! I\u2019ll be back to general political news, but still around to answer your questions, so keep them coming. And as always, please \u2013 take care of you. Labor are livid that earlier today the Greens and Coalition voted in the Senate to refer Matt Canavan\u2019s bill about the Calvary hospital takeover to an inquiry. The bill, if passed, would require the Australian Capital Territory to have an inquiry into the proposed takeover, reporting by 30 June 2024. This is an odd alliance, because the Greens are in Andrew Barr\u2019s ACT government, so the federal Greens are supporting an inquiry into a bill that would establish an inquiry into something the ACT Greens are jointly responsible for. Adam Bandt told reporters in Canberra this was a \u201crun-of-the-mill matter of Senate procedure; there is a longstanding practice in this place where private members\u2019 bills are able to be referred to an inquiry\u201d. Bandt denied that the Greens got something in return for it. Bandt said the Greens position was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d. Asked if the minor party was buying into a culture war, he said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Labor is concerned that the inquiry is being driven by people who view the hospital takeover as an attack on religion, meaning it will give a platform to those who want abortion and trans rights restricted. Here is some of how Mike Bowers saw QT: The Senate still hasn\u2019t moved through the government\u2019s agenda, which means there is the risk of a late night sitting or even a continuation of the sitting tomorrow, which is not impressing senators who have sat longer hours than the house in general this session and are very, very over each other. MP\u2019s smartwatch flags question time with \u2018loud environment\u2019 warning Just back to question time for a moment \u2013 one of the MPs has told me their smartwatch gave them a \u201cloud environment\u201d warning in the midst of some of those interjections, which they say is the first time it\u2019s happened. So seems like everyone needs a break from each other. NSW investigating alleged hack on cashless gaming trial The New South Wales government is investigating an alleged hack on the state\u2019s cashless gaming trial in Newcastle. The Daily Telegraph reported up to 40 customers participating in the trial at Wests Newcastle had been caught up in the breach. A spokesperson for the NSW minister for gaming and racing, David Harris, said Cyber Security NSW is working with its federal counterparts and the NSW police to investigate. The NSW Government has been informed that Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW (L&amp;GNSW) is working with the trial operators. The NSW Government has been informed that operators are assessing any impacts to patrons. The NSW Government strongly believes any cashless gaming trial must have secure privacy and data protections in place. The NSW Government is committed to the establishment of an independent panel of experts to oversee its broader cashless gaming trial. Chandler-Mather says PM misrepresented article as saying \u2018direct opposite\u2019 of its actual argument We finally circle back to Max Chandler-Mather on his original personal explanation where he says he was misrepresented: The prime minister selectively quoted to the extent and then imputed meaning to those quotes that imply the direct opposite of what the article was arguing. He asks to read one quote but Milton Dick says he has given his explanation and doesn\u2019t allow the quote. And that\u2019s it. The last question time until 31 July. Is everyone proud? Sussan Ley ordered to withdraw bullying comment Milton Dick asks Sussan Ley to withdraw and Ley says: I stand by my comment by allegation and Mr Speaker, I will not withdraw it. Dick then basically orders Ley to withdraw it (\u201cto assist the house\u201d is essentially an order. And if a MP doesn\u2019t do it, it kicks off a whole bunch of other procedure.) Ley withdraws to assist the house. This all happened 30 seconds after Dick asked the chamber to reflect on their behaviour and the standards they are setting. And then Sussan Ley adds in her two cents: I certainly felt very uncomfortable with the bullying attitude of the prime minister to a first term MP and not just the dispatch box yesterday but on the way out of the [chamber] (then her microphone is turned off) Milton Dick does what he can to calm the chamber. Tony Burke is not well pleased and stands up to demand that Ley withdraw the bullying allegation: Bullying is a serious allegation and should be withdrawn. And words like that, when they\u2019re used simply when someone took the point of order, it actually creates a problem for when instances occur. And then Tanya Plibersek gets up: In response to the deputy leader of the opposition\u2019s point of order, Mr. Speaker, I feel profoundly offended and worried when the deputy leader of the opposition constantly interjects when ministers on this side are responding to her interjections constantly. They are personal and they are nasty. Which makes half the chamber laugh, because Plibersek has literally included sledges to Ley in some of her dixer answers about \u201chouses on the Gold Coast\u201d and has been in politics for long enough for most things not to bother her. Max Chandler-Mather claims PM misrepresented and \u2018selectively quoted\u2019 him Annnnnddddd theeeennnnnnnn \u2026. Max Chandler-Mather of the Greens makes a personal explanation and goes to say he has been misrepresented by the prime minister: Today in question time, the prime minister so badly selectively quoted an article and then imputed meaning to those words that were the complete opposite of those words \u2026 I don\u2019t mean to explain it in full but I would just like to quote the words some of the words \u2026 Anthony Albanese then has a point of order on that personal statement: A personal explanation has to show when a member has been misrepresented. The member has just stood up and said that I quoted him, which I did. I tabled his own whole article in the Hansard yesterday, which he wasn\u2019t capable of doing, because I want people to read exactly what it is that they are saying, which is that the motivation for the holding up of the housing Australia future plan is all about politics. Adam Bandt then gets up: \u2026. The member should be entitled to be able to make [his statement in full] \u2013 especially on a question of misrepresentation, where the appropriate form is not to intervene while the question or the statement has been made during question time, but to wait until afterwards \u2013 [and the PM] should be entitled to make that point of order after that. Anyone considers that that is a misrepresentation, and the prime minister has other forms that he can take, including making his own as he did yesterday. But it should be a minimum, especially after what you just said, Mr. Speaker, about appropriateness \u2026 [that the member] be able to make his statement in full. Milton Dick reminds house of \u2018shared responsibility\u2019 to develop \u2018safe and respectful culture\u2019 Milton Dick then gives a statement to the house about standards, and uses speaker-talk to tell the MPs to get their shiz together. As the final setting before the house adjourns for the winter, I thought it was timely to remind members of our shared responsibility in relation to developing a safe and respectful culture that has a general demeanour, and the courtesy we show one another in the chamber matters, in the language we use, to the tone and volume [of] contributions, the standing orders, [to] guide and support respectful dealings in the chamber. As a house we have changed our standing orders to facilitate more family-friendly hours. And further, as all members have seen, I\u2019ve been firm and consistent in asking members to withdraw unparliamentary terms when raised by other members. We have clear guidance to about general responsibilities from the safe and respectful workplaces training program, as well as those draft behaviour standards and codes for parliamentarians. We need to act individually and collectively to enliven those values in our culture. Before the house returns on the last day of July, I want to encourage each of us to genuinely reflect on our own behaviour. Consider what contribution we\u2019re making could make towards a safe and respectful workplace environment. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer which is a rah-rah for the government, \u201chere is what we have done! Isn\u2019t this an amazing start! More to do!\u201d and then ends question time. Thank Dolly. \u2018Clearly false\u2019 posts made by no campaign on social media, Burney says Linda Burney is then asked: Can the minister confirm that the voice would have the power to advise the government on taxation policy? (It doesn\u2019t really matter by who, because all of these questions come from the tactics team, but I think it was the member for Hughes.) Burney: I\u2019m not sure how many times I can say this. The provision makes it very clear that the voice will advise on matters that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and matters that affect Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders differently. Differently. Those things like life expectancy, those things like baby birth weights, things like self-harm, these other things that we\u2019re referring to. I cannot be any clearer than that. Can I do so in terms of context, just say that the referendum is about two things: it is about recognition and listening. It is about making a practical difference. We have seen [posts by the] no campaign \u2026 on social media that are clearly false, including an image of Bob Hawke saying that he did not support recognition. And his widow said this: \u2018There are many joys but also many tears in politics.\u2019 This is [Blanche d\u2019Alpuget] speaking: \u2018Bob once said to me, \u201cYunupingu is a soul in torment. He grieves for his people.\u201d Bob grieved too. \u2018His greatest disappointment as prime minister was that he could not deliver his promise to Yunupingu with the indigenous people of Australia \u2013 for recognition.\u2019 PM slams Greens propositions on housing bill as \u2018ill-thought out and opportunistic\u2019 Adam Bandt asks Anthony Albanese: This morning on Radio National, when asked about limiting rent increases, the treasurer [Jim Chalmers] said: we are prepared to show leadership at national cabinet on rental rights and other aspects. We know you oppose a rent freeze but even limits on rent rises would make a massive difference to millions of renters in crisis. With the ACT Greens Labor government limiting rent rises and the Victorian government now looking at rent caps after a deal with the Greens, will you show leadership at national cabinet to help make unlimited rent rises illegal? Albanese says (after a preamble on why Bandt is wrong): I tell you what would have a devastating impact on renters: that would be, in June, to say, \u2018Because the Greens political party have blocked this legislation from being even debated until October\u2019 \u2013 if you said to every property owner out there, \u2018You\u2019ve got till October until the rent freeze comes on\u2019, what do you think would happen? Do you think they\u2019d put up their rents or do you think they would decrease them? That is why your propositions are so ill-thought out and opportunistic. Get on with the program, vote for social housing, do it today in the Senate. Stuart Robert\u2019s involvement in Synergy360 profits \u2018not business as usual\u2019 for an MP, Shorten says Bill Shorten continued: Since then, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, chaired by the member for Bruce, has heard more disturbing allegations against Synergy360 and Mr [Stuart] Robert. The JCPAA heard evidence from Mr [John] Margerison explaining how he instructed his accountant to direct Synergy360 profits derived from commonwealth contracts to a trust in which Mr Robert was a beneficiary. Section 44 (v) of the Australian constitution covers the issue of disqualification of parliamentarians. It states that anyone who: Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth \u2026 shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.[1] To be clear, at this point, we do not know if that threshold was breached. What we do know, this is not business as usual for a member of parliament. Furthermore, despite these revelations, Mr Robert remained on the frontbench until his sudden resignation immediately prior to the formation of the national anti-corruption commission next month, in turn causing the Fadden byelection \u2026 costing millions of dollars \u2026 inconveniencing 109,000 Gold Coast electors. Fundamental questions remain: one, was Mr Margerison installed in Synergy360 to secure Mr Robert\u2019s influence in government procurement and decisions? Two, was Mr Margerison installed in Synergy360 to channel funds through related entities to Mr Robert? And crucially, three, was Mr Robert a shadow director of Synergy360? Shorten says review of contracts awarded under Stuart Robert turned up \u2018real deficiencies\u2019 Bill Shorten takes a dixer on what he has learned about \u201cprior practices\u201d in his portfolio. This sounds like the ministerial statement Shorten was on the notice paper to deliver yesterday, which didn\u2019t happen. It is, as so many of these dixers to Bill Shorten have been, on Stuart Robert: On 24 November last year I first updated the house on disturbing reports in The Age [and] SMH alleging that Mr Stuart Robert used his status as a federal MP to help Canberra lobbying firm Synergy360 sign up corporate clients with the promise of helping them navigate parliament and the bureaucracy and meet key decision-makers, including senior coalition ministers. As further details emerged, I have updated the parliament. The initial report detailed how Mr Robert personally intervened in contracts worth $274 million awarded to Indian software giant Infosys. Mr Robert met with Infosys \u2013 a Synergy360 client \u2013 in December 2019 at the Gold Coast home of his political fundraiser Mr John Margerison. Leaked emails show that he had given \u201cinsights on progress of Infosys and future opportunities\u201d. Flowing from these disturbing revelations, Services Australia and the NDIA investigated potentially tainted contracts linked to Synergy360. The review was led by eminent former public servant Dr Ian Watt. Of the 95 procurements reviewed, Dr Watt found that 19 \u2013 or one in five \u2013 had real deficiencies. PM says commonwealth will do \u2018whatever needs\u2019 to be done to support rebuilding flood-hit communities in NSW The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, asks an actual question of importance. (I just had to pick myself up off the floor.) Littleproud: It\u2019s been more than seven months since flooding hit central west NSW. In towns like Eugowra, more than 100 people are living in temporary housing with no government support to rebuild their homes. When will communities in central west NSW get this support? Anthony Albanese takes it seriously and says he knows there needs to be faster action: I\u2019m willing to do \u2013 whatever needs to [be done], the commonwealth will do. By and large it is states that provide housing, of course; there\u2019s no commonwealth public works department that builds housing and provides support. Some of the issues which are there as well, that we need to work with, are on issues of insurance for people and we know that has been a challenge. Too many people who have lost everything find themselves in disagreement with insurance companies, and we are working with the Insurance Council as well \u2026 I must say, I think there has been significant progress there. I worked very closely with the Perrottet government at the time and we worked in a completely bipartisan way [across] different levels of government, and I\u2019m sure that [with] the incoming government, the Minns government, I will certainly raise the issues that he has raised with me. And I\u2019m willing to work through the break with the member, and also the member of Calare has been diligent for standing up for his community that has suffered so much as well. Marles dixer on defence draws accusations of being unparliamentary Richard Marles took a dixer about defence, which has become a semi-regular event staged so he can talk about how terrible the Coalition was when it came to defence. That is part payback because of the 10 years of having to listen to the Coalition talk about how terrible Labor was when it came to defence. But the Coalition is very touchy over this subject and there are a bunch of points of order over whether or not Marles is being relevant because he is talking about the last parliament (ironic given all the Katy Gallagher questions this sitting), and then whether or not he is being unparliamentary (even more ironic given Dutton\u2019s standard \u201cLabor and unions are terrible\u201d dixers he gave as minister). But everything old is new again. And when the dispatch box is on the other side, things tend to hit differently. In that answer, Milton Dick asked Sussan Ley to stop interjecting. Next minute: The deputy leader of the opposition, I just said don\u2019t interject or you will be warned, and you immediately interjected. I don\u2019t know how clear I can be. She is warned and will remain silent for the rest of question time. Milton Dick is very Dugald Dick today (Milton is his middle name \u2013 when he is cranky he becomes Dugald. Yes, I know, but I can\u2019t help knowing too much about the Queenslanders.) State leaders \u2018conscious of\u2019 housing needs in regions, PM says The independent MP Dr Helen Haines asks: Regional Australia is suffering from a disastrous lack of housing supply. In Wangaratta, people are sleeping in tents because there is nowhere for them to go. Last week the government said it was going to give $2 billion to the state and territories to build thousands of new homes. Did the government impose any conditions or receive any assurances that some of this money must go to regional Australia? Anthony Albanese: When I was having discussions with each of the premiers and chief ministers, as well as at the virtual meeting that we held last Friday afternoon, all of the premiers \u2013 including the premier of Victoria, who of course I announced the program with on Saturday in Moonee Valley and then I had a meeting with him afterwards \u2013 [are] very conscious about the need for homes to be built, not just in our capital cities but in our regions as well. The rest of the answer goes to the housing fund fight. I have now eaten an entire share packet of Violet Crumbles and we are only halfway through this. The Liberal MP Keith Wolahan, who presents exactly as you would expect the Liberal MP for Menzies to present, asks: Yesterday the minister told this house that subsection three of the voice constitutional amendment means parliament will determine the functions and powers of the voice. Isn\u2019t it the case that subsection three explicitly deprives parliament of that power to make laws where those laws conflict with the voice\u2019s powers under subsection two, and interpreting the scope of those powers would be a matter for the high court, not this parliament? There is a back and forth over whether this is asking for a legal opinion or not, but no one seems to have any energy for it, including the speaker, Milton Dick, who appears one point of order away from trying to shut the whole thing down. He says Linda Burney can address the part that relates to her statement yesterday. Burney: I absolutely stand by my response yesterday. The Liberal MP Henry Pike asks Linda Burney: Referendum working group member Thomas Mayo has stated that \u201cwe need the power of the constitution behind us so we can organise like we have never organised before, and that if we keep going, we maintain this momentum, until we change the system, until we tear down the institutions\u201d. Was the minister aware of Mr Mayo\u2019s views when she appointed him to the referendum working group? Burney: I addressed this issue yesterday, and the day before, and I am responsible for what I say. The referendum is about two things. It is about recognition and it is about listening. It is about making a practical difference, and I simply will not engage in the style of politics that we are seeing today. Anthony Albanese must be tired because it seems like he just repeats the same answer he gave yesterday when asked a dixer on housing. Although he mixes it up at the end: Australians rejected the pathology of political conflict that had defined the Morrison government, always looking for an argument, never a solution. But Australians will also reject the phony political conflict being waged by the Greens political party. You can\u2019t say you support public housing while you are voting against it. You can\u2019t say that you are serious about protecting vulnerable people in our society, while you are voting against public housing. Vulnerable people should not be the collateral damage in your manufactured political conflict. Time to stop blocking so we can start building. It\u2019s lucky parliament won\u2019t be sitting for a while because it seems we are one day away from someone disturbing pages from a burn book in the school parliament hallways. I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy Sussan Ley recycles questions on Indigenous voice and Australia Day Julie Collins continues the \u201cGreens are the worst\u201d dixers, and then we get to Sussan Ley, who asks: If the voice provides advice to the government to change or abolish Australia Day, will the government follow that advice? The groans could be heard from space. Linda Burney: I refer to my previous answer on this matter yesterday. And to provide context, Mr Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the four land councils from the Northern Territory that join us today \u2026 They have come together and issued the Barunga voice declaration, which they presented to the prime minister this morning. In part, it says: we need to be heard, and urge our fellow Australians to stand with us and vote yes in the forthcoming referendum for the sake of a better future for all of us. A better future for all of us. Also, given how many targets Australia is failing on when it comes to Closing the Gap, in what universe is the date of Australia Day \u2013 a contested date already that is not exactly gripping the nation\u2019s every thought \u2013 anyone\u2019s priority? Resources minister defends Middle Arm after Steggall asks about \u2018record profits\u2019 for gas company The independent MP Zali Steggall asks Madeleine King: Your government has backflipped and blocked an inquiry into Middle Arm in Darwin despite $1.5bn of taxpayers\u2019 money allocated to this project, extensive self-interested lobbying and seemingly no independent business case or assessment of risks and benefits to the Australian people. FOIs show the key purpose is as a gas export terminal. Why is the public funding key infrastructure for a private gas company to make record profits from exports? King: I think the members trying to impute there is a subsidy for fossil fuels on the Middle Arm \u2013 that is not the case. We have made that very clear. That is not [happening] \u2026 We will continue to work with the Northern Territory government on the development of the sustainable develop and project there in the Northern Territory on Middle Arm. It is very important for the Northern Territory to diversify its economy. It does have challenges and this government, the Albanese level government, will continue to support and work with the Northern Territory government. This government will have an equity stake in the [project] and will continue to work right across northern Australia, particularly in Darwin where this project is very important for future export industries. Burney fields more questions on voice\u2019s scope: \u2018Not even the PM can influence the Reserve Bank\u2019 The former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack gets the next non-government question and he asks: Professor Megan Davis, a member of the government\u2019s referendum working group, has written of the voice that \u201cthe voice will be able to speak to the Reserve Bank\u201d. Will the voice have the power to offer advice to the Reserve Bank on interest rates? Linda Burney takes this one and says: Thank you. The Reserve Bank is independent. Not even the prime minister can influence the Reserve Bank. Stay tuned for the next opposition question on this when we could find out \u2013 will the voice have the power to cancel Ray Hadley\u2019s show? Will the voice ensure the opposition leader\u2019s midwinter ball speech is funny? Will the voice be able to choose the NSW Origin team so it stops embarrassing itself? Milton Dick is a mood today: There is far too much noise in the chamber. It is the last day. Everyone. Needs. To. Take. a. Breath. The questions are under way in the house and the first one is from Peter Dutton who asks: My question is to the Prime Minister. Your government has delivered two budgets which have weakened our economy. Taxes are up, which is the and gas bills are getting out of We have higher inflation than the US, France and Germany, Australians I was off today than when you came to government the 10 months ago. When will the prime minister accept responsibility for his economy destroying policies? Hmmmkay. You know what the prime minister says here. My gift to you in this last sitting day for six or so weeks is to move on. (continued from previous post) Shoebridge told the senate: Daniel Duggan has now spent 8 months and one day in prison. He was arrested on 21 October 2022 and since then has been in solitary confinement. In the last few weeks he has seen the sky only a handful of times but has otherwise been locked up completely alone. There are grave concerns for Dan\u2019s wellbeing, concerns that I share. His case raises the question: can Australian citizens really be locked up indefinitely at the request of a foreign power? There are some big red flags around Dan\u2019s prosecution by the US: the timing of the indictment by IS authorities in 2017 was exactly when the US started talking about China as a strategic challenge. It\u2019s clear to many that this is a politicised extradition and prosecution with the dual aims of making an example of China and placating our Aukus allies. Did Asio conspire to lure Dan back to Australia for the underhanded purpose of the US extradition? How can he be extradited for something that isn\u2019t an offence in Australia and therefore fails the dual criminality test? But at the heart of this matter is Dan, a husband, father and Australian citizen. I recognise now in the gallery the presence of Dan\u2019s wife Saffrine Nydegger and his advocate Warwick Ponder. They\u2019re fighting for Dan to be released on bail to be with his family including his six wonderful children. They\u2019re fighting for the Australian government to step up for this Australian citizen. And I am with them, as are all my Greens colleagues. Greens senator David Shoebridge has spoken in support of incarcerated Australian Daniel Duggan, who has been held in prison for more than eight months on an extradition request from the US. Duggan, 54, a former US marine pilot who is now a naturalised Australian, was arrested last October at the request of the US which is seeking his extradition on charges of arms trafficking and money laundering, arising from his alleged training of Chinese fighter pilots more than a decade ago. The allegations have not been tested in court. Duggan, who has no criminal history anywhere in the world, has been refused bail, and has faced extreme isolation in prison, having been classified as a high-risk prisoner. He denies the charges and is fighting his extradition from prison, a process that could take months, even years, to resolve. (continued in next post) Peter Dutton then adds his words: We send our best thoughts, wishes and prayers to those flying in our country\u2019s name, on behalf of Australians alongside their brothers and sisters in Canada at the moment. Australia is renowned around the world for those men and women who wear the uniform in the Defence Force but there are those paramedics, those firefighters and police officers who are quite often deployed internationally to hot spots in our region across the world because of the reputation that they are earned over a long period of time, the training that is done conjointly, the shared values we have with a country like Canada, coming before in our hour of need. \u2026.When Canada is in need of help we stand up and provide the help to her as Canada has also on many occasions to us. We say to the families of those Australian firefighters who are deployed at the moment, that this will be a period of [unrest] for you and for those colleagues left behind there will worry about the safety of those officers fighting this fires in Canada. We wish them all the success and God speed and made a return safely and quickly and no doubt will provide support to the Canadians to save lives in their quest there. The last question time until the spring sitting session is now under way (there will be no more parliament until 31 July) Anthony Albanese starts it with a statement by indulgence on the Canadian bushfires \u2013 Australia has sent firefighters to Canada to help fight the wildfires tearing through the country and we are about to send some more. Albanese: There are currently 422 active fires burning across Canada with 199 of those considered to be out of control. Over 3.3 million hectares of land has burned and tens of thousands of people have been displaced. We unfortunately in this chamber are familiar with these scenarios. They are coming more often and with more intensity around the world. I am so proud as all Australians should be but there are currently on the ground 364 Australian firefighters and incident management specialist and that additional cruise of 124 are preparing to leave in coming days. These Australians come from every single state as well as from the ACT. And they are making an enormous difference on the ground. I said to the Australians, please keep yourself safe. We know in 2019-20, not only did so many Australians lose their life, of course American firefighters who are here to assist lost their life as well. So to, our firefighters, we say we are proud of you. We return the favour that now we do with our friends. Canada of course abided 100 firefighters here during that summer of 2019- 2020. We spoke this morning with the Canadian Prime Minister about, as I have had these discussions with President Biden as well, about increasingly with climate change leading to more intense and frequent events, we are going to have to have these exchanges more and more, most tragically. We are saying to our firefighters, thank you, will you do our nation proud. Universities welcome Startup Year bill The Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN) has welcomed today\u2019s passage of the Startup year bill which included amendments to improve protections for intellectual property and course quality. The bill creates a new form of higher education loan assistance called SY-HELP, available to final year undergraduates, post-graduates and recent graduates to enrol in accelerator program courses. It will also allow New Zealand citizens to access HELP (a nation where the first year of university is free). ATN executive director Luke Sheehy said the amendments would bolster budding entrepreneurs to operate small businesses. Expertise and input from across the political divide, along with great ideas from higher ed and industry, have brought us to this moment. Today\u2019s passage of the bill is also due to the contribution of all senators in this process, including the shadow education minister and members of the crossbench. The passing of this legislation is a shot in the arm for young entrepreneurs across Australia. Startup year will provide students access to our world-class facilities and our sector-leading mentors, the opportunity to learn from academic experts and test their exciting, new business ideas.\u201d If you didn\u2019t vote in the 2022 Victorian election a fine is coming your way The Victorian electoral commission will be sending out about 230,000 fines to people who didn\u2019t vote in the 2022 state election and didn\u2019t have a valid excuse. The fine is $92 and people who receive one will have 35 days to respond. Acting Electoral Commissioner Dana Fleming is urging people who receive an infringement notice to take it seriously. The most important thing is that you respond to the notice before the deadline \u2013 otherwise you could be issued a penalty reminder notice, which carries the original penalty plus an additional administration fee. Public schools on a \u2018road to nowhere\u2019, Greens say Greens spokesperson for schools Senator Penny Allman-Payne has responded to news we reported earlier that revealed 1,152 private schools will be funded $3.2 billion over their public funding entitlement over the next six years. With the exception of the ACT, every public school system in the country is underfunded, while some states and territories have committed to funding 100% of public schools to their cchooling resource standard, outlined in the Gonski report, without fixed timelines in place. Allman-Payne said the revelations, released under freedom of information, were \u201cpretty revolting\u201d. While most public schools don\u2019t have enough teachers and resources to give kids a decent education, the private sector is swimming in cash. The promise of Gonski was that all students would receive the funding they need to have the education they deserve. But the gap in total funding between private and public schools is wider now than it was when David Gonski handed down his report. That\u2019s created one of the most unequal and segregated school systems in the OECD. All we hear from state and federal Labor governments is that public schools are \u2018on a pathway\u2019 to full funding. That pathway is looking more and more like a road to nowhere.\u201d Education minister Jason Clare, a beneficiary of and vocal supporter of public education, has outlined equity will be a focus of the next ational school reform agreement, delayed until 2024. Dutton says the voice is a \u2018con job\u2019 Peter Dutton has spoken to Sydney radio 2GB. Once they got through the midwinter ball and SOO chat, Dutton moved on to the voice. I have never seen anything like it in the last couple of decades I\u2019ve been involved in politics*. The con job that\u2019s going on here is unbelievable. I can\u2019t believe that a Minister like Linda Burney, in a very important portfolio, can just stand in the chamber and essentially either not have a clue what she\u2019s talking about**, or misrepresent what the Voice is about. They\u2019re setting up a situation here where the voice will be able to have an influence into every area of public administration. They can advise the tax commissioner on tax policy, they can advise the treasurer on any element of the budget, they can advise the defence minister, or the chief of the defence force, about defence acquisitions or where a defence base should be located. It goes into every area of government responsibility. It\u2019ll grind the whole system of government to a halt and the impact will be felt by everyday Australians, whether they live in an Indigenous community, out in the suburbs, or in a regional town or in a capital city. Honestly, it\u2019s the biggest con job going and the prime minister wants Australians to vote for this on \u2018the vibe\u2019, but the unintended consequences here are very, very significant and I just think Australians are smarter than what he believes them to be and I just think we need to have an honest conversation. They\u2019re deliberately keeping details from the Australian public because of how severe this thing is, and I think it\u2019s why people are continuing to really turn off when they hear about the voice. *I mean Scott Morrison swore himself into five ministries while he was prime minister so\u2026.. **Burney has answered question after question after ridiculous question the opposition have asked on this. No statute of limitations on corruption Back in Victoria for a moment and Michael O\u2019Brien says there is no statue of limitations on corruption so delay shouldn\u2019t be used as a reason not to charge those invoked in the scandal: If a murder happened a long time ago, you don\u2019t say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll just let that one go.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about serious crimes that contributed to the undermining of Victoria\u2019s legal system ... This is about as serious as it gets. And there\u2019s no statute of limitations on corruption. There\u2019s no statute of limitations on destroying the integrity of our legal system. And I\u2019m very surprised that the DPP would put that up as a reason to not prosecute those responsible. AFP responds to PwC assertions The Australian Federal Police has responded to David Shoebridge\u2019s claims (made under parliamentary privilege) that commissioner Reece Kershaw and PwC partner Mick Fuller discussed the \u201cthe best possible way that PwC can make money off the AFP\u201d at a meeting in 2022. An AFP spokesperson said: The AFP categorically rejects the assertions made. The AFP will be appearing before Senates Estimates on August 4.\u201d Antipoverty advocates accuse Labor of running a scare campaign on cashless welfare Antipoverty Centre spokesperson Jay Coonan said the legislation \u201centrenches income control in the welfare system\u201d and included powers for the social services minister to expand it anywhere in the country \u2013 which is what Labor opposed when they were in opposition. Not only have the Labor party opened the door for the mass expansion of cashless welfare today, they have crushed the hopes of 22,000 people in the Northern Territory currently subjected to compulsory income control, the vast majority of whom are First Nations. Communities in the NT have fought cashless welfare since it was first proposed during the 2007 intervention. The Labor party should be ashamed to have run a scare campaign on cashless welfare, promising to abolish it, only to betray welfare recipients who hoped an Albanese government would mean this damaging, paternalistic program was a thing of the past. The group said that claims the card would be voluntary was \u201cdoublespeak\u201d because the card could be requested by people without consent from the individuals it would apply to. The antipoverty centre has already received reports from current cashless welfare sites that people affected by these programs are being excluded from consultation. By carving out an exemption so that people on the age pension cannot be subjected to income control, it\u2019s clear they are willing to have it imposed on any working age welfare recipient in the country. Regardless of their intentions, a future government will be able to do this without any need for legislation. \u2018Sneaky and insidious bill\u2019: Greens say The legislation to expand compulsory income management has passed the senate, 27 to 12. Greens senator Janet Rice said it was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of people who voted for the Labor government: Labor have now gone further than the Liberals did in expanding the racist and entirely ineffective compulsory income management system. We don\u2019t need another conservative party in this country. In the same week as securing the voice referendum, Labor teamed up with the Coalition and PHON to pass a racist bill that overwhelmingly targets First Nations people, against the wishes of key First Nations organisations, including the Central land council and the Aboriginal peak organisations Northern Territory, that gave evidence to the bill\u2019s inquiry. The hypocrisy is astounding. Despite Labor\u2019s false claims, the bill is not a simple matter of improving technology. This is a sneaky and insidious bill that significantly expands the minister\u2019s power to roll out compulsory income management in new areas, and effectively allows the new cashless debit card to apply nationally, despite Labor\u2019s campaign against CDC in opposition. The only differences between Labor\u2019s SmartCard and the ashless debit card are its name and colour. More on Lawyer X scandal Shadow attorney-general, Michael O\u2019Brien, says the director of public prosecutions comments today fail to explain why no charges have been laid over the Lawyer X scandal: It\u2019s wholly unsatisfactory, that after a royal commission, after a special investigation and after tens of millions of taxpayers dollars, not a single person has been charged over the greatest legal scandal in Victoria\u2019s history, the Lawyer X scandal \u2026 It is clearly in the public interest that people are held accountable to such a great failure \u2026 It is not good enough to sweep it under the carpet. He says the Lawyer X special investigator - Geoffrey Nettle - has decades of experience and should have the power to bring charges himself: Geoffrey Nettle has had decades of experience as a trial judge, as an appellate judge in the Victorian Supreme Court and Victorian Court of Appeal and the High Court of Australia. The director of public prosecutions, with respect to her, does not have that level of experience that Justice Nettle has. His view, that was put before the parliament, is that the evidence is there to justify charges. It\u2019s been reported today, in fact that one of the people are concerned - Nicola Gibbo - was ready to plead guilty to charges and yet despite that, the DPP says no. She might have her reasons but the public interest demands that these issues be tested in open court. And that\u2019s why I again call for the government to amend the laws to give Justice Nettle and his office the power to directly bring charges against those people who have conspired to pervert the course of justice. Critical minerals should be included in Aukus pillar two: report Australian production of critical minerals should become a focus of the Aukus agreement to reduce reliance on China, an Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) report argues. In Aukus and critical minerals: Hedging Beijing\u2019s pervasive, clever and coordinated statecraft, former Labor defence minister Kim Beazley and strategic advisor Ben Halton argue for a consistent definition of critical minerals, and for them to be part of Aukus pillar two \u2013 which is the sharing of technology aside from that needed for the nuclear-powered submarines. With China supplying more critical minerals than the rest of the world combined, the authors argue, states are left vulnerable: This is where Australia comes in. Australia has the essential minerals, which are more readily exploitable because they\u2019re located in less densely populated or ecologically sensitive areas. Australia also has the right expertise, including universities offering the appropriate advanced geoscience degrees, as well as advanced infrastructure, world-class resources technology and deep industry connections with Asia and Africa, which are also vital global sources of critical minerals. Critical minerals needed by the Aukus nations include rare earths, lithium, magnesium and tungsten. The ASPI report points out that almost every weapon being used in Ukraine, every fighter jet, navy vessel and nuclear weapon depends on rare earths. Fadden candidates to be revealed The Fadden byelection candidates will officially be declared by the AEC tomorrow and straight after the ballot draw will be done. That\u2019s happening around midday Friday. Winding path on income management Back to income management and the slow grind of amendments, most of which are being voted down by the government, including Greens senator Janet Rice\u2019s attempts to add a sunset clause to the bill. The government said a sunset clause (a date the bill lapses) would add further complications and so they would not be supporting it. We continue to wind our way to the final vote. Wait! No! Twist. Greens senator David Shoebridge has told the Greens press conference the vote was actually to guillotine the debate and force the vote, meaning the Greens voted against a procedural thing to keep an option of a tougher bill open. Greens and Labor scuttle bill to limit gambling ads Yesterday, it seemed as if the Greens may have supported the Coalition and passed the Coalition\u2019s limit gambling ads, as Josh Butler reported. But ultimately, the Greens voted against the Coalition\u2019s bill (as did Labor) and David Coleman is not particularly thrilled. This is a deeply disappointing result which flies in the face of overwhelming community sentiment for action now. Despite all the huffing and puffing particularly by government MPs about gambling advertising, today they chose to block a new law that would take strong action. Greens senators also voted against the Coalition Bill, despite voicing similar concerns during the debate about the impact of gambling advertising on families and young people. If the Greens had supported the Bill it would have passed the Senate easily. Labor and Coalition vote in favour of income management legislation The legislation which will expand compulsory income management is being voted on in the senate. Labor and the Coalition are voting in favour of it, which cuts down on the negotiating power the Greens and crossbench usually have in the senate. Bill to cut down on worker exploitation The migration amendment bill has been introduced in the house, which aims to cut down on the exploitation of workers. Tony Burke and Andrew Giles said the bill would: Make it a criminal offence to coerce someone into breaching their visa condition; Introduce prohibition notices to stop employers from further hiring people on temporary visas where they have exploited migrants; Increase penalties and new compliance tools to deter exploitation; Repeal section 235 of the Migration act which actively undermines people reporting exploitative behaviour. More to come on senate rental inquiry The Greens are holding a press conference to discuss that rental inquiry. We\u2019ll bring you that very soon. Senate inquiry into rental crisis The Greens have established a senate inquiry into the rental crisis. The inquiry will explore: the experience of renters and people seeking rental housing; rising rents and rental affordability; actions that can be taken by governments to reduce rents or limit rent rises; improvements to renters\u2019 rights, including rent stabilisation, length of leases and no grounds evictions; factors impacting supply and demand of affordable rentals; international experience of policies that effectively support renters; the impact of government programs on the rental sector; any other related matter. Lawyer X scandal back in Victorian parliament We\u2019re tuning into question time in Victoria\u2019s upper house after explosive criticism from the Lawyer X special investigator of the director of public prosecutions for failing to lay charges over the scandal. Kerri Judd, in a response tabled in parliament today, says she had no confidence a key figure would give evidence against police. Deputy opposition leader in the upper house Matthew Bach has asked the attorney general, Jaclyn Symes: Why does the government not accept Justice Nettle\u2019s view regarding the DPP\u2019s refusal to lay charges over the Lawyer X scandal? Symes replies: It\u2019s not for me to determine these matters, it\u2019s for independent bodies and I support both of them. Up-dos from last night in both chambers today Debate on the expansion of income management has been parked for a bit and the senate has moved on to other business for a little bit. There are still a few up-dos from last night being sported in both chambers today. I get it. Washing all that out takes time. Much easier to just go to sleep in it and hope for the best in the morning. Lidia Thorpe drills down on cashless debit card promises Not included in this was a commitment to also abolish the Basics Card, which remains mandatory in some areas, including the NT. The Greens senator, David Shoebridge, in the Senate on Wednesday targeted PwC over documents that give an insight into the process by which it won a contract with the Australian federal police. This follows revelations in Senate estimates that AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw had a text exchange with his friend PwC partner and former NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller about the referral of the PwC leak to the AFP. Two text exchanges were produced: 14 July, 2022 (while PwC was bidding for work). Mick Fuller: \u201cThink I\u2019m booked in to see you with Pwc in a few weeks. Will call you before if okay.\u201d To which commissioner Kershaw replied: \u201cGood plan\u201d 24 May 2023, the day of Treasury\u2019s referral to the AFP. Fuller: \u201cJust saw news re referral. Will give you some space so not too complicate your life.\u201d To which the commissioner replied: \u201cOk thx mate\u201d Shoebridge was concerned by documents detailing meetings between the pair when PwC was bidding for work. He told the Senate: We now know from the documents that have been produced that Commissioner Kershaw actually attended a meeting on 28 July 2022 with his mate Mick Fuller. It was described as: An introductory meeting to outline the identified need to undertake a comprehensive independent review of the AFP\u2019s delivery of policing services to the ACT government\u2014 And, get this\u2014 This informed PwC\u2019s consideration of whether they had the capability to undertake the work and would submit a formal quote. The meeting, of course, was not minuted. So two mates get together\u2014one the AFP Commissioner, the other a former New South Wales Police Commissioner, now a senior partner in government relations at PwC\u2014in an unminuted meeting to work out how PwC can get money from the AFP, to cobble together the best possible way that PwC can make money off the AFP. There was no tender and no public discussion. It was just two mates, some other partners from PwC and the chief operating officer from the AFP coming together to work out how they can give PwC more money and also, at significant public expense, to try and reshape the future of the Australian Federal Police operations in the ACT. The reference in the documents to submitting a quote do not necessarily support the allegation that the pair aimed to \u201cwork out how PwC can get money from the AFP\u201d, which was made under parliamentary privilege. Guardian Australia does not suggest any wrongdoing in the way the contract was awarded. Human rights lawyers get green light to appear in whistleblower case Human rights lawyers will intervene in the case of Richard Boyle, the tax office whistleblower, as he appeals a landmark decision to deny him whistleblower protections. The South Australian district court ruled that Boyle was not protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act for actions he took to collect evidence in preparation for blowing the whistle on his employer\u2019s aggressive pursuit of debts. The case was considered the first major test of the nation\u2019s whistleblowing laws and experts say it revealed deficiencies in the protections. Boyle has appealed to the state\u2019s supreme court. His appeal is due to be heard in August. The Human rights law centre announced on Thursday that it had been granted leave to involve itself in the appeal as amicus curiae, or a friend of the court. That allows it to make submissions on the critical issues in the appeal. HRLC senior lawyer Kieran Pender said: Richard Boyle\u2019s appeal will determine the strength of protections for all Australian whistleblowers, given similar provisions exist in almost all Australian whistleblower protection laws. It is a vitally important test case with significant implications for truth and transparency in this country. Labor has committed to reforming the PID act to better protect whistleblowers. More than 1,000 private schools will be overfunded by $3.2bn as inequity in the education system deepens, documents released through freedom of information reveal. Internal Department of Education figures prepared for witnesses appearing before Senate estimates state over the next six years, 40% of non-government schools will be funded in excess of their entitlement under the schooling resource standard (SRS), to an estimated value of $3.2bn. The SRS estimates how much total public funding a school needs to meet its students\u2019 educational needs, agreed to by all Australian governments in 2012. It\u2019s out of reach for the vast majority of government schools, with the documents estimating only those in the ACT, SA and WA will be at or above 75% of the SRS by 2023. Correna Haythorpe, the president of the Australian Education Union, said Australia couldn\u2019t continue to accept \u201cdeep inequity\u201d in school funding. Private schools are overfunded by billions, and public schools are underfunded by billions. It is public schools that enrol the vast majority of Australian students, and it is public schools that enrol disproportionately higher rates of students with additional needs, students that experience disadvantage and students with disability. If the commonwealth and state and territory governments can afford to overfund private schools, they can afford to fully fund public schools. Your Nairu questions answered Peter Hannam has taken at look at what exactly the Nairu is and why it matters: \u2018People power and the Swifties of Australia can unite\u2019 Being the last sitting day before the winter break, MPs are doing all they can to remind people that they are just like them! Just normal humans, doing normal things! They\u2019re Swifties too! They have the friendship bracelets! They\u2019re in their Midnights era! The latest was Patrick Gorman, who after running through a list of legislation the government passed said: There\u2019s one thing that this parliament cannot address. And that is the gross injustice of the Taylor Swift Eras world tour schedule, which has dismissed both the great state of Western Australia and the great state of Queensland, represented by so many in this Parliament including my friend on the other side, Andrew Wallace, the member for Fisher. What this parliament can\u2019t do is determine where international touring artists go. But people power can change that. People power and the Swifties of Australia can unite. And they can say it is a Cruel Summer when there is Sweet Nothing for Perth in the Taylor Swift Eras world tour. And if I think about Western Australia \u2013 we have proudly hosted the grand final \u2013 we can host a concert of this magnitude. The Gabba has also hosted a grand final; it can host a concert of this magnitude. And it will give both an emotional and economic boost to the great states of Western Australia and Queensland. I\u2019ve got to say though, for the Queenslanders, I mean they can just drive down the road to Sydney. I\u2019ve done that drive myself and I know that the Swifties of, particularly, south-east Queensland, would just do that for their absolute love of Taylor Swift\u2019s fantastic music. But for those of us in Western Australia: three-day drive. We need the Eras World Tour to come to Perth. Bill to expand BasicsCard has backing to pass Senate The second reading debate of the income management reform bill 2023 is under way in the Senate. Labor made a pretty big deal about scrapping the mandatory aspects of the cashless debit card, but they didn\u2019t ever do anything about the BasicsCard \u2013 another form of income management, which is compulsory, and run by the same company as the cashless debit card \u2013 Indue. This bill expands the compulsory use of income management. The Coalition is in favour, so the bill will pass. The Greens and the crossbench will attempt to amend the bill, so we will see what happens there. For a bit more on what the eCommissioner is planning to do about hate on Twitter, you can head here: Paterson says not enough is publicly known about the hack James Paterson expanded on the government responsibility there: Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got two problems. One is the home affairs minister said in February that she would appoint, within a month, a cyber security coordinator to handle the fallout of attacks like this. Well, it\u2019s nearly five months later, and we still don\u2019t have that person on the ground responding to this. Secondly, we\u2019ve received virtually no information out of the government at all about what has happened in this attack, about what government agencies have been affected, about what information has been lost, and that\u2019s been exacerbated by HWL Ebsworth taking out an injunction in the court which has prevented, potentially, the victims of this from finding out what of their private information has already been uploaded to the dark web. Paterson says HBL Ebsworth hack is a potential national security risk Liberal senator and security hawk James Paterson spoke to Sky News about that hack Josh mentioned, this morning: There\u2019s a number of things that are concerning about the HWL Ebsworth attack, some of which are similar to previous attacks and some which are different. The similarity is it again appears that individual Australians\u2019 private information might have been exposed on the web by a ransomware gang, probably operating out of Russia. That\u2019s what\u2019s similar to previous attacks. What\u2019s different is that HWL Ebsworth is a law firm that acts for a number of government clients. It represents a number of government agencies, including in the national security sphere, and it appears that it held on their behalf, because it represented them in legal proceedings, sensitive information of highly, sometimes classified, nature. And the risk that that has spilled out into the public is a very serious thing indeed and needs very swift action by the government. Law firm hacked by Russian-linked group reviewed digital ID legislation The law firm at the centre of a major cyber security hack was hired by the government to conduct a privacy assessment for the digital ID legislation last year. HWL Ebsworth has had around 4TB of information stolen by Russian-linked hacker group ALPHV with over 1TB posted on the dark web. The firm last year conducted a review of the former government\u2019s proposed digital ID legislation to assess the privacy risks associated with the legislation. The Digital Transformation Agency, which had carriage for the legislation, is now in discussions with the firm over whether any of its own data has been compromised in the hack, Guardian Australia has confirmed. A spokesperson said: The DTA is engaging with HWL Ebsworth on whether any data about the PIA held by them has been affected. The Government continues to actively engage HWL Ebsworth as it investigates the extent of the breach including impacts on Commonwealth information. Guardian Australia reported this week that the agency in charge of the National Disability Insurance Scheme was also currently discussing with the firm whether any client information had been compromised as HWL Ebsworth represents the agency in coverage appeal cases. Speaker responds to Tink on parliamentary behaviour Independent MP Kylea Tink wrote to the speaker Milton Dick this week, asking him to remind MPs of the higher standard they are supposed to set in terms of behaviour, and discourse. Tink wrote to Dick asking he \u201cprovide the Chamber with a full and complete update on the progress of cultural change, including reiterating the endorsement of the \u2018behaviour standards and codes\u2019\u201d: Standards and codes are only as effective as the people who uphold them. The behaviour and revelations of the past week show we have a long way to go to change the culture of this place. But we must \u2026 We all have a responsibility to display exemplary individual leadership and a role to play to set the standard for an inclusive, respectful, and professional workplace here in Parliament House and across Australia. I call on you to recommit the Parliament to positive change. Dick responded in a letter of his own: As you would appreciate, the events of last week are of keen interest to me, adding as they do to my ongoing concerns about unacceptable behaviour in our workplace. It is my intention to make a statement in the Chamber before the House rises on Thursday, to remind Members of our shared responsibility in relation to developing a safe and respectful culture in Parliament House. I will refer to some general aspects such as the language and volume of debate, as well as courtesy and respectful behaviours during proceedings. I will incorporate appropriate references to the resolution of the House endorsing the draft behaviour standards and code for Parliamentarians and reinforce the guidance the standards and code provide to Members. Dick said he would ask members to consider on what contribution they are making \u201cto achieving this\u201d and to \u201cgenuinely reflect on their own behaviour\u201d. By that he means the heckles during debate and question time, but it seems as though Tink was asking more broadly, given what some of the \u201cdebates\u201d have covered lately. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be silent just because it suits Clive Palmer\u2019 Last night Labor MP Josh Wilson spoke out against investor state dispute clauses in trade deals, vowing not to be silenced by Clive Palmer on the issue. Palmer\u2019s Zeph Investments is suing Australia for $296bn, with two more potential claims in the works. In the adjournment debate Wilson told the House of Representatives he had received a letter from Palmer asking him to withdraw comments and apologise, and calling on him to refrain from further comment. Wilson said: Now whatever you think about Clive Palmer, most people wouldn\u2019t think of him as a bloke who generally favours keeping quiet or thinks people should keep their thoughts to themselves, especially when they\u2019re in a role as a parliamentary representative, as Clive Palmer himself once was. In any case, I can assure you I\u2019m not going to be silent just because it suits Clive Palmer. Mr Palmer is free to pursue his interests and I\u2019m free to express my views \u2013 indeed, I have a duty as a member of this place, as we all do, to speak up in the national interest. In the past I\u2019ve done that when Mr Palmer sought to undermine WA\u2019s nation-leading, and I dare say world-leading, management of the Covid-19 pandemic, and in WA we remember that Mr Palmer did that with the shameful assistance of the Morrison government. And I\u2019ll continue to speak up in relation to the risks posed by the unnecessary and dangerous ISDS system. Let me be clear: I have not made the argument about the ISDS system, which I have done on many occasions, by reflecting on any particular tribunal, its members or process. My criticism is of the system as a whole. There\u2019s no reason for large multinational companies to be able to sue governments through an outside tribunal system when they can either make use of a country\u2019s judicial system in the normal way or make use of government-to-government dispute resolution processes that all trade and investment treaties include. As long as Australia is party to agreements that contain ISDS clauses, and as long as we don\u2019t act to exclude their operation, we will be at risk of the kind of enormously harmful outcome that was involved in the Philip Morris action all those years ago and is at risk from the action being taken by Mr Palmer\u2019s Singapore-based company now. Oversight of intelligence agencies in spotlight Attorney general Mark Dreyfus is on a bit of a legislative tear at the moment, with another bill to be introduced today which would put all of the intelligence and security agencies will be under the same statutory and parliamentary oversight. He explains: The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 will strengthen and expand the oversight responsibilities of the Inspector\u2011General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) and Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) to include the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the intelligence functions of the Australian Federal Police, AUSTRAC and the Department of Home Affairs. This legislation ensures all security and intelligence agencies are now subject to the same statutory and parliamentary oversight, commensurate with their powers and responsibilities. The Bill also: strengthens the relationship between the IGIS, the PJCIS and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor; enables the PJCIS to review, on its own motion, proposed reforms to counter-terrorism and national security legislation, and all such expiring legislation; and requires the Inspector-General and the Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence to provide annual briefings to the PJCIS. Last sitting before break begins The last parliament sitting before the winter break is under way. The Senate has today to get through what the government wants it to get through. If it doesn\u2019t, then Tony Burke has warned the parliament will sit on Friday too (the house would have to sit in case the Senate makes any changes to bills it has to sign off on) which NO. BODY. WANTS. It\u2019s mostly a warning to the Coalition to stop fillibustering (adding more people to the speaking lists to drag out debates) and get to the business of voting, but Burke doesn\u2019t control the Senate, or the opposition, so who knows what will happen. \u2018Queensland hearts are full\u2019 Treasurer Jim Chalmers used the start of his doorstop (a very quick press conference) to pay homage to the Queensland origin team: Every day is a great day to be a Queenslander but especially today. I wanted to congratulate Billy and Daly and everyone associated with another absolutely stunning victory for the good guys in the State of Origin and I wanted to wish the Queensland women all the very best for their big clash tonight as well. This is another really quite remarkable outcome for Queensland. Every day is a great day to be a Queenslander but especially today. Queensland hearts are full and we thank the guys for delivering another outstanding victory. I am very sorry to New South Wales supporters, but the thing you have to understand is that Queensland just has more heart. It\u2019s a fact. You can\u2019t train for that \u2013 it\u2019s as Queensland as a Milton mango, or the mighty brown snake (shibboleths used to identify true Queenslanders). Geelong job losses at Ford Victoria\u2019s minister for jobs and manufacturing, Ben Carroll, is with the premier and is being asked about job losses at Ford in Geelong: It\u2019s always difficult when anyone loses a job. It can be one or it could be 10 or it could be 50. It\u2019s always felt very hard by those families in those communities. As the prime minister himself recently said, you know, the defence industry is very much becoming the new auto industry \u2026 These jobs are well trained, they\u2019re well executed. We have a great partnership with the auto sector. We have a great partnership with our manufacturing partners, the unions, so I have every confidence that we\u2019ll find solutions for these workers and be able to do tailor-made solutions to support them going forward. Voice will save money, PM says There was some serious conversation there (a lot of the FM radio strategy has been about reaching people about the voice) and, asked how much the voice would cost, Anthony Albanese said: I think this will save money. And the reason why it\u2019ll save money is that everyone knows that there\u2019s been billions of dollars expended on education, health and housing. Governments of all persuasions have, with the best of intentions, expended a lot of taxpayers\u2019 money trying to close that gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. But the truth is that in so many areas, it\u2019s not going forward, it\u2019s going backwards. It\u2019s not going forwards to the targets, for example, on year 12 completions. Now, if the money is spent better and more efficiently and in a way that gives people that ownership over the way that programs are run by being listened to. The voice won\u2019t run any programs itself, it won\u2019t be a funding body. It will simply be an advisory body, just like we have a range of other advisory bodies. But this will be a special one, because it will be listening to people who, of course, are the original owners of the land that we share with them. \u2018I really got into Tay Tay,\u2019 Albanese says Anthony Albanese told WSFM\u2019s Amanda and Jonesy that he is in his Taylor Swift era: I really got into Tay Tay through Folklore and Evermore when she released those two albums, and I find, I think her songwriting is extraordinary, so I really like her. Will he be at her upcoming concerts now she has announced Australian dates? I don\u2019t know about that but we\u2019ll see how we go. I\u2019ve got three Origin games, two of them parliament [was] sitting, and one of them I\u2019ll be in Lithuania. So, I\u2019m not always in control of my diary. Host: Well, it\u2019s a good thing you missed Origin last night. Other host: Yes, we all wanted to be in Lithuania last night. First host: I would have liked to have been in Lithuania. Albanese: Indeed. We might just focus on the Ashes, I think. AAP reports on another blow for Geelong\u2019s workforce. Ford had been a huge part of the Geelong story for almost 100 years before manufacturing was shut down in 2016. Now the company has announced it will be cutting 22% of its remaining Australian workforce, as AAP reports. Some 400 Australian jobs are set to be lost at Ford. Most of the roles to be cut are in product development and design, with a small number in other areas. About 1,800 people work for the company in Australia, meaning more than one in five are set to lose their jobs. The company said it has started a consultation process with unions and employees about a \u201cseparation program\u201d. Australian operations will continue to be the headquarters for development of the Ranger and Everest models. A spokesperson said: The changes are part of Ford\u2019s global drive to improve efficiency and transform its operations to meet future needs. The Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union has been contacted for comment. The government has spent $125m on the Lawyer X royal commission \u2013 is Daniel Andrews disappointed no one is going to face criminal consequences? He says it not up to MPs to make that call: No one in the Victorian parliament determines who gets charged and with what \u2026 A comprehensive brief of evidence that should be the only factor. We do not want a situation where members of parliament, let alone leaders of governments are out there deciding who gets charged and what they get charged with ... That\u2019s not our system. That\u2019s not my intention, and I\u2019ll make no commentary that would undermine the independence of those independent prosecutorial decision makers. They have a very difficult job. The royal commission made recommendations and we\u2019ve been 100% faithful to all of those. But it is not uncommon for people with the best legal minds to have different views on whether someone should be charged or not. And that relates to the likelihood of getting a conviction. \u2018We have to accept the DPP advice and I will\u2019 A reporter asks Jaclyn Symes why she won\u2019t heed the advice of the special investigator \u2013 who used to be a pre-eminent high court judge: The DPP, she is equally eminent, respected and expert in her field. It is not my role to adjudicate between two very qualified people that have very different roles. I thank the OSI for his work. I hank his office investigators, great team. They have gone to great lengths to ensure that these matters have been looked at thoroughly. They\u2019ve done that. The DPP has determined that if these went to the court, they would fail. A jury would not convict. We have to accept the DPP advice and I will. The premier, Daniel Andrews, is now being asked about the special investigator\u2019s report at a separate press conference in Parkville. He says: I\u2019m not entering into a debate with him. I\u2019m not going to enter into a debate with the OPP. It is not appropriate. There will always be differences of opinion on these matters. It\u2019s not the first time that the director of the Office of Public Prosecutions has made a decision \u2026 to prosecute or not, that not everybody has necessarily agreed with. It is in fact more often than not the case that people have different views about whether someone should face charges or not. That\u2019s not new. That\u2019s not new at all. Debates not are not unhealthy. And I\u2019m in no way critical of either the those who have to make those difficult judgments. Symes hits back at O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u2018outrageous claim\u2019 on Lawyer X scandal Back to the Victorian attorney general press conference: Jaclyn Symes also hit back at the opposition shadow attorney general, Michael O\u2019Brien, who said yesterday Labor would be pleased the DPP had \u201cswept under the mat\u201d the Lawyer X scandal with no charges: That\u2019s outrageous claim and to attack an independent body within the justice system is unbecoming of somebody who purports to want to be the attorney general. I have greatest respect for both independent bodies. It is not appropriate for an investigative body to then decide whether they are the prosecutor as well. And I draw that conclusion based on experiences from other jurisdictions as well. Symes also rejected O\u2019Brien\u2019s call for the office of the special investigator to be given powers to prosecute cases themselves: Setting up the office of the special investigator was a direct implementation of recommendation 94 of the royal commission report which said you should set up an investigator to tie up loose ends, look at any matters and see if there\u2019s any cases to prosecute. Let\u2019s make it clear \u2013 if it was a clear case the royal commission would have made those recommendations, but there was a lot of things to consider. It was complex, it wasn\u2019t clear cut. It wasn\u2019t foreseen, it wasn\u2019t predicted that there would be charges. So this isn\u2019t something that is being undone. This was work that was asked to be completed to see if there was any grounds for criminal or disciplinary action. These are many years ago and there\u2019s been a lot of work, many documents, a lot of investigative effort has gone into this to come up with a brief. With all of that time and effort into an investigation you can see why it\u2019s inappropriate for that body to determine whether it should proceed to prosecution \u2026 Ibac themselves, despite having legislative opportunity to prosecute, have an internal policy where they will not prosecute directly any indictable offences. That will go to the DPP for that independent view. They recognise that there is a conflict between a body who is doing the investigative work, determining whether that should go all the way to the courts. I\u2019ve spent the morning ferreting out what I can about the speeches last night. From all accounts, yes, the Midwinter Ball was a pretty tame affair. We\u2019ve already reported that Anthony Albanese had a few pokes at the Greens in his speech, but he also apparently had a few digs at the Coalition\u2019s questioning of the voice, opening up with, \u201cWelcome to the last Midwinter Ball before it gets cancelled by the voice\u201d \u2013 because the opposition have been asking increasingly ridiculous questions over what the voice would or would not have control over. Once the laughter had died down, Albanese suggested that it \u201cwasn\u2019t the silliest thing\u201d which had been put forward this week. He apparently also paid \u201ctribute\u201d to the influence of Newscorp over the last year, including over the federal election, the Victorian state election and the Aston byelection (all of which Labor won, the joke being that Newscorp was campaigning for Labor to lose). Albanese said he enjoyed watching the Sky News federal election coverage (you know, the whole \u201cthe resistance starts now\u201d stuff). There were a couple of inward Labor jokes, including that the first nuclear submarine delivered under the Aukus pact would be named the HMAS Paul Keating (because Keating has been such a vocal critic of Aukus). Andrew Probyn, the ABC\u2019s political editor who was made redundant last week in a shock announcement got a few shoutouts. ABC\u2019s big news bosses were in the room so there would have been a few uncomfortable moments there. Albanese alluded to it having been a big week for the national broadcaster, who apparently had no money for a political editor, no money for an arts team, but enough to have a weekly segment on what Toto (Albanese\u2019s dog) is getting up to (I don\u2019t know what that was about \u2013 but I\u2019m told there was some segment on the ABC about the little white ball of fluff)*. In the serious bits, Albanese made a general statement that he had been thinking of the women in the building given the discourse over the last couple of weeks and reiterated that the parliament needed to be a safe workplace. He also praised the partners of MPs and gave Peter Dutton and his wife Kirilly a shoutout for an upcoming big anniversary. Dutton\u2019s speech was \u201cnot particularly\u201d funny, according to the sources I have spoken to, but there is only one James Jeffrey (Albanese\u2019s speechwriter) so it is, as many Coalition MPs like to complain at times \u201can unfair advantage\u201d. Dutton made a few jokes about Kevin Rudd going to the US and said he had used ChatGPT to write some of his speech, asking it to reconcile reality with some of Labor\u2019s claims. There were no impressions of US presidents by Australian prime ministers, so no diplomatic incidents this year. The speeches were held late, so the dancing didn\u2019t start until about 10pm and the ball ended pretty soon after. *I have just been informed that Albanese named the segment \u201cin full\u201d as \u201cAlbo\u2019s fucking dog\u201d \u2013 a regular segment on ABC\u2019s comedy current affairs program The Weekly. Victoria\u2019s attorney general addresses Lawyer X scandal Victoria\u2019s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, is speaking to reporters outsides parliament after a special investigator yesterday threatened to quit because the director of public prosecutions refused to charge several key figures involved in the Lawyer X scandal. She says the report \u201cspeaks for itself\u201d, with a response from the DPP to be tabled today: Effectively, he has presented cases to the DPP. [It\u2019s] her job as the independent officer to determine prosecutions in these matters. But those cases have no reasonable prospect in the courts and that is the response that she\u2019s provided to the officers especially investigated for the ones that have already been presented. They\u2019ve been having ongoing conversations about the ones that the office have been working on, the report makes clear that it is his view that his work has come to a conclusion based on the conversations with the DPP. The DPP will be making her response available today, it will be tabled in the parliament. Asked if she was disappointed no one will face criminal charges over the biggest scandal in Victorian legal history, Symes responds: No. I think that the justice system has learned a lot from this outrageous conduct. It doesn\u2019t mean that I can create a consequence at the end of that. There is a justice system there. There is court process. There are applicable rules and laws that apply to perpetrators, to people who have done wrong things, to victims. Not everybody gets the outcome that perhaps they want but the work has been completed. Important work. And the DPP has assessed that these cases would not make it through to successful prosecution in the courts. She\u2019s an expert in her field. Here is how the MPs looked at the ball, with a special shout out to Mike Bowers for staying back late last night to capture the arrivals: States stand firm against rent freezes For the time being at least, the states are in lockstep against rent freezes: The argument is that in places where rent freezes have been announced, rents have gone up drastically to get ahead of the freeze, therefore doing nothing to actually freeze rents. Now there are ways to combat this \u2013 caps, rent controls or the federal government giving states money to ease the increase. But so far there is no appetite to explore any potential answers, with the focus on increasing supply. Chalmers flags boost to rent assistance Pressed again on rents, Jim Chalmers says: We\u2019ve got the biggest increase in rent assistance for three decades. We\u2019ve got new tax breaks for build to rent properties. We\u2019ve got a whole suite of policies including tomorrow \u2013 I\u2019ll be convening the state and territory treasurers to advance our housing accord and to make sure we\u2019re all working together to get the funding right to get the zoning and planning right to work with industry to build more homes for more people who desperately need them. We would prefer the support of the Greens in order to do that, but in the absence of that support, with all of their political posturing and product differentiation, we will do what we can without them. \u2018Greens more interested in fighting with Labor than for Australians who need somewhere to live\u2019 Will the government do anything for renters to get the Greens\u2019 support for the housing Australia future fund? At this stage, from what Jim Chalmers is saying, it is unlikely: I think we\u2019ve already been incredibly accommodating and respectful \u2026 We put it to the Wenate and the Greens voted against it. And it doesn\u2019t look though the government is backing off from its criticism of the Greens either. Chalmers: We know why they did it. And that\u2019s because they\u2019re more interested in fighting with Labor than fighting for Australians who need somewhere to live. That\u2019s what it boils down to. The governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Phil Lowe, will find out his future next month, Jim Chalmers says. Lowe\u2019s contract ends in September. There is an option to renew it for three years but that is up to the government. Chalmers says he will announce that decision in July. Chalmers says it is a \u201cbig job and a big call\u201d and the government is working through it in the usual methodical way. By the way, July could mean when parliament returns \u2013 which is 31 July. Unemployment uptick expected Asked about the RBA\u2019s deputy governor Michele Bullock\u2019s speech in Newcastle this week where she spoke about a rise in unemployment to help lower inflation (on the current labour force numbers, a return to a Nairu of 4.5% would be mean about 140,000 people losing their jobs) Jim Chalmers says: I think what the deputy governor was referring to was simply reflecting the fact that both the Reserve Bank\u2019s forecasts and the Treasury forecasts in the budget expect an uptick in unemployment at the same time as we expect a moderation in inflation. I think her comments really just reflected those forecasts. And we\u2019ve been pretty upfront, I think, as a government, in saying that we expect the economy to slow because of higher interest rates and because of tricky global conditions, and that will have implications for the labor market as well. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the really quite remarkable performance of our country when it comes to the labor market record employment, record participation, unemployment with a three in front of it, given everything that\u2019s coming at us from around the world, that those are remarkable outcomes. And it means we enter this period of global economic uncertainty from a position of relative strength and that\u2019s a good thing. (The Nairu is the non-accelerating inflation of unemployment \u2013 the theoretical rate of unemployment where wages growth and inflation are under control. It has been around 4.5%.) PwC breach of trust \u2018deeply disappointing\u2019, Chalmers says Treasurer Jim Chalmers is addressing the Senate interim report into the PwC matter on ABC radio RN Breakfast: It is a deeply disappointing breach of trust, completely unacceptable, because what\u2019s happened here is we\u2019ve seen the consultation process trashed and we need to get to the bottom of it. That\u2019s what this interim report from the committee is all about \u2026 We do want to see more information and more transparency it needs to be consistent with and not get in the way of some of the other processes under way, including the AFP referral from the Treasury at the same time as we get on with all the other work that we\u2019re doing cleaning up the tax practitioners board that work that Katy Gallagher is doing when it comes to procurement, all of these things are important ways to ensure we get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened here but also, we make sure it never happens again. Albanese takes swipes at the Greens The Midwinter Ball was held overnight. It seems to have been a fairly staid affair but I am still ferreting out info. I can tell you that Anthony Albanese used his speech to the ball to take another swipe at the Greens over the housing Australia future fund. His jokes included that he \u201conly had one request for the DJ, play \u2018Give Me Shelter\u2019, but the Greens cancelled it\u201d and that the Greens had \u201ctwo demands when we came to office, more staff for themselves and less housing\u201d. The speeches from the leaders are usually comedic in tone and give them a chance to poke fun at themselves, each other, their rivals and the gallery at large. Last year, for instance, Peter Dutton made a joke about Scott Morrison\u2019s five ministries. PwC\u2019s response \u2018grudging and slow\u2019, Greens senator says Greens senator Barbara Pocock has spoken to ABC radio AM about a Senate committee report into PwC. Paul Karp looked into that report for you: Consulting firm PwC engaged in a \u201ccalculated\u201d breach of trust by using confidential information to help its clients avoid tax and engaged in a \u201cdeliberate cover-up\u201d over many years, a Senate committee has found. PwC should be \u201copen and honest\u201d by promptly publishing the names and details of its partners and staff involved, the finance and public administration committee has recommended. In a unanimous report, tabled on Wednesday, the committee also recommended that PwC cooperate with investigations by the Australian federal police and Tax Practitioner Board, which deregistered its former head of international tax, Peter Collins. Pocock said she would keep the heat on and wants to see the firm banned from any new government contracts until she sees \u201creal action\u201d taken by PwC to address the issue: I am waiting for action from PwC so that I can have some confidence that we\u2019re not going to see further stalling or further opaque behaviour. And you know, PwC have yet to front a media conference \u2013 their response has been grudging and slow and I would love to see real responsibility and transparency, but I think we\u2019re still waiting. The eSafety commissioner says Australia does have levers it can pull. Julie Inman Grant: Well, we have extra-territorial reach. So, you know, if they want to continue serving in Australia, they do have to abide by our laws. One of the first things that Elon Musk said, when he made this general amnesty, was that he would promote freedom of speech but not something that broke the law. Well, if you\u2019re breaking the law \u2013 and this is what we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of \u2013 then you do need to comply if you want to continue to serve. I was just on a call with regulators from around the globe last evening, and more countries around the world are creating online harms regulators like the eSafety commissioner, including the European Commission. And they will have very potent powers. We will be working with other governments to make sure that we\u2019re shining a spotlight on these companies and getting them to improve their standards and doing the right thing. Taking on Twitter\u2019s \u2018spewers of hate\u2019 The eSafety commissioner has issued a legal notice to Twitter, asking it what it is doing to prevent hate on its platform. (Given that Elon Musk announced yesterday that calling someone \u201ccis\u201d is now a hate crime on the platform, and will lead to accounts being banned \u2013 while Twitter has allowed anti-trans abuse to flourish \u2013 I think we know the answer to that.) Julie Inman-Grant says the reinstatement of the 60,000 accounts which were permanently banned under the previous regime have contributed to the problems on the platform: I think it\u2019s safe to say that these are the worst of the worst accounts. So, 75 of these accounts have more than a million followers. So, they have an outsized impact on the toxicity of the platform. So, again, as you said, it\u2019s very, very hard to be permanently banned from Twitter. You have to be the most egregious, repetitive spewers of hate to contravene the Twitter rules multiple times and be banned. Two of them, we know, have already been re-banned, but what we want to know is: who are these accounts? Are they given special dispensation? Are they able to tweet without immunity, particularly if they\u2019re paying for a Twitter blue subscription? A lot of the changes to the algorithms have made people feel like you see more toxicity, much worse, much more coarse discourse, but without lifting the hood and using these transparency powers we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And this is where we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of things. Twitter an \u2018absolute bin fire\u2019, eSafety commissioner confirms The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman-Grant has confirmed it\u2019s not just you \u2013 Twitter has become an absolute sh*t show since Elon Musk took over. Inman-Grant uses slightly more professional words, but only just. She told ABC News Breakfast: Well, a third of all reports into our office of online hate are coming from Twitter. It\u2019s been a huge surge since October 2022, when Elon Musk took over. Of course, there have been a confluence of factors that have added to this. Twitter has always been fiery in terms of discourse, but it\u2019s turned into an absolute bin fire. Anthony Albanese is kicking off the day with another FM radio station, where we assume he will agree to allow the hosts to run the country for a day, given his habit of granting FM hosts their every wish. This morning is with Jonesy and Amanda on WSFM. Happy winter solstice! A very big thank you to Martin for getting us all started this morning \u2013 you have Amy Remeikis to take you through these daylight hours, with Josh Butler and Paul Karp in Canberra. In Lithuania, this would be a day to eat and celebrate the coming return of the sun. But alas, I am in Canberra, where the shortest day of the year is celebrated with the last day of parliament (hopefully \u2013 Tony Burke has warned that if the Senate doesn\u2019t get through its work the parliament will sit on a Friday and I will lead the riot if that happens). It is at least a five-coffee day. Ready? \u2018Voice from the bush\u2019 calls for yes vote The Northern Territory Aboriginal land councils are asking the people of Australia to stand with them and vote yes in the upcoming referendum on an Indigenous voice, AAP reports. And they are entrusting prime minister Anthony Albanese with helping them spread the message. The chairs of the four land councils have travelled to Canberra to meet with Albanese on Thursday to hand him the 2023 Barunga declaration. Northern Land Council chair Samuel Bush-Blanasi said the declaration comes directly from Aboriginal people of the NT: It is the voice from the bush calling on all Australians to recognise us, support us, and help us make the changes so urgently needed for a better future, together. The declaration calls \u201cfor the recognition of our peoples in our still young constitution by enshrining our voice to the parliament and executive government, never to be rendered silent with the stroke of a pen again\u201d. Members of the Northern, Central, Tiwi and Anindilyakwa land councils signed the declaration at the Barunga festival in early June. Yes dress steals show at Midwinter Ball Labor senator Jana Stewart stole the show at the Midwinter Ball in Canberra with a Indigenous voice-themed dress printed with the words from the Uluru statement from the heart and also emblazoned with the \u201cyes\u201d. It was made by Indigenous label Clothing the Gaps. There were also honourable mentions for the teal MPs, although only one appeared to be wearing their team\u2019s colour. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon played it straight in black. As did Peter Dutton, although his wife Kirilly went for a midnight blue number. Check out all the styles in Mike Bowers\u2019 photo gallery: Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be be running through a couple of the best overnight news lines before Amy Remeikis takes charge. A big influx of migrants in the next year will keep the recovery in house prices bubbling along into next year, despite the headwinds of higher interest rates and tighter household budgets, according to the Domain group. It says Sydney, which led the downturn last year, will lead the rebound with a rise of between 6% and 9% in the next 12 months, lifting the city\u2019s median price to a record of just over $1.6m. Perth and Adelaide will see new records as well with Melbourne and Brisbane just short. It will also keep pressure on rents as the Greens felt pushback from Labor states over their hope for rent freezes. We\u2019ve got the latest in our series of reports about people pushing back against the gas industry in the Top End. Today Lisa Cox reports from the Tiwi Islands where locals are hoping that a federal court ruling forcing Santos to consult with them about its huge Barossa offshore gas project will draw a line in the sand in their battle with expansion and \u201cwhite fella rule\u201d. The World Airline awards announced at the Paris Air Show have confirmed what many Australians already knew \u2013 Qantas isn\u2019t as good as it used to be. The national carrier was ranked 17th in the league table of airlines compiled by Skytrax, a fall of 12 places from last year after 12 months beset by lost baggage, delays and cancellations. A Qantas spokesperson said: This survey started nine months ago when it was clear our service wasn\u2019t back to our best."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f67", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/22/bank-of-england-interest-rates-inflation-mortgage-timebomb-andrew-bailey-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank of England poised to raise interest rates for 13th time despite mortgage timebomb \u2013 business live", "lead": "Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, with Bank of England interest rate decision due at noon", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 08:36:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222026", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/636df3f4f0faf14f8e0a9f159a51fed812f967f0/0_246_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Today\u2019s newspapers do not make pleasant reading for the Bank of England, as it attracts heavy criticism for failing to keep inflation at its 2% target. Ex-business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, of \u201cburying his head in the sand\u201d. He told the Sun: \u201cHaving been too slow at the start, they now risk an overreaction that risks damaging economic consequences. \u201cBut it\u2019s extraordinary arrogance for the Bank to blame everything but its own monetary policy.\u201d The Sun have also dubbed Bailey the \u201cPlank of England\u201d, and mocked up a wooden effigy of the governor; they say homeowners will pay a crippling price for his failure to control inflation. The Daily Mail reports that senior Tories and economists turned on the Bank of England last night, as it prepared to heap more misery on homeowners today with another rate rise. Andrea Leadsom, a former Conservative Treasury minister, accused the Bank of doing \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to rein in surging prices. Leadsom argues that the Bank blundered by continuing to print money through its quantitative easing scheme even as the Covid pandemic was ending, adding: \u201cInterest rate rises began too late and were too small.\u201d The Bank\u2019s tightening cycle began in December 2021, when it nudged rates up to 0.25% from just 0.1%. It then moved in \u201cbaby steps\u201d of quarter-point rate increases, until August 2022 when it raised by half a per cent \u2013 the largest single increase since 1995. This chart from May shows the pace of the tightening programme: The Daily Telegraph reports that the former Bank policymaker Adam Posen predicted interest rates would have to rise to 6.5% or higher to tame soaring prices, which would be likely to tip the economy into recession. Posen said \u201cpolicy errors\u201d and Britain\u2019s shrinking workforce \u2013 which he partly blamed on Brexit \u2013 had left Bank officials \u201cwishfully talking about inflation declines\u201d. He added: \u201cThe UK policy regime has lost some credibility.\u201d Oof. Norway\u2019s central bank has just hiked its key interest rate by half a percentage point, more than forecast. It\u2019s another sign that inflationary pressures are worrying policymakers beyond Britain. That lifts the Norwegian policy rate from 3.25% to 3.75%, still below the UK\u2019s cost of borrowing (4.5%, until noon anyway). Norges Bank also says another hike is likely in August. Governor Ida Wolden Bache says: \u201cIf we do not raise the policy rate, prices and wages could continue to rise rapidly and inflation become entrenched. It may then become more costly to bring inflation down again.\u201d We have our first interest rate increase of the day, in Zurich! The Swiss National Bank has raised its key interest rate to 1.75%, up from 1.5%. It took the move despite inflation slowing to 2.2% in May. The SMB says today\u2019s hike is meant to counter inflationary pressure, and warns that further rate rises can\u2019t be ruled out in future. It warns that economic growth was modest in the advanced economies in the first quarter of 2023, while inflation is still over central bank targets in many countries (Cough, particularly the UK \u2026). The SNB adds: Core inflation in particular is still stubbornly elevated. Against this background, numerous central banks have tightened their monetary policy further, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the previous quarters. The growth outlook for the global economy in the coming quarters remains subdued. At the same time, inflation is likely to remain elevated worldwide for the time being. Over the medium term, however, it should return to more moderate levels, not least thanks to the more restrictive monetary policy and due to the economic slowdown. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, says she is \u201cincredibly concerned about inflation\u201d, as she presents Labour\u2019s plan to help those in mortgage distress (see our story here). Reeves says the UK\u2019s average inflation rate of 8.7% doesn\u2019t show the full picture. Poorer households, who spend a greater proportion of their income on food, energy and mortgages, are facing even higher price rises [food inflation was 18.3% a year in May] Reeves tells Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: There are some people who are particularly hard hit by what\u2019s happening. Q: So what should the Bank of England do today? Should they \u2018hold their nerve\u2019 and do whatever it takes to get inflation out of the system? Reeves, who worked at the Bank for many years, won\u2019t give a view. She says it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d for someone who wants to be chancellor to comment on the decisions of an independent central bank. Q: Former chancellors, such as Norman Lamont, have argued that a recession may be needed to squeeze out inflation. Would Labour live with a recession to fight inflation? Reeves criticises this attitude, pointing out that recessions have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on families, pensioners and businesses. She says the government must provide support for those who are suffering most \u2013 funded through a proper windfall tax on energy companies. Q: But what would your short-term plan to get inflation down be? Reeves reiterates her priority would be to help people who are struggling with higher prices. Freezing, or reducing, energy bills would have a direct impact on inflation, she says, adding: The point is, however you use that money from the windfall tax, you could use it to shield people from those high prices. She then explains that a Labour government would \u201cinstruct\u201d banks to offer support to struggling mortgage-payers, including interest-only mortgages, extending mortgage terms, halting repossessions for six months, and protecting people\u2019s credit ratings if they come forward for help. Rishi Sunak is expected to declare today that he feels a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to hit the target of halving inflation this year. An advanced text released by his office shows that Sunak will tell an event today: \u201cI feel a deep moral responsibility to make sure the money you earn holds its value. \u201cThat\u2019s why our number one priority is to halve inflation this year and get back to the target of 2%. And I\u2019m completely confident that if we hold our nerve, we can do so.\u201d The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has hit out at suggestions that the UK should intentionally enter a recession to dampen inflation. Speaking to Sky News, he said the government remained committed to cutting inflation, but that triggering a recession was not the answer. Cleverly said: \u201cWhat we need to do is we need to grow the economy. \u201cHigh interest rates don\u2019t help with that. This idea that we should consciously be going into recession I don\u2019t think is one that anyone in government would be comfortable subscribing to at all.\u201d Cleverly also insists that Rishi Sunak remains \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to halving inflation this year. He told LBC: \u201cThe prime minister is absolutely committed to halving inflation this year and we\u2019re also making sure that we support those people who are struggling to pay the bills, and we\u2019re also putting pressure on the lending industry, the banking industry, to make sure they do the right thing by their customers and help anyone that is struggling or is at risk of default. \u201cSo, we\u2019re dealing with the here and now, but we\u2019re also dealing with the future.\u201d To hit that target, inflation must drop to 5% by December, down from 8.7% last month. It didn\u2019t look particulary challenging at the start of the year, when Sunak made the pledge, but persistently high inflation makes it more stretching. The Bank of England may judge that raising interest rate by a quarter of one per cent is the \u201cless risky path\u201d, rather than a larger half-point hike, says Michael Siviter, senior portfolio manager at Invesco Fixed Income. Siviter says an increase in interest rates today is \u201calmost certain\u201d \u2013 with the debate being whether policymakers will raise rates by 25bps or choose to accelerate the tightening pace by hiking 50bps. Siviter says Despite higher than expected inflation data this week we still believe the majority of MPC members will favour a 25bps hike, with only one or two members voting for a 50bps move, mostly likely Catherine Mann and/or Jonathan Haskel\u2026. Policymakers are mindful that there is considerable policy tightening in the pipeline already as fixed-rate mortgages struck in 2020 and 2021 refix to higher rates. The next three months will see a particularly large number of mortgages resetting. The City is split over how high the Bank of England may raise interest rates, by the \u201ccursed ratio\u201d of 52:48. The money markets are indicating that a chunky half-point increase in interest rates, from 4.5% to 5%, is a 52% probability. A smaller, quarter-point rise, to 4.75% is a 48% chance, according to implied probabilities based on the value of interest rate swap derivatives. 52:48, of course, was the split in June 2016 when the public voted to leave the EU. This ratio reappeared in September 2019 when MPs voted to take control of House of Commons business to block a no-deal Brexit. It has also appeared in other polls \u2026 At 8.7% in May, the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate is much higher than the eurozone (6.1%) and the US (4%). Q: Why does the UK have a worse inflation problem than other countries? Ex-Bank of England policymaker Sir Charlie Bean explains that the UK labour market is tighter than in continental Europe \u2013 partly because half a million workers left the UK during the pandemic. This means the UK still has historically low unemployment, and high vacancies, which adds to wage increases. Leaving the EU is another factor, Bean tells the Today programme: In addition, Brexit has made it harder for firms to suck in extra labour they need at short notice from abroad. The supply of labour is less elastic \u2013 that also helps to strengthen the hand of labour. Increased trade friction with Europe means product markets are less competitive, Bean adds. Sir Charlie Bean, a former deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank of England, believes he would vote for a large, half-point increase in interest rates today if he were on the monetary policy committee. Bean told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that: If I was on the committee, I would probably vote for a 50-basis point. I\u2019m sure on the committee \u2026 there will be quite a lot of discussion about whether to go for a quarter or a half. Bean suggests that at the Bank\u2019s last meeting at the start of May, policymakers may have thought they could have paused their rate increases for a while. However, the news since that meeting has been \u201cunambiguously bad on the inflation front\u201d. Inflation was higher than expected in April and May, at 8.7%, while the latest jobs report shows pay growth was much high than expected this spring. Bean explains: You put all of that together, and it\u2019s a pretty clear signal that it needs further rate increases. Good morning. Britain\u2019s mortgage time bomb is ticking louder today, with interest rates likely to be raised for the 13th time in a row at noon. After Wednesday\u2019s inflation shock, the Bank of England is expected to raise borrowing costs again as it tries to cool the cost of living crisis. Bank rate is forecast to rise by at least a quarter of one percent, from 4.5% to 4.75%, but some in the City of London believe the BoE could unleash a half-point hike, to 5% \u2013 a level last seen in April 2008. The Bank hopes that tightening monetary policy will squeeze rising price pressures out of the system. Yesterday, we learned that inflation failed to fall as hoped in May, with the annual CPI rate stuck at 8.7% \u2013 well over the UK\u2019s 2% target. Most alarmingly, core inflation (stripping out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco) rose in May. The Bank of England is already facing heavy criticism for its failure to keep inflation close to its 2% target, including from some MPs, after leaving rates at record lows after the pandemic until December 2021. Mike Riddell, head of Macro Unconstrained at Allianz Global Investors, argues that the Bank has \u201clittle choice\u201d other than to continue hiking rates. Riddell says: Whilst headline inflation is flat vs last month, core inflation has accelerated even further. This leaves the Bank of England (BoE) with little choice other than to continue hiking rates, to weaken demand It seems very unlikely to that the BoE would deliberately run monetary policy too loose If problems on the supply side do not improve, then the BoE will be forced to further reduce demand to get wage growth lower. If it doesn\u2019t, then the BoE may as well not have an inflation target Raising interest rates will hurt borrowers, at a time when mortgage holders are already facing sharp increases in costs if they need a new deal. The Resolution Foundation has calculated that, due to the rising interest rates, people looking to remortgage their homes will pay an average \u00a32,900 a year more from 2024. More than 1 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Yesterday, JP Morgan economist Karen Ward, who advises the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, warned that the Bank has to \u201ccreate a recession\u201d if it is to control inflation. Labour are warning that \u201cpeople are being hit hard by a Tory mortgage penalty\u201d. They are proposing a five-point plan to cushion the hit from soaring mortgages and halt repossessions. Under Labour\u2019s plans, banks would be required to allow lenders to switch to interest-only repayments, extend their mortgage repayment period, reverse these measures at any point, and would have to wait at least six months before seeking to repossess a property, and make sure none of this had an impact on borrowers\u2019 credit ratings.

Damage caused by Russian shelling in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that Moscow was considering a request from the United States to visit journalist Evan Gershkovich who is being held on spying charges he denies, the Interfax news agency reported. A hearing in Gershkovich\u2019s case is due later on Thursday. Gershkovich, a US citizen, was arrested in March on espionage charges after Russia\u2019s FSB security service accused him of collecting military secrets in the city of Ekaterinburg. Gershkovich and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, strongly deny the charges. He was initially remanded in custody until 29 May, but a court last month extended his detention until 30 August. The US says he has been wrongfully detained and has called for his immediate release. The US House of Representatives voted unanimously on Tuesday for a resolution calling on Russia to release him, Reuters reported. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Friday, the Interfax news agency reported. Grossi is likely to hold talks about the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The daily intelligence update from the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence today focuses on the Russian creation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged crimes committed by the Ukrainian government against juveniles in the Donbas since 2014. \u201cThe Duma is almost certainly responding to the international condemnation of Russia\u2019s deportation of children from occupied Ukraine since its full-scale invasion,\u201d the MoD says. \u201cThe move is highly likely both a form of \u2018lawfare\u2019 and contributes to Russian information operations, weaponising legislation by attempting to muddy the narrative around its own egregious actions. \u201cMessaging around children\u2019s rights is likely an important communications theme for the Kremlin because alleged child deportations formed the basis of the International Criminal Court\u2019s arrest warrant against President Putin issued in March 2023.\u201d There have been concerns that the Storm Shadow missiles could be used to strike targets deep inside Russia\u2019s internationally recognised borders and after the UK announcement last month the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was taking a \u201crather negative\u201d view of the UK\u2019s move. \u201cThis will require an adequate response from our military, who \u2026 will make appropriate decisions,\u201d he said. Just this week, Russia threatened to strike Kyiv\u2019s \u201cdecision-making centres\u201d if western-supplied missiles were used against Crimea. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said on Tuesday that the potential use of Himars and Storm Shadow missiles against targets in Crimea would mark the west\u2019s \u201cfull involvement in the conflict and would entail immediate strikes upon decision-making centres in Ukrainian territory\u201d. Those are seen to include the Ukrainian presidential administration and intelligence headquarters. Vladimir Saldo, the Russia-appointed governor of occupied Kherson, suggested the bridge was targeted by Storm Shadow missiles. These are long-range cruise missiles which Britain confirmed it had provided to Ukraine last month. They have a range of \u201cin excess of 250km\u201d, according to its manufacturer, the European arms group MBDA, significantly further than the high-precision US Himars rocket launchers which have been used heavily by Ukraine. The shorter-range missiles have become less effective as Russia moves its troop and supply reserves further from the frontlines and the Storm Shadow missiles should allow Ukraine to strike at targets previously out of reach. We\u2019ll bring you more information about the bridge attack in Kherson/Crimea as soon as we have it, but in the meantime some background. Ukraine is determined to retake the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. One of the key objectives of its recently launched counteroffensive is to cut off Russia\u2019s so-called land bridge to Crimea and isolate Russian troops there. Last year Ukraine blew up the Kerch bridge, which links Crimea directly to mainland Russia. Reports suggest the bridge struck this time was the Chonhar bridge, which crosses the strait between Crimea and occupied Kherson. Two people have died after an explosion and subsequent fire at a 16-storey building in the Dnipro district of the capital Kyiv, mayor Vitaliy Klitschko has said on the Telegram messaging app. Another two people were in hospital and another two were treated at the scene, he said. Experts were investigating the cause of the explosion, he said. The Kyiv Independent reported that the cause was a powerful gas explosion. The ISW analysis adds that \u201cthe observation that current Ukrainian operations may have objectives that are not simply territorial is an important one\u201d. Ukrainian forces may be conducting several offensive operations across the entire theater in order to gradually attrit Russian forces and set conditions for a future main effort. Losses are inevitable on both sides, but careful operational planning on the Ukrainian side likely seeks to mitigate and balance this reality with the equally important observation that the degradation of Russian manpower is a valuable objective. Wagner Group Yevgeny Prigozhin voiced his concern that Russian forces are suffering major manpower and equipment losses as a result of ongoing Ukrainian attacks, especially in southern Ukraine. The success of Ukrainian counteroffensives should not be judged solely on day-to-day changes in control of terrain, as the wider operational intentions of Ukrainian attacks along the entire frontline may be premised on gradually degrading, exhausting, and expending Russian capabilities in preparation for additional offensive pushes. Ukrainian forces have carried out a missile strike on a bridge connecting Ukraine\u2019s Kherson region and Crimea, Russia-appointed officials in both regions have said according to Reuters. Vladimir Saldo, the Russia-appointed Kherson governor, said the bridge was likely to have been attacked by Storm Shadow missiles that damaged the road, but traffic has been diverted to a different route. No casualties have been reported. The slower than expected pace of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is \u201cnot emblematic\u201d of its \u201cwider offensive potential\u201d, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest analysis of the conflict, hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy conceded that it was proceeding \u201cslower than desired\u201d. \u201cUkrainian forces are likely successfully setting conditions for a future main effort despite initial setbacks,\u201d the think tank argued. It said: Ukrainian officials have long signaled that the Ukrainian counteroffensive would be a series of gradual and sequential offensive actions and have more recently offered the observation that currently ongoing operations do not represent the main thrust of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive planning Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar emphasized on June 20 that it is not useful to gauge the success of military actions based \u201csolely by kilometers or the number of liberated settlements.\u201d In an interview with the BBC, Zelenskiy said he would not rush the offensive to meet western expectations. \u201cSome people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It\u2019s not. What\u2019s at stake is people\u2019s lives.\u201d He said the counteroffensive was not easy because 200,000 sq km of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces. \u201cWhatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best,\u201d he said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. The slower than expected pace of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is \u201cnot emblematic\u201d of its wider offensive potential, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict, hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky admitted that it was proceeding \u201cslower than desired\u201d. \u201cUkrainian forces are likely successfully setting conditions for a future main effort despite initial setbacks,\u201d the prominent US thinktank argued. \u201cUkrainian officials have long signaled that the Ukrainian counteroffensive would be a series of gradual and sequential offensive actions and have more recently offered the observation that currently ongoing operations do not represent the main thrust of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive planning.\u201d Zelenskiy had told the BBC that Ukraine did not wish to risk soldiers\u2019 lives to meet international expectations. \u201cSome people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It\u2019s not,\u201d he said. In other developments: The EU pledged a further \u20ac50bn in loans and grants, while the UK and the US promised $3bn and $1.3bn respectively in financial support at a conference in London focusing on the reconstruction of Ukraine. The World Bank, in conjunction with the government of Ukraine, the European Commission and the UN, has put the cost of reconstruction and recovery at $411bn (\u00a3323bn) after a year of war. Delegates at the summit, from Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the Kremlin would ultimately foot the bill. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Russia is causing Ukraine\u2019s destruction and Russia will eventually bear the cost of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction,\u201d Blinken said. All Nato allies were backing a plan to give Ukraine a fast track to Nato membership of the kind offered to Sweden and Finland earlier this year, the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said on the sidelines of the conference. Cleverly said the UK was \u201cvery, very supportive\u201d of Ukraine being able to join without the usual need for it to meet the conditions set out in a Nato membership action plan (Map). Ukraine expects to be invited to join Nato with an \u201copen date\u201d at the military alliance\u2019s summit in Vilnius next month, the Ukrainian president\u2019s chief of staff has told a webinar held by the Atlantic Council thinktank. Andriy Yermak said the failure of the alliance to deliver a \u201cstrong\u201d decision at the 11-12 July summit would demoralise Ukrainians and that Ukraine had demonstrated it was ready to join Nato with its fighting on the battlefield. The chief of mercenary group Wagner has accused the Russian defence ministry of deceiving Russians about the course of Ukraine\u2019s offensive, pointing to Kyiv\u2019s progress on the battlefield. \u201cThey are misleading the Russian people,\u201d Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio message released by his spokespeople. \u201cHuge chunks [of territory] have been handed over to the enemy.\u201d Kyiv\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has accused opponents of waging a campaign to discredit him and force him out of office after a rift with Zelenskiy. The former boxing champion had been criticised after a public outcry over the deaths of three people locked out of an air raid shelter during a Russian attack on Kyiv this month. Russia\u2019s constitutional court has rejected an attempt by rights groups to seek the repeal of a law that bans people from speaking out against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Campaigners including legal defence group OVD-Info and the banned human rights organisation Memorial had filed the case in April, saying it violated articles of Russia\u2019s constitution including on free speech and freedom of conscience. EU governments agreed to an 11th package of sanctions against Russia, aimed at stopping other countries and companies from circumventing existing measures. The new package forbids transit via Russia of an expanded list of goods and technology which might aid Russia\u2019s military or security sector. Putin announced that new Sarmat nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles would soon enter service. The missiles are designed to carry out nuclear strikes on targets thousands of miles away and can be launched from land, sea or air but their deployment has proceeded slower than planned. Russia\u2019s top investigator, Alexander Bastrykin, told state-owned Tass news that more than 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for \u201ccrimes against peace and human security, including the killing of civilians\u201d.

It has been under a US trade embargo ever since a leftwing revolution in 1959, and was for many years economically dependent on sugar exports to communist Russia; the collapse of the USSR in 1991 plunged the islanders into severe hardship. The primary protagonist, Yunior, is a talented crop scientist hired by the Fumaz government in the mid-90s to help diversify their agriculture. The novel recounts his early life as a child migrant from Ghana, his musical exploits with a popular salsa band, and his ill-fated romance with a local police officer. A second, parallel narrative concerns Emelina, the US-raised heiress of a wealthy Fumaz rice merchant, who leaves the North American \u201cSun Coast\u201d (read: Miami) for her ancestral homeland when she inherits her grandfather\u2019s estate. Yunior\u2019s life revolves around his twin passions: music and nature. When he isn\u2019t playing guitar he is tending to his allotment: \u201cRotating peppers, spring onions, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and cabbages with assorted frijoles, okra \u2026 he prided himself on a garden that was both colourful and nutritious.\u201d These two themes are often intertwined in the novel\u2019s descriptive language: \u201cThrough [music] he blended with the countryside \u2013 its fertility, its undulating earth, its cycles, the muted music of its flora flourishing and fading, its temper when hurricanes flashed by.\u201d On stage, he \u201coscillates his guitar in a pattern that mirrors the map-making loops of honey bees that have found nectar in a far flung patch of petals\u201d. Emelina\u2019s narrative, meanwhile, is mainly focused on her family\u2019s backstory. Like many children of \u00e9migr\u00e9s, she has only a loose grasp of her heritage; her mother\u2019s stories \u2013 \u201cvivid, intricate canvasses awash with longing\u201d \u2013 provide a vicarious point of access. In its early years their family business gained a competitive edge by growing its rice in sugar-infused water, which made it taste sweet; hence the novel\u2019s title, Az\u00facar, the Spanish word for sugar. Az\u00facar is Parkes\u2019s second novel and comes 14 years after his prose debut, Tail of the Blue Bird. During this long interim he has published several children\u2019s books and three poetry collections, and it\u2019s fair to say his writing style owes more to those forms than to the novel as such. There is something of the bedtime story in his sing-song narration (\u201cLet us begin with a single note of music \u2026\u201d); the abundance of metaphorical flourishes, excessive by the standards of literary prose, is par for the course in spoken word, where a heightened register can be an end in itself. Some of them are pleasing: the constancy of Yunior\u2019s parents\u2019 love \u201cmade him think of dew, how it could be counted on to settle on plants in the morning, although they spent most of their hours without it\u201d. The trouble is the sheer quantity, which lends a syrupy texture to the narrative: we have \u201cherbs punching the air in pungent ecstasy\u201d and a lover\u2019s \u201cbelly of kumquat freshness with down as fine as a kiwifruit\u2019s skin\u201d; the echo of music off walls \u201cbecame the murmurings of a forest \u2013 the rustle of rodents in undergrowth, the lingering of fragrance of fallen flowers, the cries of crickets and cicadas\u201d. Though loyal to the regime, Yunior does express occasional misgivings, prompting the minister of agriculture to recap the revolution\u2019s USP: \u201cWe sell the masses on education \u2026 they see wealth because our wealthy are educated. That\u2019s the power of illusion; that\u2019s the engine of hope.\u201d Hope, indeed, is the watchword of this neatly crafted if somewhat schmaltzy fable. It pays tender homage to the staying power of migrant communities; the gist is underlined in a number of allusions to sunflowers \u2013 a symbol of resilience and longevity since biblical times. As the narrative strands converge towards a fairly predictable romantic ending, Emelina reflects: \u201cPlants are not so different from us; they find ways to settle, to survive, to belong.\u201d This is wholesome, life-affirming stuff, if a tad too saccharine for some palates. \u2022 Az\u00facar by Nii Ayikwei Parkes is published by Peepal Tree (\u00a310.99).

Speaking to Good Morning Britain on Thursday, he said: In this case, the noises are repetitive, every half hour I believe. Three different aircraft heard them in their sensors at the same time and it went on for two days-plus. It\u2019s still going on apparently. There\u2019s not a lot in the natural world we can think of that would do that every 30-minute cycle. We have to, at this point, assume that that\u2019s the submarine and move quickly to that spot, locate it and get robots down there to verify that is where the submarine is. They\u2019ve got to go fully ready as if that was the sub because it takes a while to locate it and get it up to the surface, it takes hours. (Via PA) Eric Fusil, a submarine expert at the University of Adelaide, has shared some thoughts on what is required to ensure the seaworthiness of submersibles. He writes, in a piece for the Conversation: For the Titan, fitness for purpose could be summarised by the ability to safely launch from a mothership on the water\u2019s surface, operate autonomously down to 4,000m (the approximate depth of the Titanic shipwreck), and resurface for recovery by the mothership after a dive of a few hours \u2026 The Titan is made of a composite carbon fibre-titanium hull. It is extremely complicated to design and structurally assess these materials, compared to metallic material only. For deep-sea submersibles, minor malfunctions at the surface can pose serious risks at depth. For that reason, many of these vessels have redundancy built into their design, with back-ups in case one or multiple systems fail. According to Fusil, in practical terms that means having: a reserve of oxygen (such as while waiting for a rescue party) reliable main power sources and back-up systems another power source (such as hydraulic) in case of power loss \u2013 this would help, for example, to release safety leads to get positive buoyancy and rise back to the surface. Ron Allum, a deep-sea engineer and explorer who designed the Deepsea Challenger vessel James Cameron used to reach Earth\u2019s deepest-known point in 2012, told the Guardian: The Deepsea Challenger was all about redundancy. We had almost three independent systems \u2026 backed up on different power supplies. We conducted fire tests. We literally made the batteries burn. The vessel itself also underwent methodical testing prior to the expedition: We tested and tested our descent weight. We did it at pressure. We did it hundreds of times, mounted to a forklift. It became almost monotonous. If you\u2019re just joining us here is where rescue efforts stand: Vessels and specialist equipment has been sent from the US, UK, Canada and France to join the search for the Titan in a race against time. The Polar Prince - the research vessel the Titan was launched from - will remain the command centre for the search, sitting near the Titanic wreck site Officials are still holding out hope of a rescue even as the vessel nears the theoretical limit of its oxygen supply The actual oxygen supply in the vessel depends largely on a range of factors, according to experts, such as the breathing rate of those on board, their level of physical activity and whether they remain calm For more details, we have put together a summary of what we know so far as the search enters its critical phase. Rescue teams searching for the missing Titan submersible saw reason for optimism on Wednesday after they reported hearing underwater noises in the Atlantic. While stressing that the sounds were \u201cinconclusive\u201d and not confirmation the crew was still alive, the news did raise the question of what happens if the sub is located \u2013 and what equipment will be necessary to retrieve it. As the search enters its critical phase, Jonathan Yerushalmy has taken a look at the vessels and remote operated deep-sea vessels that are being deployed. A popular Mexican travel Youtuber, Alan Estrada has recalled his trip down to visit the wreck of the Titanic aboard the Titan submersible. Estrada told the BBC that everyone who joined on the trip \u201cwere fully aware of the risks we were taking\u201d. But I never felt unsafe. I was fully aware of the risks and I knew that if something happened, if there was a failure in those depths and the submersible imploded, we probably wouldn\u2019t even notice. Estrada said he first learned about the tour offers during the pandemic when he was looking for ways to push his channel \u201cto the limits\u201d. As the search for the Titan Submersible enters its fourth day, the President of the Explorers Club, Richard Garriott de Cayeux, is still holding out hope for a good outcome. In a statement on social media, Garriott de Cayeux thanked the the public for \u201call your support and hard work\u201d on the effort to find and save the Titan submersible. He said he believed the efforts so far have \u201chave importantly improved the odds of a positive outcome\u201d to the situation, although he remained critical of authorities for not acting fast enough. He said the arrival of the Magellan and the use of side-scan sonar will help improve the odds of finding the submersible. We continue to come together for our friends, their families and the ideals of The Explorers Club, and the cause of safe scientific exploration of extreme environments. There is good cause for hope, and we are making it more hopeful. I thank you! Keep searching! Dr Glenn Singleman, an extreme medicine expert who has visited the Titanic shipwreck, told the Guardian both lack of oxygen and carbon dioxide buildup are worrying concerns for the people onboard the missing Titan submersible. The oxygen being supplied inside the vessel was likely being delivered at the regular atmospheric concentration of 21% oxygen, Singleman said: Every submariner fears fire inside the cabin because if there is fire then carbon monoxide and other toxins are a huge problem very rapidly. That\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s not common to use higher concentrations of oxygen than in normal air, because by having higher concentrations inside your submersible, you make it more likely that there will be a fire. Aside from a fire, carbon monoxide should otherwise not be a problem. A drop in oxygen levels in the air can result in hypoxia, in which bodily tissues become deprived of adequate supply. Oxygen concentrations of 10% and lower can result in loss of consciousness and death. Singleman said the 96-hour oxygen supply figure would be an approximation based on an average person\u2019s oxygen consumption at an average metabolic rate. You\u2019ve got no idea how people respond to the stress of a difficult situation \u2013 some people can increase their metabolic rate with stress, some people can relax and try to sleep and decrease it. To prevent carbon dioxide buildup, submersibles are equipped with \u201cscrubbers\u201d, usually made of soda lime, which remove CO2 from the air. Singleman said: The problem is that you get to a saturation point after a while, and you\u2019ve got to change out the soda lime. CO2 content in air is about 400 parts per million. As it goes up, over 1000[ppm], most people start to get symptomatic, and over 5000, you\u2019re very symptomatic \u2013 you get hyperventilation, you get a headache, you just feel awful. The expedition that the Titan submersible and its crew were undergoing was tremendously risky, according to industry experts and former passengers. The Titan had to withstand the pressure from being almost 4,000 metres (13,100ft) below sea level \u2013 the depth at which the Titanic came to rest \u2013 and faced the threat of getting lost or losing contact with the surface. While it is too early to say what happened to the vessel, experts have raised questions over whether all appropriate safety measures were followed. Stockton Rush, the chief executive and founder of OceanGate, creator of Titan, is among those missing. Rush has decades of engineering experience and has been at the helm of expeditions to the Titanic since 2021 \u2013 this was his fifth. OceanGate said there were a number of innovative safety features onboard the Titan. The potential risks were made clear to passengers. Mike Reiss, who travelled on the Titan last year, told the BBC: You sign a waiver before you get on that mentions death three different times. They\u2019re learning as they go along \u2026 things go wrong. I\u2019ve taken three different dives with this company and you almost always [lose] communication. The Guardian understands that all standard checks and procedures were followed before the submersible set off on its voyage, but concerns over whether the vessel met industry safety standards have come to light. If you\u2019re just catching up on the situation regarding the lost Titan submersible, read Jonathan Yerulshalmy and Ashifa Kassam\u2019s report on the concerns raised over the safety of the vessel: OceanGate CEO and Founder Stockton Rush told a US television network he was aware of the risks involved with diving thousands of metres beneath the oceans surface during an interview in December 2022. Rush was speaking to CBS Sunday Morning when he said his \u201cbiggest fear\u201d was \u201cthings that will stop me from being able to get to the surface\u201d. Overhangs, fish nets, entanglement hazards. And, that\u2019s just a technique, piloting technique. It\u2019s pretty clear \u2014 if it\u2019s an overhang, don\u2019t go under it. If there is a net, don\u2019t go near it. So, you can avoid those if you are just slow and steady. The CEO also said \u201cthere\u2019s a limit\u201d to how safe it could make the operation despite introducing some procedures. I mean, if you just want to be safe, don\u2019t get out of bed. Don\u2019t get in your car. Don\u2019t do anything. At some point, you\u2019re going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question. I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules. Recovering the missing Titan submersible and bringing its crew to safety in time using the latest advanced deep-sea rescue equipment would be an extremely difficult task, an expert has said. Even if Titan is located, a successful rescue would require remote-controlled vehicles (ROVs) capable of allowing operators on the surface a clear view of the submersible\u2019s location, any obstacles that may be present and where to attach cables capable of lifting it thousands of metres through the water. If the Titan and its five-person crew did arrive at the Titanic wreck, they will be located 3,800 metres (12,500ft) below the surface on the seabed \u2013 too deep for most ROVs to reach. Only a \u201ctiny percentage of the world\u2019s submarines operate that deeply\u201d, David Marquet, a former US Navy submarine commander, told CBC. If you\u2019re just joining us and looking to catch up on the technical challenges that face rescuers attempting to reach the sub, read the full report here: Though authorities and those involved in the hunt for the Titan submersible, the challenges should not be underestimated. The area of ocean where the vessel is lost is remote and rugged \u2013 and the wreck of the Titanic lies roughly 3700m below sea level. If that is hard to conceptualise, this illustrated video captures the scale of the challenge. There have been concerns bad weather may hamper the search from the Titan submersible but it looks as if conditions are right for a positive result. Wendy Rush, who is married to Stockton Rush, Ceo of OceanGate and pilot aboard the Titan submersible, is also a descendent of a couple who lost their lives aboard the famed ship. The New York Times reports that Rush is the great-great-granddaughter of Isidor and Ida Straus, two first-class passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it went down in 1912. The couple were among the Titanic\u2019s wealthiest passengers. Isidor and his brother co-owned a Macy\u2019s department store. Survivors reported watching Isidor refuse a seat on a life raft to allow women and children to get on board. Ida chose to remain with him. The scene was recreated in the film dramatisation of the disaster. Wendy nee Hollings Weil married Stockton Rush in 1986. She is also the communications director at OceanGate and has personally visited the Titanic wreck three times. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the search for the submersible vessel Titan that went missing during a voyage to the wreck of the Titanic with five people onboard. The search for the OceanGate Expeditions tourist submersible is entering its fourth day after the vessel was reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Officials have still said they are hopeful of a rescue despite growing concerns the oxygen supply on board is becoming dangerously low. Equipment from the US, Canada, the UK and France has been brought in to help find the vessel. Experts have said the search remains a technically challenging task because of the potential for bad weather and the difficulty in locating a small vessel in a vast ocean. So far the search has concentrated around an area where sounds were detected repeating at 30-minute intervals but authorities have said they have been unable to confirm the origin of these sounds. As of Wednesday night local time remotely operated deep-sea vehicles (ROV), capable of operating down to depths of 6km, were heading to the area to join the search and the US Navy is also sending a heavy-lifting system called Fadoss. It is understood the vessel had enough oxygen on board for 96 hours, though the true extent of its supply depends on several various including whether the vessel remains powered, the activity of those on board and whether they have remained calm and are able to control their breathing. Those onboard Titan are believed to be British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58; Pakistani-born businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, with his 19-year-old son Suleman, who are both British citizens; French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77; and Stockton Rush, founder and CEO of OceanGate Expeditions.

According to data released by the Chinese travel platform Qunar, the number of visitors to temple scenic spots increased by 367% in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2022. Much of that increase can be accounted for by the opening up of tourist and cultural destinations since zero-Covid restrictions were abandoned in December. But some other religious sites are also experiencing increases in visitors compared with their pre-Covid levels. Nearly 2.5 million tourists visited Mount Emei in Sichuan, one of the four holy mountains in Chinese Buddhism, between January and May. That is over 50% more than in the same period in 2019. According to Trip.com, another travel platform, about half of the templegoers in January and February were born after 1990. Millennials and Gen Z are part of a cohort of young people facing record levels of unemployment. In May, the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 20.8%. China\u2019s difficult economic recovery from zero-Covid and slowdowns in the education, property and technology sectors have squeezed opportunities for fresh graduates, causing many to have more faith in deities than their degrees. The phrase \u201cincense-burning youth\u201d has caught fire on social media, referring to young people who have turned to spiritual offerings in an attempt to increase their prospects. \u201cBetween going forward and going to work, I choose incense,\u201d is one popular catchphrase. The slogan reflects a desire to pray for self-improvement, as well as the decision of some young people to opt out of the rat race altogether. It has been linked to neijuan, or \u201cinvolution\u201d, the term used to describe the intense pressure felt by young people in China, where putting in more effort often feels futile. Many temples have cashed in on this demand for spiritual nourishment by offering meditation courses, on-site cafes and, according to some reports, psychological counselling centres. All this has been labelled the \u201ctemple economy\u201d by some commentators. Buddhist-style trinkets are also increasingly popular. In January, Lama temple, Beijing\u2019s biggest Buddhist monastery, issued a statement clarifying that it had not authorised third-party platforms to sell Lama temple bracelets, contrary to the claims of some online vendors. Although China is officially atheist, many people turn to ancient practices in times of need. Prof Emily Baum of the University of California, Irvine, who studies modern Chinese history, said: \u201cIn China, which has a long history of ancestor worship, youths might go to a temple to leave offerings for deceased relatives in the hopes of receiving favour in the future.\u201d For Chinese worshippers, burning incense is a practical as well as spiritual act. Prof James Miller of Duke Kunshan University in Jiangsu, China, an expert on the Chinese traditional practices of Taoism, said: \u201cVisiting temples is not seen as a necessary indicator of religious belief but as a practical step that anyone can take to help with the problems that they are facing. \u201cAlthough the Chinese Communist party promotes atheism, it also promotes traditional Chinese values, which are inscribed in China\u2019s long and complex religious history.\u201d Additional research by Chi Hui Lin"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f6c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/22/abcs-international-budget-should-grow-as-china-spends-billions-on-information-war-inquiry-told", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "ABC\u2019s international budget should grow as China spends billions on information war, inquiry told", "lead": "Parliament hears media in Asia and the Pacific are being \u2018courted\u2019 by Beijing in an \u2018unprecedented campaign\u2019", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 07:37:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222131", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a9102ef60ff45c77243d15eb269f629459433615/0_166_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "China is spending billions to win the information war in the region, a committee inquiry has heard, and greater funding for the ABC would allow it to be a stronger presence in the Asia-Pacific.

It said there were a large number of Chinese state-controlled English language services, memorandums of understanding with Pacific media companies, an expanded network of Chinese correspondents, a Chinese government visits programs for Pacific journalists, as well as advertising and sponsored content in newspapers in the Pacific. \u201cJournalism academics have expressed concern about the creeping influence of China on media freedom,\u201d Aapmi said, with \u201crespected commentators seeing China winning the information war in the Pacific\u201d. The University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for Advancing Journalism echoed many of Aapmi\u2019s concerns and said successive governments had failed to recognise the importance of \u201csoft diplomacy\u201d. \u201cChallenges for Australia and the region included the rapid digitisation of media, eroding newsroom budgets, the contest of ideas between democratic nations and China, online misinformation, disinformation and extremist propaganda, and the global economic downturn,\u201d it said. \u201cSome Pacific leaders have sought to leverage the tensions between China and Australia to their political advantage. This has been most obvious in attacks on foreign and domestic media seen as evidence of China\u2019s growing influence in the region.\u201d The independent MP Zoe Daniel \u2013 a former ABC foreign correspondent \u2013 asked Gorman about the effects of \u201csubstantial cuts\u201d to the ABC\u2019s international efforts. \u201cWe still have a reputation legacy \u2026 across the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cWe\u2019re still very much regarded as a key partner in the Pacific.\u201d She said with extra funding the ABC could expand its services in Indonesia, India, the Mekong, and other regions regarded as \u201chigh priority\u201d because of the \u201cgeostrategic situation across the region\u201d. The department for foreign affairs and trade said it supported media in the region, including through the ABC\u2019s international services, and by engaging with and building local media capacity, and through the Pacific Media Assistance Scheme.

But for Eli Crossley, who alongside Alfie Lewis, Freddie Wormleighton, Jay Guru-Murphy and Will Ponds are members of the band Askew, playing at Glastonbury festival as one of the youngest bands to ever perform has also been on their to-do list. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really done any gigs or anything, but we\u2019ve been able to practise at a studio. Now the fact we\u2019re playing Glastonbury is quite crazy,\u201d Crossley says. The prospect came about when Crossley appeared on a BBC Breakfast interview in which he spoke about the genetic condition he lives with, Duchenne muscular atrophy, as well as mentioning his love of music and how his dream was to one day play at the festival. \u201cLots of people saw it and were sending messages saying \u2018Get Eli to Glastonbury\u2019 and \u2018This kid sounds pretty good you should let him play\u2019, and were tagging Emily Eavis,\u201d Crossley says. Island Records\u2019 Jon Turner was in the audience for a school musical performance in which Askew performed, due to his son being at the same school, and was also impressed with what he heard. He got in touch with someone who knew Eavis, who then decided to give Askew the chance to play at the festival. \u201cMy mum didn\u2019t tell me for a few days at first because I think that she wanted to surprise me,\u201d Crossley says. \u201cSo one day she just whipped her camera out and I started panicking. She started recording and then she said \u2018You\u2019re playing at Glastonbury\u2019. I went a bit crazy and didn\u2019t know what to say or think.\u201d When Crossley relayed the news to the rest of the band, they could hardly believe it. \u201cI told Alfie first and he just started laughing and said, \u2018No, you\u2019re joking!\u2019 The rest of the band started yelling, saying \u2018You\u2019re insane, we\u2019re not playing Glastonbury, are you mad?\u2019 So it took them a bit to realise that we are actually doing it. We\u2019ve only played in a pub in front of around 50 parents, so to play at Glastonbury is pretty cool and a big step up.\u201d Askew\u2019s performance at Glastonbury, which will be at the Rabbit Hole on Friday, is even more remarkable given Crossley\u2019s disease, which causes progressive muscle weakness. He has been using a wheelchair for the past year. \u201cIn everyday life for me there\u2019s always going to be challenges being a wheelchair user, and sometimes that is really tough,\u201d he says. But despite his condition, he doesn\u2019t want any pity. \u201cI almost use [music] as a form of therapy, but then again I don\u2019t really get too beat down about Duchenne. It\u2019s who I am, I\u2019ve got a great life and I\u2019m able to make music which I hope is not bad. People have told me it\u2019s good but I\u2019m not sure!\u201d Crossley and the rest of the band think they could possibly be the youngest band ever to perform at the festival. \u201cI hope it goes well and I hope people enjoy it because when you\u2019re nervous you feel like you might make a mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you are a performer, no matter how successful you are, people in the crowd are rooting for you and want you to do well,\u201d Crossley says. Having achieved this huge dream at such a young age, Crossley has further big ambitions in the music industry. \u201cI kind of hope that we will be able to record an album, because I think we\u2019ve got enough songs to do that. That would be the dream,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that after we\u2019ll be able to play at more gigs \u2013 and maybe at Glastonbury again.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f6e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/22/government-under-fire-from-crossbench-over-15bn-stake-in-middle-arm-industrial-precinct", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labor under fire from crossbench over $1.5bn stake in Middle Arm industrial precinct", "lead": "Zali Steggall and David Pocock take aim at government over support of development on Darwin habour which will benefit gas industry", "author": "Lisa Cox", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 07:32:20", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222168", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/59c43ecee83ad5ca78db07c2e71f7662a30a3ab7/0_354_5305_3183/500.jpg", "body": "The Albanese government has come under pressure from the crossbench over its $1.5bn stake in a \u201csustainable\u201d development precinct on Darwin harbour after documents revealed the project would benefit the gas industry. In question time on Thursday, the independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, asked the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, why his government had \u201cbackflipped\u201d and blocked a Senate inquiry into the Middle Arm industrial precinct. Steggall also asked why the public was \u201cfunding key infrastructure for a private gas company to make record profits from exports\u201d after Tamboran Resources, which plans to frack for gas in the Beetaloo basin, announced it was one of the site\u2019s anchor tenants. In a separate debate in the Senate on Wednesday night, the independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, called out \u201ca new government that continues to back the fossil fuel subsidies of the Morrison government\u201d. \u201cThe most problematic of these decisions is the $1.5bn for what they are now trying to call the Middle Arm sustainable development precinct,\u201d he said. The Middle Arm sustainable development precinct will be a major manufacturing centre for gas, petrochemicals, blue and green hydrogen and critical minerals. In addition to Tamboran, the Northern Territory government has announced it has commitments for parcels of land at the site with Fortescue Future Industries and energy company Total Eren \u2013 which will pursue green hydrogen projects \u2013 and critical minerals firms Tivan and Avenira. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Both the federal and territory governments have branded the project as a \u201csustainable\u201d precinct, but documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show the Albanese government was told the development was seen as a \u201ckey enabler\u201d for the export of gas from the Beetaloo basin between Katherine and Tennant Creek. Separate documents show several of the wharves that would be funded by the commonwealth would be used for the export of gas and petrochemicals. The government previously indicated its support for recommendations by a Senate committee examining the expansion of gas in the Beetaloo basin. One of those recommendations was for a separate inquiry into the proposed Middle Arm precinct. But it voted with the Coalition to block the inquiry when it was put to the Senate by the Greens last week. Albanese directed Steggall\u2019s questions on Thursday to the resources minister, Madeleine King, who said: \u201cI think the member was trying to impute that there is a subsidy for fossil fuels on the Middle Arm. \u201cThat is not the case, and we\u2019ve made that very clear that that is not the case and it will continue to be the case,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Northern Territory government on the development of the sustainable development project there in the Northern Territory on Middle Arm. It is very important for the Northern Territory to diversify its economy.\u201d Steggall told Guardian Australia the response was \u201cat its best greenwashing\u201d. In Wednesday\u2019s urgency motion in the Senate, Pocock said the process that led to the decision to support the project with federal money had been \u201cshrouded in secrecy, and some of what has happened is truly bizarre\u201d. The government senator Anthony Chisholm told the Senate the $1.5bn, and a further $440m that would be spent on \u201cregional logistics hubs\u201d along key transport routes in the territory, was a commitment \u201cthe government made prior to the election last year, so we very much see this as delivering on an election commitment that we made to the Australian people\u201d. He said the Middle Arm project would have significant economic benefits and it was \u201cdeeply disingenuous to ignore the facts, as some people have continued to do, and claim that this is an investment in fracking \u2013 it isn\u2019t\u201d. \u201cIt is also disappointing that those people fail to engage in the detail of the proposition that the Australian government has put to the Northern Territory government,\u201d he said. The Greens also tried to move an amendment on Thursday to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to prevent its funds being used for new coal and gas projects. The government has twice supported a similar amendment to other funds but on Thursday voted with the Coalition to block the proposal. The Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne said: \u201cLabor needs to explain why they won\u2019t similarly apply this to the NAIF. The only reason they would want this is to deliver public funding to get the Beetaloo and Middle Arm gas and petrochemical projects up and running.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f6f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/22/cash-dictates-the-ufc-wont-cut-ties-with-the-troubled-conor-mcgregor", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cash dictates the UFC won\u2019t cut ties with the troubled Conor McGregor", "lead": "The MMA star has been the focal point for a number of serious allegations.

Last week, the Irish mixed martial artist was accused of assaulting an unnamed woman at the Kaseya Center in Miami during Game 4 of the NBA finals. In a demand letter, attorney Ariel Mitchell described her client\u2019s alleged encounter with McGregor, which took place in the VIP men\u2019s bathroom. The letter also claimed that McGregor was \u201caided and abetted by the NBA and Miami Heat Kaseya security.\u201d In a statement, Miami Heat revealed the organization is \u201caware of the allegations\u201d and is \u201cconducting a full investigation.\u201d The NBA is assisting the Heat while the Miami Police revealed it is investigating a report filed Sunday. Through a lawyer, McGregor said he has not been charged with a crime and denied the accusations and vowed \u201cnot be intimidated.\u201d The incident marks the latest in a long series of accusations, litigation, and criminal conduct on McGregor\u2019s part. It is also the fourth time that McGregor has been accused of sexual assault in the last five years. In March 2019, reports emerged that McGregor was under investigation in Ireland after a woman accused him of sexual assault in a Dublin penthouse the previous December. McGregor was arrested and questioned but was released pending further investigation. In October 2019, police received another complaint against McGregor from a woman who said he had sexually assaulted her in a car outside a Dublin pub. The UFC fighter denied both claims and did not face criminal charges in either case. In September 2020, McGregor was detained and questioned by authorities on the French island of Corsica for alleged indecent exposure and sexual assault in a bar. He spent two days in custody. However, the case was later dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence. McGregor was also sued in 2021 by the woman who accused him of raping her in Dublin. The woman filed the civil suit after prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges against McGregor. Despite the shadow of another sexual assault allegation, the UFC and ESPN remain reluctant to distance themselves from their controversial cash cow. Instead, the entities have opted to continue profiting from the 34-year-old\u2019s presence by proceeding with Season 31 of The Ultimate Fighter, where McGregor is featured as a coach opposite another veteran mixed martial artist, Michael Chandler. The fourth episode of the season aired on Tuesday. \u201cThe organization is aware of the recent allegations regarding Conor McGregor and will continue to gather additional details regarding the incident,\u201d the UFC said in a statement last week. \u201cUFC will allow the legal process to play out before making any additional statements.\u201d ESPN declined to respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. For the UFC, a McGregor fight \u2013 which could take place later this year \u2013 will fatten its bottom line. The former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion has not fought in nearly two years due to a broken leg suffered during his bout against Dustin Poirier but he has headlined five of the six most profitable pay-per-view events in UFC history. And despite a lengthy layoff, McGregor remains the organization\u2019s most recognizable star, for better or worse. It is also worth noting that the UFC continues to generate record revenues. According to its parent company Endeavor\u2019s SEC filings, the organization generated $1.4bn in revenue in 2022, nearly 40% more than the $890 million it reported in 2020, which was also the last time McGregor won a professional fight. The UFC is also expected to merge with the WWE into a new sports entertainment entity called TKO Group Holdings, which is expected to be valued at more than $20bn \u2013 a significant increase from the $4bn valuation the UFC achieved when it was purchased by Endeavor in 2016. In light of the UFC\u2019s continued success and profitability, the organization may no longer be in desperate need of McGregor\u2019s services, which makes its continued links with him notable. MMA is also a sport that has long been plagued by incidents of violence against women. In 2015, HBO\u2019s Real Sports revealed that MMA fighters are arrested for domestic violence at more than double the average national rate. Since then, the sport has continued to serve up high-profile domestic assault cases. In 2021, UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones was arrested following an alleged incident involving his wife while their children were present just hours after he was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame. He was initially charged with domestic violence but the charge was dropped following a plea deal with prosecutors. Months later, former UFC champion Chuck Liddell was arrested following an alleged domestic violence incident involving his wife. No charges were filed due to a \u201clack of sufficient evidence.\u201d Most recently, UFC President Dana White was caught on camera in a physical altercation with his wife, Anne, at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Footage showed Anne slapping White at a nightclub, which White returned before attempting to strike her again as others intervened. White later apologized for his actions but did not face any professional consequences. While McGregor has not been accused of domestic violence, he has had his fair share of violent encounters away from the Octagon. In 2018, McGregor and his entourage attacked a bus carrying UFC fighters at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. McGregor shattered the vehicle\u2019s window with a hand dolly, injuring multiple fighters onboard. The former UFC champion later turned himself into the NYPD but reached a plea deal that saw his assault and felony criminal mischief charges dropped. The following year, McGregor pleaded guilty to assault after punching a pub customer who refused to drink a shot of his whiskey brand. McGregor was also accused of assaulting a woman on his yacht in Ibiza, Spain, in January 2022. McGregor denies the accusation and has not been charged. The fact that the UFC, which clearly has an image problem when it comes to violence away from the fight area, is still happy to associate itself with McGregor raises questions about its priorities. Besides, beyond his string of controversies, McGregor is no longer the fighter he once was. The Irishman has lost three of his last four bouts and has not won a fight in more than three years. The last time McGregor was able to string together consecutive victories was in 2016. The UFC\u2019s fanbase appears to have caught on, as McGregor\u2019s return to The Ultimate Fighter has not been the ratings success the organization anticipated. Nevertheless, a potential McGregor fight in the foreseeable future will still garner more attention than anything else the UFC could offer in its place. The UFC would also never risk parting ways with McGregor when countless other organizations would jump at the opportunity to sign him. Given the UFC\u2019s penchant for profit, it seems like wishful thinking to believe that the UFC would part ways with McGregor unless it absolutely had to. As long as McGregor can continue to fight, you can expect the UFC to be there to promote it."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f70", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/22/afternoon-update-titan-sub-oxygen-could-run-out-tonight-australia-issues-twitter-warning-and-abc-ratings-tank", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Afternoon Update: Titan sub oxygen could run out tonight; Australia issues Twitter warning; and ABC ratings tank", "lead": "The Titan sub could run out of oxygen tonight and Australia issues a warning to Twitter amid rise in online hate", "author": "Antoun Issa", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 07:02:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222205", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90ca7fe81c86ecbcc012c74d5899516e991d0bc1/0_35_800_480/500.jpg", "body": "Good afternoon.

He is hated on sight by Madolyn\u2019s musclebound jock son Chad (\u201cI\u2019m gay,\u201d he tells Marco, looking his high-heeled lipglossed new colleague up and down in disgust, \u201cbut I\u2019m not \u2013 gay.\u201d). Oh, I hope someone will teach him to open his mind and let go of the fear that is causing him to engage on such hostile terms with the world! Mummy\u2019s boy \u2013 and director of sales \u2013 is keen for her to sell to a global beauty brand and make them both \u201cugly rich\u201d. Madolyn is unsure because, you see, Madolyn used to be a model and built her company out of nothing because \u201cpeople told me I couldn\u2019t\u201d so, you know. Pioneer. Pride. Legacy. All that. We also have the fearful but ultimately good-hearted first assistant Venetia (Jade Payton), who spurns Chad\u2019s offer to bring down the new boy and helps him find his feet instead. There is a shy love-interest, Ben (Michael Hsu Rosen), whom we spend too long every episode watching being inarticulate around Marco, and forthright lesbian Britt (Ayesha Harris), who seems to be there only to encourage Ben to breathe and speak to his idol. There is a not-shy love interest, Parker (Graham Parkhurst), who hasn\u2019t done much more than go to the gym and tell Marco that he\u2019s not interested in playing games, but maybe he will reveal hidden shallows. And there is Alyssa (Lisa Gilroy), who is in charge of social media content. She is a Mean Girl, yet cannot help but warm to Marco. What we do not have is anything for Cattrall to do. Madolyn is a limp nothing \u2013 not a fierce businesswoman, not a stormingly creative force, not strong, not magnificently cold or cruel or, more subversively, warm and brilliant. Cattrall looks bored out of her mind. Why recruit a gay icon to a gay show and not use her? It\u2019s baffling. She/Madolyn could have been a catalyst for making something of a series that is otherwise just full of characters telling each other to be brave and be themselves, and actors trying to make lines such as \u201cI\u2019m flopping like a Katy Perry single\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re so focused on what people want you\u2019ve forgotten what people need!

On Monday the Greens voted with the Coalition to delay consideration of Labor\u2019s $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff) until 16 October, despite pressure from housing groups to pass the bill after the government pledged $2bn of direct funding for social and affordable housing. The Greens and Coalition teamed up again on Thursday to establish the inquiry, which will provide an interim report by 23 September to provide input into the national cabinet process considering renters\u2019 rights set up by the Albanese government. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The inquiry will consider rising rents and rental affordability; supply and demand; actions that governments can take to reduce rents or limit rent rises; and \u201cimprovements to renters\u2019 rights\u201d, including rent control, length of leases and no-grounds evictions. Peak housing bodies have urged the Greens to pass the Haff to help secure $500m a year for social and affordable housing, while states and territories have rejected a rent freeze and warned shovel-ready projects are put at risk by the delay. On Thursday the Coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peak Organisations (Coalition of Peaks) added its voice to those calling for the bill to pass, warning that housing is too critical to fall victim to political game-playing. \u201cHousing is a key social determinant of health \u2013 our people need housing now. It\u2019s time to stop procrastinating,\u201d Scott Wilson, the chair of the South Australian Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation Network, said. \u201cOur politicians need to stop dragging this issue out and start taking action. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that come October the legislation will pass, and even if it does, by the time you even start building houses we\u2019re looking at 2025.\u201d Catherine Liddle, the chief executive of SNAICC National Voice for our Children, said \u201cpoliticians are letting perfect get in the way of good, forcing our people to languish on the streets and in overcrowded and unfit housing\u201d. In question time, Anthony Albanese quoted at length from Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather\u2019s essay for Jacobin, in which he argued that the parliamentary conflict on the bill \u201chelps create the space for a broader campaign\u201d on housing affordability. \u201cAllowing the Haff to pass would demobilise the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry about the degree of poverty and financial stress that exists in such a wealthy country,\u201d the prime minister said, quoting Chandler-Mather. Albanese said: \u201cVulnerable people should not be the collateral damage in your manufactured political conflict.\u201d Chandler-Mather claimed he had been misrepresented through selective quotation. The Greens have rejected calls to pass the Haff, arguing that despite securing $2bn of direct funding for social housing it must use the bill to prevent \u201cunlimited\u201d rent rises. But in question time, Albanese argued that attempting the Greens\u2019 policy would amount to telling \u201cevery property owner out there, you\u2019ve got till October until the rent freeze comes on\u201d. \u201cWhat do you think would happen? Do you think they\u2019d put up their rents or do you think they would decrease them?\u201d \u201cThat is why your propositions are so ill thought-out and opportunistic.\u201d On Thursday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told Radio National the Albanese government is \u201cprepared to show leadership at the national cabinet level on renters\u2019 rights and other aspects of the relationship between landlords and tenants\u201d. Chalmers later told reporters in Canberra the Haff was \u201cnot the only part of our agenda\u201d for housing, and the government would \u201cget on with the job\u201d, including through his meeting with treasurers on Friday. Treasurers will discuss \u201chow we advance the housing accord, how we make sure that in addition to the billions of dollars of commonwealth investment and the money invested by the states themselves, that we get the planning and zoning developments that we need, we rope in the industry and investors\u201d, he said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f73", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Missing Titan sub likely intact but out of power, says expert who designed deepest-diving submersible", "lead": "Engineer Ron Allum says missing tourist sub unlikely to have suffered a \u2018catastrophic implosion\u2019 but partial flooding could be preventing it from resurfacing", "author": "Donna Lu Science writer", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 06:37:14", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222259", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90ca7fe81c86ecbcc012c74d5899516e991d0bc1/0_35_800_480/500.jpg", "body": "The missing Titan submersible is unlikely to have suffered a catastrophic failure of its pressure hull, according to a deep-sea engineer who designed the vessel that film-maker James Cameron used to reach Earth\u2019s deepest point. Ron Allum, an Australian deep-sea engineer and explorer, co-designed the Deepsea Challenger submersible that Cameron used in 2012 to reach the deepest-known point of Earth\u2019s seabed in the Mariana Trench. Allum also worked with Cameron on his Last Mysteries of the Titanic documentary in 2005. \u201cSound travels particularly well underwater,\u201d Allum said. \u201cA catastrophic implosion could be heard for thousands of miles and could be recorded.\u201d An implosion would likely trigger signals in military hydrophones, devices used for recording or listening to underwater sounds. \u201cTo me, it sounds like the sub\u2019s pressure hull is intact, but it\u2019s demobilised from power,\u201d Allum said. In such an event, the Titan was likely to have automatically dropped weights to resurface. The tourist sub lost communications in the north Atlantic on Sunday while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. How long it would take to retrieve it if found depends on where and what state the vessel is in. \u201cIf the pressure hull is flooded, you\u2019re now talking about the dry mass of a vessel. You could be lifting a very heavy weight,\u201d Allum said. \u201cIf it were intact, an ROV [remotely operated vehicle] could attach to it and it could at least bring it up to shallower water where they could get a stronger lift cable to it to lift it out of the water \u2026 that ascent may take an hour or two. \u201cThe ROV may have to work around the wreckage \u2026 it may take a few hours to release the sub from the seafloor.\u201d The submersible should have released its drop weights in an emergency but partial flooding of the pressure hull could be preventing the vessel from resurfacing, Allum said. \u201cIf you have water in the pressure hull, it\u2019s quite a large volume. The drop weights usually aren\u2019t that big, and that could be what\u2019s keeping it on the bottom. \u201cIt also means that if the occupants are sitting in a half-flooded pressure hull, that could also be catastrophic. They could become hypothermic. I don\u2019t know how well the CO2 scrubber systems would work if they\u2019re wet.\u201d Dr Glenn Singleman, an Australian extreme medicine expert who has visited the Titanic shipwreck, said a lack of oxygen and carbon dioxide buildup were worrying concerns for the people onboard the missing submersible. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to control your oxygen flow and you\u2019ve got to remove carbon dioxide and you\u2019ve got to remove water vapour. They\u2019re the three things about the environment internally that you\u2019ve got to control. The fourth thing is temperature \u2026 the water temperature down there is 0 to 1C,\u201d he said. Singleman has been the expedition physician on several deep-sea exploration projects, including for Cameron\u2019s Titanic documentary, the Deepsea Challenger expedition, and Victor Vescovo\u2019s Five Deeps expedition. To prevent carbon dioxide buildup, submersibles are equipped with \u201cscrubbers\u201d, usually made of soda lime, which remove CO2 from the air. \u201cThe problem is that you get to a saturation point after a while, and you\u2019ve got to change out the soda lime,\u201d Singleman said. \u201cCO2 content in air is about 400 parts per million. As it goes up, over 1,000[ppm], most people start to get symptomatic, and over 5,000, you\u2019re very symptomatic \u2013 you get hyperventilation, you get a headache, you just feel awful.\u201d Singleman added that the oxygen being supplied inside the vessel was likely being delivered to maintain the regular atmospheric concentration of 21% oxygen. A drop in oxygen levels in the air can result in hypoxia, in which bodily tissues become deprived of adequate supply. Oxygen concentrations of 10% and lower can result in loss of consciousness and death. Singleman said the Titan\u2019s initial 96-hour supply of oxygen would be a figure based on an average person\u2019s oxygen consumption at an average metabolic rate. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no idea how people respond to the stress of a difficult situation \u2013 some people can increase their metabolic rate with stress, some people can relax and try to sleep and decrease it.\u201d Singleman described Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of the five people on board, as a \u201clegend\u201d in the submersible community and \u201cone of the leading experts\u201d on the Titanic wreck. \u201cHis passion is the Titanic, and he\u2019s visited that wreck more than 100 times in submersibles \u2026 Everybody says: why would you go on such a risky venture? The reason is because it\u2019s his passion. This is who he is. He\u2019s spent a lifetime in submersibles going to these extreme environments, exploring unknown places and bringing back these incredible photographs and incredible stories of what\u2019s possible. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to PH many times about it.

Her diary is full of pain: deaths, losses, illness, grief, depression, anguish, fear. But on every page life breaks in, with astonishing energy, relish and glee. The diary is an unmatchable record of her times, a gallery of vividly observed individuals, an intimate and courageousself-examination, a revelation of a writer\u2019s creative processes, a tender, watchful nature journal, and a meditation on life, love, marriage, friendship, solitude, society, time and mortality. It\u2019s one of the greatest diaries ever written, and it\u2019s excellent to see it back in print. Woolf\u2019s first surviving diary entry was made in 1897, when she was nearly 15; her last was on 24 March 1941, four days before her death. She kept these 42 years\u2019 worth of writings in unlined notebooks with soft covers which she bound in coloured papers. She often referred back to them to remind herself of her past, and she drew on them when she started her memoir, Sketch of the Past, in 1939. When her London house was bombed in October 1940, she made sure to salvage them. Before she killed herself, on 28 March 1941, she left a note for her husband Leonard asking him to destroy all her papers. Luckily for us, he didn\u2019t. Instead he set about sorting and saving a vast mass of materials, including manuscripts of novels, essays and reviews, and these diaries, which went to the Berg Collection in the New York Public Library. In 1953, Leonard selected extracts, published as A Writer\u2019s Diary, which gave the impression of nun-like dedication to the task of writing. It would take the publication of the complete diaries and letters, 20 or so years on, to shift that unsmiling image. Woolf\u2019s posthumous reputation as a gigantic figure in 20th-century literature, galvanised by the feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s, was secured by the scholarly editing and publishing of her novels, thanks to all those manuscripts Leonard preserved, and by decades of biographical and critical books on her. It also owes a great deal to the joint work of her nephew, the art historian Quentin Bell, who wrote her firstfull-length biography in 1972, and his wife, Anne Olivier Bell, who edited the diaries between 1977 and 1984, helped by Andrew McNeillie. That long labour is nicely evoked by her daughter Virginia Nicolson in her foreword to this Granta edition (all five volumes have good introductions from, among others, Olivia Laing and Margo Jefferson). Olivier transcribed more than 2,000 photocopied pages, tidied up Woolf\u2019s quirks of spellings, datings and punctuation, introduced paragraphs into the rapid, free flow of her prose, and annotated, thoroughly, briskly and humorously, the torrent of names, references, in-jokes and allusions on every page. Granta keeps the original editorial prefaces and notes, and adds a hitherto not-included 1917 wartime Asheham Diary, but sadly doesn\u2019t include Woolf\u2019s early journals (1897 to 1909) which were published by another editor in 1990 as A Passionate Apprentice. There is, notoriously, no shortage of mean remarks in Woolf\u2019s diaries, as in her letters. She can be spiteful and snooty, and she often speaks the now-offensive language of her times. This has for years been catnip to Woolf critics who condemn her for her views. But, as Laing says here, she is \u201ccapable of shocking episodes of snobbery and cruelty while remaining far more progressive and politically engaged than many of her class\u201d. Though Olivier removed a few unkind references to living people, she decided not to \u201cbeautify\u201d Woolf by \u201ccutting away ugly bits here and there\u201d. The publisher at Granta has sensibly followed suit, but notes that \u201cthe language used and/or views expressed in the diary \u2026 and the original editorial material are those of the respective authors in their time and do not represent the publisher\u2019s attitudes\u201d. No one could ever blame or shame Woolf as much as she does herself. She is intensely self-critical and longs to push outside herself, beyond egotism, to identify as \u201cwe\u201d, not \u201cI\u201d. There\u2019s a gripping struggle throughout between solipsism (\u201cHow I interest myself!\u201d) and a longing for impersonality and communality. Her precise, passionate descriptions of the landscape around her, whether the Sussex Downs or London city streets, which in themselves make the diaries worth reading, are part of that longing to reach out from the self to what she calls \u201cthe singing of the real world\u201d. And her avid fascination with other people makes for an almost uncanny empathy, as if she is turning herself into the person she is observing. The diary is a treasure house of characters, from the famous literary men and women she knew (Hardy, Wells, Yeats, Sackville-West, Mansfield, Eliot) to a thousand vivid portraits of more obscure lives. How many different uses she puts her diary to! It is a record of her world, and if you want to know the details, written up at speed in the heat of the moment, of the general strike, or the abdication crisis, or the civilian experience of the second world war, this is the place to go. It is a writer\u2019s exercise book, where she works at finding an \u201celastic\u201d form which will make something of \u201cthis loose, drifting material of life\u201d: \u201cIt strikes me that in this book I practise writing; do my scales.\u201d It is an essential form of therapy, where dangerous feelings \u2013 anger over a row with Leonard about money, terror at the onset of depression, pain in illness, social embarrassment, apprehension of being laughed at when her books are coming out \u2013 can be laid to rest. This is where she \u201ccomposes\u201d herself: \u201cTo soothe these whirlpools, I write here.\u201d It is a reader\u2019s notebook, where she records her literary responses and judgments and often tells herself \u201cwhat a vast fertility of pleasure books hold for me!\u201d It is an intimate account of her own writing process, like the joyous moment in her bath when she suddenly invents Three Guineas \u2013 \u201cLord how exciting!\u201d \u2013 or the evolution of To the Lighthouse, from the first thought: \u201cto have father\u2019s character done complete in it; &amp; mothers; &amp; St Ives; &amp; childhood; &amp; all the usual things I try to put in \u2013 life, death, etc\u201d. It is a memory book, which, very importantly for her, brings back her past and compulsively revisits key dates like her mother\u2019s death when she was 13, or her marriage to Leonard, or the moves to different houses. It is a book about mortality, knowing that death is coming and making the most of what is now and here. \u201cI am glad to be alive and sorry for the dead,\u201d she writes after the suicide of a friend. She wrings all the juice from life: love, pleasure, affection and enjoyment run all through. She wants to live for the moment. \u201cIf one does not lie back &amp; sum up &amp; say to the moment, this very moment, stay you are so fair, what will be one\u2019s gain, dying? No: stay, this moment. No one ever says that enough. Always hurry. I am now going in, to see L &amp; say stay this moment.\u201d \u2022 The Diary of Virginia Woolf (in five volumes) is published by Granta (\u00a330 each).

If it is still intact \u2013 and the five men inside are still alive \u2013 the missing Titan submersible is now down to its very last few hours of usable oxygen.

UK news | Police searching for Sophie Lambert, a 22-year-old woman who went missing from her home in Harrogate last Friday evening, have found a body in the River Nidd. In depth: Lost at sea and out of time? Where is Titan? When it last made contact with its launch vessel the Polar Prince (pictured below), around 1.45pm GMT on Sunday, the tiny carbon fibre and titanium submersible was heading towards the most famous shipwreck in the world, around 3,800 metres (12,500ft) below sea level. Since then, there has been no sign of it, leading to an increasingly fraught search operation. \u201cBanging noises\u201d detected in the search area by a Canadian aircraft on Tuesday raised hopes that the five passengers might be alive, and rescuers have continued to detect sounds that have helped them focus the search. But there is no way to be sure that the noises came from the sub. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they are, to be frank with you,\u201d the US Coast Guard spokesman said. Five people are missing: Pakistani industrialist Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman; British billionaire adventurer Hamish Harding; the highly experienced former French navy commander Paul Henry Nargeolet; and Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate Expeditions, the operators of the Titan. According to the US Coast Guard, the group had about 96 hours of oxygen in total when they launched. It has been estimated, if the passengers are alive, that any remaining oxygen will be exhausted by around 10am GMT today, meaning the rescue operation could not be more urgent. *** A journey to the bottom of the sea If the gathering search and rescue effort to find the sub is impressive, the scale of the area in which it is lost is bewilderingly vast. Titan is 6.7m long \u2013 reminiscent of a minivan, according to CBS journalist David Pogue who took the same Titanic tour last year. The Titanic, on the other hand is 3,800 metres underwater, and lies 740km (400 nautical miles) from Newfoundland. By Wednesday, the search extended to an area twice the size of the state of Connecticut, the US Coast Guard said. It is possible, according to experts, that the vessel could have refloated back to the surface, but has no functioning communications and so no way of alerting rescuers. That\u2019s the best-case scenario, they say \u2013 but those on board would still risk suffocation, because the only way to open the vessel is from the outside. Another possibility is that the sub reached the hull of the Titanic and become entangled in its wreckage. If so, and in the event of a power loss, the temperature at the depths is just 4C. An onboard fire is another possibility; if so \u201cthere really is no safety gear in there except for a fire extinguisher and fire masks, which we practised putting on and taking off\u201d, Pogue told NPR. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it, because there\u2019s not much you can do if something goes wrong.\u201d The most catastrophic scenario would be a failure of the carbon fibre hull \u2013 a material regarded as untested in these conditions, the Guardian\u2019s science editor, Ian Sample, has reported. In the event of such a failure, under pressures of more than two tonnes per square inch, the craft is likely to have instantly imploded. One deep sea engineer told the Guardian that was unlikely, however, as the noise of a catastrophic rupture would have been detected. He said the capsule might be partially flooded, preventing it from resurfacing. *** \u201cMacGyver-y jerry-riggedness\u201d Pogue\u2019s homespun description of the submersible, referencing the 1980s series in which the hero improvises ingenious engineering solutions using comically basic parts, reflected his surprise at some of the elements of Titan\u2019s construction. It has one button \u2013 similar to that in a lift \u2013 Rush told Pogue proudly in the CBS report, and its internal lights were sourced from a camping shop. For ballast, the vessel reportedly reused old construction pipes. Most startlingly, Titan was said to be controlled by a modified video-game controller. Because there is no GPS underwater, the submersible was given instructions from the surface via text message. Rush assured Pogue that the structure of the vehicle itself was sound. But it has emerged that OceanGate Expeditions was warned that Titan\u2019s construction could lead to catastrophic safety problems. In a 2018 engineering report, the company\u2019s director of marine operations, David Lochridge, warned that the craft needed more testing, and that passengers might be endangered when it reached \u201cextreme depths\u201d, according to a lawsuit filed that year in the US district court in Seattle. His concerns focused on the method by which any flaws were detected in the hull, and queried the depths at which it was safe. OceanGate said he was not an engineer and sued Lochridge; the case was later settled. *** A scramble to rescue As of today, more ships are still arriving at the scene, among them US and Canadian coast guard vessels, some equipped with sonar search capabilities, and a French vessel carrying an ROV that is connected by an 8km-long cable and reportedly capable of operating at extreme depths. A Canadian naval ship carrying a medical team and hyperbaric recompression chamber was also en route. Despite the effort, it is by no means certain if any rescue is possible, even if the craft is found sitting on the sea floor. The deepest-ever submarine rescue, of two men from a small submersible off the coast of Ireland in 1973, was from a depth of 480 metres. The seabed around the Titanic is around eight times as deep. All will hope fervently for the men\u2019s safe return, but as many have noted, the huge effort to rescue them stands in stark contrast with the attention given to the ramshackle fishing vessel packed by people smugglers with an estimated 750 migrants onboard, which sank in the Mediterranean last week. More than 1,200 people drowned in the Mediterranean in 2022, according to Human Rights Watch, part of a \u201chorrifying tally\u201d of almost 25,000 deaths since 2014.

Cartoon of the day | Steve Bell The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad Moss is often treated like something that needs to be destroyed or removed \u2013 an annoying pest ruining pristine, pruned gardens. The truth, however, is that moss is a key part of keeping our planet healthy, and fighting air pollution and the climate crisis. Because they don\u2019t have proper roots and absorb nutrients like a sponge, mosses are particularly good at feeding on pollutants and fine particles of dust in the air. It has been estimated that moss stores 6.43bn tonnes more carbon in the soil layer than is stored in bare patches of soil. Their durability also means they are able to colonise bare ground and survive harsh environments, and their existence allows for other plants to grow.

In truth, this film is basically a bit of brand enhancement, following on from Crouch\u2019s post-football podcast and Crouchfest live show, and as such doesn\u2019t go anywhere particularly unexpected. Crouch, of course, was the gawky striker who, in the footballing parlance, proved the doubters wrong by making it into the Premier League, winning the FA Cup with Liverpool, scoring a hat-trick for England and \u2013 most potently for the legend \u2013 improvising that dopey robot-dance goal celebration and marrying model Abbey Clancy. (Not for nothing is his most famous line the one about what he would be if he wasn\u2019t a footballer.) Well, Crouch enlarges on the feelings of awkwardness he felt as a teenager trying to break into the game, and even after having done so the trauma of failing to score in his first dozen and a half games for Liverpool. (Improbably, it turns out he met Clancy the night he broke his Liverpool duck; as she acidly remarks, \u201cThat was his lucky day.\u201d) And for all Crouch\u2019s sensitivity as a youngster, there\u2019s one or two amazing details that suggest there was a fair amount of gormlessness going on as well; I\u2019d suggest most 24-year-olds know about the existence of bedsheets. Crouch, however, shows his innate shrewdness in knowing he had to try and set up his post-football life while he was still in the spotlight (\u201cplenty of ex-players told me the moment you retire, no one remembers; so I wanted to do things while I was still current\u201d), and he certainly had the backing of a number of big-name managers \u2013 Harry Redknapp, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson \u2013 who kept the faith during Crouch\u2019s wobbliest moments. Fortunately Crouch\u2019s travails don\u2019t appear to have cut too deeply \u2013 \u201cthat was the nearest I got to be being depressed,\u201d he says, after being booed by a stadium full of Manchester United fans when he was subbed on during an England international \u2013 and if there\u2019s a villain of the piece it might be his hyper-competitive dad Bruce who, it transpires, was one of those parents who gets into fights on the touchline of kids\u2019 games. Despite all this, Crouch does seem to be a nice guy, which is his and this film\u2019s USP, even if some of the film\u2019s key messages are repeated two or three times. There\u2019s a fair bit of padding, too; it\u2019s clear that much of his playing career, including his time at Stoke, the longest spell of his career at a single club, can\u2019t have been that riveting. Still, this is good-natured, entertaining stuff. \u2022 That Peter Crouch Film is released on 22 June on Prime Video."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f77", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/22/compensation-has-been-as-hellish-as-our-eurostar-trip", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Compensation has been as hellish as our Eurostar trip", "lead": "When it comes to delays, rail passengers are treated as second-class compared with those who choose to fly", "author": "Anna Tims", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 06:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222332", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4db8fdd2f9cb1a048e3bf19c079f70911c773228/305_424_3738_2242/500.jpg", "body": "My friend and I suffered the Eurostar journey from hell on a two-day trip to Amsterdam in March. It started when we crossed the Belgian border and were told problems on the line required the power to be switched off. We sat motionless for four hours, then the train returned to Lille and were told that when the line reopened, the service would terminate in Brussels and passengers for Amsterdam would have to take an inter-city train unless they preferred to return to London. At Brussels, we were held for another hour and, when we were finally allowed to disembark, there was utter chaos, with no Eurostar officials present. We eventually reached our hotel eight hours later than scheduled. Eurostar says the only compensation we are entitled to is 50% of the cost of the ticket or an e-voucher worth 75%. This is the same compensation offered to a passenger delayed by no more than two hours, and is entirely inadequate. JS, London Rail passengers are classed by EU regulators as second-class citizens compared with air travellers. European regulations allow the latter to claim \u00a3220 compensation if a short-haul flight arrives more than two hours late, unless the delay was caused by an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d outside the airline\u2019s control. The sum is sometimes several times the value of the ticket. EU train operators only have to refund half the ticket cost for the same delay, except in extraordinary circumstances. Now, major faults on the line would count as an extraordinary circumstance, so Eurostar could have refused you any compensation. It says its booking terms and conditions explain all this and points out it goes beyond EU regulations by offering 75% in the form of vouchers against future travel. However, train operators, like airlines, are obliged to offer food and drink during severe delays and you say none was provided. And the fact remains that if Eurostar had been to blame for the delays you would have been entitled to far less than an air passenger. According to consumer group Which?, weak protection could harm the drive towards sustainable travel. \u201cThe EU has ambitions to encourage more people to travel by train, but, to be successful, protections must be strengthened to offer at least the same level of cover as flights,\u201d says Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel. \u201cNot only do train passengers often receive lower levels of compensation, potentially leaving them out of pocket for disruption, but rules on assistance and rerouting are often poorly understood, or ignored, leaving customers stranded, and so rail is likely to continue to be a less attractive prospect.\u201d In the UK, most operators have signed up to the Delay Repay scheme, which pays 50% of the ticket price for delays of half an hour, and a full refund for journeys delayed by an hour or more, regardless of the cause.

Like, loads. There have been at least 10 iPhones since then, plus a machine that can literally harness the power of the stars. Yet when someone wants to hype up a new product today, they don\u2019t say, it\u2019s the best thing \u201csince Bluetooth\u201d or \u201cthe rocket that took man to the moon\u201d or even \u201cthe polio vaccine\u201d. They say it\u2019s the best thing since sliced bread \u2013 because, nearly a century on, we still haven\u2019t invented anything better. Soft, pillowy white bread that sticks to the roof of your mouth when untoasted \u2013 that you squish into a ball and bite into as a kid, that you pack in lunchboxes and on picnics and fry in beaten eggs \u2013 is something many of us know is worth dying earlier for. It is a comfort food so comforting that, according to Warburtons chairman Jonathan Warburton, sales rose during Covid and the cost-of-living crisis. \u201cThe staple white sliced bread is most certainly not dead,\u201d said the breadman after consumer behaviour firm Circana found that sales of pre-packed white loaves are up 0.6% compared with this time last year \u2013 while sales of all other surveyed bread categories declined. Of course, what\u2019s good news for Warburton isn\u2019t necessarily great for everyone else. It\u2019s worth scrutinising the way the economic crisis is affecting our diets and health, and it\u2019s sad that \u2013 according to Hovis commercial director Alistair Gaunt \u2013 \u201cshoppers are buying fewer different types of bread for their household\u201d thanks to feeling squeezed. What I want more than anything is for everyone to be able to afford the bread they like best. Yet I can\u2019t help but rejoice at the return of white bread, simply because of how much I despise its cruel, hard, glamorous cousin from out of town \u2013 the bread that has spent the last few years taking over cafes across the country. I\u2019m talking about the worst girl I\u2019ve ever met: sourdough. I recently paid \u00a311 for a club sandwich. Extortionate, but it would be worth it \u2013 or so I thought. As I waited for my order, my mouth watered at the thought of the jammy egg with the right-kind-of-chewy chicken, the bread snugly squeezing the fillings together. Yet when it arrived at my table and I took a bite, I found that the insides of my sandwich slipped and slid about, barely held together by two slabs of tough, brown sourdough. My fury was hard and unyielding, like the crusts I couldn\u2019t eat. It is not that sourdough is always or inherently evil \u2013 spread with jam, held in your hand, I can see why it was the pandemic\u2019s most popular pal. Yet sourdough has somehow become the de facto bread for sandwiches and loaded toasts. The ridiculousness of this situation becomes apparent when a waiter hands you a steak knife to eat your eggs and avocado with. This is a knife that admits, right to your face, that the bread on your plate is too inflexible. It takes but one brave little boy to declare that the emperor is naked, so I shall be he. Bread should not cut and scrape the roof of your mouth! Sandwiches should be so soft that our jaws continue to be measurably worse than those of our caveman ancestors! \u201cBut,\u201d you might say, because people love to say but \u2013 \u201cisn\u2019t sourdough super healthy? Isn\u2019t it good for gut health and super nutritious?\u201d What if I told you that your gums are potentially being shredded by bread that is no better for you than some thick sliced white? According to the Real Bread Campaign, run by non-profit food alliance Sustain, many shops are currently selling \u201csourfaux\u201d, which is filled with additives and preservatives and not made with the real, fermented sourdough starter that gives sourdough its nutritional edge. To my mind, then, white bread has more than earned its comeback. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a money thing \u2013 even Waitrose customers are turning back to the trusty old classic, with the supermarket reporting a 17% rise in sliced white bread sales in the year leading to September 2022. I think \u2013 I hope \u2013 we have simply opened our eyes. There is only one bread that deserves to entomb our fish fingers and our bacon and our crisps. Speaking after Circana\u2019s findings, Roberts Bakery insight manager Rachael Chard called white bread a \u201cblank canvas\u201d, adding: \u201cConsumers can experiment with interesting sandwiches and toasted sandwiches \u2013 and white bread, whether standard or premium, is usually the ideal base.\u201d I\u2019ll eat to that. I hope we continue to invent more rockets and vaccines, but I also hope that scientists will soon fuel our bread slicers with the stars. There is a reason that no other invention has taken over the idiom. Yet somehow, simultaneously, sourdough has taken over our cafes. For shame \u2013 no more, please. Sourdough sandwiches are the worst thing since sliced bread.

The invasive snails have voracious appetites and consume at least 500 species of plants, according to Florida\u2019s department of agriculture, which is fearful for the state\u2019s lucrative growing industries of citrus and other fruits and vegetables. In response, it has set up a \u201ctreatment area\u201d covering several dozen blocks of the city of Miramar, south west of Fort Lauderdale, and is warning residents that the slimy creatures snails also pose a serious health risk to humans by carrying parasite rat lungworm, known to cause meningitis. Under the quarantine order, the department says it is unlawful \u201cto move a giant African land snail or a regulated article, including, but not limited to, plants, plant parts, plants in soil, soil, yard waste, debris, compost or building materials\u201d. It intends to spray the area with the chemical snail bait metaldehyde, which is approved for residential use. The snails are illegal to import or possess in the US without a permit, and authorities have been trying for years to eradicate them. They can damage buildings, as well as destroying crops, and in some quarters are even considered a delicacy. In March, customs officers in Detroit intercepted a traveler from Ghana trying to smuggle six snails into the country in a suitcase. In one of the biggest outbreaks, officials in Miami-Dade discovered almost 150,000 snails in more than two dozen separate areas of the county in 2014, many clinging to houses, eating plaster and stucco to gain calcium for their shells, and eating their way through gardens. Invasions have occurred in other areas of Florida on an almost annual basis since. Pasco county was placed under quarantine last June after more than a thousand of the snails, females of which can produce up to 2,500 eggs a year, were discovered in New Port Richey. Experts believe the snails first arrived in Miami in 1966, and numbers swelled to almost 18,000 within six years. According to an ABC News report, the species was declared eradicated twice in Florida, in 1975, and again in 2021. \u201cThe primary danger is that they\u2019re voracious plant eaters, so they can do an awful lot of damage to both landscapes and to agriculture,\u201d University of Florida entomologist William Kern told Miami\u2019s Local 10 news station. \u201cIf the snails crawl on uncooked vegetables, you can have a problem with it getting a human infection.

But with a recent UK study showing people are planning to go and see less live music this year due to the cost of living crisis, perhaps commercial music events have lost their charm. The good news: there are some eclectic and affordable festivals in Europe where profit takes a backseat. Pete the Monkey, Normandy, France Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, in the Calvados region of northern France, is home to a three-day festival called Pete the Monkey that is just minutes away from the beach. Dubbed a \u201csecret little paradise\u201d by Le Monde newspaper, the festival is a vibrant celebration of French and English culture, with sustainability at the top of its agenda. Food trucks serve only locally sourced produce, there is no plastic on site and the DJ stage is run on solar panels. In the past, Pete the Monkey has boasted an impressive lineup from Loyle Carner to Folamour, and 2023 will see the likes of African/Afro-Cuban fusion band Orchestra Baobab, French indie artist Flavien Berger and Parisian duo Acid Arab on stage. The money raised by the festival goes towards Jacj Cuisi monkey sanctuary in Bolivia, which saves animals that have become the victims of deforestation and illegal trafficking. When festival founder Louis Dumas volunteered at the sanctuary in 2009, he saw monkeys being used as pets, and forced to wash dishes in the river. He filmed it on his camera and the video went viral. Louis and his brother Rob then decided to start a festival committed to raising money for the underfunded sanctuary. Little did they know a 350-strong party in 2012 would turn into one of France\u2019s most coveted green festivals. 13-15 July, three-day ticket \u20ac177.50, petethemonkeyfestival Sun, Hungary The Sun (Solar United Natives) festival takes place in Csobankapuszta, a \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d in northern Hungary. The ethos at Sun is one of deep human connection. Attenders come to \u201crebuild, shake off the problems, forgive and let go\u201d. There are cows and sheep on the land, tree-planting sessions and healing groups. Ten years ago, the idea grew out of the Hungarian Goa scene, a collection of psychedelic trance parties, and maintains that reputation today. On the running list this year are Sabretooth, Gagarin Project and Triceradrops. Rather than using a traditional ticketing system, you must become a \u201cmember\u201d of the community to attend. It\u2019s all organised by NGO Deep Smile Foundation with no investors or corporate backing.

Friday is for indie music fans (AmpRocks), Saturday is a more traditional \u201cproms in the park\u201d (AmpProms) and Sunday shifts to a family-friendly event (AmpGala) with charity stalls and activities for kids. A small festival of about 8,000 people, Ampthill has still seen the likes of McFly headline. But this year you\u2019ll get the chance to see chart-topping band Clean Bandit alongside indie-rock quartet Black Honey and opera singer Elizabeth Bottone.

Located in Czaplinek, north-west Poland, it attracts a huge number of visitors \u2013 with 750,000 turning up in 2019. Although the festival\u2019s roots are heavy metal, the lineup includes indie, hip-hop, rock and reggae artists. Apollo 440 and Bullet for my Valentine (BFMV) are headlining this year amid a host of creative workshops and lectures. The event is run by the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity as a way of thanking its volunteers, and each year the money raised goes towards a different branch of medicine in Poland. So far the festival has devoted itself to paediatric and elderly care, but it has also raised funds for specific conditions such as sepsis. Patients are encouraged to come to the festival, along with everyone else, with safe spaces created to accommodate their needs. 3-5 August, free, polandrockfestival Ypsigrock, Sicily, Italy Nestled between the Madonie Mountains and the sea on the north coast of Sicily is the medieval town of Castelbuono \u2013 the unlikely home to Italy\u2019s leading indie-rock festival. Ypsigrock has seen the likes of alt-J and Primal Scream on stage, but this year it features \u201cemotional rock\u201d from Ekkstacy, jazz/electronica band the Comet is Coming and Mercury prize-winning group Young Fathers. Now in its 26th year, the festival was founded by the nonprofit Associazione Culturale Glenn Gould, which promotes cultural initiatives to enhance and develop the region. The association also runs a social inclusion programme with Fondazione Con il Sud. It aims to improve the accessibility of events in southern Italy by finding ways for people with disabilities to actively participate at festivals. 10-13 August, three-day pass \u20ac125.89, ypsigrock Medicine, Reading, UK If you\u2019re looking for a truly international festival with respect for nature as its top priority, head to Wasing Estate near Reading in August. Medicine is a celebration of Indigenous communities around the world. Elders share their teachings and ceremonies in an effort to preserve ancient cultures on the brink of extinction. Expect \u201csacred sound\u201d, world music, dance, healing arts and ecological activism. Headliners this year include \u201cotherworldly\u201d folk artist Ayla Nereo and Canadian-American band Fanna-fi-Allah, which plays qawwali, a form of Sufi devotional music from south Asia. Medicine has donated more than \u00a340,000 to charities such as Survival International and Amazon Watch, a cultural restoration initiative for the Yawanaw\u00e1 tribe in Brazil and a programme providing education for Tibetan monks. While the festival is sold out, Medicine is releasing a limited number of tickets at \u00a3290 on its website, which can be claimed using the password: medicinelastfew. 17-21 August medicinefestival Amsterdam Dance Event (Ade), Holland Every October, electronic music fans flock to Holland for the Amsterdam Dance Event (Ade). This is a pricey festival at \u20ac525 a pop, but it\u2019s worth it for the hardcore fans. It takes place over five days and there are roughly 1,000 events in 200 locations over the city. From basement-club nights and 12-hour parties to stadium shows, lectures and workshops, this is where EDM (electronic dance music) industry nerds congregate. Last year\u2019s opening night saw Kyle Dixon &amp; Michael Stein, composers of the soundtrack to Stranger Things, play a live performance from the score. This year will feature a solo show from DJ Martin Garrix and sets from techno-house aficionados B\u00e1rbara Lago and Fatima Hajji, among many others. Ade is organised by the Amsterdam Dance Event Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to nurturing electronic music, its culture and industry worldwide. The aim is to lay a foundation for future generations by supporting emerging talent. 18-22 October, early bird tickets with access to all events \u20ac525, amsterdam-dance-event Untold, Romania Set in Cluj-Napoca, a city in north-western Romania, Untold is the largest electronic music festival in the country. Over six stages (indoor and outdoor), it hosts some of the most talented names in contemporary techno. But there is something for everyone, with the lineup famed for being particularly diverse \u2013 trap, progressive house, psy, euphoric hardstyle, afro house and ambient. In 2023 you can expect to hear Imagine Dragons, Alesso and Bedouin, to name a few. Fun fact: in 2018, Armin van Buuren played for seven hours straight on the main stage. The festival was founded by Share Federation Cluj-Napoca (a nonprofit government organisation) after Cluj-Napoca city was nominated as the European youth capital in 2015. The federation\u2019s mission is to support youth organisations through inclusive urban development projects and sharing culture and common European values. 3-6 August, day tickets from \u20ac89, untold"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f7b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/new-zealand-pm-disagrees-with-joe-biden-over-xi-jinping-dictator-remark", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New Zealand PM disagrees with Joe Biden over Xi Jinping \u2018dictator\u2019 remark", "lead": "Chris Hipkins, who is about to meet the Chinese president on a trip to Beijing for the first time, said China\u2019s system of government is \u2018a matter for them\u2019", "author": "Tess McClure in Christchurch", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 05:56:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222404", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e2958415a6ddabb538b16b2dfbf2324721d19ab0/0_291_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins has disagreed with US President Joe Biden\u2019s remark that Xi Jinping is a \u201cdictator\u201d, as he prepares to meet the Chinese leader on an official trade trip to China. \u201cNo, and the form of government that China has is a matter for the Chinese people,\u201d Hipkins told reporters when asked about Biden\u2019s description. Asked whether the Chinese people had a say in the form their government took, he said: \u201cif they wanted to change their system of government, then that would be a matter for them.\u201d Pressed by journalists on how the Chinese people could viably enforce a change in the way they are governed, Hipkins said, \u201cwell, that would be a matter for them\u201d. Hipkins\u2019 remarks come as he prepares to visit China leading a trade delegation and meet Xi, the first time a New Zealand prime minister has done so since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Announcing the trip earlier this week, Hipkins emphasised the country\u2019s economic importance to New Zealand. \u201cChina represents nearly a quarter of all our exports, was our second-largest source of tourists pre-Covid and is a significant source of international students, so it\u2019s a critical part of our economic recovery,\u201d he said in a statement. New Zealand is highly dependent on China for trade, and it is New Zealand\u2019s largest trade partner by a considerable margin. The relationship between the two countries has been strained in recent years \u2013 by Beijing\u2019s increasingly assertive pursuit of its interests in the Pacific, human rights abuses in Xinjiang and crackdowns in Hong Kong \u2013 but New Zealand has been more cautious and less forthright than many of its western allies in comments condemning those actions. At times over the years, that balancing act has come under criticism: a Canadian government-published report labelled New Zealand the \u201csoft underbelly\u201d of the Five Eyes security alliance, and former leader Jacinda Ardern came under attack from a UK Tory MP for \u201csucking up\u201d to China. Discussing his planned meeting with Xi earlier in the months, Hipkins said New Zealand prided itself in being \u201cconsistent\u201d in its approach. \u201cThat means that where we have human rights concerns we will raise them. Where we have concerns around trade or any other foreign policy issue, we will raise those,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s \u201cdictator\u201d comment came shortly after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had met Xi on a trip aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. The US president said Xi had been embarrassed when a Chinese spy balloon was blown off course over the US. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn\u2019t know what happened. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be going where it was. It was blown off course up through Alaska and then down through the United States. And he didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d Biden said. The remark provoked immediate pushback from Beijing. Biden\u2019s comment was a \u201cpolitical provocation\u201d and had \u201cseriously violated China\u2019s political dignity\u201d, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Wednesday."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f7c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/22/audit-office-finds-nsw-forestry-failed-to-monitor-contractors-amid-calls-to-end-native-forest-logging", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Audit office finds NSW Forestry failed to monitor contractors amid calls to end native forest logging", "lead": "Report also notes some EPA staff did not have advanced training in forestry and lacked basic equipment such as tape measures to gauge tree diameter", "author": "Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 05:54:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222425", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/50c1bafea6608ad8df9722e3705cd01315fdd69b/788_453_3904_2343/500.jpg", "body": "NSW\u2019s Forestry Corporation (FCNSW) does not consistently monitor compliance of contractors and failed to assess the risk of its timber operations in the state\u2019s west, the state\u2019s audit office said in a report. Some inspectors even lacked equipment such as measuring tapes. The report, tabled in NSW parliament on Thursday, also found 80% of forests on the south coast were affected by 2019-20 bushfires, reducing long-term timber supplies from the region by about 30%. FCNSW\u2019s total harvest fell to 574,000 cubic metres in 2020-21, which was about 60% of the level of two years earlier. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The audit office found the frequency of contractor supervision to be inconsistent and not tied to a contractor\u2019s past performance. Monitoring results were also not collated and analysed to target audits. These gaps increased the risk that \u201cnon-compliant practices will not be identified, potentially leading to environmental harm\u201d, the report said. Pressure on NSW to end logging in state forests has increased following Victoria\u2019s plan to end the industry by next year. Western Australia has a similar target. Liberals in the Perrottet government prepared plans to end such logging in the run-up to the March election, only to have their Nationals partners block the move. Industry regulator, Environment Protection Authority, was also found not to be assessing risks in western regions. The agency was not inspecting all \u201chigh-risk harvest sites\u201d, the report found. \u201cMost EPA staff have basic training in forestry matters, but few staff have the more advanced training required to effectively undertake forestry inspections,\u201d it said. Some staff also lacked access to necessary tools, such as tapes for measuring tree diameter. The report also noted the EPA did not have the ability to restrict logging activities in bushfire-hit forests. While the FCNSW initially asked the EPA for extra site-specific conditions it then began implementing its own measures a year later. \u201cUnlike the [specific conditions], the EPA was unable to undertake enforcement activities for breaches of voluntary measures,\u201d the report said. Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson Sue Higginson said: \u201cNative forest logging costs NSW tens of millions [of dollars] just in the harvesting and haulage. \u201cIf we add the expenses of the EPA having to monitor all of the non-compliant operations, then the bill blows out even more.\u201d Carmen Dwyer, an EPA executive director, said her agency had already implemented two of the report\u2019s recommendations. \u201cStrong and effective regulation is critical to ensuring our state forests are protected for future generations,\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cBy December this year, we will have documented and explained our approach to risk assessments in the Western Integrated Forestry Operations approval areas.\u201d Forestry Corporation said it accepted the audit office\u2019s recommendations and \u201cwas committed to making continued improvements to our operations where necessary. \u201cOur staff care passionately about the forests they work in and, over the last three years, we have significantly increased our efforts around compliance,\u201d a spokeswoman said, adding that included \u201cinvestment in technology solutions, putting more staff on the ground and a regular program of internal audits\u201d."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f7d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/22/australian-ballet-dancers-strike-first-industrial-action-42-years", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Australian Ballet dancers to take first industrial action in more than four decades", "lead": "Dancers will \u2018hold the curtain\u2019 at a Melbourne performance on Friday after negotiations to ensure appropriate pay rises failed", "author": "Kelly Burke", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 05:21:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222446", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/afa4a0be90faa8c1a83bec72c44ca7235a5ca1e2/0_368_5942_3566/500.jpg", "body": "Dancers of the Australian Ballet will take industrial action for the first time in more than four decades, after negotiations with management over a new workplace agreement reached an impasse on Monday. Dancers will \u201chold the curtain\u201d at this Friday\u2019s performance in Melbourne, meaning the show Identity, a program of two original works, will be delayed by 15 minutes. In response, ballet management has decided to cancel a one-off bonus performance of a new short work that was scheduled to take place after Friday night\u2019s show, in a move the dancers\u2019 union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, has called \u201cpunitive\u201d, but management said was unavoidable, given the scheduled performance would now run overtime. \u201cIt will be rescheduled to give it the prominence it deserves,\u201d the company said in a statement. A full-on strike by dancers has not been ruled out. The last time that happened was 42 years ago when they stopped work for 26 days and some shows had to be cancelled. In 2017 the dancers filed for protected industrial action at the Fair Work Commission when negotiations over a new enterprise bargaining agreement stalled, but a deal was reached that maintained a longstanding clause guaranteeing dancers\u2019 pay would keep pace with inflation \u2013 something management is seeking to strike out in the new agreement. The MEAA is calling on volunteers to leaflet Friday\u2019s audience and obtain signatures for a petition to send to the company\u2019s executive.

As reported in the Guardian on 8 June, 91% of dancers voted to commence industrial action earlier this year, after negotiations which began with management last September reached a stalemate. Dancers speaking anonymously told Guardian Australia they felt management had not acted in good faith, given they had agreed to a pay cut of 20% and then 50%, as theatres across the country were forced to close due to Covid-19. The dancers then agreed to a pay freeze for the remainder of 2021. The company told Guardian Australia the 50% pay cut was for only a short period of time and in May 2020 it assisted 10 dancers who were suffering financial hardship with an average payment of $5,495 each. Earlier this month, the company told Guardian Australia that dancers\u2019 pay packets in 2023 would still be 5.3% higher than last year, taking into account the 4.3% top up already paid in February. The MEAA said including the 4.3% top up as part of the 2023 pay rise was \u201cmisleading\u201d. An Australian Ballet spokesperson said the disruption of any performance was \u201cregrettable\u201d for ticket holders, but the company respected the right of its dancers to take protected industrial action. \u201cOver nine months of negotiation with the MEAA, good progress has been made with agreed enhancements in several key areas including performance and rehearsal schedules, rest days, and live streaming performance fees,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, we are yet to reach agreement on the final level of wage increase our dancers will receive over and above the 4.3% increase they received from 1 February 2023.

The President of the Explorers Club, Richard Garriott de Cayeux, has thanked the the public for \u201call your support and hard work\u201d on the effort to find and save the Titan submersible. In a statement on social media, Garriot de Cayeux said he believed the efforts so far have \u201chave importantly improved the odds of a positive outcome\u201d to the situation, although he remained critical of authorities for not acting fast enough. He said the arrival of the Magellan and the use of side-scan sonar will help improve the odds of finding the submersible. We continue to come together for our friends, their families and the ideals of The Explorers Club, and the cause of safe scientific exploration of extreme environments. There is good cause for hope, and we are making it more hopeful. I thank you! Keep searching! Ten ships and several remote subs have joined the hunt for the missing submersible Rescue teams searching for the missing Titan submersible saw reason for optimism on Wednesday after they reported hearing underwater noises in the Atlantic. While stressing that the sounds were \u201cinconclusive\u201d and not confirmation the crew was still alive, the news did raise the question of what happens if the sub is located \u2013 and what equipment will be necessary to retrieve it. Jonathan Yerushalmy has taken a look at the surface vessels and the underwater robots being used in the search and rescue operation. The US Coast Guard issued hand outs on Wednesday showing a visual depiction of the updated search patterns used in the ongoing search for the 21 foot submersible Titan. Rescuers intensify search as fears grow over Titan\u2019s remaining oxygen supply The search for a submersible that went missing during a dive to the wreck of Titanic has entered its fourth day, amid concerns the oxygen supply sustaining its five passengers is running dangerously low. Equipment from the US, Canada, UK and France is heading to the scene of the search, about 640km (400 miles) south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, joining an international coalition of rescue teams that is sweeping a vast expanse of the North Atlantic for the Titan after it went missing on Sunday, nearly two hours into its dive. Officials still hold out hope of a rescue. A US Coast Guard captain, Jamie Frederick, said on Wednesday: When you\u2019re in the middle of a search-and-rescue case, you always have hope. The search is focused on an area where underwater sounds have been heard but their origin remains a mystery. As of Wednesday night local time, remotely operated deep-sea vehicles (ROV) were heading to the site from Canada, the UK and France, the US Coast Guard said. For more on what we know so far about the search for the missing sub, read the full story by Graham Russell. Around the world, the story of the missing Titanic submersible and its rescue operation\u2019s race against time has been riveting onlookers. Views of the Titanic movie\u2019s Wikipedia page surged on Wednesday, according to data from movie analytics site FlixPatrol as others find themselves caught up in the tragedy of the situation. Erin Geary, a 27-year-old research assistant in Atlanta, Georgia, described feeling sad, anxious and mystified as she watched the rescue operation for the Titan submersible unfold. She said she and her father had gotten caught up imagining what survival tactics the five passengers might be resorting to. On social media sites on Wednesday, commentary ranged from despair at the Titan occupants\u2019 plight, to incredulity that anyone would want to embark on a risky mission in a small vessel. Some people expressed frustration that the tourist voyage had received such an expensive rescue operation while bigger boat tragedies with less prominent passengers, such as the deadly wreck of a fishing boat carrying hundreds of migrant passengers near Greece last week, failed to rally the same public outcry. In Boston, near the Coast Guard base that has been delivering public updates on the search, paralegal Jenna Roat said on Wednesday that she had been captivated by the rescue efforts along with her family and friends. - Reuters There are several possible scenarios for what may have happened to the Titan submersible. Ron Allum, a deep-sea engineer and explorer, told the Guardian he believed it was unlikely that the vessel\u2019s pressure hull had suffered a catastrophic failure: Sound travels particularly well underwater. A catastrophic implosion could be heard for thousands of miles and could be recorded. An implosion would likely trigger signals in military hydrophones, devices used in the world\u2019s oceans for recording or listening to underwater sounds. Allum said: To me it sounds like the sub\u2019s pressure hull is intact, but it\u2019s demobilised from power. In such an event, the Titan is likely to have automatically dropped release weights to resurface. Allum added: One of the reasons I suspect the sub may not be able to surface after dropping a release weight could be that it may be partially flooded \u2026 If you have water in the pressure hull, it\u2019s quite a large volume. The drop weights usually aren\u2019t that big, and that could be what\u2019s keeping it on the bottom. It also means that if the occupants are sitting in a half-flooded pressure hull, that could also be catastrophic. They could become hypothermic. I don\u2019t know how well the CO2 scrubber systems would work if they\u2019re wet. Hypothermia is a significant risk as the water temperature around the depth of the Titanic, at 3,800m below sea level, is around 0 to 1C. How long the Titan would take to retrieve if it is found depends on where and what state the vessel is in, Ron Allum, a deep-sea engineer and explorer, told the Guardian. Allum worked with James Cameron on his Last Mysteries of the Titanic live documentary in 2005, and Cameron\u2019s Deepsea Challenger expedition to reach Earth\u2019s deepest-known point in 2012. He said: If the pressure hull is flooded, you\u2019re now talking about the dry mass of a vessel. You could be lifting a very heavy weight. If the pressure hull is still intact \u2026 it\u2019s going to be much lighter. Submersibles are generally neutrally buoyant. If it were intact, an ROV [remotely operated vehicle] could attach to it and it could at least bring it up to shallower water where they could get a stronger lift cable to it to lift it out of the water. The ROV may have to work around the wreckage \u2026 it may take a few hours to release the sub from the sea floor. If the pressure hull was not flooded or hadn\u2019t suffered a catastrophic failure then an ROV could possibly lift it from the sea floor \u2013 that ascent may take an hour or two. I think you could get the sub out of the water in 12 hours or so. If there was a catastrophic failure and the pressure hull is flooded, it\u2019s going to be a different operation. There would be no race against time there because the occupants would not have survived. If the Titan has already surfaced and is found on the ocean, opening the pressure hatch and extracting the people onboard would also take time. Allum said: They are totally reliant on it being lifted out of the water either by their own launch and recovery mechanism or by another ship. That extraction process would take around an hour if a surface support ship was nearby, he estimated. Michael Guillen was the first correspondent to report live from the wreck of the Titanic but has recalled how the vessel he was on nearly ended up trapped. Dr Guillen was working as science editor for America\u2019s ABC network in 2000 when he travelled in a Russian submersible lowered from the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh research ship to tour the wreck. He told BBC Radio 4 how they toured the bow \u201cwhere everything had gone well\u201d before they headed over to the stern where the vessel became trapped in the \u201chuge\u201d propeller\u201d for an hour. As we approached the stern area - flying over what\u2019s called the debris field - we were caught up... in a very fast-moving underwater current. So we ended up getting stuck in the propeller. All of a sudden, there was just a crash. We just felt this collision, and all of sudden debris... just huge chunks, rusted chunks of the Titanic started falling on top of us. Dr Guillen said the pilot, who used to fly Russian Mig fighter jets, worked to jostle the submarine out \u201clike you get your truck, your car stuck in the mud\u201d. When it came lose, there was a feeling that the vessel was floating. We didn\u2019t want to say anything. I was like \u2018My gosh, is it possible that we are out of this?\u2019 Then I turned to Viktor, and I said: \u2018OK?\u2019 That was all. He only spoke broken English. And I\u2019ll never forget [how] he said this in a very low growling Russian accent: \u2018No problem.\u2019\u201d I breathed a sigh of relief. The passengers aboard the Titan are likely \u201cfreezing cold and very uncomfortable\u201d while the await rescue according to experts monitoring the situation. Retired Navy Captain David Marquet, a former submarine captain told CNN that the ambient temperature of the water around them made for a difficult environment for those five passengers aboard. They\u2019re freezing cold. The water entirely surrounding the ship is at freezing or slightly below. When they exhale, their breath condenses. There\u2019s frost on the inside of the parts of the submarine. They\u2019re all huddled together trying to conserve their body heat. They\u2019re running low on oxygen and they\u2019re exhaling carbon dioxide. Captain Marquet also said the passengers on board will be trying to keep very still and calm to control their breathing for \u201cas long as possible\u201d to give rescuers the time they need to find them. It\u2019s not a zero percent chance of recovering them. A British man who spent more than three days trapped in a vessel on the seabed said Wednesday he was \u201cvery frightened\u201d for those on board a submersible missing near the wreck of the Titanic. Roger Mallinson and Roger Chapman were saved in the deepest sub rescue in history after their small vessel became trapped on the Atlantic seabed off the coast of Ireland at a depth of 1,575 feet (480 metres) in 1973. Mallinson, now aged 85, said he had deep concerns for the five on board the missing Titanic submersible It sounds very, very dangerous, I\u2019m very frightened for them. If they are waiting to be rescued I think everyone wants to get into one area and make as much noise as they can. I can\u2019t understand how these people have been left abandoned out in the middle of the Atlantic without any communication, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Mallinson recalled feeling pessimistic during his own ordeal, saying that \u201conce everything goes wrong, it goes wrong, and everybody that comes down seems to do wrong.\u201d It was very stressful, very cold and you just had to try and keep warm, you didn\u2019t want to burn oxygen. You got dressed up properly. I had a big woolly jumper, so I got my woolly jumper on and then my overalls back on top. Roger Chapman didn\u2019t have a woolly jumper so we had a lot of white rags and we mummied him. Mallinson said he didn\u2019t feel relief until the hatch opened, and a pod of watchful dolphins had left. When the dolphins disappeared then you realised you\u2019re safe. They stayed with us the whole 84 hours, thousands of dolphins arrived to look after us, they knew there was a problem. You couldn\u2019t talk to the surface on the underwater phone because thousands of dolphins chattered every time you spoke. Former Royal Navy officer Chapman died in 2020, having been awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2006 for services to shipping. I\u2019ve lost my mate One wonderful thing was that when he died I was able to go to his funeral and play the organ for him. - AFP The search for the missing submersible off in the North Atlantic is raising legal questions about who might be responsible for any mishap. In the case of the Titan, passengers on board were asked to sign a waiver form that stressed the risk of death, however legal experts say this may not be enough to protect the company from liability. Speaking to MSNBC, Stanford University law professor Nora Freeman Engstrom said that a court may be open to setting aside the waiver. Rescue operations searching for the Titan submersible have focused their efforts on a remote area of the North Atlantic where a series of underwater noises have been detected. Noises were detected by Canadian P-3 aircraft on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, US Coast Guard officials said in a press conference this afternoon. Experts have not yet identified the source of these noises, and officials have warned the sounds may not have originated from the missing vessel. Analysis of the noises has been \u201cinconclusive\u201d, Coast Guard Capt Jamie Frederick said. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) searches have been deployed in the area where the P-3 aircraft recorded the noises, US Coast Guard officials said. The five passengers on board the missing Titan sub had 96 hours of breathable air, according to its operator OceanGate\u2019s specifications. This would mean oxygen could run out by Thursday morning, but experts say the air supply depends on a range of factors. More ships and underwater vessels are being brought in to join the search and rescue operations, US Coast Guard officials said. Three search vessels arrived on the scene on Wednesday, including one that has side-scanning sonar capabilities. The full scope of the search is twice the size of Connecticut and 2.5 miles (4km) deep, Capt Frederick said. Documents show that the sub\u2019s operator, OceanGate, had been warned there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way the experimental vessel was developed. David Lochridge, OceanGate\u2019s director of marine operations, said in a 2018 lawsuit that the company\u2019s testing and certification was insufficient and would \u201csubject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible\u201d. The disappearance of the submersible en route to the wreck of the Titanic has highlighted the businesses that offer extreme expeditions \u2013 and their clienteles. Among the five people on the missing Titan submersible are two billionaires \u2013 Hamish Harding, a 58-year-old businessman who made his fortune selling private jets and holds three Guinness world records for previous extreme trips, and the British-based Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, who is onboard with his 19-year-old son Suleman. A man who was on the Titan last year told Sky News that the submersible \u201cwas not safe\u201d. Speaking to the outlet, former passenger Arthur Loibl said that \u201ceverybody was nervous\u201d during the 2021 expedition to the Titanic wreck. \u2013 Guardian staff Per Reuters, Sean Leet, Horizon Maritime\u2019s chairman, said \u201call protocols were followed\u201d but did not specify how communication with the sub were cut off. \u201cThere\u2019s still life support available on the submersible, and we\u2019ll continue to hold out hope until the very end,\u201d Leet told reporters. Sal Mercogliano, a former merchant mariner, and maritime historian at Campbell University, tells New York Magazine that OceanGate wasn\u2019t \u201cbreaking the laws, but they\u2019re operating in a very gray area\u201d . He told the magazine\u2019s Clio Chang: The catch with OceanGate and the Titan was they were basically operating outside territorial waters \u2014 they\u2019re past the 12-mile limit, and they\u2019re launching off a Canadian vessel. There didn\u2019t appear to really be any sort of jurisdictions applying to this vessel. And so, the company wasn\u2019t required to undergo inspections to follow rules that apply to submersibles being operated in US waters. Read more here. The disappearance of the submersible en route to the wreck of the Titanic has highlighted the businesses that offer extreme expeditions \u2013 and their clienteles. Among the five people on the missing Titan submersible are two billionaires \u2013 Hamish Harding, a 58-year-old businessman who made his fortune selling private jets and holds three Guinness world records for previous extreme trips, and the British-based Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, who is onboard with his 19-year-old son Suleman. In an Instagram post on Saturday, Harding said that he would \u201cfinally\u201d begin the 12,500ft dive at 4am on Sunday morning and it was \u201clikely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023\u201d. It wasn\u2019t Harding\u2019s first trip to the bottom of the seas. He has already navigated to the deepest point in the world\u2019s oceans, the Mariana Trench, a depth of about 10,925 metres (36,000 feet) in the Pacific. Harding has also been up very high. Last year, he was one of six people onboard the fifth human flight of Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin New Shepard rocket that reached an apogee (height) of 351,000 ft (66 miles or 107 km) above earth. These adventures do not come cheap. Tickets for the Titanic submersible cost $250,000 (\u00a3195,000). The trip is organised by OceanGate, an exploration tourism company founded and run by Stockton Rush, an American multimillionaire. He is also missing, as is Paul Henri Nargeolet, the French deep-sea diver, who has visited the wreck site more than 30 times and is known as \u201cMr Titanic\u201d. A video advert for the trip says: \u201cThis is not a thrill ride for tourists, it is much more, it is an eight-day one-of-a kind experience.\u201d Read more: Here\u2019s a timeline of the past few days: Tuesday 2.50pm GMT/9am ET: France says it will help with search by deploying Atalante, a ship equipped with a deep-sea diving vessel. It is expected to arrive late on Wednesday. The Titan submersible is seen launching from a platform in an undated photo. During the day: Sounds detected over several hours by Canadian Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, equipped with gear to trace submarines. CNN and Rolling Stone magazine report banging sounds at 30-minute intervals had been detected. Wednesday US Coast Guard, US navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expeditions establish a unified command to handle the search. 6am GMT/1am ET: US Coast Guard confirms Canadian P-3 aircraft detected underwater noises. It says remotely operated vehicle (ROV) searches are directed to the area of the sounds and the data is also sent to US navy experts for analysis. Thursday 10am GMT/5am ET: Approximate deadline for when the air in the submersible will run out, based on the US Coast Guard\u2019s estimate that the Titan could have up to 96 hours of air supply from the time it was sealed. A friend of Hamish Harding, the British billionaire on board the missing submersible, has called Harding \u201can extremely logical guy.\u201d Speaking to Sky News, Chris Brown said, \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely logical guy, quite intellectual, I\u2019m quite sure he\u2019s going through all the possibilities. We don\u2019t know what the situation is\u2026 Whatever the situation is, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going through all the permutations, combinations of what could be done\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was him who came up with the knock every 30 minutes so that you can tell it\u2019s a human doing it rather than just pieces of metal banging together.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be a calming influence on the other guys down there because it\u2019s going to be everybody to keep calm and breathe as little as possible.\u201d A man who was on the Titan last year told Sky News that the submersible \u201cwas not safe.\u201d Speaking to the outlet, former passenger Arthur Loibl said that \u201ceverybody was nervous\u201d during the 2021 expedition to the Titanic wreck. Loibl went on to describe the cramped conditions of the vessel, saying, \u201cThere is no seat, you cannot stand, you cannot kneel, you only sit for 10 and a half hours. Our legs are like a crab, like a snake because it was so small, nothing was comfortable.\u201d He also added that the vessel was \u201cvery, very cold\u201d as the temperature outside the submersible was 4 degrees Celsius. When asked whether he felt that the submarine was safe, Loibl replied, \u201cNo, it was not safe.\u201d A new documentary on the missing submersible is set to air this week. On Wednesday, Variety reported that a new documentary is scheduled to air on the UK broadcaster Channel 5 on Thursday at 7pm local time. The ITN-produced documentary will be called: \u201cTitanic Sub: Lost at Sea\u201d and will be presented by host Dan Walker. \u201cThis program will chart everything from the exploration itself, to the rise of extreme tourism, to the rescue attempts, but above all it will tell a very human story that has captured the nation which is about 5 people, all with families, who are trapped at the bottom of the ocean. Our expertise and heritage in fast-turnaround documentaries and reputation for responsible filmmaking means we always treat such stories with great sensitivity,\u201d ITN\u2019s managing director for content Ian Rumsey said. Horizon Maritime, the Canadian company that co-owns the Polar Prince research vessel that launched the Titan sub, has released a statement following the press briefing. The company said it was working to \u201censure every possible effort is put into bringing people home\u201d. Shahzada Dawood, the British-Pakistani businessman on board the missing Titan sub, is an explorer whose expedition to the Titanic wreck followed a yearslong passion for science and discovery, his friends and family have said. Dawood, 48, who boarded the vessel with his 19-year-old son, Suleman, loves Star Trek and Star Wars, as well as sharing pictures of his faraway adventures, according to Ahsen Uddin Syed, a friend of Dawood who used to work with him at Engro Corporation, the chemicals-to-energy conglomerate where Dawood is the vice-chair. \u201cHe is an explorer,\u201d Syed told the New York Times. \u201cTraveling, science, are part of his DNA.\u201d Like his father, Suleman Dawood also loves science fiction, according to a statement from Engro. Here\u2019s a clip from the US Coast Guard\u2019s press briefing earlier today, where officials said rescue operations searching for the Titan submersible have focused their efforts on a remote area of the North Atlantic where a series of underwater noises have been detected. Horizon Maritime\u2019s chairman, Sean Leet, says his team is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the crew of the Polar Prince, the Titan sub\u2019s mothership on the surface that is also part of the search operation. He says the ship has been supporting Titanic expeditions for \u201cseveral years\u201d and that it will \u201cstay out until the search is completed\u201d. Rescue teams are \u201cvery well aware\u201d of the \u201ctime sensitivity\u201d around the search mission for the missing Titan sub, the Horizon chairman, Sean Leet, says. He says the North Atlantic Gulf is always a \u201cchallenging\u201d place but that the current weather conditions are \u201cnot overly significant\u201d. Leet says: The equipment that\u2019s been mobilised for this is the finest in the world, the most capable in the world. We have to hold on to hope. Horizon Maritime, the company that owns the support vessel Polar Prince, which took the Titan submersible out for the expedition on Sunday, is holding a news briefing from St John, Newfoundland. Horizon has mobilised the Polar Prince and the 94-metre Horizon Arctic to add vessel support for the search and rescue mission to find the missing sub, Sean Leet, Horizon\u2019s chairman, says. The marine industry in this region \u201cis no stranger to responding to difficult incident\u201d, he says. We work together to ensure every possible effort is put into bringing people all the people on board. We care deeply about their wellbeing. All of us here in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, the United States and around the world are unified in this work. He says it has been a \u201cdifficult few days\u201d for the crew on board the Titan sub and the Polar Prince. Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Rescue operations searching for the Titan submersible have focused their efforts on a remote area of the North Atlantic where a series of underwater noises have been detected. Noises were detected by Canadian P-3 aircraft on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, US Coast Guard officials said in a press conference this afternoon. Experts have not yet identified the source of these noises, and officials have warned the sounds may not have originated from the missing vessel. Analysis of the noises has been \u201cinconclusive\u201d, Coast Guard Capt Jamie Frederick said. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) searches have been deployed in the area where the P-3 aircraft recorded the noises, US Coast Guard officials said. The five passengers on board the missing Titan sub had 96 hours of breathable air, according to its operator OceanGate\u2019s specifications. This would mean oxygen could run out by Thursday morning, but experts say the air supply depends on a range of factors. More ships and underwater vessels are being brought in to join the search and rescue operations, US Coast Guard officials said. Three search vessels arrived on the scene on Wednesday, including one that has side-scanning sonar capabilities. The full scope of the search is twice the size of Connecticut and 2 1/2 miles (4km) deep, Capt Frederick said. Documents show that the sub\u2019s operator, OceanGate, had been warned there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way the experimental vessel was developed. David Lochridge, OceanGate\u2019s director of marine operations, said in a 2018 lawsuit that the company\u2019s testing and certification was insufficient and would \u201csubject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible\u201d. Recovering the missing Titan submersible and bringing its crew to safety in time using the latest advanced deep-sea rescue equipment would be an extremely difficult task, an expert has said. Even if Titan is located, a successful rescue would require remote-controlled vehicles (ROVs) capable of allowing operators on the surface a clear view of the submersible\u2019s location, any obstacles that may be present and where to attach cables capable of lifting it thousands of metres through the water. If the Titan and its five-person crew did arrive at the Titanic wreck, they will be located 3,800 metres (12,500ft) below the surface on the seabed \u2013 too deep for most ROVs to reach. Only a \u201ctiny percentage of the world\u2019s submarines operate that deeply\u201d, David Marquet, a former US Navy submarine commander, told CBC. Read the full story here: Capt Jamie Frederick of the US Coast Guard says we \u201chave to remain optimistic and hopeful\u201d while the team is conducting a search and rescue operation. The Coast Guard carry out search and rescue cases on a daily basis \u201cand sometimes we don\u2019t find what we\u2019re looking for\u201d, he says. There are a lot of factors you have to consider. After considering all those factors, sometimes you\u2019re in a position where you have to make a tough decision. We\u2019re not there yet. If we continue to search, potentially we could be at that point ... That\u2019s a discussion we will have with the families long before I am going to discuss here publicly. The US Coast Guard\u2019s Capt Jamie Frederick says it is his understanding that \u201cnoises\u201d were heard yesterday and this morning. Carl Hartsfield of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution says it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to discern what the sources of the noises heard by the Canadian P-3 aircraft are. He says there have been \u201cmultiple reports\u201d of noises \u201cand every one of those noises is being analysed, tracked, looked for patterns and reported upon\u201d. The noises \u201chave been described as banging noises\u201d, Hartsfield says, but acoustic analysts \u201chave to put the whole picture together in context and they have to eliminate potential man-made sources\u201d. There are some \u201climited rations\u201d of food and water on the Titan sub, the US Coast Guard\u2019s Capt Jamie Frederick says. I can\u2019t tell you exactly how much they have on board, but they do have some limited rations aboard. Capt Frederick says \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d what the noises that have been heard in the area of the site are, but that there is always hope in a search and rescue case. The good news, what I can tell you, is that we\u2019re searching in the area where the noises were detected, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. He says data from the Canadian P-3 aircraft has been shared with US Navy experts for further analysis \u201cwhich will be considered in future search plans\u201d. The unified command team is working \u201ctirelessly\u201d in response to this \u201cincredibly complex\u201d search operation to find the missing Titan sub, Capt Frederick says. He says that the team are in close contact with the family members of the five crew members on board the sub. The team currently has five surface assets searching for the sub and expects to have a total of 10 surface assets searching in the next 24 to 48 hours, he says. The surface search is now approximately two times the size of Connecticut and the subsurface search is up to two and a half miles deep, he says. Capt Jamie Frederick of the US Coast Guard has started speaking at a news conference in Boston. The US Coast Guard will hold a press briefing to discuss the latest on the search for the missing Titan submersible at 1pm local time (6pm BST). Capt Jamie Frederick will lead the press conference. We will be covering it live on the blog. You\u2019ll also be able to stream it live at the top of the page. David Marquet, a retired US Navy captain, said OceanGate may have gone \u201ca little too far\u201d with launching submersible carrying five people to the wreck of the Titanic. In an interview with the BBC, Marquet said he admired \u201cthe innovative spirit\u201d of the company behind the vessel now missing hundreds of miles off the Newfoundland coast. \u201cSometimes we push the bounds and innovation gets ahead of where regulation is,\u201d he said. He added: But when you\u2019re putting people down at 13,000ft, the laws of Mother Nature are gonna take over. So I think they might have gone a little too far. I admire the spirit, but we know from years of safe submarines, what it takes. All the discipline, the rigour of the operational testing, the operational risk mitigation that you have to do to maintain submarine safe. The Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco in Toronto and Spoorthy Raman in St John\u2019s have spoken to people in the town where the Titan submersible set off on Friday. They write: St John\u2019s, Canada\u2019s easternmost city in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, remains the closest city to the liner\u2019s final resting place and has become the launching site for expeditions traveling to the wreck site, nearly 400 miles (650km) away \u2013 and more than 12,000ft (3,800 metres) below the surface of the ocean. On Tuesday, the city, known for its brightly coloured \u201cbiscuit box\u201d houses, was blanketed in a thick haze of fog and rain as residents made sense of the news. \u201cTo hear that there are people in distress possibly and not knowing where they are and if we\u2019re ever going to find them \u2026 it\u2019s heart-wrenching,\u201d said Anne Simmons, operations manager at a local tour company. \u201cThe whole world is watching because it\u2019s the Titanic. Everybody knows about it.\u201d Here is their full dispatch: Here\u2019s more from R Adm John Mauger, of the US Coast Guard, who said rescue efforts are prioritising both surface and sub-surface searches for the missing sub. Mauger, speaking to BBC News, said: This has been a very complex and difficult case for all of us but as we continue to actively search for the submersible and the people onboard our thoughts are with the crew members and their families who, I can imagine, are having a very difficult time at this point. He added: We have two vessels, two remote-operated vessels, a remote-operated vehicle conducting a sub-surface search, and we have an aircraft and surface vessels which are conducting the surface search at this moment. The crew of the submersible Titan may have less than 20 hours of breathable air remaining, if they are still alive, a US Coast Guard official has said. R Adm John Mauger, speaking to BBC News, said it is hard to determine exactly how long they have, due to various factors. The 20 hour estimate is based on an initial estimate that said the vessel had a 96-hour supply of oxygen. The veteran Titanic diver Joe MacInnis has just been speaking on CNN about the banging heard from the Titan search site overnight. He says it\u2019s a \u201csign of hope\u201d: It\u2019s an indication, possibly, of human activity that is coordinated. And this is the kind of thing that we hope [for]. We\u2019re all engaged in this kind of collective imagination, what\u2019s going on down there? We\u2019re beset with fear and sadness and hope and uncertainty. But these sounds have given us a sense of hope. And let\u2019s hope that we can solve this problem before the oxygen runs out. We haven\u2019t got much time left. The Canadian explorer MacInnis is one of the biggest and most respected names in Titanic folklore, having been an integral part of Robert Ballard\u2019s 1985 expedition that discovered the wreck of the doomed ocean liner 12,500ft below the surface of the Atlantic. Earlier this week he spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco about the search operation for the missing submersible Titan. Read the interview here: The US coast guard has released an updated weather on scene in the Titan sub search area, where gusty winds of up to 23mph and wave heights up to 7ft are possible. The French ship Atalante, carrying a robot that can dive to 20,000ft (6,000 metres) underwater, is expected to arrive late today to join the search operation for the missing sub. The unmanned robot, called Victor 6000, can dive deeper than other equipment now at the site in the North Atlantic and has arms that can be remotely controlled to cut cables or perform other manoeuvres to release a stuck vessel, Reuters reported, citing the robot\u2019s operator, Ifremer. Victor \u201cis not capable of lifting the submarine on its own\u201d but it can help hook the Titan sub to a ship with the capacity to lift it to the surface, Ifremer\u2019s head of naval operations, Olivier Lefort, said. Victor is able to do visual exploration with all the video equipment it has. It is also equipped with manipulating arms which could be used to extricate the sub, such as by sectioning cables or things that would be blocking it at the bottom. He said the 25-strong crew required to operate the robot \u201ccan work non-stop for up to 72 hours\u201d once it reaches the site. He added: We don\u2019t know what happened. The noises that were heard give us hope the submarine is on the seabed and that people are still alive, but other scenarios are possible. Even if hope is slim, we\u2019ll go all the way. Magellan, an international exploration company that digitally mapped the Titanic wreckage last year, has said it is \u201cready to support\u201d the search for the missing submersible. The British firm, which specialises in deep ocean investigations and recovery operations, said on its website that it was contacted by the sub\u2019s operator, OceanGate, on Monday and \u201cimmediately offered our knowledge of the specific site and also our expertise operating at depth considerably in advance of what is required for this incident\u201d. A statement by Magellan said: We have been working full-time with UK and US agencies to secure the necessary air support to move our specialist equipment and support crew. It was previously reported that US authorities had failed to give Magellan the necessary permits to participate in the search. The Telegraph reported that a team of deepwater specialists had been waiting to leave an airport in the Channel Islands since Monday evening, but that US officials had indicated that they would prefer to use a New York-based vessel instead. When asked for comment about these reports, Magellan told ABC News it \u201cdoes not wish to comment on any specific media report\u201d. The five passengers on board the missing submersible have less than 24 hours of air supply left \u2013 if they are still alive. The Titan vessel has 96 hours of air supply, according to its specifications. On Tuesday at about 17.00 GMT, the US Coast Guard said the Titan sub had enough air for 41 hours, which would mean a deadline of roughly 10.00 GMT on Thursday. Those inside the sub will be \u201cresting, breathing as little as possible, and trying to keep calm\u201d in order to conserve energy, Joe MacInnis, who has made two trips to the wreck of the Titanic, told CNN earlier today. OceanGate, the company that operates the sub, has not commented on conditions and provisions on the Titan, the BBC reports. But based on the accounts of those who have previously been inside the vessel, there will have been food and water available. Mike Reiss, a producer and writer for The Simpsons, boarded the Titan vessel last summer. Sandwiches and water were available on the sub, but he recalled being told that many passengers did not eat during the journey, and that the rudimentary toilet on board had never been used, the New York Times reported. CBS News correspondent David Pogue went on the OceanGate Titan in November, and compared the sub to being in a \u201cminivan without seats\u201d. In an interview with NPR, Pogue said: There really is no safety gear in there except for a fire extinguisher and fire masks, which we practised putting on and taking off. That\u2019s pretty much it, because there\u2019s not much you can do if something goes wrong. Images from OceanGate show a vessel measuring 6.7 x 2.8 x 2.5 metres, where only one passenger can stretch their legs out at one time. As the Guardian\u2019s science editor Ian Sample points out, if the Titan has surfaced, the danger for the crew is not over: the hatch appears to be bolted from the outside, meaning those inside will still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe. Three vessels have arrived on the scene to join the rescue operation, the US Coast Guard has said. Among them are the Canadian Coast Guard\u2019s scientific research vessel, the John Cabot, which has sonar search capabilities, the Canadian Atlantic Merlin and subsea support vessel Skandi Vinland. Shortly after sunrise on Friday, a hulking icebreaker departed the protected waters of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, and ventured into the unpredictable vastness of the north Atlantic Ocean. Onboard the ship was an array of scientific monitoring equipment, cameras and a sleek, 22ft-long submersible, named Titan. The passengers onboard the chartered Polar Prince vessel were excited at the prospect of reaching the final resting site of the RMS Titanic, even if it meant cramming themselves inside the hollow body of Titan. But the small carbon fibre craft disappeared on Sunday, nearly two hours after it dipped below the surface, en route to the remains of the sunken ocean liner. The disappearance has prompted a frantic international search, with both Canada and the US marshalling all available resources in a race against time. The Titanic never reached its destination of New York City. But along the east coast of Canada, the legacy of the doomed ship still looms large more than a century after it sank. More than 120 victims of the disaster are buried in the Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the time the city nearest to the sinking with rail and shipping connections. The city\u2019s Museum of the Atlantic showcases artefacts from the ship, including a deck chair, personal effects and wreckage, as well as the white canvas mortuary bags used for the victims. St John\u2019s, Canada\u2019s easternmost city in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, remains the closest city to the liner\u2019s final resting place and has become the launching site for expeditions travelling to the wreck site, nearly 400 miles (650km) away \u2013 and more than 12,000 feet (3,800 meters) below the surface of the ocean. On Tuesday, the city, known for its brightly coloured \u201cbiscuit box\u201d houses, was blanketed in a thick haze of fog and rain as residents made sense of the news. Read the full story by Leyland Cecco and Spoorthy Raman here: History has shown that attempts to rescue stricken submarines do not always end well, nonetheless those trying save the crew and passengers on board OceanGate\u2019s Titan sub may take inspiration from the successful rescue of two British submariners 50 years ago, whose tiny vessel was raised from the depths of nearly 1,600ft, 150 miles off Ireland. The two men were aboard the Pisces III, a 6ft-diameter deep-sea submersible that had been laying transatlantic telephone cable on the Atlantic seabed, off the coast of Cork. Having got into difficulties, the Pisces III plunged nearly 1,600ft (500 metres), where it lay for three days. Above it, a desperate sea rescue operation was in full swing to get to pilot Roger Chapman and engineer/pilot Roger Mallinson in time. The rescuers got to the men just as the sub had 12 minutes of oxygen left in its cylinders. The mission to save the two submariners captivated the world, here\u2019s how the Observer covered the successful conclusion to the rescue in September 1973. Sabrina Dawood, whose brother Shahzada Dawood is aboard the Titan sub with his 19-year-old son Suleman, has said the family\u2019s \u201csole focus\u201d is on the search and rescue efforts. In a statement to Sky News, she said: May Shahzada and Suleman return to us safe and sound. We are sure they would be as moved as we are by the support of the global community during this period of difficulty. She asked that the family would be granted privacy \u201cas we deal with this crisis\u201d. Reports that rescuers searching for the Titan have detected noises in the area where it went missing could suggest the submersible is at the surface, a submarine search and rescue expert has said. Frank Owen said his \u201cconfidence went up by an order of magnitude\u201d when he heard reports of banging being detected by floating sound detectors. He told the BBC: There\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, onboard this craft is a retired French navy diver. He would know the protocol for trying to alert searching forces \u2026 on the hour and the half hour you bang like hell for three minutes. The sound signal being picked up by a buoy close to the surface could mean the sub itself is near or at the surface, he added. Below about 180 metres, the water temperature drops very rapidly. That creates a layer that the [sonar signal] bounces off. But if you\u2019re in the same depth water it tends to go quite straight. Our video team has compiled a report on the latest footage and Coast Guard information from the search: Reuters has published a timeline of the Titan\u2019s voyage, starting on Friday when it set off: Friday: expedition sets off from St John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada. Saturday: British billionaire and adventurer Hamish Harding, one of those onboard the submersible, posts on Facebook: \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.\u201d Sunday 08.00 GMT: Time the submersible originally aimed to start its descent, according to a post by Harding on Instagram. It actually started its descent later, according to the US Coast Guard. 12.00 GMT: The submersible starts what should be a two-hour descent to the Titanic wreck, nearly 4,000 metres down, according to the US Coast Guard. 13.45 GMT: Communications between the submersible and the surface vessel are lost 1 hour and 45 minutes after starting its descent. 19.00 GMT: Titan is scheduled to return to the surface, the US Coast Guard says but fails to appear. 21.40 GMT: Coast Guard receives report about an overdue submersible from the research vessel Polar Prince about 900 nautical miles east of Cape Cod on the US coast. Monday: US and Canadian ships and planes are swarming the area, some dropping sonar buoys that can monitor to a depth of almost 4,000 metres, US Coast Guard R Adm John Mauger says. Officials have also asked commercial vessels for help. Tuesday: 14.50 GMT France says it will help with search by deploying Atalante, a ship equipped with a deep-sea diving vessel. It is expected to arrive late on Wednesday. During the day: Sounds detected over several hours by Canadian Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, equipped with gear to trace submarines. CNN and Rolling Stone magazine report banging sounds at 30-minute intervals had been detected. Wednesday: US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expeditions establish a unified command to handle the search. 06.00 GMT: US Coast Guard confirms Canadian P-3 aircraft detected underwater noises. It says remotely operated vehicle (ROV) searches are directed to the area of the sounds and the data is also sent to US Navy experts for analysis. Thursday: 10.00 GMT: Approximate deadline for when the air in the submersible will run out, based on the US Coast Guard\u2019s estimate that the Titan could have up to 96 hours of air supply from the time it was sealed. Detecting the Titan\u2019s exact location will be a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d, Dr Jamie Pringle, a reader in forensic geosciences at Keele University, has told Sky News. Pringle said the area of the Atlantic floor is \u201creally remote\u201d and the submersible is very small. \u201cIt might be nice and flat and be sitting proudly on top, which would be great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be partially submerged, and of course, there\u2019s lots of submarine canyons and submarine seamounts \u2026 Those issues are very difficult.\u201d He added that the vessel\u2019s loss of contact suggested there had been an electrical problem, so it would probably be \u201cvery cold [and] very dark\u201d inside the craft. \u201cThey were only meant to be going down for eight hours, I believe \u2013 this many days is going to be difficult,\u201d he said. R Adm John Mauger of the US Coast Guard, who is heading the search for the Titan, has told CBS News it is a complex operation and an international effort. Mauger confirmed an aircraft had detected noise in the water picked up by sonar buoys on Tuesday, but said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the source of that noise.\u201d He said there were a lot of metal objects at the site of the Titanic wreck, which could be where the noise was coming from. Mauger added that the search operation would continue \u201cas long as there\u2019s an opportunity for survival\u201d and that more vessels would be arriving at the site to join it, the BBC reported. The latest official update on the search operation was several hours ago. The US Coast Guard tweeted that a Canadian P-3 aircraft had \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area\u201d and that ROV (remote operated vehicle) operations had been \u201crelocated in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises\u201d. Those ROV searches had \u201cyielded negative results but continue\u201d, the coastguard said, adding that the data from the aircraft had been \u201cshared with US Navy experts for further analysis which will be considered in future search plans\u201d. Estimates suggest as little as a day\u2019s worth of oxygen could be left if the vessel is still functioning. It is unclear whether or how rescue teams could reach the submersible if it is on the ocean floor. However, some experts have suggested the fact that a sonar buoy relatively close to the sea\u2019s surface picked up the banging noises could mean the Titan is not too deep. Joe MacInnis, who has made two trips to the wreck of the Titanic, has said Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of the five onboard the submersible, is an \u201cextraordinary leader\u201d in a crisis. \u201cHe\u2019s been in all kinds of problematic situations and he\u2019s resolved them \u2026 He\u2019s the guy you want next to your side in this kind of situation,\u201d MacInnis told CNN. He said the five would be: \u2026 conserving energy. Resting, breathing as little as possible, and trying to keep calm. That is the most important thing.\u201d The three biggest risks for a deep ocean dive were fire, hull failure and getting entangled in a wreck, MacInnis said, adding that news that a Canadian plane had detected banging noises was heartening: We\u2019re all caught in this swirl of emotions from sadness to hope, fear, uncertainty \u2026 There\u2019s some possible promise in what we\u2019ve just heard. Here are some undated photographs of the Titan submersible and its interior provided by its operator, OceanGate Expeditions: At least five vessels are now at the Titanic wreck site, Sky News has reported, with four more underway but unlikely to reach the area on Wednesday. Sky said marine tracking data showed the research vessel Polar Prince, the Titan submersible\u2019s \u201cmother ship\u201d, was at the site, along with a Bahamian pipe-laying vessel, Deep Energy, and a commercial Vessel, Skandi Vinland. The Canadian coastguard vessels John Cabot and Atlantic Merlin arrived overnight, while the French research craft L\u2019Atalante \u2013 carrying a deep-sea diving robot submersible \u2013 should reach the scene in the evening. Four others, including two more Canadian coastguard vessels, a Canadian navy ship and a private offshore support vessel, looked unlikely to arrive until Thursday, Sky said. An oceanographer has told the BBC the underwater noises give hope that those on board are still alive. \u201cThere are plenty of sound sources in the ocean, but it does give hope,\u201d Simon Boxall, a senior lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told the World Service. \u201cI think one of the scenarios that everyone feared was that the submersible had basically imploded. So it does give some hope that this is still a rescue operation, rather than just a recovery operation.\u201d Here is the latest on the search from the Associated Press: A Canadian military surveillance aircraft detected underwater noises as a massive search continued on Wednesday in a remote part of the North Atlantic for a submersible that vanished while taking five people down to the wreck of the Titanic. A statement from the US Coast Guard did not elaborate on what rescuers believed the noises could be, though it offered a glimmer of hope for those lost abroad the Titan as estimates suggest as little as a day\u2019s worth of oxygen could be left if the vessel is still functioning. Meanwhile, questions remain about how teams could reach the lost submersible, which could be as deep as about 12,500ft (3,800 metres) below the surface. Newly uncovered allegations also suggest there had been significant warnings made about vessel safety during its development. The Coast Guard said a Canadian P-3 Orion had \u201cdetected underwater noises in the search area\u201d. Searchers then moved an underwater robot to that area to search. However, those searches \u201chave yielded negative results but continue\u201d. \u201cThe data from the P-3 aircraft has been shared with our US Navy experts for further analysis which will be considered in future search plans,\u201d the Coast Guard said. Rolling Stone magazine, citing what it described as internal US Department of Homeland Security emails on the search, said that teams heard \u201cbanging sounds in the area every 30 minutes\u201d. Underwater sounds can come from a variety of sources but the reports have sparked hope in some, including Richard Garriott de Cayeux, the president of the Explorers Club who said it had \u201cmuch greater confidence\u201d now after speaking to officials in Congress, the US military and the White House. OceanGate has described the Titan as \u201cthe largest of any deep diving submersible\u201d with an \u201cunparalleled safety feature\u201d that assesses the integrity of the hull throughout every dive. Made of titanium and filament wound carbon fiber, the sub is less than 7 metres long and weighs 9,072kg in the air but is ballasted to be neutrally buoyant once it reaches the seafloor, the company says. It is capable of diving 4km (2.4 miles) \u201cwith a comfortable safety margin\u201d, according to court documents filed by the company in April. The Titan is intended to only hold five people for a one-day expedition: two hours to reach the Titanic, a few hours exploring the wreck, then a two-hour trip back up. Video recorded last year by CBS shows a small chamber with about as much space inside as a minivan, no seating, and passengers sitting on the floor. Two Britons who have visited the wreck of the Titanic have expressed confidence in the submersible\u2019s crew and said there is a chance they will be recovered. Dik Barton, the first British diver to see the Titanic wreck, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain it a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d place to be and he \u201c100%\u201d felt in danger during previous expeditions. \u201cThere\u2019s a local ebb and current of water which moves around, it\u2019s not consistent,\u201d Barton said. \u201cThe strength of the submersible is relatively limited. The thrusters are quite strong but, at the end of the day, you have to conserve your power because it\u2019s your life support system and navigation system.\u201d Barton said he was with Paul-Henry Nargeolet, reported to be on board the Titan, calling him \u201can extremely capable submersible operator pilot\u201d who had been down to the wreck 37 times. \u201cI have enormous respect for him and his ability, and, quite frankly, if there\u2019s anybody I\u2019d ever want to be in a position, God forbid, in this circumstance then it would be [Paul-Henry]. Oisin Fanning told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he had also been on the submersible with Nargeolet and OceanGate\u2019s chief executive and founder Stockton Rush. \u201cThe two guys on the sub currently, so Paul and Stockton, are both consummate professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, to be honest, if I was in trouble, I\u2019d want to be on a sub with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThey will be conserving energy from day one. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the oxygen lasts a lot longer because they\u2019ll know exactly what to do \u2026 I think there is a very good chance they will be found. These are not fly-by-nighters, these are very highly professional people.\u201d A major search and rescue operation is under way for the Titan. Here is what we know so far: The US Coast Guard, US Navy and Canadian Coast Guard are coordinating the search with input from OceanGate, the submersible\u2019s operator. Deep Energy, a pipe-laying vessel with underwater capabilities, and Polar Prince, the vessel the Titan launched from, are on the scene. Other craft, including a Canadian vessel with a mobile decompression chamber and the French research ship Atalante, which has an underwater robot that can descend to 4,000 metres, are en route. The US Navy is sending a Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System, designed to recover heavy undersea objects such as aircraft or small vessels, and the US military is sending unspecified assets. Two US C-130 aircraft are providing air support and carrying out search and rescue flights, as well as two Canadian planes. ROVs (remote operated underwater vehicles) from the British company Magellan, which specialises in deep ocean investigations, imaging and recovery operations, have been offered but are mostly in Europe so would take time to reach the area. Here are brief profiles of the five people onboard the Titan, courtesy of the Associated Press: Stockton Rush founded OceanGate Inc in 2009 to provide crewed submersibles for undersea researchers and explorers. He is the vessel\u2019s pilot and has a background in aerospace and technology. In an interview with CBS last year, Rush defended the safety of his sub but said nothing is without risk. \u201cWhat I worry about most are things that will stop me from being able to get to the surface \u2013 overhangs, fish nets, entanglement hazard,\u201d he said. Described as \u201ca real pioneer\u201d and \u201ca risk-taker\u201d by friends, at 19 Rush became the youngest jet transport rated pilot in the world in 1981, and flew commercial jets in college, according to his company biography. Hamish Harding lives in Dubai in the UAE. He is a billionaire adventurer who holds three Guinness world records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. In March 2021, he and ocean explorer Victor Vescovo dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench. In June 2022, he went into space on Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket. In a Facebook post on Saturday, Harding said he was \u201cproud\u201d to be part of the Titan mission to the Titanic. Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, father and son, are members of one of Pakistan\u2019s most prominent families. Their firm, Dawood Hercules Corp, based in Karachi, is involved in agriculture, petrochemicals and telecommunication infrastructure. Shahzada Dawood also is on the board of trustees for the California-based SETI Institute, which searches for extraterrestrial intelligence, and a member of the global advisory board at the Prince\u2019s Trust International, founded by King Charles III to address youth unemployment. Paul-Henri Nargeolet is a former French navy officer who is considered a Titanic expert after making multiple trips to the wreckage over several decades. He is director of underwater research for E/M Group and RMS Titanic Inc, has completed 37 dives to the wreck and supervised the recovery of 5,000 artefacts, according to his company profile. He led the first recovery expedition to the Titanic in 1987 while with the French Institute for Research and Exploitation of the Sea, and was expedition leader on the most technologically advanced dive to wreck in 2010, using high-resolution sonar and 3D optical imaging. The Titan could be in extremely deep water: the wreck of the Titanic, where the submersible with its five passengers was heading, has lain on the seabed at a depth of 3,800 metres since the liner struck an iceberg and sank in 1912. Search teams have detected underwater sounds, the US Coast Guard has said, as the clock ticked down to the last 24 hours of the craft\u2019s presumed oxygen supply. Canadian aircraft detected the sounds, the Coast Guard said. Robotic undersea search operations have been diverted to the area but there was still no tangible sign of the Titan, it added. OceanGate Expeditions, which operates the Titan, was repeatedly warned that there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way it was developed, the Associated Press has reported. The undersea exploration company, based in Everett, Washington, has been making yearly voyages to the Titanic since 2021. David Lochridge, OceanGate\u2019s director of marine operations, wrote an engineering report in 2018 that said the craft under development needed more testing and that passengers might be endangered when it reached \u201cextreme depths,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed that year in the US district court in Seattle. OceanGate sued Lochridge that year, accusing him of breaching a non-disclosure agreement, and he filed a counterclaim alleging that he was wrongfully fired for raising questions about testing and safety. The case settled on undisclosed terms several months after it was filed. Lochridge\u2019s concerns mainly focused on the company\u2019s decision to rely on sensitive acoustic monitoring \u2013 cracking or popping sounds made by the hull under pressure \u2013 to detect flaws, rather than a scan of the hull. Lochridge said the company told him no equipment existed that could perform such a test on the 5in-thick (12.7cm-thick) carbon-fiber hull. \u201cThis was problematic because this type of acoustic analysis would only show when a component is about to fail \u2013 often milliseconds before an implosion \u2013 and would not detect any existing flaws prior to putting pressure on to the hull,\u201d Lochridge\u2019s counterclaim said. Further, the craft was designed to reach depths of 4,000 meters (13,123ft), where the Titanic rested. But, according to Lochridge, the passenger viewport was only certified for depths of up to 1,300 metres (4,265ft), and OceanGate would not pay for the manufacturer to build a viewport certified for 4,000 metres. OceanGate\u2019s choices would \u201csubject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible,\u201d the counterclaim said. However, the company said in its complaint that Lochridge \u201cis not an engineer and was not hired or asked to perform engineering services on the Titan\u201d. Here\u2019s a recap of developments overnight: Underwater noises have been detected by a Canadian aircraft in the search area for the missing submersible, according to the US Coast Guard. Searches yielded negative results but will continue. The data has been shared with the US Navy experts for further analysis, the Coast Guard said. Search crews have heard banging sounds at 30-minute intervals, according to US media. CNN and Rolling Stone cited internal government memos saying banging had been detected, and reported that after additional devices were deployed four hours later, noises were still heard. The memos did not clarify when on Tuesday the banging was heard, or for how long. The Explorers Club, of which two passengers in the missing sub are members, says there is \u201ccause for hope\u201d based on field data, asserting that \u201clikely signs of life have been detected at the site\u201d. The submersible\u2019s hatch appears to be bolted from the outside. So even if the sub has surfaced and is spotted by search operations, the danger is not over, as the crew inside would still need to rely on emergency oxygen to breathe until the hatch is opened by rescue teams. The Titan crew is estimated to be down to about 30 hours of breathable air. Ten hours ago, Coast Guard officials said the crew of the missing submersible had about 40 hours of breathable air left. So far, more than 25,900 sq km of sea has been searched by aircraft for the missing vessel \u2013 part of a unified command of aircraft and ships of the US Coast Guard, US Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and OceanGate Expedition. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the search for the submersible vessel Titan that went missing during a voyage to the wreck of the Titanic with five people onboard. Rescue teams are continuing the search for the OceanGate Expeditions tourist submersible, which was reported overdue on Sunday evening about 435 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Those onboard Titan are believed to be British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58; Pakistani-born businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, with his 19-year-old son Suleman, who are both British citizens; French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77; and Stockton Rush, founder and CEO of OceanGate Expeditions. Authorities have not confirmed the identity of any passenger. On Tuesday, officials estimated the five people onboard had about 40 hours of breathable air remaining. We\u2019ll bring you updates on the search as they happen."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f80", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/journalists-received-legal-threats-from-bravus-formerly-adani-carmichael-coal-mine-site-parliament-told", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Two journalists received legal threats from Bravus after travelling to Carmichael coal site, parliament told", "lead": "Matthew Abbott says he and another reporter were invited to meet Wangan and Jagalingou cultural custodians at the site where Bravus, formerly Adani, is mining", "author": "Christopher Knaus", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 05:01:05", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222499", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d54a39ad1af8694bfb1933b23fae1a44a1f8f5/0_0_1553_932/500.jpg", "body": "Two journalists who travelled to meet Indigenous elders at the Carmichael mine site were surveilled, threatened with a police complaint and warned they would face legal action if they published any material obtained during their visit, documents tabled in parliament allege. The award-winning photojournalist Matthew Abbott says he and a reporter from the Swiss-based NGO Public Eye last year travelled to meet with Wangan and Jagalingou cultural custodians to discuss their ceremonial reoccupation of the Carmichael mine site. In a statement tabled in the Senate on Wednesday, Abbott said that within minutes of arriving, a security vehicle with a video camera mounted on the seat drove past and filmed them. \u201cShortly afterwards they sent us a letter threatening us with legal action \u2013 with a warning to \u2018leave immediately\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not see this letter until well after my visit to the area.\u201d The letter said that Bravus, formerly known as Adani, had complained to Queensland police about their presence and that the company would seek damages if any material obtained during the trip was published. \u201cWe request that you and Mr Abbott leave Bravus\u2019 mining lease immediately and do not return, and that you or Public Eye do not publish any photographs, videos, or other material taken on or of our mining lease without our prior written consent,\u201d the letter said, according to Abbott\u2019s statement. The Wangan and Jagalingou custodians began reoccupying the land in August 2021, establishing a Waddananggu or \u201ctalking camp\u201d, inviting guests and holding ceremonies. Abbott said the custodians, who are aggrieved by the damage posed to their land, are on the site lawfully. \u201cAs journalists, my colleague Adria Budry Carbo and I were invited to visit the ceremony camp and learn about the concerns they share about the mine\u2019s impact on their homeland, but also to witness their connection to that Country, the place they call home,\u201d he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Abbott said Bravus had a history of using press council complaints and legal threats to intimidate journalists. He alleged that other journalists who had visited the site had received legal threats and subsequently not published. Public Eye did publish a piece from its reporting trip, despite the threats. \u201cI believe we have a problem when media outlets are intimidated to a point where they are self-censoring their stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does that say about our democracy, our culture of secrecy, that a litigious foreign-owned corporation can have so much influence in our press?\u201d The statement was tabled by Senator David Pocock on Wednesday. \u201cThese stories need to be heard,\u201d Pocock told the Senate. \u201cWhen one of our best photojournalists speaks out, we should all listen.\u201d In response, Bravus issued a statement alleging the reporters trespassed despite clear directions not to enter the site. It said it wholly rejected the claims aired by Pocock, describing them as \u201cembellished and incorrect\u201d. The company said it was contacted by a European-based journalist in 2022 seeking access to the Carmichael site for a story on \u201cthermal coal use in Switzerland\u201d. \u201cThe foreign journalist was advised, in writing, that Bravus did not provide its consent for him or for any other contractor engaged by him to visit or enter any part of the company\u2019s mining or pastoral leases,\u201d Bravus said in a statement. \u201cThe journalist and Mr Abbott chose to ignore that direction and instead chose to enter Bravus\u2019 Mining Lease in October 2022 without the authorisation of the owner of the land.\u201d Bravus said it wrote to the journalist requesting that he and Abbott did not publish material taken on the site without consent, something it said was what \u201cany other law-abiding business would do\u201d. \u201cWe welcome legitimate media and answer their questions almost daily, but we don\u2019t welcome trespassers.\u201d The company rejected an allegation that it used facial recognition software to identify Abbott.

We\u2019ve geared our lives around the low interest rates of the past 13 years. I am the only earner in the family. If interest rates hit 6%, I\u2019ll have to find an extra \u00a31,480 per month \u2013 well over double what we pay now. That is totally catastrophic for our family, absolutely terrifying.\u201d The UK is experiencing the sharpest, fastest rise in interest rates since the 1980s, and markets and homeowners are braced for another increase from the Bank of England on Thursday, with an increase of at least 0.25 percentage points from 4.5% expected. After more than a decade of rates at 0.75% or below, this has left many homeowners whose fixed deals are ending, and those on tracker mortgages, facing huge blows to their finances. Many of the people who have got in touch with the Guardian are young couples and families, who are often worse affected than older homeowners by the interest rate hikes because they have repaid smaller parts of their often relatively large mortgages. Steven, 52, and his wife have an interest-only mortgage. They bought their house 20 years ago, initially on an interest rate of 4.8%. \u201cBut over the years, we\u2019ve had to increase our mortgage for home improvements, and back then we had two incomes and no children,\u201d Steven says. \u201cWe have a \u00a3480,000 mortgage remaining, and will probably end up paying around \u00a319,000 extra per year just on interest. This is ruining people\u2019s lives.\u201d Steven considers the Bank\u2019s imminent decision to raise interest rates for the 13th time in a row a grave mistake, because millions of homeowners\u2019 mortgages are yet to be affected \u2013 thanks to the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages, struck during the ultra-low rates era, that have yet to expire. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that these rises are not having an immediate impact on inflation. People who are affected, however, are going through hell. Raising the base rate is an outdated, blunt tool totally unsuitable to fix this multidimensional, international problem. \u201cRate rises are fine in principle, but it\u2019s the unprecedented speed with which they have been raised, leaving no time for people to plan, to regear. I\u2019ve had to get myself a new job to pay for this, and only thanks to my new slightly larger salary we may not have to sell the house. These rate hikes are an inflationary measure in themselves, forcing people to go out and demand higher wages, after successive governments have encouraged home ownership for many years.\u201d Kirsty, a marketing professional, and her husband, a self-employed electrician, both 42, from Epsom in Surrey, earlier this month moved on to a new tracker mortgage at 0.34 percentage points above the base rate \u2013 in the hope that interest rates would fall in the coming months. \u201cIt was a gamble,\u201d Kirsty says. \u201cWe have two young daughters and are paying \u00a32,300 a month in nursery fees, so three years ago we took out an interest-only mortgage, which kept our monthly payments at \u00a3524. \u201cOur new monthly mortgage payment is \u00a31,600 \u2013 still just interest-only. Our rate has gone up twice since we\u2019ve taken it out and will now go up again. If things get worse we can switch, though for the moment we\u2019ll hold out. There\u2019s little point in switching when fixed deals are this bad.\u201d Should their interest repayments reach \u00a32,000 a month, the couple will struggle to pay, Kirsty says. \u201cOur mortgage and nursery fees are crippling us, and my husband and I both earn good incomes.\u201d James, 39, an insurance broker from north London, has been similarly caught out by rapidly rising interest rates, concluding that his best option is something he never dreamed he would be doing a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re going to exit home ownership completely for now. Our five-year fixed-term loan comes to an end in September. With these rates, our repayments would rise by over \u00a32,000 a month, from \u00a33,700 to something in the region of \u00a36,000. My wife and I are high earners but we have no option but to sell our house and go back to renting,\u201d he says. The couple will put their house, which they have been renovating for the past two years, on the market in a few weeks\u2019 time. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. We stress-tested ourselves up to about 4.5% interest when we took out this mortgage, but interest rates above 6% on a \u00a3950,000 mortgage would be totally unaffordable. We\u2019re likely to spend \u00a34,000 a month on rent now for a couple of years, but that\u2019s still cheaper than paying for a mortgage.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the sixth house I\u2019ve owned, and we certainly still believe in home ownership. But at the moment it\u2019s just too crazy. We\u2019d rather put our money into something other than property for now.\u201d Danny, 49, an IT consultant and father of two from East Molesey in Surrey, scrambled to get in touch with his mortgage broker after the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget last September, six months before his deal would have expired. \u201cOur monthly repayments were \u00a32,300. As rates started soaring, our broker was able to get us a five-year fixed deal at 3.6%, meaning we\u2019d \u2018only\u2019 be paying \u00a31,500 per month more, or \u00a318,000 extra a year. I recall my hand shaking and feeling nauseous until I clicked \u2018accept\u2019 and received the confirmation email that the deal had gone through. Later that day this rate was withdrawn, and they just kept going up and up. Although the mortgage is now 50% of our take-home pay, we\u2019re lucky: at 4% we\u2019d have been forced to sell.\u201d Danny says his mortgage adviser tried to get in touch with all his clients after the mini-budget to alert them all to a mortgage cost crisis that would devastate the finances of millions. \u201cHe told us people were in three categories: the ones that didn\u2019t return his call and didn\u2019t see it as important, the ones too shocked and paralysed to act, and the lucky ones \u2013 those who answered and acted promptly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just Liz Truss who we are angry at, it is the 70,000 Conservative party members who selected her, people who are mortgage free and living in the home counties \u2013 people who don\u2019t know and can\u2019t imagine this pain.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f82", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/gilbert-plass-scientist-raised-dangers-carbon-dioxide-climate-change", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The scientist who raised dangers of carbon dioxide in 1950s", "lead": "Physicist Gilbert Plass predicted climate change, blaming fossil fuels for rising temperatures", "author": "Jeremy Plester", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 05:00:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222537", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d2de8e6cc71ae1231871fb064a2a68a0810181d1/0_170_5100_3060/500.jpg", "body": "It\u2019s often assumed that most people in the 1950s were blissfully unaware of climate change, but in fact there were already alarm bells ringing.

Look at those people as they posed for the historic photographs. Look at their faces; wearied from a month of travel, etched with joy, hope, bewilderment and lurking stage left, just out of sight, foreboding. As the descendants of that Windrush generation, we get to look at those faces every day in the pictures of our own families that we hang on the walls and in our front rooms. They have the same posed smiles, the demeanour of all adventurers who smile at the outset of an uncertain journey. There were 492 of them and they knew they had to impress and account for themselves. The attire was pin-sharp, whatever could be said of them on arrival, it was not to be that they were slovenly. They knew enough to show that they came in peace. Some sang and exuded bonhomie for Path\u00e9 News, but others interviewed on the day sought to echo the self-effacement and deprecation they saw as essentially English. They made the best of it; but they didn\u2019t know much at all. They would have to learn much quickly in turbulent decades. Where would they live? Around 236 of the men would be bussed to the half light of an underground shelter under Clapham Common in south London. It was dark, a bit damp and cramped, as if they had transferred from a ship to the innards of a submarine. But it was English dry land, and proximity to a labour exchange brimming with postwar work offered the springboard that allowed many to rent rooms and buy homes in nearby Brixton, making it the unofficial black capital of Britain \u2013 and Europe. In time they would migrate to other big cities where work was available, Birmingham, Manchester \u2013 where dock and construction work could be found \u2013 and on to Leeds and Nottingham as well. But smiling on the dock, how could they have known about the No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs signs to come. The exploitative landlords; the fact that Peter Rachman, known as the worst of them \u2013 widely reviled, and rightly so, as king of slum landlords \u2013 would become a go-to guy because he at least was willing to let them live in his squalid accommodation, albeit at an extortionate cost. The rapacious exploiter as saviour. They took what they could get. They didn\u2019t know what lay ahead, and yet they prevailed. They rented rooms, worked hard and saved cash. My uncle, a contractor \u2013 a bit of a wheeler-dealer \u2013 helped guys find rooms, bought some houses, rented out more rooms. My dad, who arrived in 1953, stayed in one of them: part of the Caribbean-to-UK underground railroad, until he moved into his own place, and thanks to carpentry jobs, bought his own. Things moved fast. According to the Imperial War Museum, when the first US GIs arrived in Britain in 1942, there were thought to be between 8,000 and 10,000 black people in Britain, scattered mainly around the many ports. By 1958, as families grew, relatives left behind in the Caribbean were sent for and others, like my own father, came by sea and air to try their luck, 125,000 had arrived. They helped each other prevail. My dad ran the \u201cpardner\u201d, the unofficial savings scheme whereby a group of people threw money in the pot and at the end of the week, one of them received the total for their own use \u2013 seed capital for a house or for furniture. People would knock on the door and hand to me, barely a teenager, their contribution to pass on when Dad came home from work. When all the money was in, one of them would come back to collect it all, and bounce away smiling about the acquisition that would follow or the bill that could finally be paid. Sniffy, distrustful banks weren\u2019t an option, so they trusted each other. They came for employment, but what did they know about what would happen at work? Jobs were available and they were ready to graft, but their faces would fit one day and jar the next. There was no employment or discrimination law on the buses (until the 1960s, a colour bar pertained on Bristol\u2019s buses), or the trains or at Ford or on the building sites. Not until 1968 did the Race Relations Act render unlawful acts of discrimination in employment, housing and advertising. My dad was laid off from one building site because he drove a nicer car than the foreman, and made the mistake of parking it where the boss could see it. They prevailed, with a bit of help. No blacks, No Irish, said the signs and, for those so targeted, that forged camaraderie. Ruddy-faced Tom Norton worked alongside my dad on the building sites and would tell him of opportunities. One of those led Dad to Lambeth council in south London where he joined the direct labour organisation building homes and at the end of his working life, building Brixton Recreation Centre. Two decades later, when Dad retired in traction, having fallen off scaffolding into an as yet waterless pool, we visited him in hospital, and Tom Norton was there. Everything was new that first day. What did they know as the ship docked and the news cameras whirred, of how Britain would view their children? How so many in English schools would quickly be condemned by inevitability of geography and by bureaucratic design to the worst classes and over represented in the schools for those deemed educationally subnormal. That was a shock to those who saw the educational opportunities as the prize most worth having. Most thought a free British schooling system staffed by teachers, a highly respected breed in the Caribbean, would be the least of their worries. Instead those in London in 1967 found the proportion of their children diverted to ESN schools (28%) was almost double that in mainstream schools (15%). Prevailing on education remains an objective today \u2013 witness the statistics on race disparities within our schools system \u2013 but back then it took many forms. Saturday supplementary schools in draughty halls and churches campaigns by black teachers and activists and left-leaning institutions exposing the discrimination, and its terrible effects on those least able to navigate the system. The campaigns were macro and micro. My mother, armed with a bible and a food thermos, with children underfoot, staged a day-long sit-in directly outside our director of education\u2019s private office when my sister was allocated a lesser school than merited. The director hunkered down \u2013 for who was he to be challenged by a female immigrant, but she had stuff to eat and read, more patience than him and a deal of indignation. By day\u2019s end, the allocation was changed. It took cussedness to prevail. How could they ever have known at Tilbury dock that the prejudices of those who regretted their presence here would be conveyed by the forces of law and order? The stops, the searches, the Vagrancy Act 1824, known as the \u201csus law\u201d, which proved ideal for the targeting of black communities. Who could predict the over-surveillance, the under-protection, the flimsy arrests, the violence, the arbitrary raids. As a child, I returned home from playing football on a local street to see a row of police vans slowly turning the corner and entered our house to find it dishevelled, my parents angry and traumatised. There had been a very public drugs raid because the police detained someone and said \u201cgive us a name\u201d, and so he did, prompting a visit to our house, where all there was to uncover was domesticity and hymn books. We tidied up, we prevailed. And that\u2019s what I see when I look at those arrival pictures. Bright people, smart people, tough people, adaptable people. People who didn\u2019t know what awaited them but largely did what they intended to do when they bought their tickets: made a better life for themselves and those of us who follow. And I see a journey that at its end and through the years made this a better country. Their sweat and that of their descendants helped build our infrastructure \u2013 physical and social, their creativity infuses our politics, our industry, our arts and culture, our sport. They faced challenges and today, we their descendants face challenges and a country that has still to come to terms with its ambivalence. Consider the Windrush scandal. Consider this week\u2019s revelation that Suella Braverman has disbanded the Home Office\u2019s own Windrush reform unit. Consider the fact, repeated in a Home Office document leaked last year, that \u201cduring the period 1950-1981, every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK\u201d. But then, for today, take a moment, look at the picture, look at them, then look at Britain. Who knew?

Across the UK, at least 57 drag events have been targeted over the past year, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which has also documented how anti-LGBTQ+ messaging from the US is increasingly being imported to the UK. Some events have been framed as a threat to children by a loose coalition of far-right groups and self-styled \u201cchild protection\u201d advocates who have been at the centre of flashpoint protests outside libraries hosting Drag Queen Story Hour events. Several Conservative MPs and peers have publicly criticised all-ages drag events, including one peer who questioned whether children would also be offered \u201centertainment by murderers, paedophiles, terrorists, furries and other fetishists\u201d. The report\u2019s author, Aoife Gallagher, said: \u201cThese incidents should not be viewed in isolation; they speak to a wider anti-LGBTQ+ mobilisation in the UK and they raise concerns about a backsliding trend in LGBTQ+ rights. Although counter-protesters at drag events often outnumbered protesters, this is not enough to protect these communities.\u201d The report, which notes that the Conservative party deputy chair, Lee Anderson, in February discussed a strategy of leaning into \u201cculture wars\u201d in the next election, says the interest of Conservative politicians showed how the opposition to drag is being \u201cmainstreamed\u201d. The research is part of a larger project that has evaluated similar threats in the US, France and Australia and found isolated incidents in several European countries. The UK had the second highest incidence of anti-drag mobilisation of the countries analysed, topped only by the US, which had 203 incidents. In the UK, 49 of the 57 events targeted took place between the end of July 2022 and the end of August 2022, when Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) embarked on a tour of libraries, where performers read to young children and their parents. In January this year, the Tory peer Emma Nicholson described a DQSH event due to take place in the Tate Britain the following month as \u201cpropaganda\u201d. On the day, clashes took place between far-right activists and counter-protesters. In March, the Tory MP Sara Britcliffe tweeted about a DQSH event due to take place at a literary festival in Lancashire, urging the organisers to cancel it, which they did due to \u201csafety concerns\u201d. A month later, another Conservative MP, Nick Fletcher, said \u201cserious questions\u201d had to be answered about a \u201cglam camp\u201d for children that took place over the Easter holidays in Doncaster. The Conservative party said it would not be commenting on the report, titled A Year of Hate: Anti-Drag Mobilisation Efforts Targeting LGBTQ+ People in the UK. The UK went from receiving the top score in LGBTQ+ rights across European countries in 2015 to falling to 17th position this year. Homophobic crimes have doubled and transphobic hate crimes tripled. Organisations involved in some of the protests have included Turning Point UK, a rightwing student group whose honorary president is the Tory MP Marco Longhi. A GB News presenter, Calvin Robinson, and the activist actor Laurence Fox were among those who took part in one of Turning Point\u2019s protests against DQSH. In April, a man who took part in a protest against a drag queen story event in a library was sentenced to a 12-month community order after being convicted of hate crimes. Robbie de Santos, director of external affairs at Stonewall, said: \u201cMany LGBTQ+ people in the UK are living in fear as far-right activism grows and gains legitimacy from mainstream political and press support. Protesting drag queens is only part of a picture that also includes attacks on LGBTQ+-inclusive education in schools and ongoing attempts to row back well-established rights.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f85", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/the-climate-crisis-is-this-centurys-biggest-threat-we-need-a-global-finance-pact-that-reflects-the-task-ahead", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The climate crisis is this century\u2019s biggest threat.

The climate crisis is the biggest single threat we face as a global community. In turn, meeting the goals of the Paris agreement and realising the opportunities of climate action is the task of the 21st century. No single government can address this alone. Together, we can rise to the challenge. When leaders gathered in Bretton Woods in 1944 as the second world war was winding to its close, they set themselves a formidable task. Their job was to design an international financial system that would reduce global recessions and instability, and lead to a steadier international political environment than the one which bedevilled the first half of the 20th century. The result was imperfect, but nonetheless astounding. The creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was played an important role in supporting a more stable period through the second half of the 20th century. If a new Bretton Woods system was being thrashed out today, there would no doubt be agreement that the present task is even greater than that of the 20th century \u2013 building a global financial architecture that helps the world stay as close as possible to 1.5C of warming. We, the climate change ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, hold hope that it is still possible to urgently correct course and see deep, rapid emissions reductions across all sectors and systems. But it is critical we create the right conditions for all nations to thrive, and not be left behind. We need a global financial architecture that helps address the existential threat of climate change, while supporting countries\u2019 development ambitions, responding to the millions slipping back into poverty and maintaining stability in the global financial system. Pacific and Caribbean Island nations are showing us the way. Their leadership has been instrumental in driving global climate ambition, including to advocate for adequate and predictable flows of climate finance. The prime minister of the Cook Islands and chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, Mark Brown, recently called for \u201ctransformation in our multilateral development funds and institutions\u201d. This reflects the shift that we agree is necessary. We are also inspired by the leadership of Barbados, whose prime minister, Mia Mottley, is a tireless advocate for international financial architecture reform to support the most climate-vulnerable nations. This includes small island states who face multiple, cascading challenges to their economic prospects because of climate change. Growing debt burdens are limiting the ability of developing countries to absorb the costs of addressing the devastating impacts of climate change on their own. That\u2019s why we recognise the need to increase support for adaptation and the response to climate impacts in the developing world. We also call for developing countries to be directly engaged in these reform efforts. Our climate and development goals must be pursued in lockstep. Given their important role, multilateral development banks are uniquely placed to demonstrate leadership and our three nations welcome the delivery of initial reforms including the recent announcement to unlock US$50bn in lending capacity over the next 10 years at the World Bank. However, there is much more to do. Considering how urgent it is to provide climate finance at affordable rates, we need to make it a collective effort to ensure climate change becomes a bigger factor in the balance sheet of each multilateral development bank, recognising the importance that the banks retain their preferred creditor status and AAA credit rating. The reality is that climate finance from these multilateral institutions continues to be patchy and at times inaccessible to the nations that need it most \u2013 particularly those in the Pacific, and small island states around the world. We must change that. Climate finance that is inaccessible has little value. Multilateral development bank portfolios should increase alignment with the Paris agreement and scale up the provision of concessional finance. That means integrating climate risk considerations and impacts across their activities. It means strengthening efforts to leverage and unlock greater private sector investment off the back of interventions as well as streamlining access, eligibility and delivery of projects and programs. Now is a time of both challenge and opportunity. The summit for a new global financing pact is under way right now and it presents a time to focus on pathways to advance climate and nature-positive reforms across global financial architecture. So too, the World Bank and IMF annual meetings in Marrakech in October represent an opportunity to formalise the evolution of the World Bank, which we hope will deliver meaningful action. We also extend our support to the United Arab Emirates as the Cop28 president, expressing our joint ambition to work closely with UAE to make multilateral development bank reform a key focus of their presidency agenda. We all need to be \u201call in\u201d. And that includes all international financial institutions. Chris Bowen is Australia\u2019s climate change and energy minister.

The show, now in its 21st year, has bucked the trend which has seen Australian Story fall by 16% between 2019 and 2022; Foreign Correspondent by 22% and 7.30 by 4%, according to an internal presentation for executives seen by Guardian Australia. The program to lose the biggest chunk of its audience is Q+A, which has dropped by 36% in three years \u2013 and a dramatic 58% since 2016 \u2013 and was moved from Monday to Thursday and back to Monday in an attempt to find an audience. Stan Grant, who was appointed full-time host a year ago, is on leave and it is not clear if he will return. These shrinking audiences are not unique to the ABC but part of a trend across the industry including for Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes (down 25% since 2019) and Ten\u2019s The Project (down 20% since 2019). Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Hosted by David Speers since 2020, Insiders is moving its production from Melbourne to Canberra next month, resulting in the loss of two Melbourne studio-based jobs. However, the program was not targeted last week in the major round of redundancies affecting programs like Four Corners and Australian Story as the corporation moves towards becoming an \u201cintegrated digital operation\u201d. The news division lost 41 of the 120 jobs which were targeted for redundancy across the organisation. ABC management is proposing to cut 16 jobs across Four Corners, Australian Story, 7.30, the investigative reporting team and Radio National\u2019s Background Briefing, including losing highly experienced multi-award winning journalists in order to fund new digital-focused jobs. The figures from an internal 2022 presentation to news executives show that the decline of broadcast audiences for current affairs television is not being offset by a growth in digital. While more people are watching news programming on ABC iview, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and ABC online, these digital channels are not growing fast enough. But the ABC said on Thursday the digital audience reach is expected to surpass TV reach for the first time this year and the shift to digital news consumption is accelerating. ABC online figures show that Australian Story articles had the highest engagement and Foreign Correspondent articles had the highest average page views. \u201cThere is no decline in Australians\u2019 need for trustworthy, independent public interest journalism,\u201d ABC news director Justin Stevens said. \u201cWe are better placed than any media organisation in this country to provide the audience quality and significant news and journalism across video, audio and text.\u201d Stevens told staff the division must change to \u201chave a viable digital future\u201d. \u201cABC current affairs teams have yet to complete the digital transformation, with resources and skills still weighted toward linear broadcast TV programs,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cTo meet changing audience needs, journalists and technical staff must be multiskilled operators able to deliver high-impact digital content\u201d. On Four Corners, multi-skilled operators who shoot, produce and edit for all platforms, including digital and social will be hired, and two sound recordists will be redundant. On Australian Story and 7.30, several reporters and producers will be let go and new digital staff will be hired to produce \u201ccompelling digital content untethered from its linear programming\u201d. The shock redundancy of Andrew Probyn and his Canberra press gallery producer Brihony Speed last week came in addition to the 16 positions to go in the current affairs division. Probyn and Speed were mentioned at the Midwinter Ball on Wednesday night by Nine\u2019s David Crowe, who won the press gallery journalist of the year award. \u201cI\u2019m really thinking about Andrew Probyn and Brihony Speed,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cThe word \u2018redundancy\u2019 is such an awful word. It suggests you\u2019re unnecessary.

Depending on the intensity of light, it can flash through fiery red and sunset orange at the same time. The oriental species comes from the Caucasus, Iran and Turkey, and has appeared in gardens for centuries. These flowers are an explosion \u2013 dangerous, erotic, visionary. Oriental Poppies, painted by Georgia O\u2019Keeffe in 1928, was groundbreaking, not just for its intense colour but for the textures of the flowers and their sense of movement.

On this bright day in \u201cflaming June\u201d, after last night\u2019s thunderstorm, the poppy flowers are full of garden bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, sometimes three or four in the same flower. Furry black-and-gold striped with white bums, the bees collide into the scarlet shimmer. Pulled by the visual lure of black patches inside the flower that give the illusion of dark, cavernous spaces, they crash into the rings of paddle-like stamens that carry a sable-purple pollen. These stamens skirt the curious seedhead structure with stigma of spidery, sticky-felt black arms, the diadem of the Mycenaean poppy goddess. The bumblebees have individual, high-pitched whines, like a kind of alarm or a magical note. Their wings vibrate the stamens at a certain frequency until the pollen baskets attached to their legs are full. The bees pull out of the flower to return to the nest. The pollen is potent enough and the bees do not receive nectar from the poppy. Like many bees, garden bumblebees have a cuckoo bee \u2013 an impostor species that steals the bee\u2019s identity so that it can gain access to its nest to predate or exploit its colony. Bombus barbutellus looks very similar to Bombus hotorum, but has no pollen baskets on its legs; it steals from the labours of garden bumblebees.

The lack of workers is fuelling food price inflation, Arla said, warning that without action this could also lead to a crisis in milk production. Staff shortages are just the latest challenge facing dairy farmers, the cooperative said, following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, which has pushed up the cost of producing milk to record levels. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the price of dairy products rising steeply in May, with low-fat milk climbing by 28.5% in a year, butter by 14.1% and the price of cheese and curd increasing by 33.4%. Staff shortages in farming and the wider food industry are compounding farmers\u2019 problems, according to a survey carried out by the cooperative, which represents a third of Britain\u2019s dairy farmers. Its director of agriculture, Paul Savage, said: \u201cWe are at serious risk of continued food price inflation and longer-term food security issues if we don\u2019t tackle this now.\u201d Almost three-fifths of Arla members polled said they were finding it harder to find staff than in 2019, blaming the end of free movement of EU workers resulting from Brexit, as well as the pandemic, for their recruitment problems. The survey found that 12% of farmers were considering quitting dairy production altogether because of the challenge of finding workers. Others said labour shortages might cause them to reduce their milk output or cut the size of their herd. Problems finding labour have already prompted farmers to raise pay for farm workers, leading to higher wage bills. The 600 farmers surveyed by Arla in March said that on average they had increased pay for their workers by 22% since 2019. The majority (60%) of dairy producers said they expected wage pressure to continue for the next year, which would continue to have an impact on food prices. The cooperative is calling on the government to work with the industry to help bring more young people into food and agriculture. Young people have a limited understanding of what modern farming involves, Arla found, and more than half of the farmers surveyed (55%) said none or very few of the applicants for current jobs had the right skills. The cooperative is also calling on ministers to create clearer routes into a career in farming through apprenticeships and the T-level vocational qualification. Dairy farmers had to challenge preconceptions about the industry, Savage said. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges we face is recruiting people into the industry.\u201d He said farmers \u201cwork with innovative new technologies and data, and they\u2019re at the forefront of tackling climate change. We know that all of these are important factors when people are choosing their careers.\u201d Harry Davies, an Arla farmer, said he had seen the pressure that staff shortages put on the cost of milk production. \u201cA career in dairy farming is extremely rewarding with our role in feeding the nation and playing our part in reducing emissions and caring for the land around us,\u201d Davies said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t educate people about this on our own.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f8a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/thames-water-pipe-leaks-at-highest-level-in-five-years-foi-reveals", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Thames Water pipe leaks at highest level in five years, FOI reveals", "lead": "Water company to have regular meetings with environment secretary after failing to meet promised targets to fix leakage rates", "author": "Sandra Laville and Damian Carrington", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 04:00:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222682", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/85747d40c0697998a5065e077ec6407e36d53cde/0_257_4800_2881/500.jpg", "body": "The leakage rate from Thames Water pipes is the highest for five years and the company will not meet its target to plug them this year, according to information released under freedom of information laws. The company, which serves 15 million customers across London and Thames Valley, has to have regular meetings with the environment secretary because it is considered to be lagging in its performance. Details of letters released under freedom of information laws between the CEO, Sarah Bentley, and Rebecca Pow, the environment secretary, reveal that Thames is not fixing its leaks as it has promised. Bentley told Pow: \u201cRight now, we have the highest leakage rate since 2018. Consequently, we have already signalled to Ofwat that we are behind on our 2022/23 leakage performance and our target this year will now be very challenging to achieve. \u201cAs annual leakage targets are based on a three-year rolling average, the impact of this year will be felt, not just this year but for the next two years\u2019 performance.\u201d Thames is proposing controversial measures to tackle drought in the future, including a \u201crecycling\u201d scheme in which up to 100m litres of treated sewage from the Mogden sewage works will be pumped into the River Thames at Teddington, south-west London. This will replace 100m litres abstracted from the Thames to tackle water shortages. The project raises environmental concerns including increased water temperatures and a change in the salinity of the river, which will affect fish and biodiversity. It also involves digging three to four 10.5-metre shafts within a protected nature reserve, Ham Lands, a site of importance for nature conservation (SINC), according to Thames documents. The company is also proposing to transport 155m litres of water a day from Wales, in another sensitive policy to try to tackle water shortages in London and the south-east. But its failure to fix its own leaks \u2013 which are estimated to be 630m litres a day \u2013 is likely to make it more difficult for Thames to get approval for these proposals in its draft water resources management plan. Bentley blamed the hot, dry weather last summer, followed by a wet winter, for exacerbating leaks from the network and from customers\u2019 homes. \u201cThe hot and dry summer created an unprecedented \u2018soil moisture deficit\u2019, with ground drying out and causing leaks in our pipes and customers\u2019 pipes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also led to large increases in demand from our customers [in some areas and at sometimes up to 50% more during the summer]. This drove up \u2018unmeasured consumption\u2019 and the need for us to pump more water through our pipes at higher pressure to satisfy demand that in turn also led to more leaks from our pipes. \u201cThe re-wetting of the ground later in the autumn then caused further movement and more leaks in our pipes and customers\u2019 pipes. More recently, the freezing temperatures before Christmas, followed by a speedy thaw, has resulted in a new surge of leaks \u2013 both on our water supply network and on our customer\u2019s pipes.\u201d Thames, like other water companies, has a target to cut its leaks by 50% by 2050. But the Environment Agency has called for the company to increase this target. The EA says the company needs to do more to tackle leaks before suggesting schemes including the Teddington water recycling plan and the transport of water from Wales. It has said the security of water supply to the south-east and London will be at risk if the company does not tackle its leaks and reduce customer demand for water. Bentley told Pow in her letter dated January this year that Thames was running a \u00a31m communications campaign to highlight the challenges \u201cwe all face\u201d and educate customers on what they can do to help make sure there is enough water for everyone. The government has set a target of reducing individual daily water use from about 144 litres a day to 110 litres a day by 2050. On its website, Thames Water admits it is not acceptable that so much water is being lost. It said it is doing all that is reasonably practical to reduce leakage but it will miss its 22/23 target, and that will affect future years. However, the company is working to improve its \u201cleakage transformation plan\u201d. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been very clear to water companies that we expect them to deliver on their commitments \u2013 including targets to reduce leakage by 30% by 2032. \u201cThe government is taking a number of actions to improve water supply through our Plan for Water, as well as taking action to clean up our water through more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f8b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/22/massive-discounts-and-midweek-mini-breaks-20-ways-to-book-a-fantastic-more-affordable-holiday", "primaryCategory": "travel", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Massive discounts and midweek mini-breaks: 20 ways to book a fantastic, more affordable holiday", "lead": "Keen to snag a holiday bargain \u2013 while avoiding scammers and anything too good to be true?

Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, revealed in May that it had received 6,457 reports of holiday fraud in the last financial year, an increase of 41% on the previous year. The average loss was \u00a32,372 per person, with 44% of victims in their 20s and 40s \u2013 dispelling the myth that only older people fall prey to fraudsters. Even without the scams, holidays can be a huge expense in a cost of living crisis \u2013 and Which? reported that getaways this summer could cost up to 70% more than last year. But before you resign yourself to another summer at home, try these booking tips to outsmart the scammers and bag a great deal. Beware clones and fakes One of the biggest threats comes from cloned comparison, airline and holiday websites. These look like the real deal but have a small change to the url, from .co.uk to .org, for example. They may even send fake confirmation emails or booking references \u2013 Anna Bowles, the head of consumer policy and enforcement at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, says: \u201cSome victims only realise they have fallen victim to fraud when they are at the airport to check in for their flight, only to be told that their booking does not exist.\u201d Check the url carefully and Google the site to find the official one. Fake sites, as opposed to clones, can often be spotted by spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and low-quality pictures. Valid businesses should have a phone number and registered address and, ideally, accreditation from a travel body such as Abta or Atol. Worryingly, Bowles says an emerging trend is fake Atol protect numbers, so cross-check on the Atol website. Sites such as Trustpilot can verify the company is genuine. Don\u2019t trust companies whose only online presence is on social media and don\u2019t click on links in social media posts or emails. Never respond to unsolicited emails, calls or texts. Don\u2019t be fooled by the pictures Fake listings steal images of gorgeous villas/luxury hotels/fancy apartments and pass them off as their own. Do a reverse image search (right-click on the picture and select \u201csearch image with Google\u201d) to see where else the image appears online. If the same picture is illustrating multiple different properties, it\u2019s a scam. At the less extreme end of the spectrum, keep an eye out for fish-eye lenses that make rooms look bigger than they are; overly staged images and closeups of objects (designed to distract you from, say, a grotty bathroom); and signs of digital manipulation \u2013 stretched or blurred edges, odd shadows and unrealistic colours. Use a map Some hotels and holiday homes may stretch the truth about the location \u2013 \u201ca stone\u2019s throw from the beach\u201d could require a very strong arm. Put the address into Google Maps to check, and consider using Street View (although bear in mind it might not be up to date if the property has been recently refurbished). Make sure the location suits you as well as the property itself: has it got good transport links and nearby shops/restaurants, for example? Claire Wills, the director of the holiday rental site Coolstays, says: \u201cWe hear lots of stories about guests who try to get to very rural places without a car or any supplies and expect Deliveroo to reach them.\u201d Read online reviews \u2026 Check out the reviews on the business\u2019s own website and on sites such as TripAdvisor or FeeFo. If there are no first-person reviews, only edited (or invented) testimonials, that could be a red flag. Ditto very old reviews, suspiciously similar reviews, a sudden flood of rave reviews and one-off reviews from users who have never posted before. It can also be useful to read the responses from the owners/managers \u2013 are they polite, friendly, open to constructive criticism? \u2026 but don\u2019t let one or two bad reviews put you off Reviews are subjective, after all \u2013 and some unscrupulous reviewers may be working for a rival business or trying to wangle an undeserved refund. Don\u2019t forget word of mouth A personal recommendation from someone you know and trust is worth more than the opinions of 100 anonymous keyboard warriors. Wills says it is often the best way to find hidden gems. Consider a travel agent Believe it or not, high-street travel agents still exist, and those that have survived are likely to offer a great service. They will help to find the best deals and support you if anything goes wrong. Go direct for a discount Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, says if you want a good hotel deal, just phone up and ask. \u201cHoteliers and B&amp;B owners are often stuck in contracts with online booking websites that prevent them from offering you a better price on their own websites. But on the phone, they can do any deal they want, and they usually will,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I have phoned directly, they\u2019ve usually been able to beat the online price, or at least match it and throw in a room upgrade or meal voucher. Plus, more of the money is going to the owner rather than a middleman.\u201d Look out for hidden fees The headline price might be appealing, but make sure you read the small print to see what is included. Paying for extras such as service fees, baggage allowance, transfers and breakfast can add up quickly. Double-check important details Identify your holiday priorities and check your booking really does fit the bill. For example, Wills says: \u201cSome \u2018dog-friendly\u2019 places ask you to confine your beloved pooch to one area of the house.\u201d Be flexible with dates Do you have school-age children or work in education? If not, don\u2019t travel in the school summer holidays. The weather can be lovely in spring and autumn, and prices are far lower. If you are going very early or late in the season, though, do check that the hotel isn\u2019t doing any maintenance work and that everything is open: pool, restaurants, attractions etc. If you are tied to the school holidays, Karen Williams, a travel expert at Eurocamp, says the May half-term or the last week of the summer holidays in September tend to be cheaper than July and August. Midweek breaks are cheaper than weekends. Williams says: \u201cDon\u2019t restrict yourself to traditional holiday durations, such as one week, 10 days or a fortnight. Play around with the length of your trip by a few nights either way to get the best prices.\u201d Flying is not the only option \u2026 \u2026 and it\u2019s obviously not the greenest option. If you must fly, Tuesday tends to be the cheapest day. Boland has plenty of other money-saving flight tips: \u201cIf you are flexible on your destination, set up price alerts on flight comparison websites, such as Skyscanner, for multiple countries. These will alert you to price drops on the route.\u201d He also suggests keeping an eye out for new airlines. \u201cThere have been cheap deals to New York and Boston in 2023 because new budget airlines, such as Norse and Play, launched flights and other carriers dropped their prices to compete.\u201d Finally, he says it\u2019s not worth paying for seat selection. \u201cOur research suggests that you have a strong chance of being seated with your travel companions even if you don\u2019t pay \u2013 Ryanair is really the only exception to this rule.\u201d Otherwise, consider taking the train or a ferry, booking as far in advance as possible for the best prices. Interrailing around Europe can be good value for families \u2013 two children under 12 travel free with every adult. Companies such as Eurocamp often have free ferry offers when you book accommodation through them. Go with a group Teaming up with friends or family can be a good way to save money. Big holiday homes tend to work out much cheaper per head than those that sleep two to six, and more than 100 YHA hostels in England and Wales are available for exclusive hire from as little as \u00a37 a night per person. There is also a recent trend for whole campsite bookings, which can work out at less than a tenner a night per person. Book (way) in advance The bad news is that the best deals for this summer have long gone, although there are still bargains to be had from mid-autumn onwards. The good news is that now is a great time to book for next summer. If you\u2019re worried about paying out so far in advance in case the company goes bust, Angus Kinloch, the managing director of Ski Line, a specialist travel agent, suggests snooping on Companies House. \u201cThis site allows users to view the latest company accounts to see if it is profitable and likely to still be in business when you take your holiday. A business showing negative shareholders\u2019 funds or accumulated losses isn\u2019t likely to be trading for very long.\u201d Don\u2019t bank on a last-minute bargain Dan Fox, the managing director of the tour operator Ski Weekends, says: \u201cLate deals do still exist with the major package operators because they have already paid for the flight and accommodation and need to sell it.\u201d However, he adds: \u201cThe overcapacity that used to exist has all but disappeared, so these deals are few and far between; don\u2019t bank on finding one.\u201d Maximise your chances by signing up for email alerts on last-minute offers from operators, hotels and spas, or gamble on an impromptu UK minibreak \u2013 boutique hotels often discount massively on the day if they aren\u2019t fully booked. Beware huge discounts Having said that, early-bird or last-minute offers are one thing, but unrealistically big discounts or very time-sensitive deals (\u201cAct now!\u201d) may well be a scam. Even if the company is genuine, Mark Nathan, the owner of Chalets1066 in Les Gets, France, says: \u201cIt is easy to be attracted by offers such as 50% off, but this often means that the list price is inflated enormously. You have to ask the question: do you trust a company that inflates the list price and tries to make huge profits, and only discounts when a week is not selling?\u201d Follow payment guidelines Kinloch says: \u201cScammers play on people\u2019s greed, asking clients to pay for their holiday away from the website where the listing is so they can avoid paying commission. Always follow the payment guidelines when booking on sites such as Airbnb.\u201d Legitimate websites with secure payment systems have an SSL certificate, indicated by \u201chttps\u201d rather than \u201chttp\u201d in the url, and a padlock symbol. They will also have a privacy policy explaining how they store your data. Never give out personal or financial information over the phone, and avoid paying by bank transfer. \u201cUsing a credit card will offer you extra protection under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act,\u201d says Boland. PayPal\u2019s Buyer Protection programme is another good option. Buy travel insurance If travelling in Europe, apply for a global health insurance card (Ghic), which entitles you to limited emergency healthcare. But you still need travel insurance \u2013 annual multi-trip cover is often the best value if you are going away more than once a year. \u201cAlways take out travel insurance at the same time you book your holiday. This ensures you are protected if you can\u2019t travel, which is especially useful if you or one of your party becomes unwell, says Boland. \u201cRead your policy document carefully so you understand what is covered. For example, last year we found that four in 10 policies won\u2019t cover you in the event of strikes by airline or airport staff.\u201d Price isn\u2019t everything For many, the cheapest option is the only option. But if you can afford it, consider paying a little more to support independent businesses with sound environmental policies. You may even be able to help someone else have a holiday \u2013 some retreat venues and festivals operate on a \u201cpay what you can\u201d basis, with better-off customers subsidising others. The Greenbelt festival in Northamptonshire, for example, is \u00a3190 for a standard ticket or \u00a3230 for a supporter ticket; the latter helps cover the cost of free and discounted places for people on benefits or in financial difficulties. And finally \u2026 \u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it most definitely is,\u201d says Pauline Smith, the head of Action Fraud, and pretty much every other travel expert.

Doctors have variously had their hair ripped out, been backed up against a wall and been racially abused, a survey and dossier of testimonies collated by a medical organisation has revealed. Long delays for care and staff shortages are cited as the main triggers for what NHS leaders say is an increased readiness by the public to be aggressive towards frontline staff. The research by the Medical Protection Society (MPS) found that 56% of the doctors questioned had experienced or witnessed a situation involving verbal or physical abuse over the last year. Almost half said incidents had occurred because of a lack of staff, while 45% blamed it on patients\u2019 frustration at having to wait a long time to be treated. One doctor told the MPS how a \u201cpatient\u2019s partner threatened to kill me as he felt his wife had waited too long to be seen\u201d, while another said: \u201cI had a handful of my hair ripped out despite the patient being in handcuffs and with the police.\u201d A third described being \u201cbacked up against a wall by parents who wanted better nursing for their child in intensive care. We literally had no staff.\u201d Another said: \u201cI was physically and verbally abused by a patient because of the time they would have to wait for their operation.\u201d Prof Jane Dacre, the president of the MPS, said that while staff shortages and long waits could be \u201cfrustrating and stressful\u201d for patients and their families, frontline personnel were \u201cdoing their best in very difficult circumstances\u201d. She said: \u201cWhile many patient interactions are positive, it is distressing that so many healthcare workers face daily verbal and physical abuse from patients, including being spat at and threatened.\u201d GPs as well as hospital doctors have been targets of abuse, with frustration at getting appointments a common trigger. One family doctor recounted how there was \u201cdaily abuse of reception staff about lack of appointments and regular anger to GPs from relatives and patients about secondary [hospital] care and primary [GP] care waiting times\u201d. A second GP said: \u201cAggressive, abusive language and behaviour [is] often directed at the reception team.\u201d Dr Latifa Patel, the British Medical Association\u2019s workforce lead, said underfunding of and understaffing in the NHS by the Conservatives had left it \u201ca shadow of its former self\u201d and unable to give patients who were often in pain and distress the care they need quickly enough. \u201cHowever, I urge the public not to take out their exasperation on doctors or our colleagues who share the same frustrations and are acutely aware that waiting times are too long,\u201d she said. Concern about aggression directed at emergency workers led the government to double the maximum sentence for people convicted of assaulting them. Alarm about abuse of staff led health service leaders in London to warn in an open letter last year that \u201ctens of thousands of staff and colleagues working in the NHS in London are confronted with violence and aggression from patients and members of the public simply for going to work. Now the abuse is at a dangerous level.\u201d Three in 10 doctors think the police do not take such incidents seriously enough, the MPS\u2019s survey of 861 doctors across the UK found. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cViolence or misconduct of any kind is unacceptable and has no place in the NHS.\u201d The growing abuse has led some NHS care providers to issue staff with bodyworn cameras to deter and record aggression, and others to hire extra security staff and install CCTV."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f8d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/robot-subs-and-an-8km-winch-the-equipment-being-deployed-in-search-for-titan", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Robot subs and an 8km winch: the equipment being deployed in search for Titan", "lead": "Ten ships and several remote subs have joined the hunt for the missing submersible near the wreck of the Titanic", "author": "Jonathan Yerushalmy", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 03:30:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222735", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/82389b31d8122973e48fd42042964bea693c3658/0_354_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Rescue teams searching for the missing Titan submersible saw reason for optimism on Wednesday after they reported hearing underwater noises in the Atlantic. While stressing that the sounds were \u201cinconclusive\u201d and not confirmation the crew was still alive, the news did raise the question of what happens if the sub is located \u2013 and what equipment will be necessary to retrieve it. Surface vessels The US Coast Guard said five ships were searching for Titan on Wednesday and they expected there to be 10 ships by Thursday. The Polar Prince, the research vessel that the Titan was launched from, remained near the Titanic wreck site in the Atlantic Ocean. It is operated by OceanGate \u2013 the sub\u2019s owner \u2013 and was reportedly being used as the \u201cunified command\u201d by the US Coast Guard. It was quickly joined by Deep Energy, a vessel that is used to lay pipes at great depths along the ocean floor, and another commercial vessel, Skandi Vinland. By Wednesday morning, Canadian coast guard vessels John Cabot \u2013 equipped with sonar capabilities \u2013 and Atlantic Merlin had also joined the search. The final five vessels were expected to arrive on Thursday. French research vessel L\u2019Atalante was expected to be the first to join the search. Two further Canadian Coast Guard ships \u2013 the Anne Harvey and the Terry Fox \u2013 were also expected as well as another commercial vessel, the Horizon Arctic. Finally, Canadian naval ship Glace Bay was en route to provide medical assistance. It is equipped with a medical team and a mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber. Hyperbaric chambers are used to treat people affected by a sudden and rapid change in pressure. Sean Leet, co-founder and chairman of Horizon Maritime Services, which owns the Polar Prince, has praised how quickly specialist marine craft have been scrambled to help in the search. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the marine industry since a very young age and I\u2019ve never seen equipment of that nature move that quickly,\u201d he said. ROVs If the Titan did reach the wreck of the Titanic, it could be trapped as deep as 3,800 metres below the surface of the ocean, so key to the search are camera-equipped remote-controlled vehicles known as ROVs, which are designed to scan the seafloor at depths other vessels can\u2019t reach. Two of the first vessels to join the rescue effort \u2013 Deep Energy and Skandi Vinland \u2013 both carry ROVs and have deployed them in the search. US Coast Guard vessel Atlantic Merlin is also equipped with an ROV. It is not clear, however, whether any of the ROVs operating in the early part of search could reach the extreme depths that might be required. David Marquet, a former US navy submarine commander, told CBC that only a \u201ctiny percentage of the world\u2019s submarines operate that deeply\u201d. Fortunately, the French research vessel L\u2019Atalante carries an ROV that can reportedly descend to 6,000 metres. The Victor 6000 is connected to its parent ship by an 8km long cable that provides it with electrical power, meaning that in theory there is no limit to the duration for which it can dive. It is also equipped with arms that can cut cables or conduct manipulations to help release a stranded vessel. Guernsey-based Magellan is also deploying its ROV which can operate at depths of up to 6,000 metres. The company specialises in deep sea rescue and said it was first approached by OceanGate to help. Fadoss If the search vessels are able to locate the Titan, retrieving it presents a number of challenges. While some ROVs are able to manipulate things, they would be unable to lift it to the surface. The Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System (Fadoss) is a lift system designed to provide reliable deep ocean lifting capacity of up to 27,200kg. It has been deployed in the hope it could be used to hoist the Titan up to the service. Fadoss can be used to recover \u201clarge, bulky, and heavy sunken objects such as aircraft or small vessels\u201d and has in the past operated at a depth of almost 6,000 metres. The system is essentially a huge winch with a cable, one end of which is attached to an ROV, which attaches it to the lost vessel. Commercial vessel the Horizon Arctic, which is en route to the search site, is believed to have a Fadoss system on board. The US navy has also sent a Fadoss to St John\u2019s in Newfoundland. However, before it can be deployed, it needs to be welded to the deck of a ship, a process that can take a full day, according to a navy official speaking to CNN. \u201cWe have a vessel of opportunity that we are looking to put under charter, but it is not currently under charter.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f8e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/22/lawyer-x-victoria-dpp-decision-not-to-lay-charges-director-public-prosecutions", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Informant\u2019s plea deal behind decision not to lay charges over Lawyer X scandal, says Victorian DPP", "lead": "After explosive criticism from special investigator, Kerri Judd says she had no confidence a key figure would give evidence against police", "author": "Benita Kolovos", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 03:24:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222753", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/675a865b981d260b6e4ef16a4ed38195dd937a4d/1041_154_2612_1568/500.jpg", "body": "Victoria\u2019s director of public prosecutions has defended her decision not to lay charges over the Lawyer X scandal, saying she had no confidence a key figure involved would plead guilty and testify against police officers. A letter from Kerri Judd was tabled in parliament on Thursday, a day after the special investigator tasked with building criminal cases against those involved in the scandal, Geoffrey Nettle, attacked her for refusing to approve charges. Nettle, a former high court judge, called for the office of the special investigator (OSI) to be disbanded or he would resign, arguing any further work would be a \u201cwaste of time and resources\u201d given the chances of prosecution was \u201ceffectively nil\u201d. While praising the \u201cdiligent efforts of the OSI in these most challenging investigations\u201d, Judd challenged Nettle\u2019s description of a 5,000-page brief of evidence for one investigation, dubbed Operation Spey, that he said \u201cestablished a powerful case of offending\u201d. \u201cMuch of this material was irrelevant to any likely facts in issue in the proposed proceeding or, if relevant, would have been inadmissible as a matter of law,\u201d Judd said. She said the OSI\u2019s case relied on an unnamed individual \u2013 understood to be Nicola Gobbo \u2013 pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice and testifying against police officers. Neither Nettle\u2019s report or Judd\u2019s response name Gobbo, the gangland lawyer at the centre of the scandal who was recruited by police to inform against her own clients. However, correspondence between the two parties contains information that identifies her, including the years Gobbo was registered as a police informant and the fact she has fled the country. Judd said she received conflicting statements about what Gobbo would receive in exchange for their testimony: either a lighter sentence or indemnity from prosecution. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThe OSI informed me \u2013 and I accept \u2013 that it had given the individual no assurances that I would give them an indemnity from prosecution or an undertaking that their evidence not be used against them,\u201d Judd wrote. \u201cBut given the discrepancy in material provided to me, I had no confidence that the individual would in fact agree to plead guilty and give evidence as contemplated by the OSI.\u201d She said the brief also did not include a statement from a \u201ccrucial potential witness\u201d, given the pseudonym Fleet, who was \u201cthe primary victim of the alleged offending\u201d but \u201cuncooperative and potentially not compellable\u201d. Fleet had given evidence at the Lawyer X royal commission but Judd said this would not be admissible at a criminal trial. \u201cWithout Fleet\u2019s direct account of the alleged attempt to pervert the course of justice, I considered there was insufficient admissible evidence to prove the offence,\u201d Judd wrote. On a possible charge of perjury against another individual, Judd said she asked for more material on the case on 1 December 2021, and the special investigator said he would try to provide it. \u201cTo date, I have not received further material in relation to that brief of evidence,\u201d she wrote said. On another investigation, known as Operation Charlie, Judd said the passage of time since the alleged police offence \u201cwould undoubtedly have a significant bearing on the prospects of conviction\u201d. She questioned whether it was in the public interest to pursue the case, which would take years to make its way through the courts and would likely lead to a non-custodial sentence. The OSI was created after a recommendation by the Lawyer X royal commission to investigate laying criminal charges against those involved. The OSI was not given the power to prosecute cases itself, instead requiring the office of public prosecutions to do so on its behalf. The use of Gobbo as an informer broke the convention of lawyer-client privilege and resulted in the overturning of three criminal convictions, including against drug kingpin Tony Mokbel. The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said even though no charges have been laid against those involved in the scandal, many lessons had been learned as a result. \u201cNot everybody gets the outcome that perhaps they want but the work has been completed \u2026 and the DPP has assessed that these cases would not make it through to successful prosecution in the courts. She\u2019s an expert in her field,\u201d Symes told reporters outside parliament. The premier, Daniel Andrews, characterised the conflicting reports as \u201chealthy debate\u201d between two of the state\u2019s \u201cbest legal minds\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not new at all.

There has been nothing sexy about Slater\u2019s approach but Queensland have just gone into every game confident they were ready and would not be let down by those off the field. Fittler, by contrast, has opted for an increasingly dangerous combination of risk-taking and stubbornness throughout this series. His approach has at times been kamikaze in nature, featuring a resounding self-belief in the face of common sense and popular opinion that has led to moves few others could understand. It was slow and steady against a desire for quick fixes and a devotion to impulse. And it led to Slater winning four of five games against Fittler. For the first time in the last six years, Queensland were not only favoured but heavily so in the 2023 series. But the burden of expectation did not weigh them down, nor did any pressure applied by New South Wales. Slater has re-instilled the resilience that Queensland have made famous \u2013 an ability to absorb pressure and then take opportunities when they arrive. Seven linebreaks and six tries in Brisbane, despite being well beaten in the possession stakes, is testament to the Maroons\u2019 patience and ruthlessness. Luck, of course, plays its part in all sporting contests and it was the Maroons who got the rub of the green in Brisbane. Queensland\u2019s first try was questionable at best with potentially two knock-ons in the play while their second appeared to come off a forward pass. The early injury to Tom Trbojevic sent any plans the Blues had completely off the rails. The better team won, but in truth it was the better prepared team that won. Damien Cook played 78 minutes of a game which New South Wales needed to win. The Blues had 55% of possession yet scored just a single try and conceded 32 points to a Maroons team that had just a 45% share. New South Wales had more tackle breaks, post-contact metres and passes yet were never in the game. If that doesn\u2019t sum up the Fittler era, then it at least gives a suitable eulogy for his final years. In the opening game when Trbojevic went down late with an injury, he opted for Nicho Hynes, despite having numerous more suitable options to play centre among a string of edge backrowers. Hynes conceded the defining try playing out of position. Rather than admit his mistake when Trbojevic went down again on Wednesday, Fittler doubled down by choosing arguably the least suitable person from his bench to play the all-important left centre. Cook turns 32 on Friday. He stands 1.78m tall, which is short for a centre. He has spent most of his career playing hooker. Yet Fittler plumped for him ahead of playing a backrower like Hudson Young, Liam Martin or Cameron Murray. Cook, typically, tried so hard but he was found out time and time again. Poor positional work contributed to the first try. He spilled an attempted bomb that led to the final try. In between were poor tap-ons and defensive reads. None of this was Cook\u2019s fault \u2013 he was set up to fail. Realistically, Fittler has little chance of being named New South Wales coach next year, and the NSWRL will now seriously consider his suitability to both select and lead the team into the dead rubber in Sydney. Defeat, of course, is always around the corner in Origin, but on what was a night of great celebration for Queensland, New South Wales have found themselves at the start of a great reckoning."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f92", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/titanic-sub-timeline-titan-submersible-missing-vessel", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Titan submersible: timeline of missing vessel\u2019s voyage", "lead": "As rescue vessels arrive at the search site off Newfoundland, here\u2019s the Titan\u2019s voyage, starting on Friday, when it set off for the Titanic", "author": "Guardian staff and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 01:46:49", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222827", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5ab82b84e4d3689d058732da63ec882cebebae05/0_111_2200_1320/500.jpg", "body": "The search for the missing Titan submersible is continuing on Wednesday amid concerns over dwindling oxygen supply on the vessel.

What was behind her comments and why has it got some people worried? It\u2019s all to do with the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What was said? Perhaps ironically, Bullock\u2019s comments were made in a speech she gave on Tuesday to a business gathering in Newcastle titled \u201cAchieving Full Employment\u201d. While the RBA\u2019s battle to constrain inflation had been the focus, she stressed that it did not mean the \u201cother part of our mandate \u2013 maintaining full employment \u2013 has become any less important\u201d. \u201cIt is hard to overstate the importance of achieving full employment,\u201d she said, listing the effects from financial to mental and physical health for those unable to find work. But she sparked angst with comments that implied the current jobless rate \u2013 at 3.6% as of May \u2013 was probably more than full employment, and hence official interest rates had to rise. \u201cIf unemployment remains too low for too long, inflation expectations will rise, which will make it that much harder for the monetary authorities to bring inflation back down,\u201d Bullock said. Despite a dozen rate rises in 13 months, the labour market \u201cremains tight, with many firms still finding it challenging to hire workers, and there are still roughly as many vacancies as there are unemployed\u201d, she said. Who was upset? The assessment that unemployment was \u201ctoo low\u201d prompted anger from unions, which have argued the RBA\u2019s rate hikes concentrate pain on workers who would face job cuts as economic activity slows. As of May, Australia\u2019s unemployed totalled 511,800, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If the jobless rate were to rise to 4.5% by the end of 2024 and the available workforce expanded at the same pace as it has for the past year, the ranks of the jobless will swell by about 150,000. (Treasury has a similar employment forecast.) \u201cIt\u2019s a truly broken system when the RBA\u2019s message to struggling Australians is: some of you need to lose your jobs or we\u2019ll have to smash all of you with interest rate hikes,\u201d said Stacey Schinnerl, the acting national secretary of the Australian Workers\u2019 Union. \u201cWorking people didn\u2019t cause the inflation crisis and yet every solution the RBA suggests involves hurting working people. \u201cIt\u2019s a busted system in need of a complete overhaul.\u201d What is a sustainable level of unemployment? The Goldilocks level of joblessness that is considered neutral as far as inflationary pressures go is known as \u2013 jargon alert \u2013 the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu. As the RBA itself says: \u201cThe Nairu is the lowest unemployment rate that can be sustained without causing wages growth and inflation to rise.\u201d Adding to its mystique, the gauge is only inferred from other measures. \u201cThe Nairu cannot be observed directly,\u201d the RBA said. If wage growth is picking up and inflation is increasing, the unemployment rate is likely below Nairu, as has probably been the case over much of the past year. Where does the Nairu sit now? Selwyn Cornish, an adjunct associate professor at the Australian National University and official historian of the RBA, says opinions vary about where Nairu might land. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty general concept,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you ask 10 people what Nairu might be \u2026 you\u2019ll probably get 10 answers.\u201d Cornish notes the 2% jobless rate that Australian enjoyed during much of the 1960s was in hindsight too low, fostering an inflationary buildup in the following decade (ably assisted by the Opec oil shocks). In the wake of the second world war, Nairu was assumed to be about 4-5%. A 2021 paper by Treasury concluded that a \u201cprudent\u201d estimate based on the five years before the Covid pandemic placed it at about 4.75% Bullock herself noted the projected rise in the jobless rate to 4.5% by the end of 2024 was \u201cnot far off some estimates of where the Nairu might currently be\u201d. \u201cIn other words, the economy would be closer to a sustainable balance point\u201d at that level, she said. What if Nairu estimates are too high? Wage increases lagged forecasts for years in the run-up to Covid, suggesting the RBA had kept its cash rate unnecessarily high. That meant people who might have had jobs didn\u2019t get them and the economy missed out on growth. Economists such as Greg Jericho argue the RBA shouldn\u2019t be panicking now about workers getting paid more. If Nairu were, say, closer to 4%, the central bank\u2019s work would be all but done. The jobless rate will take time to creep higher, given the lag for rate rises to take effect. Cornish said the pandemic distorted the economy, from subsidies to keep people in jobs to increased workforce flexibility, most notable in the increased tolerance of staff working from home. More research was needed to understand its impact. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t help us very much here,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f94", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/woodside-has-huge-plans-to-drill-for-oil-and-gas-and-to-meet-its-climate-targets-how-does-it-do-it", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Woodside has huge plans to drill for oil and gas \u2013 and to meet its climate targets.

How? Woodside has said it \u201caims to thrive through the energy transition by building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio\u201d. It has a 60% stake in the development, known as Trion, alongside Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil exploration and production company, Pemex. Pemex discovered the oil and gas 2.5km deep, about 180km off shore in the Gulf of Mexico. There will be 24 wells and Pemex and Woodside are planning for the first oil to be pumped in 2028. Announcing the investment, Woodside pointed to analysis carried out for the UN\u2019s climate science panel that it said showed there were \u201ca range of future energy transition pathways\u201d that allowed for new supply of fossil fuels while keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5C. Drilling for all this oil and gas in a new development would not even compromise the company\u2019s climate targets, it said. But analysts told Temperature Check the Trion project would lead to the release of about 365m tonnes of CO2-equivalent over its lifetime \u2013 equal to about 80% of Australia\u2019s annual emissions. How can Trion fit into Woodside\u2019s climate targets? Most of the greenhouse gases from Trion will come when the oil and gas is burned and Woodside has no targets covering those emissions. Instead, the company says it will invest up to US$5bn in \u201cnew energy products and low-carbon services\u201d by 2030. But that pledge is dwarfed by the money it is spending on fossil fuel production. Before announcing the US$4.8bn spend on Trion, the company said it planned to spend another US$6bn or so on an oilfield in Senegal and its Scarborough LNG project in Western Australia. Woodside does have targets for the emissions from its own operations (before the fossil fuels are sold and burned) but the company allows itself to buy offsets to meet them, which it did last year to turn a 3.5% rise in emissions into an 11% fall. Woodside thinks Trion will be financially \u201cresilient\u201d in a decarbonising world because it would make a quick return on investment and two-thirds of the fossil fuels would be extracted \u201cwithin 10 years of start up\u201d. The company said in its announcement it would use the cash from Trion to help fund \u201cfuture developments in oil, gas and new energy\u201d \u2013 a further pointer to the company\u2019s hopes to keep exploiting fossil fuels. Woodside pointed to work done for the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that produces scenarios of how the world will decarbonise. Some of these show there will be a demand for oil in 2030 that is not met by existing fossil fuel projects. But the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, says many of the modelled scenarios with higher levels of fossil fuel use also need \u201cmuch higher levels of carbon dioxide removal that is likely unachievable and unsustainable\u201d. Hare says Trion would release about 365Mt of CO2-e. A briefing document released by Woodside about the Trion project refers to the International Energy Agency\u2019s scenario for how economies can reach net zero \u2013 but that analysis gives no room for new fossil fuel developments. The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, has pointed to a \u201cblack and white\u201d contradiction for fossil fuel companies who claim increasing their production is in line with the Paris agreement. Hare tells Temperature Check: \u201cDeveloping new oil and gas fields is completely inconsistent with getting to 1.5C and requires an almost infinite level of gullibility, wilful or otherwise, from investors and banks to believe and invest in this kind of magical thinking that sets aside as irrelevant or immaterial the increasingly strong analysis and messages from the world\u2019s premier \u2013 and legendarily conservative \u2013 International Energy Agency.\u201d Renewable coal? Climate activists have blockaded ports in Newcastle, Brisbane and Melbourne this week trying to disrupt the coal trade, causing some traffic jams and delays. Sky News Australia host Peta Credlin described it as \u201cexport terrorism\u201d and suggested the government should ban the activists from accessing welfare. On Credlin\u2019s show, the former Howard government minister Gary Hardgrave was confused about why protesters would be targeting coal. \u201cCoal is a great renewable resource because the trees suck it out of the sky \u2013 that carbon dioxide \u2013 every night and turn it back into oxygen,\u201d he said. The protesters should have sat with him in grade 6 where children \u201cwould have known how the balance of nature works\u201d. \u201cThese people are unhinged. Simple,\u201d Hardgrave said. One might ask why, if trees are sucking all coal\u2019s carbon dioxide out of the sky, the gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, adding unfathomable amounts of extra heat to the oceans and driving worsening fire conditions in forests (where magic trees grow)."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f95", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/metal-recycling-plant-felony-charges-los-angeles", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Metal recycling plant owners charged for contaminating LA school grounds", "lead": "After decades of complaints from staff and students at Jordan high school, Atlas Metals was hit with 22 felony counts", "author": "Maanvi Singh", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 00:10:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222881", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eb862b539197e9cc43fcf3c59fceef73ffcbefcd/0_93_6316_3790/500.jpg", "body": "The owners of a metal recycling plant operating next to a south LA high school campus have been hit with 22 felony charges, after decades of complaints that the facility was contaminating school grounds with lead and other toxic waste. Announcing the charges on Wednesday, the Los Angeles district attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said that staff and students at Jordan high school in Watts, a predominantly Black and Latino neighbourhood, had been \u201cpotentially exposed to dangerous levels of pollutants on a daily basis\u201d. \u201cThe charging of Atlas Metal for their environmental crimes is a step toward justice for the children of Jordan high school and the community of Watts,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said at a press conference held outside the school. For generations of students, the grey mounds of scrap metal looming over the school, past the softball field, were a familiar sight. A Guardian investigation last year found that high schoolers had become inured to the sounds and noxious smells coming from the Atlas scrap yard. \u201cThe smell is just very, very nasty,\u201d Genesis Cruz, a 2023 graduate of Jordan high, told the Guardian. \u201cA sharp smell, like thick oil.\u201d Class lectures were punctuated by clangs and crashes coming from the S&amp;W Atlas Iron &amp; Metal Co recycling facility, which has been operating next to the school since 1949. On occasion, shards of metal have flown onto campus, and authorities have found dust laced with dangerous levels of lead \u2013 a neurotoxin \u2013 and other heavy metals atop sports fields and inside classrooms. In addition to the 21 felony counts of knowingly disposing hazardous waste without a permit and one felony count of depositing of hazardous waste, the owners of Atlas, Gary Weisenberg and Matthew Weisenberg, also face a misdemeanor count for allegedly failing to minimise the risks of fire and public nuisance. An arraignment is scheduled for next week. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Atlas is going to receive this action,\u201d Timothy Watkins, a longtime community advocate and president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee, said at the press conference. Still, he said, the charges alone will not \u201coffset the harm that\u2019s been done over the last 75 years\u201d. Watkins told the Guardian he and others had been raising concerns about the recycling plant, as well as lead pollution in nearby housing developments for decades before officials began to pay heed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it took a whole lot more than it should.\u201d This is not the first legal action taken by local officials against Atlas. In 2020, the Los Angeles unified school district (LAUSD) sued Atlas in federal court and the next year, the city of Los Angeles filed suit against the recycler as well. Between 2017 and 2020, the school district spent $2.4m to test and treat the contamination on campus, only to find that dust was recontaminating the campus, district officials told the Guardian. Gasc\u00f3n said that he hoped the criminal charges against Atlas \u201cwill serve as a deterrent to other companies that may be tempted to cut corners when it comes to environmental regulations\u201d. Benjamin Gluck, a lawyer for Atlas said that the company is \u201cactively working with the many public agencies involved and is actually moving close to a global resolution\u201d. \u201cThe district attorney declined to engage with us and chose instead to file charges. We have not learned the details of those charges yet, but we will defend this case vigorously,\u201d he said. But for Watkins and other residents, the felony charges \u2013 after so many years of advocacy \u2013 are both a vindication and heartbreaking reminder that Watts has been neglected for too long. \u201cIf this was Beverly Hills, and you tried to have this next to Beverly Hills high school, oh my gosh,\u201d Watkins told the Guardian. \u201cIt would be a joke. It would never happen.\u201d Watts is chequered with recycling plants, lumber yards and fabricators. Noxious pollution also emanates from a freight expressway east of the high school. The life expectancy here is about a decade lower than in wealthier parts of LA. \u201cI feel like a lot of people don\u2019t really have the motivation to even stand up for themselves anymore, because they\u2019re just so used to disappointment and they feel like nothing\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Cruz said. She hopes the DA\u2019s charges will remind residents that their advocacy does matter. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f96", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/22/tom-calma-says-politicians-deliberately-peddling-misinformation-on-indigenous-voice", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Tom Calma says politicians deliberately \u2018peddling misinformation\u2019 on Indigenous voice", "lead": "Key voice to parliament campaigner says MPs \u2018should know better if they\u2019ve got a conscience\u2019 than to mislead the public on the referendum", "author": "Lorena Allam Indigenous affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 00:07:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222904", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/733622c91b0a1fedaeb0cf5fdaeb938db2233a73/0_28_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Prominent Indigenous voice campaigner and senior Australian of the Year, Professor Tom Calma, has lashed out at politicians for deliberately \u201cpeddling misinformation\u201d about the referendum, saying they \u201cshould know better, if they\u2019ve got a conscience\u201d than to \u201cmislead\u201d voters. Calma, a Kungarakan man from the Northern Territory, will address the issue of misinformation about the Indigenous voice to parliament in the annual Reconciliation lecture on Thursday evening in Canberra. Calma told Guardian Australia he is disappointed at the \u201cridiculous\u201d statements being made by politicians about the referendum and the voice. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou scratch the surface and realise that what they\u2019re saying, by and large, has no validity. It\u2019s inaccurate, and it\u2019s very sad that politicians should be peddling this rhetoric when they should know better. \u201cThey should know that what they\u2019re saying is not accurate.

Other Liberals, the Nationals, Thorpe, One Nation and Ralph Babet voted no. Calma, co-author of a major codesign report for the previous Coalition government on how a voice might operate, said some MPs were deliberately misleading the public. \u201cIt is ultra, ultra frustrating when the politicians make statements like, \u2018It could be one person appointed to this to this body\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s an elite Canberra-based body\u2019, when they know very well it\u2019s not, because we\u2019ve briefed them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe briefed the the opposition leader and members of parliament, we\u2019ve talked and talked to them about the report, Professor Langton and I, under the previous government, about how it\u2019s going to be structured, and yet they still mislead the population. \u201cI think it\u2019s very deliberate,\u201d he said. The Calma-Langton report recommended the national voice have 24 members, with two from each state, the Northern Territory, ACT and Torres Strait. A further five members would represent remote areas and an additional member would represent Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. Members would serve four-year terms, with half the membership determined every two years. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, to make the sort of statements they make.

The owners and operators of Taqueria Garibaldi, a Sacramento-based restaurant chain, are also accused of threatening workers and fabricating timesheets as part of an effort to obstruct an investigation into the business. The US Department of Labor previously found that the company illegally denied workers overtime pay. The labor department launched an investigation into Taqueria Garibaldi in 2021, at which point the business owners instructed employees to tell investigators that they worked 40 hours a week, were provided two days off and 30-minute breaks, and were paid only with checks, court records show. Workers were also prohibited from using their usual digital attendance tracker and were instead told to write that they were only working 40-hour weeks on paper timesheets that were then processed by a third-party payroll company. Employees did as they were told under threat of retaliatory actions such as firing and holding immigration statuses over their heads, according to the labor department. \u201cThis employer\u2019s despicable attempts to retaliate against employees were intended to silence workers, obstruct an investigation and prevent the recovery of unpaid wages,\u201d Marc Pilotin, the labor department\u2019s regional solicitor of labor, said in a press release. In what the labor department described as \u201camong the most shameless\u201d efforts to intimidate workers that investigators have seen, the owners of Garibaldi also brought in a fake priest to conduct confession sessions with employees. Once employees sat with the \u201cpriest\u201d they were peppered with work-specific questions and asked whether they had any ill feelings toward their employers or had spoken negatively about them to anyone, including investigators. \u201cUnder oath, an employee of Taqueria Garibaldi explained how the restaurant offered a supposed priest to hear their workplace \u2018sins\u2019 while other employees reported that a manager falsely claimed that immigration issues would be raised by the department\u2019s investigation,\u201d Pilotin said. After local reporters covered the labor department\u2019s lawsuit against the restaurant chain in May 2021, the business fired Maria Parra, an employee who they believed had filed the original complaint to the labor department. \u201cFirst, Defendants fired Maria Parra for cooperating with the government and then used the firing to intimidate other employees,\u201d court records stated. In addition to paying back wages and damages to 35 workers and $5,000 to the Department of Labor, the owners and operators of Taqueria Garibaldi are also required to use a digital time clock system at each location that allows employees to accurately record their work times and must submit payroll and employee contact information to the labor department upon request for the next three years."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f98", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/22/cost-of-living-crisis-forcing-students-to-take-on-more-hours-of-paid-work", "primaryCategory": "education", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cost of living crisis forcing students to take on more hours of paid work", "lead": "Most university students supporting themselves say it is negatively affecting their studies, survey finds", "author": "Richard Adams Education editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 23:01:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222945", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9d824fd1c09b4a15625510acd997591e9d5c16ca/0_219_5877_3526/500.jpg", "body": "The cost of living crisis is forcing more university students to take on more hours in their part-time jobs, with most saying that supporting themselves is affecting their studies, according to a new study. More than half of the 10,000 students surveyed by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) said they did paid work during term time, with most saying they were using their wages to support their studies. \u201cThe results highlight that financial concerns are felt across the board, and particularly by disadvantaged students, indicating a need for the sector to treat this as a matter of priority,\u201d the authors said. In 2021, the survey found that 34% of UK students had jobs while studying, rising to 45% last year and 55% this year. The survey found that 28% of students working 10 or more hours of paid work said they needed the money to cover most of their living costs. On average students did paid work for 13.5 hours each week, with 14% saying they needed the income to pay for most or all of their costs. Older students, aged over 26, and those with children or caring responsibilities were also more likely to need to work for extra income. Nick Hillman, Hepi\u2019s director, said students who did long hours of paid work on top of their studies were in a \u201cdanger zone\u201d of academic underachievement. \u201cEverybody in the survey are full-time students so they should all be doing something similar to a full-time job,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing 17 hours paid work or 20 hours paid work on top of that, that\u2019s when it really affects your studies and it makes you more likely to drop out [and] less likely to do well in your degree.\u201d A spokesperson for advocacy organisation University UK said: \u201cThis data definitively shows that students\u2019 university experience is being negatively impacted by the cost of living crisis, with further support needed from governments.\u201d The next cohort of students in England face even more challenging prospects after graduation, according to consumer finance guru Martin Lewis. Lewis said a series of \u201csubtle but massive\u201d changes to the student loans system that come into force from September will mean some repaying up to twice as much of their loans compared with earlier graduates. The changes mean that a graduate who studies in England and later earns \u00a330,000 will repay \u00a3450 a year, compared with one who graduated this year repaying just \u00a3243 on the same salary. The government\u2019s changes lower the earning threshold at which student loan repayments begin, from \u00a327,295 to \u00a325,000, while the repayment term is extended from 30 years to 40 years. That means 52% of graduates are expected to repay their loans in full, compared with 23% at the moment. \u201cOn the surface it looks like a tweak, in practice it will increase the cost by over 50% for many typical graduates and double it for a few,\u201d Lewis said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f99", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/sky-launches-sky-live-smart-camera-for-joint-viewing-zoom-and-motion-controlled-games-glass-tv", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Sky launches TV smart camera for joint viewing and motion-controlled games", "lead": "Sky Live camera is hoped to cement firm\u2019s Glass TV as centre of all home entertainment", "author": "Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 23:01:53", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222964", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/653c6a2f41341747f0cbe9b6a4d68f73b9380980/132_0_3963_2378/500.jpg", "body": "Sky has launched a smart camera for its streaming television to allow customers to watch live and on-demand TV remotely with friends, place video calls via Zoom, track workouts and play motion-controlled games. The Sky Live camera is an add-on service for the firm\u2019s broadband-powered TV set and forms part of its attempt to cement the traditional television as the centre of all home entertainment in the face of competing technologies and streaming services. Sky, which was acquired by the US media company Comcast since 2018, is vying for viewers with services such as Netflix and Disney+. Sky Live costs from \u00a36 a month on a 48-month interest-free term similar to its Glass TVs, on which it is dependent, or \u00a3290 outright. Introductory offers will bring down the cost to \u00a33 a month if bundled with a TV. The device has a four-mic array and 12-megapixel wide-angle camera with automatic framing designed to work well in often small and dark British living rooms. A light indicates when the camera is on, and a button on the top can mute the mics and disconnect the camera for privacy. The Watch Together feature allows up to 12 households with Glass TVs and cameras to watch content from Sky\u2019s platform, including live sport, in sync alongside a small video call window. The broadcaster will hope to outmuscle rivals, such as Apple\u2019s SharePlay, by offering its range of live TV channels. Video-call capabilities provided by Zoom will allow users to connect on a variety of devices using their own pre-existing accounts. The automatic framing, content sharing from other devices and other features will offer a consumer-friendly version of the conference calling equipment commonly used in offices. The Live camera can also track body movement using machine learning. This allows motion-controlled games and entertainment experiences \u2013 including a version of the popular Fruit Ninja and a rhythm game called Starri that resembles Meta\u2019s Beat Saber \u2013 without needing a VR headset. Some of the other 27 apps include an upcoming Peppa Pig experience, where children can engage directly with the story; a connected Monopoly game; and an augmented-reality video booth that puts filters on your face. The motion-tracking also enables guided workouts that put a personal trainer on the TV. Developed in partnership with fitness firm WithU, the Mvmnt app offers more than 130 interactive workouts using the camera to count reps and analyse your form, providing real-time guidance on how to correctly perform each exercise."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f9a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/22/health-bosses-warn-of-heart-disease-emergency-in-england", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Health bosses warn of heart disease emergency in England", "lead": "Charity calls for prioritisation of NHS heart care after nearly 100,000 excess deaths since March 2020", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 23:01:52", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.222982", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0972bd12e050c8f88b80f35216f75c55d2eb42/0_15_4484_2690/500.jpg", "body": "England is engulfed in a cardiovascular disease emergency, health bosses have said, as stark figures reveal there have been almost 100,000 excess deaths since the start of the Covid pandemic. Analysis of official government data suggests that more than 500 people a week are dying needlessly from heart disease, heart attacks or strokes. There have been 96,540 extra cardiovascular-related deaths since March 2020, according to the report by the British Heart Foundation. In the first year of the pandemic, Covid-19 infections led to a surge in excess cardiovascular deaths, the charity said. But while deaths from Covid-19 have since fallen, the number of cardiovascular disease deaths have remained much higher than expected. The BHF said other factors were likely to be driving the continued increase in excess deaths involving cardiovascular disease, including severe and ongoing disruption to NHS heart services. \u201cCovid-19 no longer fully explains the significant numbers of excess deaths involving cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and associate medical director at the BHF. \u201cOther major factors are likely contributing, including the extreme and unrelenting pressure on the NHS over the last few years. \u201cLong waits for heart care are dangerous \u2013 they put someone at increased risk of avoidable hospital admission, disability due to heart failure and premature death. Yet people are struggling to get potentially lifesaving heart treatment when they need it due to a lack of NHS staff and space, despite cardiovascular disease affecting record numbers of people.\u201d The BHF is calling for action on three fronts: the prioritisation of NHS heart care, renewed focus on preventing the causes of cardiovascular disease, and greater research efforts to unlock new treatments and cures for the future. \u201cAs more and more heart patients wait longer and longer, we need to see a specific and long-term commitment from government to fast-track improvements in cardiovascular care now and for the future,\u201d Babu-Narayan said. Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said it was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d that so many more people with cardiovascular disease were losing their lives. England was \u201cfirmly in the grip of a heart and stroke care emergency\u201d, she said. \u201cIf little changes, we could continue to see a sustained rise in death rates from cardiovascular conditions that undoes decades of scientific progress to reduce the number of people who die of a heart attack or stroke. There is no time to waste \u2013 government must take control of this crisis to give heart patients and their loved ones hope of a better and healthier future,\u201d Griffiths said. Prof John Greenwood, the president of the British Cardiovascular Society, said the high numbers of excess deaths were worrying but not surprising. \u201cWe know that Covid has caused direct [Covid leading to new cardiovascular disease], indirect [reduced treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease] and long-term effects [cardiovascular disease and long Covid],\u201d he said. He added that there must be an \u201curgent prioritisation\u201d of cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, as well as an increase in staff to tackle the backlog of patients waiting for treatment. \u201cAdded to this, we need a strong public health strategy from government to promote healthy behaviours and prevent heart disease in the first place.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f9b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/22/big-tech-digital-markets-unit-cma-rishi-sunak", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Big tech is trying to weaken new digital markets regulator, Rishi Sunak warned", "lead": "A legal battle is brewing over how giant firms will be able to appeal against new unit\u2019s decisions", "author": "Alex Hern UK technology editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 23:01:52", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223000", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/767e13f1f4db69dcfed6ba7c6f71a8abd1696ebf/0_768_5675_3407/500.jpg", "body": "Big tech is trying to use its vast coffers to neuter the powers of the UK\u2019s new tech regulator, Rishi Sunak has been warned, as a fight over the courts becomes the latest battleground for overseeing Silicon Valley. Under the digital markets, competition and consumers bill, which is passing through parliament, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be empowered to set strict new rules on large online platforms such as Apple\u2019s App Store, Amazon\u2019s Marketplace and Google\u2019s search engine. But a technical dispute has become the focus of heated lobbying from the companies the bill seeks to cover, as well as their competitors in other industries. Firms such as Apple, Meta and Microsoft have told the House of Lords that they want the ability to appeal against the new Digital Markets Unit\u2019s (DMU) decisions in a \u201cfull merits\u201d review, allowing them the chance to fight unfavourable decisions from every angle. That stands in contrast to the current draft of the bill, which gives businesses the right to ask for a judicial review of cases, but only one that assesses whether the DMU follows its own rules. A broad coalition of organisations, including trade bodies for mid-sized tech firms, the newspaper, publishing and bookselling industries and smaller e-commerce sites wrote to Rishi Sunak calling for the government not to bend under such pressure. The Guardian is a member of the News Media Association, which coordinated and signed the letter. \u201cThe judicial review standard for appealing CMA decisions must be maintained to ensure that the objectives of the new pro-competition regime can be realised,\u201d the joint letter said. \u201cJudicial review is a tried and tested mechanism for appealing regulatory decisions across forward-looking regulatory regimes in the UK, including the CMA\u2019s existing merger control and market investigation powers.\u201d The organisations warned that the \u201cunlimited legal budgets\u201d of the companies the DMU intends to regulate meant they \u201ccould leverage their resources in the courts to obstruct and delay the entire regime\u201d. Speaking to peers on Tuesday, a big tech executive said a judicial review would not be the right fit for such an exercise. \u201cThe JR standard is more focused on process and procedure,\u201d said Kyle Andeer, an Apple legal VP. \u201cFrom our perspective, there really needs to be a strong merit-based review that focuses on the evidence supporting the outcomes here.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Chlo\u00e9 MacEwen said the judicial review standard could impose \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the system. \u201cWe\u2019re very conscious of the UK\u2019s ambitions, especially for new investment, and for science and tech superpower status. We are quite supportive of regulation, but what we are less sure about is uncertainty.\u201d The two were joined by representatives of Amazon, Meta and Google, all of whom agreed that they would prefer to face an appeals standard that let them query whether the regulator\u2019s decision \u201cmight not be the right one\u201d. Tina Stowell, the chair of the Lords committee holding the hearing, said on Tuesday that Apple had a reported legal budget of $1bn a year, and that one single legal staffer at the company was paid $26m in 2021. \u201cI suspect that is larger than the whole of the CMA\u2019s legal budget,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25f9c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/mps-vote-down-labour-attempt-to-revive-animal-welfare-bill", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "MPs vote down Labour attempt to revive animal welfare bill", "lead": "Motion to bring back legislation on puppy smuggling and live exports that was part of Tory manifesto rejected in Commons", "author": "Hayden Vernon", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 22:35:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223038", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ee70a4643c5ab9ea03df7dda85c5f04091f8c4f3/0_240_1600_960/500.jpg", "body": "MPs have voted down an attempt by Labour to revive the government\u2019s animal welfare bill.

Labour attempted to force the bill back into parliament with an opposition day motion on Wednesday. While some backbench Tory MPs were expected to back Labour, MPs voted by 256 votes to 183 to reject the motion.

We cannot go on allowing cruel practices such as the live exports of animals for slaughter and the puppy import trade.\u201d Claire Bass, senior director of campaigns and public affairs at the Humane Society, said: \u201cAnimals are not political footballs and they needed MPs to come together today in order for progress to be made, but very disappointingly that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWith this plan voted down, we are left with the government\u2019s insistence on its \u2018plan B\u2019 to deliver manifesto commitments to animals \u2013 to demote them to the lottery of private members bills, which are likely five months away from even starting. All the time politicians dither, animals are suffering unnecessarily.\u201d While some Tory MPs spoke in favour of bringing back the bill during the Commons debate, Labour was criticised for trying to reintroduce the bill instead of tabling a motion in support of it. Former Conservative party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the Commons: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t really, I think, have found ourselves in a situation where this bill had to be dumped.

They impress on her their connection to the land (\u201cSee this earth, we were born on it \u2026 by those bins over there\u201d) and reluctantly rent her the filthy, broken-down caravan in which their \u201cfeythur\u201d recently carked it. This means \u201cfather\u201d in the Forester dialect and, if you hope to follow the plot, shouldn\u2019t be confused with The Verderer (Jim Howick from Ghosts), angry local radio DJ and self-appointed woodland guardian, who is another of the eccentrics Linda encounters. There\u2019s also the ruggedly handsome Pig Man (Jerome Flynn), pub lothario Tony (Paul Whitehouse) and Joy (Motherland\u2019s Tanya Moodie) a calm, centred presence who becomes Linda\u2019s guide to the strange ways of the village traditionalists. It\u2019s The Vicar of Dibley in biker leathers, essentially; this story of a lone middle-aged woman shaking things up in a tight-knit rural community, but further enhanced by the folky feminism that runs through Gloucester-born Christie\u2019s comedy like the River Severn. The feminism bit, at least, has been evident since her 2013 breakthrough with her Edinburgh comedy award-winning standup show, A Bic for Her, and 2015 memoir-manifesto Book For Her, but fans of the excellent lockdown-era Radio 4 series, Mortal, will also know of Christie\u2019s fascination with pagan rituals and natural world rhythms. All this has been translated into an attractive televisual aesthetic by director Al Campbell (still probably best known as Barry Shitpeas from Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe, despite his many TV comedy directing credits). It\u2019s sun-dappled woodland clearings, the peaceful companionship of a half-empty pub, and a wistful folk music soundtrack \u2013 like a less blokey Detectorists. But while that beloved BBC show was content to meander towards some sense of meaning, The Change strides purposefully towards its culmination, in a revamped, gender-balanced version of the village\u2019s annual festival. Linda features centrally in this, of course, in a series of sensational outfits (we\u2019re calling it Sheela-na-gig chic), while delivering speeches on the stages of womanhood that are genuinely affecting. There\u2019s stuff here that we rarely see on TV. Linda\u2019s relationship with her furiously self-denying, righteously judgmental older sister (Liza Tarbuck) offers insight into a larger rift in feminism and might have benefitted from more narrative space to breathe. But Christie, via \u201cLinda\u201d, has so much more to say \u2013 about pigs and trees, single-sex spaces and blackface morris dancing \u2013 that with only six, 25-minute episodes to say it in, the show\u2019s pacing can feel a little panicked, and its resolutions a little pat. (If only all small-minded bigots were as amenable to reasoning as the ones Linda encounters!) Ideally she\u2019d have extended her summer stay in that grimy caravan for a week or two longer. It would have been nice to linger a while.

One cannot call it a radical idea, however. First, it\u2019s in the interests of lenders themselves, up to a point, to be flexible by, say, lengthening the term of the loan, granting a payment holiday or allowing a borrower to switch to interest-only arrangements for a while. Second, many banks say they already have such policies in place, even if critics say they\u2019re not advertising them with enthusiasm. Ultimately, though, the worst outcome for banks would be a demand-crushing crash in the value of houses. They would also definitely wish to avoid a situation in which politicians start to ask if their fabled \u201caffordability checks\u201d on home loans were up to scratch. And the good news is that lenders can definitely tolerate a round of political arm-twisting that demands greater levels of forbearance. A feature of the current rate-hiking cycle that began in December 2021 is the remarkably low level of bad debts and defaults that have appeared. On the business side of their lending books, banks did not see the pandemic-created defaults they imagined at the outset. \u201cResilience\u201d is a commonly used word by banks in recent quarterly reports about commercial lending. On the mortgage and consumer side, unemployment has always been the best predictor of defaults: since we currently have the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s, the picture has also been solid there. Meanwhile, net interest margins \u2013 the difference between what a bank pays to depositors and what it charges on loans \u2013 have been rising. So, yes, if forbearance requires banks to absorb a few costs, they can afford it. Labour is pushing in the right direction, even as it accepts \u201csome lenders are offering similar measures\u201d to the ones it proposes and that this is really about creating a uniform approach. The interesting part of the plan, then, comes down to its urging of the government to tell the Financial Conduct Authority, the chief financial regulator, to issue a formal instruction to lenders that borrowers\u2019 credit score should be unaffected, a point made by campaigner Martin Lewis. Borrowers would get a right to request a temporary interest-only arrangement or a longer repayment term; lenders would have to wait six months before initiating repossession proceedings. Measures would be reviewed after 12 months. Would an FCA order, as opposed to the usual regulatory \u201cguidance\u201d to treat customers fairly, help? Possibly: borrowers could enter a conversation with their lender knowing what to expect. And the six-month non-repossession measure might offer a degree of comfort, even if lenders say a repossession process already takes longer. But let\u2019s not pretend that Labour has somehow discovered an ingenious way to defuse the \u201cmortgage timebomb\u201d. An ability to defer or smooth payments is only an indirect form of support: the interest and principal still have to be paid eventually. Like the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, Labour seems to have concluded that offering direct support for mortgage holders cannot be justified. Quite right too: there\u2019s no point in having the government and the Bank of England pull in opposite directions, and direct handouts for homeowners is surely a non-starter when renters tend to be poorer. It is only a handful of Trussite Tory MPs (and, oddly, John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s former shadow chancellor) who are flirting with the idea of reintroducing tax relief on mortgage interest. The Labour leadership, then, is within the consensus that says help for homeowners should take the form of tweaks to mortgage terms. Still, it\u2019s smart politics to be seen to crank up the pressure on the banks. Hunt is meeting their chief executives on Friday. The chancellor will now be under more pressure to produce something meatier than the loose \u201ccommitments\u201d that usually emerge from such encounters."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/21/labour-rishi-sunak-rachel-reeves-mortgage-plan", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Labour piles pressure on Sunak with plan to prevent \u2018mortgage catastrophe\u2019", "lead": "Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says party would force banks to take a range of steps to protect borrowers", "author": "Kiran Stacey", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 21:30:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223114", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b4dad364a484da4f24dc07c776b55b119da36ce4/0_43_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Labour has piled further pressure on Rishi Sunak to take action to help struggling mortgage holders as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates again to levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crash. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said on Wednesday that if Labour were currently in power, it would force banks to offer a range of support to borrowers, including letting them move on to interest-only mortgages and extending their repayment period. The intervention comes as the Bank of England is expected to raise rates again on Thursday, possibly by as much as 0.5 percentage points \u2013 a move that would lead to millions of households losing major chunks of their income in the coming months. Reeves said: \u201cAcross Britain, people are being hit hard by a Tory mortgage penalty. Unlike this government, Labour will not stand by as millions face a mortgage catastrophe made in Downing Street.\u201d Labour\u2019s announcement does not amount to a promise to enact such changes if the party is elected at the next election. But it does amplify growing calls for the prime minister to take similar action, before a meeting between the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and major banks on Friday. Concern is growing among economists and members of the Conservative party about the fallout from the \u201cmortgage timebomb\u201d. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation stuck at 8.7%, as economists warned that rising wages could mean it takes longer to drop to pre-pandemic levels. Stubbornly high inflation has in turn caused banks to ramp up their mortgage interest rates above 6% for the first time since Liz Truss\u2019 botched mini-budget last year. Conservative MPs are beginning to worry about the possible electoral fallout as borrowers roll off existing deals on to much more expensive ones. A half-a-percentage-point rise would take the Bank\u2019s base rate to 5%, a level last seen in April 2008. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on Wednesday said 1.4 million UK mortgage holders would lose a fifth of their disposable income as they rolled off their fixed-rate plans. Labour says the average mortgage holder is having to pay \u00a32,900 a year extra thanks to higher interest rates since the mini-budget, while the IFS said the costs would be disproportionately borne by younger borrowers. Conservative MPs have begun to worry whether high mortgage costs could cost them their seats at the next election, which is expected to take place next year, and are now urging ministers to intervene. Jake Berry, chair of the Northern Research Group of \u201cred wall\u201d Conservative MPs, called on Tuesday for the government to bring back tax relief on mortgage interest payments \u2013 a scheme scrapped by the former Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 2000. His call was echoed by Jonathan Gullis, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, who told the Commons: \u201cMortgage payers \u2026 are rightly worried at this moment in time, with the impending rebrokering that they are facing.\u201d Hunt will meet major mortgage lenders on Friday in an attempt to encourage them to do all they can to help mortgage holders. A Downing Street spokesperson said on Wednesday that the chancellor wanted banks to offer \u201cthe best possible products for their consumers\u201d, but ministers have so far ruled out taking any stronger action. Sunak said during prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday that the best way to cut costs for homeowners would be to reduce inflation; he has promised to cut it in half by the end of the year. Officials say that if they intervene to help mortgage holders, it would dampen the effect of the Bank of England raising interest rates in an effort to curtail consumer spending. Speaking at a PM Connect event with voters on Thursday, Sunak will stress that he views cutting inflation as his first priority. \u201cBeating inflation has to be the priority, because if we don\u2019t get a grip on inflation now, the damage will be worse and longer-lasting,\u201d the prime minister will say. Karen Ward, a member of Hunt\u2019s economic advisory council, said on Wednesday that the Bank of England would have to \u201ccreate a recession\u201d to bring down inflation. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, has called for the government to introduce a \u00a33bn mortgage protection fund. Labour is calling for a series of interventions that would not require any additional money. Reeves said on Wednesday that if she were chancellor, she would require financial regulators to force banks to help mortgage holders. Under Labour\u2019s plans, banks would be required to allow lenders to switch to interest-only repayments, extend their mortgage repayment period, reverse these measures at any point, and would have to wait at least six months before seeking to repossess a property, and make sure none of this had an impact on borrowers\u2019 credit ratings. The FCA says it has already given guidance to banks to encourage them to offer support along those lines if they felt it was in a borrower\u2019s best interests. But regulators say forcing banks to offer such support could impede their ability to decide what is in the best interests of each individual borrower. Tim Pitt, a former Conservative Treasury adviser, said he did not expect ministers to bow to pressure and copy Labour\u2019s approach. \u201cThe FCA guidance is already there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could toughen some of that, but in reality they have limited ability to do much more than they already have.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/there-she-goes-review-a-beautiful-cathartic-return-for-david-tennant-and-jessica-hynes", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "There She Goes review \u2013 a beautiful, cathartic return for David Tennant and Jessica Hynes", "lead": "This taboo-breaking comedy about parenting a child with disabilities is back for a one-off special with an air of finality.

It took me a minute to find the answer: you can\u2019t undo it. You can never undo it. Mortgages and marriages and other things that seem permanent are, in fact, easily dismantled, but once you are a kid\u2019s parent, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a life sentence. Most parents don\u2019t want to be freed, because they love their child so completely that returning to a world without them feels absurd. There She Goes, however, is a comedy about people who have longed for a reset button. Emily (Jessica Hynes) and Simon (David Tennant) have a learning-disabled daughter, Rosie (Miley Locke), who is non-verbal and exhibits extremely challenging behaviour due to a chromosomal disorder. Every day is a nightmare of torn books, smashed possessions, smeared food and scratched skin, to a soundtrack of grinding screeches where the girl\u2019s words should be. With the regular joys of parenting out of reach, the show and its characters have had to fight to find their own. There She Goes runs on two timelines. In the earlier one, Rosie is a baby/toddler, and the shock of knowing that their lives will always now be difficult has pushed Em and Si into deep lows. While she grieved for the daughter she expected to have and doubted she could love Rosie instead, he submerged himself in raging self-pity and wine, both of them breaking the taboo of wishing their child were different. Writers Sarah Crawford and Shaun Pye, basing Em and Si on themselves, have been unstinting in showing us their own frailties, in the process reaching out to take the hands not just of parents of disabled children, but of any mother who worries she won\u2019t bond with her baby, and any father who fears he is not emotionally equipped for the job. By the end of season two, the flashback versions of Em and Si had put coping mechanisms in place and had begun to find fulfilment in their task, but the journey to get there would have been unbearable without the main timeline, a decade on, where the family are as settled as they can be. There, the series is something like a traditional family sitcom in which birthday parties, holidays and trips to the park or swimming pool have all inevitably gone awry, Simon forever undercutting the struggle with wicked jokes at Rosie\u2019s expense: \u201cShe\u2019s half Rain Man. She can throw a box of matches on the ground. She just can\u2019t count them.\u201d Now they are back for a one-off special that has an air of finality. The older Rosie is 13 and is trickier than ever to wrestle with when out and about, to the point that the family is visited by a police officer investigating a report of a child abduction. Si enjoys winding up the copper: \u201cYou\u2019d have to be insane trying to kidnap her. Five minutes of that noise, you\u2019d chop your own ears off.\u201d There She Goes is more than a show trying to be funny about a hard situation; it is a show about funny people who wouldn\u2019t survive their situation if they couldn\u2019t wisecrack their way through it. One of countless lovely touches is the way it never forgets who Em and Si used to be: the new episode has Rosie surging into puberty, which prompts the series\u2019 most disturbing scene yet, but also makes Em wonder whether Rosie \u2013 grumpy, inert, no friends \u2013 is a goth and should have a poster of Wayne Hussey from the Mission above her bed. Si gets the reference. In the flashbacks, Emily has gained enough equilibrium to think the unthinkable and suggest trying for another baby. Previously, the twin timelines have worked to reassure us: we know the family won\u2019t disintegrate because we know their future selves. Now that is flipped, since we know Em will not get her wish, so the story acquires yet another layer of sadness and regret, worked through and overcome. Bittersweet doesn\u2019t really cover it. In the present, however, a happy ending is in sight. Moments of closure are granted to the supporting cast\u2019s many minor heroes, as a series that has made us burst suddenly into tears several times, always at people unexpectedly revealing the depth of their kindness, does so again. A scene playing on one of Em and Si\u2019s perpetual miseries \u2013 being judged by strangers \u2013 brilliantly contrives a way to allow them something like that moment all parents crave, when they can relax and enjoy a job well done. The last ever scene, if that is what it is to be, is supremely cathartic if you have worked out exactly what you are seeing, and still beautiful if you haven\u2019t. Bringing up Rosie has been agony; we wouldn\u2019t change any of it. \u2022 There She Goes aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/22/morning-mail-titan-sub-search-focuses-on-underwater-noises-islanders-fight-gas-plan-house-prices-to-rise", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Morning Mail: Titan sub search focuses on underwater \u2018noises\u2019, Islanders fight gas plan, house prices to rise", "lead": "More sounds have been heard in the area being searched for the submersible missing in the North Atlantic", "author": "Martin Farrer", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 20:46:26", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223149", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dbacae8d8768df9ca34377a5a1da9407cf9b94cb/45_0_5910_3547/500.jpg", "body": "Morning, everyone.

She shared with other young British designers of the late 1960s and 70s a taste for clothes that were near-craftworks, which pleased the eye just hung on a rail, and satisfied even inside out because of thoughtful construction and finish. Hers photographed well, but lived better, especially her discreet not-quite-suits in crepe with artwork details, which are now collected to be worn rather than as period pieces. Wainwright, who has died aged 82, had a vocation for the clothes themselves and the processes of their making. At 20, she had won a place on Janey Ironside\u2019s revolutionary course at the Royal College of Art in London. Before becoming professor of fashion, Ironside had been a skilled, imaginative dressmaker, and she taught students (including Ossie Clark, Bill Gibb and Zandra Rhodes) that fashion should be more than a transient look transmitted through images: clothes could be physical pleasures, and should serve their wearer\u2019s identity, not subsume it. Ironside demanded that her proteges be grounded in the grinding business of production, too, and Wainwright took that task on early. While still at the RCA she was permitted to design part-time for a mass-manufacture firm, Simon Massey, which was widening its customers from those who bought inexpensive much-blurred Paris copies to the young, who wanted an affordable version of wacky boutique designers. After graduation, Wainwright was given her own \u201cdesigned by\u201d label inside Massey garments within a year, and worked for the firm through the 60s. The job was an education in compromise \u2013 if she produced an original textile design it often had to be printed on unsuitable cheap fabric to keep within budget, and she had to deal with factories (all in the UK) to ensure they would machine enough quantity to an adequate standard by deadline. The experience paid off when she began to work independently from 1972, and, having bought out her founding investors, with her own company from 1974, named Forty Seven Poland Street after its Soho address. No more Banlon: Wainwright could afford quality raw materials \u2013 Bernard Nevill\u2019s figured velvets, Celia Birtwell\u2019s graphic chiffons, silk woven to order in Lyon or printed to imitate vintage samples she found in California. Wainwright knew which factories could handle dressmaker-level finishes, roll chiffon edges or top-stitch crepe, since her concept for her label lay between the detailing of one-off creations (with appliques and embroidery done by specialists) and semi-volume manufacture. Her evening wear had an appeal much like the then-admired vintage art deco pieces \u2013 it had a Roxy Music retro glamour, subtler than glitz. Despite the steep prices that resulted from first-class fabric and time-consuming details, Wainwright was soon exporting 60% of her output, proud to have sales among the picky stylish of France and Japan; as well as grand US department store buyers, including Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, she had a concession in Harvey Nichols, and was a regular label in Harrods and Selfridges. Although a loyal customer might be favoured with a bespoke wedding dress, Wainwright had no interest in celebrity, either clients\u2019 or her own. Her core firm stayed small, around 20 people, including her sister, Wendy, as head of marketing, plus, in the 80s, Horace the computer to deal with stock control. They made limited concessions to the industry changes that brought in heightened publicity and advertising, offshore production, and a sharpened division between high-profile couture and high-volume but very short-lived mass fashion (the young of the 60s had bought fewer items and worn them more often). Wainwright retired in 1990, though continued to lecture to students, as she had since leaving college. She acknowledged her debt to education: her parents, Joseph and Irene (nee Lowe), had left school at 14, later finding security in civil service jobs in the Ministry of Defence. She was born in Doe Lea, Derbyshire, and grew up in what she recalled as a succession of ever-bigger council houses in Wimbledon, south-west London, and went to the Willows school in nearby Morden. She chose to channel her talent for art towards fashion, as a possible employment path for a woman, beginning with Saturday morning drawing classes. At 15, she went to Wimbledon School of Art, then Kingston School of Art, then the RCA, where she proved the kind of scholarship winner Ironside believed in. Wainwright married in 1968 David Cripps, who had trained as a graphic designer but became a great still-life photographer, especially of crafted objects; they had a son, Aaron, and divorced in 1973. After retirement, Wainwright moved to Sydney, Australia, where she re-encountered the architect and artist Rollin Schlict, whom she had met in his bohemian youth in 60s London. They married in 2003; he died in 2011, and she returned to the UK in 2017. She is survived by Aaron and her grandchildren, Daisy and Ned. \u2022 Janice Wainwright, fashion designer, born 2 December 1940; died 3 June 2023"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/live/2023/jun/21/samuel-alito-gifts-supreme-court-trump-biden-latest-news", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Senior senators threaten to step up supreme court ethics reform after Samuel Alito revelations \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Alito reportedly accepted seat on private plane owned by Paul Singer; expert says he should have recused himself from Singer cases before the court", "author": "Maya Yang (now); Gloria Oladipo (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 20:04:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223185", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/920ba101bd5d94992458efd6ac29d36c67fe81cc/0_0_4053_2432/500.jpg", "body": "It is slightly past 4pm in Washington DC. Here is a wrap up of the day\u2019s key events: Supreme court justice Samuel Alito is facing questions for not declaring several gifts received from conservative billionaire Paul Singer, and for not recusing himself when Singer had cases presented before the court. The latest report questioning the ethics of supreme court justices came from ProPublica, which recently published several articles on the relationship between justice Clarence Thomas and Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. The powerful governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-backed investment fund has been invited to testify before a Senate committee in the wake of a proposed merger between Saudi-backed LIV Tour and the PGA, raising the possibility the executive could be questioned under oath about issues ranging from the future of golf to the execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, was invited to testify on July 11 by the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, whose chairman, Democratic senator Dick Blumenthal, is one of the toughest critics of Saudi on Capitol Hill. A January 6 rioter who attacked a Capitol Hill police officer in the neck with a stun gun has been jailed for 12 years. Daniel \u201cDJ\u201d Rodriguez yelled, \u201cTrump won!\u201d as he was led out of the courtroom where the US district judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced him to 12 years and seven months behind bars for his role in the attack on Congress. Only two other January 6 defendants have received longer prison terms after hundreds of sentencings for Capitol riot cases. Over a quarter of registered voters in the US have indicated that they will only vote for candidates who share the same beliefs as them on abortion. More than a quarter of registered US voters say they will only vote for candidates who share their beliefs on abortion, according to a poll released on Wednesday, a total (28%) one point higher than last year. As the US marks one year since the end of Roe v Wade, the Democratic National Committee is launching a six-figure ad campaign to highlight the stakes of the 2024 elections. The campaign, which starts tomorrow, includes billboards and digital ads in battleground states like Georgia and Arizona, as well as marquee locations like Times Square in New York City. Two senior senators have threatened to step up legislation on supreme court ethics reform following a report saying Samuel Alito had failed to declare a flight paid for by a conservative billionaire. Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate judiciary committee, and Sheldon Whitehouse, chair of the Senate judiciary subcommittee on federal courts, oversight, agency action, and federal rights, have announced a markup in the judiciary committee on ethics reform legislation surrounding the supreme court. Colorado\u2019s rightwing representative Lauren Boebert has introduced a resolution calling for the impeachment of Joe Biden. Boebert introduced the resolution as a privileged resolution which will in turn force the House to vote on the measure in two days. The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the company of knowingly enrolling millions of consumers into its Amazon Prime paid subscription without their consent. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle, the FTC accused Amazon of using \u201cmanipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as \u2018dark patterns\u2019 to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions.\u201d That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. For the full story on Samuel Alito\u2019s failure to disclose his luxury gifts, click here: Thank you for following along. The powerful governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-backed investment fund has been invited to testify before a Senate committee in the wake of a proposed merger between Saudi-backed LIV Tour and the PGA, raising the possibility the executive could be questioned under oath about issues ranging from the future of golf to the execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, was invited to testify on July 11 by the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, whose chairman, Democratic senator Dick Blumenthal, is one of the toughest critics of Saudi on Capitol Hill. Jay Monahan, the PGA commissioner, and LIV Golf League chief executive and commissioner Greg Norman, were also invited to testify. The proposed merger of LIV Tour and PGA, which also involves the DP World Tour, has received a frosty reception on Capitol Hill, where it is facing questions not only from Blumenthal, but also the Senate finance committee. The call for Rumayyan to testify at a hearing, however, marks a new twist. California\u2019s Democratic representative Ted Lieu has responded critically to recent reports of Samuel Alito\u2019s failure to disclose luxury gifts from conservative billionaire Paul Singer. \u201cAmericans used to respect the Supreme Court,\u201d Lieu tweeted. \u201cNow with the flagrant violations of ethical rules and possibly laws by Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas (and potentially other Justices), Americans can rightfully ask: has the Supreme Court turned into a cesspool of corruption?\u201d he added. A January 6 rioter who attacked a Capitol Hill police officer in the neck with a stun gun has been jailed for 12 years: The Associated Press reports: Daniel \u201cDJ\u201d Rodriguez yelled, \u201cTrump won!\u201d as he was led out of the courtroom where the US district judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced him to 12 years and seven months behind bars for his role in the attack on Congress. Only two other January 6 defendants have received longer prison terms after hundreds of sentencings for Capitol riot cases. The judge said Rodriguez, 40, was \u201ca one-man army of hate, attacking police and destroying property\u201d at the Capitol. \u201cYou showed up in DC spoiling for a fight,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame what you did once you got there on anyone but yourself.\u201d A body camera worn by Fanone captured the Metropolitan police officer screaming after Rodriguez shocked him with a stun gun while he was surrounded by a mob. Another rioter had dragged Fanone into the crowd outside a tunnel on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, where police were guarding an entrance. Other rioters began beating Fanone, who lost consciousness and suffered a heart attack after Rodriguez pressed the stun gun against his neck and repeatedly shocked him. Fanone addressed the judge before she imposed the sentence. The former officer described how the January 6 attack prematurely ended his law enforcement career and turned him into a target for Trump supporters who cling to the lie that Democrats stole the 2020 election. For the full story, click here: Two major political action committees have released a statement in response to reports over Samuel Alito\u2019s disclosure failures. The End Citizens United and Let America Vote Action Fund called Alito\u2019s actions \u201cshameful\u201d and also condemned justice Clarence Thomas surrounding his own failures to disclose luxury trips provided by billionaire GOP donor Harlan Crow. \u201cJustice Alito\u2019s relationship with billionaire mega-donor Paul Singer is improper and downright shameful. The mere existence of such a relationship undermines the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the Supreme Court, but what is even more alarming is the concrete evidence proving the corruption within the ranks of the Justices. \u201cThese scandals affirm Americans\u2019 fears about impartiality and fairness. The fundamental question arises: Is justice truly blind, or is it simply a commodity to be bought and sold by those with deep pockets? Justices Alito and Thomas have put a price tag on it. \u201cThese scandals should serve as a wake-up call for Congress to implement and enforce a strict code of ethics. Anything short of this will empower the extremist conservative Justices to continue to engage in this reprehensible behavior.\u201d End Citizen United // Let America Vote Action Fund supports two pieces of legislation that would tackle the ethics problems plaguing the court: the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency (SCERT) Act and the DISCLOSE Act. These bills will offer more transparency into the justices\u2019 outside activities to identify any potential conflicts of interests, and accountability when they run afoul of the law.\u201d Over a quarter of registered voters in the US have indicated that they will only vote for candidates who share the same beliefs as them on abortion. The Guardian\u2019s Erum Salam reports: More than a quarter of registered US voters say they will only vote for candidates who share their beliefs on abortion, according to a poll released on Wednesday, a total (28%) one point higher than last year. The survey, from Gallup, was released before the first anniversary of Dobbs v Jackson, by which conservatives on the supreme court removed the right to abortion that had been safeguarded since Roe v Wade in 1973. A majority of Americans think abortion should be legal at least in some form. Since Dobbs, abortion rights has been seen as a vital motivating factor in a succession of Democratic successes. According to another poll released on Wednesday, by NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist, 57% of Americans say the court was wrong to bring down Roe. According to Gallup, for many voters who do not solely base their vote on abortion, the issue is still important: just 14% of respondents said abortion was not a major issue in deciding how they vote. That was down two points on the same survey last year and nine points from the previous low, 23%, in 2007. In the new Gallup survey, 56% said abortion was just one issue out of many when deciding how to vote. In 2022, 54% gave that answer. Primary elections continue to serve as a testing ground for the issue. For the full story, click here: Democratic lawmakers across California are voicing their discontent with senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s absence in recent years as a result of her old age and health issues. In May, Feinstein returned to senate following an extended medical absence due to shingles. Despite aides reassuring that Feinstein\u2019s health is improving and that she is playing a more active role on Capitol Hill, Democrats remain frustrated over the 89-year old senator, with several of them speaking to CNN. Representative Raul Ruiz said, \u201cThe last time I spoke with her on anything face-to-face was right before the pandemic,\u201d referring to a a conversation he had over three years ago with Feinstein about designating a natural monument in his district. Representative Mike Levin told CNN that the last conversation he remembers having with Feinstein is in 2018, after he won his San Diego area seat. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a while,\u201d Levin said. \u201cI don\u2019t speak with her on a regular basis, and that\u2019s been before any of the recent health challenges she\u2019s had.\u201d \u201cOh boy, I can\u2019t remember. Probably when I was a freshman member,\u201d representative Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, who was elected in 2016 from a district near Los Angeles, told CNN. In response to when the last time they spoke was and whether he could recall any collaborations with Feinstein, six-term representative Mark Takano said, \u201cGosh,\u201d adding, \u201cHard to say anything we\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cOver my 11 years in Congress, I haven\u2019t worked that closely with her,\u201d representative Ami Bera told the outlet. As the US marks one year since the end of Roe v Wade, the Democratic National Committee is launching a six-figure ad campaign to highlight the stakes of the 2024 elections. The campaign, which starts tomorrow, includes billboards and digital ads in battleground states like Georgia and Arizona, as well as marquee locations like Times Square in New York City. The DNC\u2019s digital ad brings attention to some of the Republican presidential candidates\u2019 past controversial comments and legislative actions on abortion access. Donald Trump is heard bragging, \u201cI\u2019m the one that got rid of Roe v Wade,\u201d and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is seen signing his state\u2019s six-week abortion ban into law. Speaking on a press call today, DNC chair Jaime Harrison noted that total abortion bans are widely unpopular with the American people. The Roe reversal is believed to have contributed significantly to Republicans\u2019 disappointing performance in the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cWhile these Republicans are in a race to see who can have the most extreme anti-abortion platform, one thing is for certain: the American people have repeatedly -- repeatedly -- rejected these extremists,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cAnd they will do it again in 2024.\u201d Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, chair of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, predicted Republicans\u2019 stance on abortion access would determine control of the lower chamber next year. \u201cIn 2024, the threat to abortion rights nationwide will be clearer than ever,\u201d DelBene told reporters. \u201cHouse Republicans will not stop until they ban abortion nationwide, and this extremism on reproductive freedoms will cost Republicans the House majority.\u201d Two senior senators have threatened to step up legislation on supreme court ethics reform following a report saying Samuel Alito had failed to declare a flight paid for by a conservative billionaire. Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate judiciary committee, and Sheldon Whitehouse, chair of the Senate judiciary subcommittee on federal courts, oversight, agency action, and federal rights, have announced a markup in the judiciary committee on ethics reform legislation surrounding the supreme court. The announcement said: \u201cThe supreme court is in an ethical crisis of its own making due to the acceptance of lavish gifts from parties with business before the court that several justices have not disclosed. The reputation and credibility of the court are at stake. Chief justice Roberts could resolve this today, but he has not acted. \u201cThe highest court in the land should not have the lowest ethical standards. But for too long that has been the case with the United States supreme court. That needs to change. That\u2019s why when the Senate returns after the July 4th recess, the Senate judiciary committee will mark up supreme court ethics legislation. \u201cWe hope that before that time, chief justice Roberts will take the lead and bring supreme court ethics in line with all other federal judges. But if the court won\u2019t act, then Congress must.\u201d Colorado\u2019s rightwing representative Lauren Boebert has introduced a resolution calling for the impeachment of Joe Biden. Boebert introduced the resolution as a privileged resolution which will in turn force the House to vote on the measure in two days. The resolution calls for Biden to be impeached for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. Using the powers of his high office, President Biden 17 has knowingly presided over an executive branch that has 18 continuously, overtly, and consistently violated Federal 19 immigration law by pursuing an aggressive, open-borders 20 agenda,\u201d it added, accusing Biden of intentionally facilitating a \u201ccomplete and total invasion of the southern border,\u201d it added. Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy has commented on the resolution, telling reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d the Hill reports. This is one of the most serious things you can do as a member of Congress. I think you\u2019ve got to go through the process. You\u2019ve got to have the investigation \u2026 And throwing something on the floor actually harms the investigation that we\u2019re doing right now,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Nebraska\u2019s Republican representative Don Bacon called Boebert\u2019s move \u201cplayground games\u201d. This shouldn\u2019t be playground games, in my view. This should be serious,\u201d he said on Wednesday, the Hill reports. \u201cIf there\u2019s real facts for impeachment then you go there. But doing this is wrong, and I think the majority of the conference feels that way \u2026 Impeachment shouldn\u2019t be something that is frivolous \u2026 We should get to the facts of that, but just doing a privileged motion is wrong.\u201d Senate committee chair Whitehouse, who has organized 10 climate-focused hearings since he took the helm of the Senate budget committee, asked Oreskes to \u201cdescribe for us the academic study of the fossil fuel disinformation operation\u201d. She explained that in 2004, she published a paper on the scientific consensus on the human-caused climate crisis, and that as a result of that paper, she was targeted by a disinformation campaign herself. I started getting hate mail,\u201d she said \u201cI had people file complaints against me at my university and went through some unpleasant experiences as well.\u201d She wasn\u2019t alone. Others, like climate scientist Michael Mann, were attacked in similar ways. That experience of being attacked led me to try to understand what these attacks were, who was funding them, who was behind them, and why they were doing it,\u201d she said. The field of study into climate disinformation, she said, is \u201cmature\u201d. Later, ranking member Grassley asked Pielke to talk about the influence dark money has on Democrats. In 10 climate hearings, Democrats have never asked a single one of their witnesses about their receipts of dark money, let alone attempted to impugn their integrity or accuse them of conspiracy,\u201d he said. Pielke responded: \u201cI can\u2019t explain exactly why your colleagues aren\u2019t willing to look at the dark money ties of their own witnesses,\u201d going on to lob accusations. Oregon senator Jeff Merkley spoke about these accusations later on. He offered a solution for his Republican colleagues who are concerned about dark money\u2019s influence on Democrats. We should simply have all political money be disclosed. And the citizens can decide on what impacts that has.\u201d The DISCLOSE Act, introduced by Whitehouse in the Senate this year, would expose the sources of these clandestine funds. I would invite my colleagues across the aisle to join us in ending dark money on both sides,\u201d said Merkley. Democrats are intensifying their abortion-related attacks on Republicans, as the US prepares to mark one year since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. Speaking at a press conference on Capitol Hill this morning, Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington, noted that 14 states have passed total abortion bans since Roe was reversed on 24 June 2022. Every day, women across our country are confronting a dystopian reality, one where Republican politicians have the final say in their healthcare decisions,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWomen are forced to stay pregnant against their will, even when their health and lives are at risk. Senate Democrats plan to push for legislation providing federal protections for abortion and contraception access, but such a bill will almost certainly fail in the Republican-controlled House. Despite those challenges, Murray emphasized that Democrats would not abandon their efforts to expand and reinforce reproductive rights across the US. \u201cWomen are not going to settle for a country where men in state legislatures are taking away their fundamental freedom to decide what happens to their bodies,\u201d Murray added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not going to settle for a country where their daughters and granddaughters have fewer rights than they did just a year ago.\u201d The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the company of knowingly enrolling millions of consumers into its Amazon Prime paid subscription without their consent. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle, the FTC accused Amazon of using \u201cmanipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as \u2018dark patterns\u2019 to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions\u201d. It went on to detail the ways Amazon allegedly complicated the cancellation process, which the company called \u201cIliad\u201d. For years, Amazon also knowingly complicated the cancellation process for Prime subscribers who sought to end their membership. Under significant pressure from the Commission \u2013 and aware that its practices are legally indefensible \u2013 Amazon substantially revamped its Prime cancellation process for at least some subscribers shortly before the filing of this Complaint. However, prior to that time, the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them. Fittingly, Amazon named that process \u201cIliad,\u201d which refers to Homer\u2019s epic about the long, arduous Trojan War. Amazon designed the Iliad cancellation process (\u201cIliad Flow\u201d) to be labyrinthine, and Amazon and its leadership \u2026 slowed or rejected user experience changes that would have made Iliad simpler for consumers because those changes adversely affected Amazon\u2019s bottom line. It added that Amazon generates $25bn in revenue from Prime memberships and that one of the company\u2019s goals is \u201cincreasing subscriber numbers\u201d. Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse has issued a slew of harsh responses to Alito\u2019s defense of himself in the Wall Street Journal following ProPublica\u2019s reports of his disclosure failures. \u201cOh, my, the questions: First, who orchestrated this weird pre-buttal with the infamous WSJ Polluter Page, and did Alito get help from a PR firm? If so, who paid?\u201d wrote Whitehouse. \u201cThird, why not ask the Financial Disclosure Committee of the Judicial Conference, the body set up exactly for that purpose, for its advice on what should be disclosed? That\u2019s why it\u2019s there,\u201d Whitehouse continued. \u201cAnd what, he just happened to be flying to Alaska and there just happened to be a private jet going to Alaska with an empty seat, and he just happened to find that out, like on some weird billionaire shared-ride Uber?\u201d the senator wrote, adding: \u201cOh, and would that \u201cempty seat\u201d trick fly with legislative or executive ethics disclosures? (Hint: no.) And how about with the Financial Disclosure Committee? (Right, you didn\u2019t ask.) This just keeps getting worse.\u201d The unidentified bail guarantors of George Santos will be revealed on Thursday. Reuters reports that federal judge Joanna Seybert announced that the two people who guaranteed bail for the Republican representative will have their names publicly revealed. Seybert, who said the names will be publicized on Thursday at 12pm ET, rejected Santos\u2019s claims that the public disclosure could threaten the individuals\u2019 safety. Santos, who has pled not guilty to a 13-count indictment accusing him of fraud, money laundering and theft of public funds, has suggested that his guarantors are family members. For more details, click here: The Democratic National Committee will raise pro-choice abortion billboards across key voting states as the country gears up for the 2024 presidential election. The billboard campaign will begin on Thursday in New York City\u2019s Times Square and will also feature in Atlanta, Phoenix, Milwaukee, Tallahassee, and Raleigh, CBS reports. The billboards will highlight the contrast between Democrats and Republicans over their efforts at protecting and banning abortions, a DNC official told CBS. With the one-year anniversary of Roe vs Wade\u2019s overturn coming on Saturday, the DNC will also run social media campaigns this week on Facebook and Instagram, as well as CTV ads across Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia and Arizona. According to CBS, the DNC also plans to deploy officials and surrogates across multiple states to discuss abortion rights across the country this week. Christine Arena, a former public relations executive at the firm Edelman who now works in social impact film-making, testified second. She drew comparisons between the fossil fuel industry\u2019s decades-long misinformation campaign and that helmed by the tobacco industry to cover up the harms of smoking. \u201cJust like the tobacco executives before them, [fossil fuel executives] characterize peer-reviewed science and investigative journalism that illustrates the extent of their deceptions as biased or inconclusive,\u201d said Arena, who was invited to testify by committee chair Sheldon Whitehouse. Richard Painter, a professor of corporate law at University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration, later testified that he is a political independent, and that Americans should get on board with the push to end climate misinformation no matter where they fall on the political spectrum. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue. This is not about being a Democrat or Republican, or an independent,\u201d said Painter, who was also invited by Whitehouse. \u201cThis is about caring, and doing something about a grave threat to the human race.\u201d Painter was followed by two witnesses invited by Republican Senators. The first was Dr Roger Pielke Jr, professor of environmental studies University of Colorado Boulder. He said in 2015, he testified in Congress about climate science, and in response, a member of Congress suggested that he may have been the recipient of undisclosed funding from fossil fuel companies. His university investigated him and found the accusations were not true, he said.\u201cHowever, the very public accusation was enough to derail my work and upset my career in ways that continue today,\u201d he said. Pielke said he believes climate change is real, human-caused and dangerous, but that the Democrats\u2019 concerns are overblown. \u201cOne important role of us experts is to call things as we see them,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes research results are inconvenient or uncomfortable to certain interests, and that includes political interest.\u201d Scott Walker, president of conservative non-profit organization Capital Research Center who also served in the George W Bush administration as special assistant to the president for domestic policy, claimed that the subject of the hearing \u2013 dark money \u2013 is not a major problem in American politics. Further, he insisted, the political left takes more money than the right. To say that a group uses dark money is like saying the group uses telephones. It\u2019s a universal technology,\u201d he said. Senate budget committee chair Sheldon Whitehouse kicked off Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because fossil fuel funded climate disinformation and obstruction is directly causing systemic financial risks to the economy and to the federal budget,\u201d he said. He explained the well-documented misinformation campaign that fossil fuel companies and their allies have waged on the American public. \u201cBeginning as early as the 1950s, industry scientists became aware of climate change, measuring and predicting it decades before it became a public issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew their products were responsible for it\u2026 but industry management and CEOs spent decades promoting climate misinformation.\u201d Ranking member Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, pushed back on the need for such a hearing, saying it constituted a \u201cmissed opportunity to work together on a responsible budget\u201d. \u201cDemocrats have claimed that climate change will cause catastrophic economic collapse due to devastating natural disasters. They have also attributed a Republican rejection of extreme climate policy to win alleged fossil fuel disinformation conspiracy to defraud the public,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cThis premise either insults the integrity or the intelligence of Republican legislators that diligently serve their constituents, as well as our constituents.\u201d The first witness to testify was Harvard history of science professor Naomi Oreskes, who has written several books on oil industry misinformation and who was invited by committee chair Whitehouse. \u201cClimate change is a market failure, and market failures require government action to address,\u201d she said. Fossil fuel companies\u2019 and their front groups\u2019 concerted efforts to disrupt climate policies have come at great expense to America, including not only financial costs, but also human suffering and lives lost, she said. Samuel Alito joins other conservative justices in facing ethics questions for not disclosing multiple gifts he received from billionaire Paul Singer. In April, conservative justice Clarence Thomas came under fire from watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers after ProPublica revealed that he had accepted luxury trips from Harlan Crow, a Republican real estate developer and megadonor. In its investigation, ProPublica found that Crow has donated over $10m in publicly disclosed political contributions. He has also donated to groups that conceal their donors and once said: \u201cI don\u2019t disclose what I\u2019m not required to disclose.\u201d Recent reports also revealed that conservative justice Neil Gorsuch reportedly failed to disclose the buyer of a $1.8m Colorado property which he co-owned in 2021. The buyer was eventually revealed by Politico to be a chief executive of Greenberg Traurig, one of the country\u2019s largest law firms which has made multiple appearances in front of the supreme court. The disclosure failures from multiple conservative justices have prompted widespread criticism among Democrats, who have since been calling for ethics reforms across the court. \u201cIt is not going to be easy,\u201d Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse told NBC in May. \u201cThe work that we\u2019re doing on ethics in the court ought to be easy. And yet it\u2019s not. It\u2019s partisan also. \u201cSo I think that the first step is going to be for the judicial conference, the other judges, to put some constraints around the supreme court\u2019s behavior and treat the supreme court the way all other federal judges are treated.\u201d Democratic representative Lisa Blunt Rochester has announced her bid to run for senator. In a campaign video released on Wednesday, Rochester said: \u201cIt\u2019s been the greatest honor of my life to represent Delaware, to protect our seniors, our environment, our small businesses and women\u2019s reproductive rights. But we\u2019ve got so much more to do.\u201d Rochester went on to talk about the January 6, 2021 Capitol Hill riots, saying: \u201cPeople ask me if January 6 was my worst day. It was but it was also one of my proudest moments. Because we walked back in that House chamber and we completed our work. The forces of fear did not win and democracy prevailed.\u201d Currently, the Delaware Senate seat is occupied by Democratic senator Thomas Carper, who announced last month that he will not seek re-election after 2025. Carper has indicated his support for Rochester, who used to intern for him when he served in the US House of Representatives. In May, Carper announced his endorsement for Rochester, saying: \u201cWe love Lisa, and I spoke with her this morning and I said you\u2019ve been patiently waiting for me to get out the way, and I\u2019m gonna get out of the way, and I hope you run, and I hope you will let me support you and support you in that mission,\u201d CNN reports. The Senate budget committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday morning, scrutinizing the role of oil and gas-linked \u201cdark money\u201d in delaying climate action \u2013 and tearing through local and federal budgets. The fossil fuel sector has spent billions on a decades-long campaign to sow doubt about climate science and policies, despite its own findings from as early as the 1950s that emissions from oil and gas warm the planet. Some of that funding has been anonymized through trade associations and other groups, research shows. The hearing will be led by Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who chairs the committee and who has given nearly 300 speeches about the climate crisis on the Senate floor. \u201cAs chairman of the budget committee, I am shining a light on the massive, well-documented economic risks of climate change,\u201d said Whitehouse. \u201cThese are risks that have the potential to cascade across our entire economy and trigger widespread financial hardship and calamity.\u201d It will feature five witnesses: Harvard history of science professor Naomi Oreskes, who has long studied climate misinformation; Christine Arena, former public relations executive at the firm Edelman who now works in social impact filmmaking; Richard Painter, a professor of corporate law at University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration; Dr Roger Pielke Jr, professor of environmental studies University of Colorado Boulder; and Scott Walker, president of conservative non-profit organization Capital Research Center who also served in the George W Bush administration as special assistant to the president for domestic policy. The hearing follows one launched by Democrats in 2021 on what was then called the House oversight and reform committee, which focused on big oil\u2019s alleged efforts to mislead the public about the climate crisis. Kyle Herrig, the president of the watchdog Accountable.US, calls out Leonard Leo and John Roberts in a statement this morning about ProPublica\u2019s blockbuster story about Samuel Alito and the billionaire Paul Singer. Herrig said: \u201cAs the supreme court corruption crisis grows with yet another apparent violation of the court\u2019s bare minimum ethics code, it\u2019s no surprise that Leonard Leo is right in the middle. He\u2019s the corrupting influence responsible for the rot.\u201d Leo is a rightwing activist who has done much to shape conservative dominance of federal courts including the supreme court, and who recently received $1.6bn to further his work. He accompanied Alito and Singer to Alaska on the fishing trip at the heart of the ProPublica report. Leo told ProPublica: \u201cNo objective and well-informed observer of the judiciary honestly could believe that they decide cases in order to cull favour with friends, or in return for a free plane seat or fishing trip.\u201d Herrig continued: \u201cAs long as Chief Justice Roberts continues to dodge responsibility by refusing to take action, public trust in our court will continue to plummet. We need reform now.\u201d Roberts has rebuffed calls to testify in Congress \u2013 over previous ProPublica reports about Clarence Thomas, another hardline rightwing justice, and his relationship with another rightwing billionaire, Harlan Crow. As quoted in the ProPublica story, Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, has recently said: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t tolerate this [Thomas\u2019s behaviour] from a city council member or an alderman. And yet the supreme court won\u2019t even acknowledge it\u2019s a problem.\u201d More: Alito published a Wall Street Journal op-ed in response to ProPublica\u2019s reporting, but declined to answer direct questions from ProPublica. In the op-ed published hours before ProPublica\u2019s report, Alito said that he did not know Singer was connected to cases heard before the court. Alito also claimed to have spoken to Singer \u201con no more than a handful of occasions\u201d, including during the aforementioned fishing trip. From the Wall Street Journal: On no occasion have we discussed the activities of his businesses, and we have never talked about any case or issue before the Court\u2026 It was and is my judgment that these facts would not cause a reasonable and unbiased person to doubt my ability to decide the matters in question impartially\u2026 \u2026When I reviewed the cases in question to determine whether I was required to recuse, I was not aware and had no good reason to be aware that Mr. Singer had an interest in any party\u2026 But experts have pushed back against Alito\u2019s defenses, telling ProPublica that they could not recall an instance of a justice ruling on a case after receiving a gift from a donor. \u201cIf you were good friends, what were you doing ruling on his case?\u201d said Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor and expert on recusals to ProPublica. \u201cAnd if you weren\u2019t good friends, what were you doing accepting this?\u201d said Geyh, referring to the flight on the private jet. Alito is facing ethics questions related to a 2008 fishing trip the supreme court justice took with Republican billionaire Paul Singer, first reported by ProPublica. On 8 July 2008, Alito flew on Singer\u2019s private jet to Alaska, where the pair stayed at King Salmon Lodge, a fishing resort that costs more than $1,000 a day. The private plane to Alaska would have cost Alito more than $100,000 if he had chartered it himself, ProPublica reported. In the years after the trip, Singer\u2019s hedge fund was involved in cases presented before the court at least 10 times. In 2014, the court resolved a key question stemming from a decades-long battle between Singer\u2019s hedge fund and Argentina. Alito voted in Singer\u2019s favor, in a 7-1 majority. The hedge fund ultimately received $2.4bn. Good morning, Supreme court justice Samuel Alito is facing questions for not declaring several gifts received from conservative billionaire Paul Singer, and for not recusing himself when Singer had cases presented before the court. The latest report questioning the ethics of supreme court justices came from ProPublica, which recently published several articles on the relationship between justice Clarence Thomas and Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. According to the ProPublica report published on Tuesday night, Alito accepted a seat on a private plane owned by Singer and flew to Alaska for a luxury fishing trip at the King Salmon Lodge, which costs $1,000 a night. Abbe Smith, a Georgetown law professor, told ProPublica Alito should have recused himself because of the gift from Singer. If she were representing a client in such a case and \u201cfound out [about the gift] after the fact\u201d, Smith said, \u201cI\u2019d be outraged on behalf of my client. And, frankly, I\u2019d be outraged on behalf of the legal system.\u201d Alito did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions for the piece. Instead, the justice published a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the trip, several hours before the Propublica piece published. Here\u2019s what else is on today: Joe Biden will host India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, at the White House on Wednesday evening. Several democrats are calling on Biden to question Modi on his human rights\u2019 record."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/secret-invasion-recap-episode-one-its-true-the-world-has-been-invaded-by-reptilians-disguised-as-humans", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Secret Invasion recap episode one \u2013 it\u2019s true, the world has been invaded by reptilians disguised as humans!", "lead": "Bombs, aliens and Samuel L Jackson: the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s return to the small screen was an intriguing, darker affair \u2013 featuring a brilliant performance from Olivia Colman", "author": "Andy Welch", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 20:00:49", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223205", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d157f059c708421223ca6c82300872c9abc58e26/0_66_2000_1201/500.jpg", "body": "This recap contains spoilers for episode one of Secret Invasion. Do not read on unless you have seen it Sometimes conspiracy theorists are right \u2026 We opened with Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) skulking around present-day Moscow and arriving in the office of Agent Prescod (Richard Dormer). Prescod was on to something \u2013 the wave of terror attacks around the world was not being carried out by individual groups, but by the same band of Skrulls, merely disguising themselves as different groups in order to sow the maximum amount of chaos. Ross, however, didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what they want you to think,\u201d Prescod told Ross, sounding like a pub conspiracy theorist at last orders. Only he was correct, and got a bullet for piecing together the truth. After a frantic foot chase, we realised that Ross was not Ross at all, but a Skrull. (If you\u2019re not sure what a Skrull is, they are a race of technologically advanced reptilian humanoids, who used to live on the planet Skrullos until it was destroyed by a militaristic alien race, the Kree, during an invasion. Skrulls are strong, age slowly and, crucially, can shapeshift, which allows them to look like any other life form. Watch Captain Marvel if you want more background.) Skrull Ross called Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) for a lift, but was chased through the streets of Moscow. He eventually fell from a roof where it became clear he was the bad kind of Skrull and his pursuer was, in fact, Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), leader of the Skrull refugees and a good sort. Roll credits. The Return of Fury Having not been seen on Earth for some time, Nick Fury had some catching up to do. The exact amount of time he\u2019d spent on the Saber space station is not clear \u2013 \u201ca few years\u201d was the closest we got from Hill. (Samuel L Jackson, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t made more than a fleeting appearance in the MCU since 2019\u2019s Spider-Man: Far From Home. That film was set in 2024 and the She-Hulk series ended in 2025, so Secret Invasion\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d is mid-2025, suggesting Fury has been off-planet for a year. Something doesn\u2019t quite add up.) More significant still is the feeling among certain Skrulls that Nick Fury has reneged on the promise he made in 1995 during the events of Captain Marvel to find the refugee Skrulls a permanent home. This feeling is what has been driving Gravik and his rebel Skrulls \u2013 they haven\u2019t been given a safe haven, so they will just take Earth, instead. Troubled by what he heard, Fury went for a walk. A bad idea late at night in Moscow \u2026 Nice intro, Olivia Colman \u2026 Welcome Olivia Colman to the MCU. She is playing Sonya Falsworth, an MI6 agent and old friend of Fury\u2019s with a good line in intros. \u201cThis is so exciting: a large Black man in Moscow \u2013 well, it could either be Nick Fury or the ghost of Paul Robeson,\u201d she said, before telling one of her thugs to take off Fury\u2019s hood. \u201cOh damn \u2026 and I was hoping for a command performance of Ol\u2019 Man River.\u201d Colman looked as if she\u2019s having a blast in this scene, and her and Jackson\u2019s quality really shined through \u2013 it was thoroughly entertaining. Right now, it\u2019s unclear if Falsworth can be trusted \u2013 Fury was on the fence, too, bugging her office to keep tabs on her. Double-agent Khaleesi? Then we met Emilia Clarke\u2019s G\u2019iah for the first time, welcoming Beto (Samuel Adewunmi) to New Skrullos, the rebels\u2019 temporary home in an abandoned nuclear facility (Skrulls are immune to radiation). She pointed out that there are 500 Skrulls in the resistance, and while it\u2019s not mandatory to become a warrior, those who choose to fight are rewarded with the chance to leave the compound. Crucially \u2013 I think this will be a big plot point in future episodes \u2013 Skrulls whose missions involve taking on human form stay that way, even in the compound, as the longer they are in disguise, the better they become at maintaining it. Convenient, perhaps, for any human that wants to infiltrate the resistance base? We shall see. G\u2019iah was then sent on a mission to retrieve two bags from an art dealer in the city, but was intercepted on her way back to base by Hill and Talos. G\u2019iah, it turns out, is Talos\u2019s missing daughter, and was unaware that her mum had died. G\u2019iah wasn\u2019t the most convincing of rebels before finding this out \u2013 Pagon (Killian Scott) and Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir) looked as if they had their suspicions about her \u2013 but that kind of news will have her questioning the cause even more. (She told her dad about the attack later in the episode, but I predict a more permanent double agent has been born.) Fury and Hill talked about his crisis of faith, the reason he was hiding in space. His crisis followed him up there, he said. The reality is that he hasn\u2019t been the same since the Blip \u2013 I\u2019m sure turning to ash would leave you with some sort of PTSD \u2013 and probably still hasn\u2019t come to terms with the deaths of Iron Man and Black Widow. Attack, attack, attack G\u2019iah disguised herself to meet Talos and tell him about the attacks Gravik has planned. Three bombs in rucksacks, to be detonated in the square. Only Fury, Hill and Talos couldn\u2019t stop the bombs going off \u2013 the rucksacks were decoys anyway. Despite the square being devastated and ice-cold Gravik completing his mission, there was worse to come for Fury. Maria Hill was shot and killed. And by a Skrull posing as Fury, no less. Following Fury into his spy capers was always going to be dangerous and likely to lead to her death \u2013 but I bet she never thought it would be him actually pulling the trigger. How\u2019s that crisis of faith coming along now, Nick? Notes and observations Farewell Cobie Smulders. The Canadian actor had played Maria Hill since 2012, appearing in all four Avengers films, as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Spider-Man: Far From Home and in the TV series Agents of SHIELD Despite Hill never being given a storyline worthy of Smulders\u2019 talents, I wasn\u2019t expecting her to bow out like this. Who was Sonya Falsworth talking to in that intercepted meeting? Surely not \u2026 Agent Prescod? That would mean Falsworth was talking to a Skrull impostor. At least three sugars in that tiny cup of tea, Gravik? What are you, a lazy caricature of a builder? I always enjoy hearing non-standard accents in the MCU, following on from Erin Kellyman\u2019s Nottingham twang in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Gravik sounds to my ear like a man from Pontypridd, while Killian Scott as Pagon appears to be talking in his native Limerick brogue. It\u2019s about time we got away from generics. Getting the Avengers on a midlife crisis shopping spree certainly beats a sports car, hair implants or a fancy watch. A shame Richard Dormer won\u2019t be sticking around as Agent Prescod. I would watch him in anything \u2013 that voice! Those wild eyes! He was terrific in Blue Lights, wonderful as Game of Thrones\u2019s Ser Beric Dondarrion and, best of all, as Terri Hooley, the owner of a Belfast record shop during the Troubles in the shamefully underrated Good Vibrations. (You may have seen Hooley as a talking head in the brilliant BBC documentary series Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland.) You may also recognise Kingsley Ben-Adir from his time in ITV\u2019s Vera, as a private eye in the second season of The OA or as the doomed Col Ben Younger in Peaky Blinders\u2019 fourth and fifth seasons. He\u2019s been busy \u2013 playing a version of Ken in the forthcoming Barbie film and starring in a Bob Marley biopic due for release next year. What\u2019s the little girl with the brightly coloured ball got to do with it? \u2022 Secret Invasion is on Disney+. What did you think? Did you like the darker, gritty tone?

In 1956, having read about Mahatma Gandhi, he decided to go to India and join Gandhi\u2019s spiritual successor Vinoba Bhave\u2019s Bhoodan Land Reform Movement. He walked from village to village asking landowners to give a portion of their land to the landless. The following year, he joined Howard Steele, who as a protest planned to sail a boat into the British atomic test area near Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. David then worked on a leprosy colony called Anandavan. On his return to Britain in 1958 he and I met at Marsham Farm hotel, in Fairlight, Sussex, where I was the cook. We married six weeks later, and soon moved to Bromley, Kent, where David worked as the south London organiser for Oxfam. In 1968 he joined the Centre for Group Studies, set up by the sociologist Richard Hauser, in Manchester, working in the poorest areas of the city to raise consciousness among tenants and students. By now we had five children and lived in a large Victorian house in Chorlton. In his 40s David became a mature student at Manchester University, and gained a degree in politics and economics. Afterwards, in the late 70s, he lectured in sociology at the university and was a tutor with the Open University. Many people who needed help and support would come to stay at our family home and found their lives changed: often they became vegan and participated with David in his local actions, which included protecting Gypsies from eviction; setting up a free school and a school students\u2019 union; organising free speech demonstrations; supporting refugees; and organising tenants. He also campaigned internationally, in 1971 participating in Operation Omega, which took humanitarian aid into East Pakistan during the war that saw Bangladesh emerge as an independent country. In 1996 he founded the Vegan Organic Network, to advocate growing organic food without the use of manure, herbicides, artificial fertilisers and slaughterhouse by-products. He was born Louis Abrahams in the East End of London. His parents, Harry, a tailor, and Milly (nee Izaaks), were immigrants from Poland and Russia, and changed the family name to Graham because of antisemitism. During the second world war, Louis was evacuated to East Anglia, and went to Aldreth village school until he was 12, after which he worked on local farms. When he was 16, a local farmer arranged for him to go to Writtle Institute of Agriculture, near Chelmsford, where he studied for two years. He returned to London and changed his name to David. At 20 he was called up for national service. As a member of the Peace Pledge Union he registered as a conscientious objector and was sentenced to a year in prison, which is where he read about Gandhi. He is survived by me and our children, Simon, Suzanne, Naomi, Benjamin and me, eight grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and his sister, Gloria."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/us-extreme-weather-six-weeks-heatwaves-storms", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Half of Americans have faced \u2018extreme\u2019 weather in the last six weeks", "lead": "Scientists tracking alerts sent by the National Weather Service say data underscores risks of heatwaves and storms this summer", "author": "Maanvi Singh", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:58:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223249", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d005a3688835fcbafb2899b64143510f9caa1b69/440_669_5576_3347/500.jpg", "body": "Half of the US population has faced an extreme weather alert since 1 May and many more are likely to face risks from wildfires, flooding, tropical storms and extreme heat as summer begins. The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has been tracking the alerts sent by the National Weather Service (NWS) warning about dangerous weather. The UCS also finds that more than 51 million people in the US were facing extreme weather alerts on Wednesday, with about a third of them living in areas designated as disadvantaged by the federal government. The period between May and November is a period the UCS is calling \u201cDanger Season\u201d, when increasingly intense storms, heatwaves and wildfires are expected to besiege the country. Fifty per cent \u201cis a very troubling sort of threshold that we\u2019ve crossed\u201d, said Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist for climate vulnerability at UCS. \u201cAnd we are one month and a half into danger season.\u201d In recent days, storms battering the Lower Mississippi Valley and central Gulf coast states have downed power lines and mangled homes. In Texas, triple-digit temperatures are straining the power grid. The heat index has surpassed 120F in parts of the state, due to an unusually intense high pressure system. About 10% of the extreme heat alerts this year have a clear \u201cclimate signal\u201d linking them to the climate crisis, said Declet-Barreto. That figure is based on the non-profit Climate Central\u2019s Climate Shift Index, which estimates the influence of climate change on extreme temperatures around the world. In Texas, the heat was made at least three, four and five times as likely by climate change, the Index indicates. Overall, numerous studies have found that the climate crisis is fueling more intense and prolonged heatwaves, storms, droughts and floods. Meanwhile, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), the grid operator, has asked Texans to voluntarily reduce electricity use to address soaring demand. \u201cThis is just another signal of how climate change is affecting our infrastructure,\u201d said Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist in the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. Ercot issued similar warnings last summer and in 2021, hundreds died after the state grid was pushed to the brink of total failure, amid an extreme winter storm. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a non-profit that oversees the reliability of the North American power grids, warned that two-thirds of North America could face reliability challenges this summer. \u201cThis is just setting up to be a pretty hot summer,\u201d said Cleetus. \u201cThis is not going to be the last time that we\u2019re going to see a situation like this.\u201d Last year, 18 major disasters and a slew of storms, floods, fires and drought caused about $165bn in damages, making it the third most costly year for such disasters since records began in 1980. A total of 474 people died, according to government data. But those figures excluded the costs and losses from extreme heat, which contributes to thousands of deaths each year. This is the second year that UCS has been tracking weather alerts through the warm season. \u201cThe whole purpose of doing this and illustrating this is to tell people that climate change is already a big problem,\u201d said Declet-Barreto. \u201cAnd we need big solutions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fa8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/21/rashid-ashraf-obituary", "primaryCategory": "media", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rashid Ashraf obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives</strong>: Broadcaster in Urdu who worked for the BBC World Service for 45 years", "author": "Kenza Kamal", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:38:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223266", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a8eb70978b2203c7ac9cc7037545f1f8bfc4e75f/0_500_1920_1151/500.jpg", "body": "My grandfather Rashid Ashraf, who has died aged 90, was an Urdu scholar and broadcaster who wrote, produced, and presented thousands of radio programmes for the BBC Urdu Service from the mid-1960s onwards. His voice became well known to many listeners across India and Pakistan, as well as on television in the UK, where he was the regular newsreader on Nai Zindagi Naya Jeevan (A New Life, 1968-92) and then Asian Magazine (1982-87), both broadcast on the BBC. Those two groundbreaking programmes, with their mix of news, current affairs and cultural presentations from the subcontinent, were the first in the UK to be presented entirely in Hindi and Urdu, and created a sense of belonging for many Asian people in 80s Britain. Rashid was born in Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh, British India, to politically active parents, Bushra (nee Khatoon) and her husband, Shurfudin Ashraf, a landowner. He experienced the violence and unrest of the years leading up to the 1947 partition of India, and at 14 stood in the midnight crowds in Delhi on the night that independence from Britain was formally declared. His schooling did not begin until he had turned 10, but he was an avid reader throughout childhood and taught himself English. After studying at the Anglo Arabic higher secondary school in Delhi he migrated to Lahore, in Pakistan, at the age of 17 with some of his family members. There he completed a degree in journalism, followed by a master\u2019s, at Punjab University, earning distinctions in both while suffering from tuberculosis. In the decade from 1956 to 1965 Rashid took on various freelancing jobs as a translator, including with the Pakistan government. In 1966 he married Kishwar Wajdani and they moved to the UK so that he could work for the BBC World Service. Rashid was a master orator, linguist and storyteller who had an unparalleled knowledge of the BBC\u2019s Hindi and Urdu Service and was a mentor to the next generation of British Asian journalists and producers. At his core he was a scholar of language, knowledgable in the linguistic histories of Urdu and Hindi, along with Farsi and Arabic. A passionate admirer and reciter of Urdu prose and poetry, he could analyse and educate others on the most intricate of verse. His published work included a collection of short stories, Dehleez Aur Dusri Kahani (translated as The Threshold and other stories) in 2019, a translation of Ben Okri\u2019s novel The Famished Road (2020), and perhaps his most significant contribution to Urdu scholarship, Lughat, an Urdu-English phrase dictionary.

Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, was invited to testify on 11 July by the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, whose chairman, the Democratic senator Dick Blumenthal, is one of the toughest critics of Saudi Arabia on Capitol Hill. Jay Monahan, the PGA commissioner, and LIV Golf League chief executive and commissioner Greg Norman, were also invited to testify. The proposed merger of LIV Tour and PGA, which also involves the DP World Tour, has received a frosty reception on Capitol Hill, where it is facing questions not only from Blumenthal, but also the Senate finance committee. The call for Rumayyan to testify at a hearing, however, marks a new twist. In a public statement, Blumenthal said the purpose of the hearing was to examine the proposed agreement between the PGA and the PIF. \u201cOur goal is to uncover the facts about what went into the PGA Tour\u2019s deal with the Saudi Public Investment Fund and what the Saudi takeover means for the future of this cherished American institution and our national interest,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cAmericans deserve to know what the structure and governance of this new entity will be. Major actors in the deal are best positioned to provide this information, and they owe Congress \u2013 and the American people \u2013 answers in a public setting.\u201d But it is far from clear whether Rumayyan will ultimately agree to testify. Saudi officials in the past have successfully avoided depositions and public testimony under oath by claiming sovereign immunity. While the focus of the hearing will undoubtedly be centered on golf, Rumayyan could also face questions about his role at the PIF and his relationship with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is the chairman of the PIF. Rumayyan wears many hats in his role as a Saudi state official: he serves as chairman of Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, and chairman of Newcastle United, among other roles. The Guardian previously reported that the executive was involved in a controversial \u201canti-corruption\u201d purge in Saudi Arabia that included the transfer of assets on behalf of the crown prince. Internal Saudi documents filed to a civil court in Canada as part of an unrelated case show that in 2017 a close aide to Prince Mohammed ordered Rumayyan \u2013 who is formally referred to in memos as \u201chis excellency\u201d and the \u201csupervisor\u201d of the PIF \u2013 to transfer 20 companies to the sovereign wealth fund as part of the anti-corruption campaign. One of 20 seized companies, the documents show, was a charter jet company that was later alleged to have been used in the Saudi plot to kill Jamal Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies concluded in an intelligence report that was declassified in 2021 that Prince Mohammed approved Khashoggi\u2019s gruesome murder. There is no suggestion that Rumayyan had involvement in or knowledge of the alleged use of the jets in the operation that killed the Washington Post journalist. But the matter could be raised in the upcoming hearing, as could questions about the PIF\u2019s takeover of Newcastle. Rumayyan could also be asked about his financial relationship with Donald Trump, whose golf properties have hosted LIV events. People familiar with the PGA\u2019s previous litigation with LIV Tour \u2013 which has been dropped following the announcement of the proposed deal \u2013 told the Guardian that Saudi officials associated with the litigation had steadfastly refused to be deposed in the matter, claiming sovereign immunity. The letter seeking Rumayyan\u2019s in-person attendance at the July hearing was signed by Blumenthal and Ron Johnson, the top Republican senator on the subcommittee. The executive has until 28 June to confirm his appearance. This article was amended on 21 June 2023 to clarify that Yasir al-Rumayyan is the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-backed investment fund, rather than the chairman."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fab", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/israeli-settlers-attack-palestinian-villages-following-deadly-hamas-strike", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Armed Israeli settlers rampage through Palestinian town in revenge attack", "lead": "Palestinians say man was killed and 10 were injured after settlers rampaged through West Bank town and army opened fire", "author": "Ben Lynfield in Jerusalem and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:16:54", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223318", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/93325492338ee3498ef0040b2127d1f6349a41e3/0_182_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "A large group of Israeli settlers have attacked a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank, setting fire to homes, cars and fields in a revenge rampage that left one Palestinian dead from gunfire and 10 others injured, according to Palestinian witnesses and officials. Many of the hundreds of settlers who raided the town of Turmus Ayya, north of Ramallah, on Wednesday were armed. But the dead man, Omar Abu Katan, 27, was shot by Israeli soldiers who entered after the settlers, Palestinian medics said. According to a Palestinian Authority official, Ghassan Daghlas, the 10 wounded were struck by live shots, some fired by soldiers and others by settlers. About 30 houses and over 40 cars were torched, he said. Later on Wednesday, three Palestinians were killed when an Israeli drone targeted a car in the northern West Bank. The late-night attack marked an escalation in Israel\u2019s campaign against alleged militants in the area. The identities of the people inside the car were not immediately known, but the army said it had \u201cidentified a terrorist cell inside a suspicious vehicle\u201d that had been responsible for a number of recent shooting attacks on Jewish settlements. The settler attack reinforced questions from rights groups, who accuse the military of enjoying a cosy relationship with settlers to the point of doing little to fulfil its international legal obligation of protecting civilians. Turmus Ayya resident Mohammed Awad, 26, said people had to contend with fire from the settlers and the army. \u201cI rescued five people with my own hands. They were shot with live ammunition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Armageddon in Turmus Ayya. Cars are on fire, villas and fields are on fire. Someone needs to stop them. No one is helping us.\u201d The Turmus Ayya onslaught was part of a day of settler attacks in the northern West Bank in reprisal for the killing by Hamas gunmen on Tuesday of four settlers at a restaurant and petrol station outside the Eli settlement. According to Yesh Din, which monitors settler violence, eight Palestinians were wounded in some of the other attacks that occurred in Luban Sharqiya, Qablan, Huwwara, Baytin, Zaatra Junction and Yizhar Junction. Israeli media reports said that those who assaulted Turmus Ayya did so after the funeral of Nachman Morodov, one of the settlers killed in nearby Eli. Associated Press quoted the Turmus Ayya resident Mohammed Suleiman as blaming the army, saying soldiers turned their guns on Palestinians instead of stopping the settlers who were setting alight everything in their path. \u201cIt was terrifying. We just saw mobs in the streets, masked, armed,\u201d he said. Earlier Benjamin Netanyahu and senior ministers approved plans for 1,000 new housing units at Eli, in what officials said was a response to Tuesday\u2019s attack. As the Israeli army beefed up troops in advance of a possible operation, in Jenin, in the northern West Bank, 15-year-old Sadeel Naghneghia was laid to rest after succumbing to her injuries and becoming the seventh Palestinian to die after an Israeli army incursion on Monday that left more than 90 other Palestinians and seven Israeli soldiers injured. It is one of the worst spasms of violence in an escalation that began early last year with a string of Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets that resulted in the Israeli military launching \u201cOperation Break the Wave\u201d, frequent raids that have resulted in heavy Palestinian casualties while failing to deter attacks, mostly in the West Bank on military and settler targets. The army said in a statement that \u201csecurity forces entered the town to extinguish the fires, prevent clashes and collect evidence. The Israeli civilians exited the town and the police has opened an investigation.\u201d There was no immediate word of arrests. The most rightwing government in Israeli history is moving ahead with illegal settlement activity and massive infrastructure plans and appears determined to make the territory occupied during the 1967 war an integral part of Israel. Many Palestinians fear that Israel intends to expel them from the area envisioned, according to the rhetoric of the international community, as the heartland of a future Palestinian state. Settlers also struck late on Tuesday in Luban Sharqiya village near Eli. \u201cThey vandalised whatever houses and stores they could find,\u201d said local councillor Filastiin Nubbani. \u201cThey burned cars in front of houses and a lot of wheat fields.\u201d She said two people suffered gunshot wounds. \u201cIt won\u2019t get better, it will only get worse. There is nothing to protect us.\u201d The Turmus Ayya onslaught evoked memories of a mass settler attack in February in Huwara near Nablus. Gadi Gvaryahu, head of the dovish Israeli group Tag Meir, said the government and army bore responsibility for the Turmus Ayya assault. \u201cThings are just repeating themselves. It was completely clear there would be revenge. The government and army are not doing the work. We are responsible for protecting the population in these areas. It\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d Additional reporting by Sufian Taha"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fac", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/newcastle-confident-of-signing-sandro-tonali-from-milan-for-60m", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Newcastle confident of signing Sandro Tonali from Milan for \u00a360m", "lead": "Newcastle are pushing to complete the signing of Sandro Tonali, with the Milan midfielder expected to join for \u00a360m plus add-ons", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:08:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223338", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a67e8344690e0a81e8e5debd00d6f372729235e2/0_96_2892_1736/500.jpg", "body": "Newcastle are pushing to complete the signing of Sandro Tonali, with the Milan midfielder expected to join for \u20ac70m (\u00a360m) plus add-ons.

One issue could be a late move from Chelsea, who have spoken to Milan about Tonali, but at this stage the 23-year-old midfielder is expected to move to St James\u2019 Park. Sealing a deal for the Italian will be a major boost for Eddie Howe as he prepares to lead Newcastle into the Champions League.

Both Upside Foods and Good Meat said on Wednesday they had been given permission by the US Department of Agriculture to produce and sell chicken that has been grown from a cluster of sample animal cells in large metal vats. The approval means that the US becomes just the second country in the world, after Singapore, to allow the sale of meat grown from animal cells, a breakthrough touted by the nascent industry as being better for both animals, which aren\u2019t harmed in the process, and the environment. Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Good Meat, said that the approval is a \u201cmajor moment for our company, the industry and the food system\u201d. Good Meat has been selling its lab-grown chicken at hawker stalls, butchers and restaurants in Singapore since 2020.

The nascent lab-grown meat sector has gathered pace in the US over the past year, with a number of different startups jostling for position to challenge plant-based offerings such as the Impossible burger, which have struggled of late. The new products are not vegetarian, but rather meat that has been grown in the sort of setting more familiar to the pharmaceutical industry than the food sector. A scraping of cells are taken from an animal, such as a cow or chicken, and then multiplied into cuts of meat in bioreactors. Proponents of the sector claim that it is superior to the traditional livestock industry on animal welfare grounds, as well as the ruinous impact meat production currently has upon the environment via greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and air and water pollution. Critics have, however, questioned whether the specialized resources and energy required to produce the meat will also have a significant impact. For now, the lab-grown meat market is getting off to a quiet start in the US \u2013 Upside\u2019s chicken will be launched at Bar Crenn in San Fransisco, while Good Meat\u2019s product will be sold first at an undisclosed restaurant in Washington DC."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fae", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/england-big-decisions-lords-ashes-cricket", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No need to panic but England have big decisions to make for Lord\u2019s | Ali Martin", "lead": "Losing the first Ashes Test in such a manner will highlight the failings even though a lot went right", "author": "Ali Martin", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:00:48", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223373", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/40e8111db31cb17e3b23f2441b9d44246b100ee9/0_134_3101_1861/500.jpg", "body": "So, where do England go from here? After coming up short in a teeming, undulating first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, one that left combatants and spectators drained but richer for it, the smart-alec answer here is Lord\u2019s. There are five full days off first, however, with England not due to resume training until Monday; time to reflect on the one that got away, rest some weary legs and pop Moeen Ali\u2019s sore spinning finger in a pot of piddle. Australia were rightly buzzing after their two-wicket heist, renditions of True Blue (John Williams, not Madonna) and Under the Southern Cross I Stand echoing late into the night. But on the other side of the dressing room wall, the hosts were not too blue in defeat. Memories of 2005 have been baked into the narrative of this series and it is worth going back there. England went 1-0 down in the first Test, faced headlines such as \u201cVaughan again losers\u201d and calls for changes in the team. But they held their nerve, stuck to the principles that underpinned a 12-month rise and struck back. Back then it was a 239-run pasting inflicted by Glenn McGrath; this time it was Australia bucking a trend of coming second in Ashes close finishes by securing their tightest win by wickets over England since 1907. History may be more or less bunk but, equally, there is no need for Ben Stokes to get all Corporal Jones just yet. As superb as Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon were during that tense final hour, after a couple of sparkling second-innings bowling performances by donning capes with bat in hand, England will know they made most of the running. They also made most of the errors; those old-as-time non\u2011negotiables that hold true whether a team are good, bad or on an evangelical mission to reinvent/save Test cricket. Over the course of a match when both sides took 18 wickets, England put down (or failed to go for) five catches of varying difficulties, missed one stumping and bowled 23 no-balls \u2013 one of which cost Stuart Broad the wicket of Usman Khawaja 121 runs into his 141 first time around. Even ignoring the latter \u2013 an inch further back would be a different delivery \u2013 this was the highest number of no-balls by England since the 25 in the 2006 defeat by Sri Lanka at Trent Bridge. This profligacy feels more relevant than the runs England may or may not have scored without that first-innings declaration. On a torpid pitch such as the one served up at Edgbaston, where Cameron Green\u2019s low stunner under heavy clouds was the only catch to fly to the slip/gully region off the seamers, chances come at a premium. Still, to create more than 20 opportunities was to the credit of England\u2019s bowlers and the crackling synapses of Stokes when setting his fields. Contrary to some chatter about recreating Rawalpindi, it was not what Stokes had in mind when he asked for \u201cfast, flat\u201d surfaces. Four days out from the match, with the covers on in bright sunshine, there were clearly concerns. Looking to Lord\u2019s, where the slope offers natural variation, England will want a lot more carry. Jimmy Anderson has long since shed a reputation for needing clouds to prosper but, without edges flying at catchable height, his excellence with the wobble seam is undermined. Back from a groin niggle and a four-week layoff, he was probably a little undercooked. While Ollie Robinson had his moments (not all of them well\u2011thought through), Broad certainly validated his retention over Mark Wood with a performance of heart, skill and bandana bravado. His early hold over Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne represents a boon, the latter having seemingly inched into the county cricket trap of trying to cover off stump and losing it in the process. That said, a defeat with Australia\u2019s big two sharing 35 runs between them is clearly a missed opportunity and these two batting badgers will be working hard to correct things during the break. Despite a tricky match, including not moving for Khawaja\u2019s edge four balls into his crucial 65 in the chase, there will be no going back on Jonny Bairstow as the wicketkeeper. The chief quandary is Moeen and the open wound on his spinning finger that resulted from more overs on day two (29) than in his Indian Premier League campaign (26). His return to Test cricket after two years out contained some typical magic darts but ones that increasingly flew off the island as the problem developed. England are initially minded to see if the skin dries and heals in the next few days, with Surrey\u2019s Will Jacks \u2013 29 first-class wickets raw and a batter, really \u2013 said to be the likeliest call-up if not. Until he was clobbered for a couple of sixes late in the piece by Cummins, Joe Root\u2019s off-breaks did lock down an end during that tense final day, so an alternative may be to deploy a Lord\u2019s specialist in Chris Woakes \u2013 average 61 with the bat, 11 with the ball at HQ \u2013 or inject some pace in the form of Wood. That said, while Root is an ever\u2011willing cricketer who genuinely enjoys his bowling, England need to be mindful of not overburdening him. The former captain has just returned to the top of the International Cricket Council Test batting ranks after his 164 runs for once out and, given a top three that looks fallible, the day job cannot be compromised. These are tactical decisions to be made closer to the time, with Stokes and Brendon McCullum stressing the overall approach will not change. But, after falling short in squeaky Brum time and knowing no side has won an Ashes series from 2-0 down since 1936-37, the result they claim not to think about must. Five fixes for Lord\u2019s Raise the mower blades A reversion to playing on full-blown snooker tables could easily backfire on an England lineup that team who like to play their shots and should probably be avoided. Still, a bit more carry and sideways movement would not go amiss, certainly if the suppression of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne is to be maintained. Improve the basics Cricketers shouldn\u2019t really need reminding that dropped catches and no-balls (23!) can prove costly but with sharper hands/gloves and better discipline with the front line they would be 1-0 up right now. Jonny Bairstow \u2013 a far better wicketkeeper than some of the chatter, but stewing on missed chances \u2013 will be keen to make amends. Keep up the pressure on Boland Edgbaston was the first time since that jaw-dropping debut in Melbourne 18 months ago that Scott Boland has gone at more than three runs per over. The 34-year-old did claim a key wicket in each innings but his overall economy \u2013 5.65 \u2013 was disrupted with some twinkle-toed footwork and innovation from Joe Root in particular. Pace \u2013 the final frontier Conditions at Lord\u2019s are yet to present themselves but Mark Wood entering the fray has to be a serious consideration. Provided he is fit \u2013 he has not played since April in the Indian Premier League \u2013 the 33-year-old\u2019s extra pace would present a fresh challenge for Australia, not least the tail. Let the ball do the talking Ollie Robinson\u2019s attempts to ruffle Usman Khawaja with some chirp in the second-innings run chase didn\u2019t work. It wasn\u2019t an entirely great look either following that crude (if slightly over-moralised) four-letter outburst upon getting him out in the first innings. Talk of \u201cthree No 11s\u201d in the Australia team aged like milk, too. Time to focus on the bowling."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25faf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/scotland-evolution-experience-camaraderie", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018A real togetherness\u2019: Scotland keep evolving with diversity of experience", "lead": "Steve Clarke\u2019s four years as head coach have brought stability and a philosophy of play to a team peaking at the right time", "author": "Will Unwin", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:00:47", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223391", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f3a36dfef927a49cd81f9d8919e1adc1dacdda13/0_65_2516_1509/500.jpg", "body": "There seems to be an element of surprise to Scotland leading a European Championship qualifying group, but this should not be the case. They have beaten Spain and Norway as part of four victories in four matches to give themselves a great chance of spending next summer in Germany and it has nothing to do with luck. Steve Clarke has completed four years as head coach and has a contract until 2026, bringing stability and giving him time to instil his philosophy into a team peaking at the right time. Throughout there is a level of quality that has been lacking in the national setup for a long time. There are usually one or two standout players but, finally, there is a group that would make it into most top-flight teams in Europe\u2019s big five leagues. Against Georgia on Tuesday, as in all of Scotland\u2019s qualifiers, their most important players stood up to be counted. Liverpool\u2019s Andy Robertson was awarded player of the match and Manchester United\u2019s Scott McTominay scored the crucial second goal to ease the team to a 10th group-stage victory in a row in the rain and puddles. While Georgia were in the changing rooms making the case to not play, Scotland were desperate to get back out on the Hampden Park pitch because they are full of confidence and did not want to lose the momentum they have built up during this campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown everyone we have a real togetherness,\u201d Billy Gilmour said. \u201cWe make sure we\u2019re challenging each other every day in training. It\u2019s clearly good for Scotland. There\u2019s a buzz about the place.\u201d Diversity of experience is as important as camaraderie. Scotland are finding ways to beat everyone put in front of them thanks to the eclectic squad available to Clarke. They ground out a result against Spain, enjoying a mere 25% possession but crucially scored two goals to La Roja\u2019s none, forcing Manchester City\u2019s Rodri to lament: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a bit rubbish because it\u2019s always wasting time. They provoke you. They always fall. This is for me not football.\u201d Scotland had more possession than Georgia on Tuesday, as well as 14 shots to their opponents\u2019 nine, crucially ensuring the visitors did not get a single one on target. Scotland possess a lot of knowledge on the pitch as well off it, especially when it comes to European football. Most of their players are working under elite coaches. McTominay has Erik ten Hag at United, Robertson has spent six years with J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Liverpool, Kieran Tierney is learning from Mikel Arteta at Arsenal while John McGinn has Unai Emery at Aston Villa and Billy Gilmour has found his feet at Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s Brighton. Others can bring a different skill set; Aaron Hickey is playing for Brentford after time abroad at Bologna and Jack Hendry impressed during Club Brugge\u2019s Champions League campaign. Clarke, meanwhile, spent time under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Chelsea and has evolved into an excellent manager, but the structure within which his teams operate can still be attributed to the organisation he learned at Stamford Bridge. The 59-year-old has been intelligent with his backroom appointments, who have an impressive portfolio of work behind them; assistant Austin MacPhee has international experience with Mexico and Northern Ireland, in addition to working for Danish side Midtjylland; the goalkeeper coach, Chris Wood, occupied the same role with USA and John Carver has managed in Major League Soccer and Cyprus. These varying opinions and methods have been harnessed to produce a team effective in any circumstance. Finding a way to fit Tierney and Robertson into the same team has paid dividends, helping Hickey to operate in his preferred role at right wing-back, which in turn has made the team solid in defence and a threat on either flank. Scotland lack a top-quality striker; Lyndon Dykes is not prolific at Championship level but carries out the instructions of his manager to the letter and caused problems for every defender he has faced during qualifying, helping create space for his teammates to exploit. The job is far from done for Scotland, with trips to Spain, Georgia and Cyprus when the new season starts. But they have laid the foundations for qualification and ruffled a few feathers on the way. This evolving side are diverse of thought and strong of mind. Another year of progress will ensure few will want to face them in Germany."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/ilkay-gundogan-to-leave-manchester-city-to-join-barcelona-on-free-transfer", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ilkay G\u00fcndogan to leave Manchester City and join Barcelona on free transfer", "lead": "Ilkay G\u00fcndogan is to join Barcelona, dashing Manchester City\u2019s hopes of keeping him, but leaves with the club\u2019s blessing", "author": "Fabrizio Romano and Jamie Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:55:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223410", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a748617490f34d6cf0b02096eb70583d45c19c/0_197_3500_2099/500.jpg", "body": "Ilkay G\u00fcndogan will sign for Barcelona on a free transfer, ending Manchester City\u2019s hopes of keeping the influential midfielder. The 32\u2011year\u2011old, who was captain and a pivotal figure in City\u2019s treble\u2011winning side \u2013 scoring twice in the FA Cup final \u2013 has agreed a two-year deal with Bar\u00e7a, with an option for a further year. G\u00fcndogan\u2019s contract at City was due to expire at the end of the month. City understand that G\u00fcndogan reached the agreement to join Barcelona and he leaves with the champions\u2019 blessing and respect. They offered the German a new one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months but his wage demands plus the Catalan club offering him three years means City are comfortable with him departing, given their midfield options. They would also point to a track record of allowing other players over 30 to leave when the time was correct. These would include Yaya Tour\u00e9, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Fernandinho and Pablo Zabaleta. Pep Guardiola had told reporters at a golf tournament on Monday: \u201cWe are interested in renewing his contract and [Barcelona] are also interested. I hope he stays with us. We are still fighting for him to stay with us. He is a player we want to stay \u2013 and we will do all we can \u2013 but we know Bar\u00e7a want him. \u201cIf Bar\u00e7a sign him, they will have a spectacular footballer on their hands. I am aware Xavi [Barcelona\u2019s manager] has called him a lot. If, in the end, he picks Bar\u00e7a, I will tell him he will enjoy himself.\u201d City enjoy strength in depth in all departments but could also lose Bernardo Silva in the transfer window this summer. Silva, like many Premier League players, has reportedly received interest from the Saudi Pro League. Speculation about the future of the 28-year-old, whose current deal runs until 2025, has led to links with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona. City and Guardiola are keen that the midfielder remains in Manchester. In response to G\u00fcndogan\u2019s departure, City have immediately bulked up their midfield options by signing Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for a fee of \u00a325m plus \u00a35m in add-ons. Kovacic had been a key player for Chelsea since joining from Real Madrid on a five-year deal in 2019, having initially arrived on loan. The Croat entered the final year of his contract and departs with Chelsea undergoing a squad overhaul after the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as manager."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/marvel-ai-generated-credits-backlash", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Marvel faces backlash over AI-generated opening credits", "lead": "Social media users condemned use of AI -generated opening credits for Secret Invasion premiering this week on Disney+", "author": "Adrian Horton", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:53:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223428", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/add59bbb443008b7c410007b37e0dcde5169efef/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Marvel\u2019s Secret Invasion, a new television series which launched on Disney+ this week, has received backlash online after it was revealed that its opening credits were generated by artificial intelligence. In an interview with Polygon on Wednesday, director Ali Selim confirmed that AI operated by a company called Method Studios produced the opening sequence to the new series, which stars Samuel L Jackson as Marvel fixture Nick Fury. According to Selim, the sequence, which features what look like metamorphosing watercolor renderings of the show\u2019s major figures, was inspired by the show\u2019s plot of shape-shifting \u201cSkrulls\u201d invading Earth. \u201cWhen we reached out to the AI vendors, that was part of it \u2013 it just came right out of the shape-shifting, Skrull world identity, you know? Who did this? Who is this?\u201d he said. Selim told the site that he didn\u2019t \u201creally understand\u201d how artificial intelligence works, but was interested in how AI could translate a sense of foreboding he wanted for the series. \u201cWe would talk to them about ideas and themes and words, and then the computer would go off and do something. And then we could change it a little bit by using words, and it would change.\u201d The revelation has caused a stir on social media, as it\u2019s presumed that the use of AI on the opening credits precluded work for graphic designers and animators. \u201cI\u2019m devastated, I believe AI to be unethical, dangerous and designed solely to eliminate artists careers,\u201d tweeted Jeff Simpson, who worked with the visual development team on Secret Invasion. \u201cSpent almost half a year working on this show and had a fantastic experience working with the most amazing people I ever met \u2026\u201d In another tweet, Jon Lam, a storyboard artist, called the decision \u201csalt in the wounds of all Artists and Writers in the WGA strike\u201d. Lam referred to concerns about the use of AI as part of the ongoing negotiations between the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the striking Writers Guild of America. Recent WGA proposals have included protections against AI for writers; the use of AI to replace human labor has become a major talking point over the course of the eight-week strike. In the Polygon interview, Selim took a more positive take on the technology as a potential artistic tool: \u201cIt felt explorative and inevitable, and exciting, and different.\u201d Some prospective viewers felt differently. \u201cSo Marvel really used AI to make the intro for Secret Invasion \u2026 it\u2019s actually over,\u201d tweeted film-maker Brian Long. Another user wrote: \u201cI really loved the first episode of secret invasion but them using AI \u2018art\u2019 for their intro is just wack.

Last week Elias Anastas, a co-founder of the Palestine-based Radio Alhara, was invited to deliver a livestreamed talk remotely on the radical possibilities of radio, exploring how broadcasting could be used as a tool of subversion. But during the soundcheck for the event, Anastas said he received a text message from someone who works at the Barbican saying: \u201cIn terms of content, avoid talking about free Palestine at length \u2026just to further safeguard the audience.\u201d Moments earlier, a member of the Barbican\u2019s management reportedly pulled aside Anastas\u2019 interviewer, Nihal El Aasar, and asked if she and Anastas could \u201csteer clear of thorny issues\u201d such as \u201cfree Palestine \u2026 or whatever\u201d. The event was then cancelled due to technical difficulties, understood to be poor wifi. Artists for Palestine UK, a network of pro-Palestinian artists and culture workers, said the intervention \u201craises urgent questions about the organisation\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression and anti-discrimination\u201d. In a statement on Wednesday, the Barbican said it \u201calways strives to use our platform and programme to represent the widest possible range of worldviews, human experiences, artistic expressions, and enable free exchange of ideas and debate.\u201d It said: \u201cIn haste, shortly before the event was due to begin, the Barbican shared an editorial note with the speaker asking him to avoid spending too much time discussing \u2018free Palestine\u2019. The situation was compounded by a technical failure with the live broadcast, which unfortunately brought the event to an abrupt close. \u201cThe intervention by the Barbican relating to the content of the talk was unacceptable and a serious error of judgment, for which we are deeply sorry. As an organisation we believe in the importance of free speech, dialogue and debate \u2013 giving a platform to the experiences and views of individuals and groups involved in \u2018free Palestine\u2019 is part of this commitment.\u201d The event was part of a three-day programme in the Barbican\u2019s Curve Gallery co-organised by the Resolve collective, an interdisciplinary design group that addresses social issues. In response to the incident, the collective said it was ceasing all its public programme events at the Barbican as well as pulling its exhibition, which was originally scheduled to run until 16 July. In a statement, the artists alleged that during the course of their time as Curve Gallery artists they had \u201cexperienced a number of shameful incidents\u201d at the venue. Claire Spencer, the chief executive of the Barbican, and Will Gompertz, its artistic director, said: \u201cDuring the run of their exhibition, Resolve Collective and their collaborators have been subject to a number of unacceptable experiences, which included the events that took place on Thursday 15 June. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for the pain caused to the members of Resolve Collective and those involved in their exhibition. Nobody should have to work in a place where they don\u2019t feel welcome and respected. Will and I are taking this situation extremely seriously and are currently working with the broader Barbican team to understand the details of what happened.\u201d They continued: \u201cWe are fully supportive of Resolve Collective\u2019s decision to change the nature of their exhibition and will work with them to make this possible. The exhibition will reopen on Monday 26 June until 16 July. \u201cA great deal of work has already gone into building a new culture at the Barbican in which all our people, and those who we work with, are valued, supported, and feel they belong. It\u2019s clear we have a lot more work to do but we are committed to making the Barbican a place that is inclusive, welcoming, and safe for everyone.\u201d In February, more than 50 artists, including the poet Benjamin Zephaniah and the Turner prize co-winner Tai Shani, protested over the Barbican\u2019s collaboration with the Israeli embassy in London in putting on a concert. In 2021, the Barbican committed to \u201ca radical transformation of culture and behaviours\u201d after more than 120 allegations \u2013 a third of which related to racism \u2013 were investigated by lawyers as part of an external review of its operation."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/simon-crump-author-sheffield-tree-felling-protest-council", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Author convicted over Sheffield tree-felling protest says council\u2019s apology not enough", "lead": "Simon Crump says the ordeal has cost him his career and relationship, and asks for his name to be cleared", "author": "Helen Pidd North of England editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:45:24", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223465", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/674c0d4e9442acd1c1a91fb44f765ab073b48a80/0_291_4368_2621/500.jpg", "body": "An author and academic who received a suspended prison sentence for demonstrating against tree-felling work in Sheffield has made a plea for the council to help clear his criminal record and compensate him for the \u201cmental, emotional and reputational harm\u201d caused. On Tuesday the local authority issued a four-page apology for its \u201cflawed\u201d programme to fell 17,500 street trees \u2013 many of which were healthy \u2013 after an independent inquiry found a \u201cserious\u201d mishandling of the long-running dispute. \u201cProtesters and campaigners were maligned, injured and experienced physical, emotional and, for some, financial stress,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe action the council took damaged Sheffield\u2019s reputation in a way that casts a long shadow.\u201d In 2018, Dr Simon Crump received a two-month jail sentence, suspended for one year, after a judge found he and other protesters had broken an injunction that prevented them from entering \u201csafety zones\u201d set up around trees being felled. Crump, who previously won \u201cmost inspirational student tutor\u201d while teaching creative writing at Huddersfield University, dismissed the apology as \u201cnot enough\u201d. Three years ago he took redundancy and, having to declare the conviction on job applications, he has since been unable to find another academic post. He now works as a cleaner and shopfitter to make ends meet. \u201cWe have suffered mental, emotional and reputational damage,\u201d said Crump. \u201cThey need to do whatever they need to do to get those cases annulled.\u201d He said his relationship broke up as a result of the saga and he had to leave Sheffield after receiving more than 100 death threats. \u201cThe human cost to all of this was huge. If you Google me now, one of the first pictures that comes up is me being handcuffed by two police officers,\u201d he said. \u201cTry explaining that to potential employers.\u201d The leader of Sheffield city council, Tom Hunt, said: \u201cThe [independent] report recommended we drop any claims for unpaid fines, which we have done, and we have paid back those who paid fines issued by the council at the time. We have formally apologised for our actions and have made a promise to do better. \u201cThe council does not have the power to exonerate anyone, but we have committed to working with the handful of people who breached the injunction to apologise to them directly and do everything possible to mitigate any ongoing challenges they face.\u201d While the council refunded Crump\u2019s legal fees, Crump now wants compensation. \u201cThey should put their money where their mouth is,\u201d he said. He accused the council of deliberately turning residents against each other, mischaracterising protesters as \u201cmiddle-class tree huggers\u201d. Demonstrations turned nasty, he said, claiming to have been \u201cknocked out cold\u201d during one altercation. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so frightened in my life.\u201d On another occasion, the Daily Mail posted a video of him lying on a branch as it was being fed into a chipping machine, which he claimed resulted in 138 death threats. The whole experience has changed Crump, who has co-authored a book about the battle for Sheffield\u2019s trees, called Persons Unknown. \u201cI have gone from being a confident showoff to being someone who is anxious about everything,\u201d he said. Despite it all, Crump insists it was worth it. \u201cIt was fantastic. It was the most fun you could have with your clothes on. But when the dust settles you do think: oh God, what have I done?

Young, Black and trans in 90s New York, Lovell was fired from her job when she began to live her truth and was forced to sustain herself via sex work. The Stroll is a testament to what she went through just to be herself and the stories of so many other women like her that she met along the way. \u201cIt was just time to tell this story,\u201d Lovell told me. \u201cThere was a void, a generational void, where we went from the likes of Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson to this new generation that\u2019s coming up and fighting again for trans rights, and there\u2019s a generational gap. Trans history is something that\u2019s not taught in schools, so the new generation really didn\u2019t have an understanding of all this stuff.\u201d Drucker added that, \u201cbecause of the dominance of the trans sex worker trope, there was this impulse to focus on other representation of trans people. That led to this erasing of trans sex work from our history. Trans people have always survived through the centuries as sex workers and in underground economies. It\u2019s overdue for us to highlight and foreground the stories of trans sex workers.\u201d The Stroll tells the story of New York\u2019s west 14th Street, once a central hub of sex work and slaughterhouses, two economies that have been displaced as the city\u2019s so-called Meatpacking District has been transformed through gentrification, now sporting high-end restaurants, boutiques, the High Line and the Whitney museum. With lots of archival footage, the movie brings this lost world to life, centering a subset of the trans community that is often left out. A veteran artist and documentarian focusing on transgender women, Drucker was the ideal collaborator for Lovell, who makes her directorial debut with The Stroll. Although Lovell had been using a video camera to document other trans women on The Stroll since about age 19, she wanted someone who could help her harness the archive of footage she had been collecting for years. \u201cBeing a first-time director I needed someone who was more experienced,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew Zachary would be the perfect fit.\u201d Drucker added that from the very first meeting she felt a kinship, saying: \u201cWe Zoomed in December 2020, and I just had this fluttery feeling of fate, meeting Kristen. I\u2019ll never forget it. This was a story that wanted to come into the world. There was such harmony behind the scenes.\u201d The movie is part oral history, granting many of the surviving sex workers the space to tell their stories of how they managed to oversee complicated medical transitions while navigating the twin dangers of potentially dangerous clients and police officers. As The Stroll documents, many of these women ended up serving lengthy prison sentences at Rikers Island for little more than trying to subsist in the gray economy, and many of them died before they had the chance to tell their stories to Lovell and Drucker. \u201cFrom back then, in the 80s, let\u2019s say there was 1,000 girls; today living from that era, it might be five,\u201d said Egyptt, a former sex worker, in The Stroll. Her testimony was followed by Nicole, another sex worker, who said, \u201cIf you made it to live beyond [40 years of age], you are tremendously blessed and you have changed the dynamics of the system.\u201d Starting in the 80s and 90s, and moving forward through the decades, The Stroll pauses on the murder of Amanda Milan, a Black transgender sex worker who was stabbed to death in 2000 in a hate crime in the early morning hours in Times Square. While the New York Times\u2019s three-sentence notice of the event typified the muted response to the murder, describing Milan as \u201cA man [who] was fatally stabbed in midtown Manhattan yesterday after a dispute with two other men \u2026 dressed in women\u2019s clothing,\u201d the murder became a rallying call among trans people seeking better inclusion into the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cIt really was a turning point in the trans community for mobilizing,\u201d said Drucker. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the touchpoints in our community.\u201d Lovell added that, \u201cI tell young people today that we\u2019re more mobilized than we have ever been in history. We\u2019re all so much more aware of each other \u2013 we\u2019re communicating and sharing our experiences now. So it was a big thing, it was a really big thing.\u201d The Stroll offers Milan the dignity and empathy that she did not receive from the media at the time, while also focusing on the contrasting responses to her murder and that of Matthew Shepard. As The Stroll attests, while Shepard\u2019s vigil received an outpouring of support from New Yorkers of all kinds \u2013 as well as an address from then-president Bill Clinton \u2013 Milan was jeered at while she was being murdered and was only commemorated by other women like her. The film features archival footage of an aghast Rivera lamenting that only 200 people showed up to honor Milan\u2019s death. \u201cA lot of these women\u2019s stories are my stories,\u201d said Lovell. \u201cI really knew these women. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of things that they all experienced. I had been attacked a few times, with razors to my throat, or being locked in a car with a knife to my stomach. To know that the same place that Amanda Milan had walked, I had been there, it could have been any of us. She was stabbed, and no one wanted to help her because she was trans. It woke me up as a young trans person.\u201d As demonstrated by the film\u2019s documentation of Milan\u2019s murder, one of The Stroll\u2019s strengths is how it helps audiences understand the indignities placed upon trans people, even from other members of the LGBTQ+ community. At one point the film shows a segment filmed by an up-and-coming RuPaul, as he joyfully skips along The Stroll with a film crew, saying: \u201cI asked some of the girls \u2013 boys \u2013 girls, whatever, if I could take a look inside of their world!\u201d chirpily laughing at his own degrading jokes. For Lovell and Drucker, unearthing that bit of trans history was surprising, even to them. \u201cI think it just goes back to RuPaul\u2019s claim that, when he has been held to account for excluding trans people in the past, the claim is always that \u2018we were all in it together back in the day, we all come from the same place\u2019,\u201d said Drucker. \u201cAnd that clip just highlights that that is not true. To be able to take the drag off is a privileged existence, whereas when you\u2019re committing full-time to living a trans life, you \u2013 especially back then \u2013 paid consequences.\u201d The film also documents how the nature of sex work and the Meatpacking District have changed over time. Due to the twinned influences of 9/11 \u2013 which in effect shut down The Stroll for some time \u2013 and the rise of the internet, sex work happened more and more online than on the street. Michael Bloomberg\u2019s subsequent institution of tough-on-crime policies \u2013 epitomized by stop-and-frisk, which in effect criminalized simply walking while trans \u2013 further led to the transformation of the Meatpacking District. The Stroll ends on a high note with footage of Ceyenne Doroshow, founder of Glits Ink, addressing a crowd of 15,000 in June 2020, celebrating the lives of Black trans people and announcing that Glits\u2019s fundraiser to build and own housing for Black trans people had raised nearly $1m in just three days. The film is also a celebration of the long-overdue arrival of Lovell as a trans film-maker and documentarian, one who will hopefully have many, many more stories to tell. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey,\u201d she said, \u201cand so we finally made it to this point, which is still a little bit of a surprise.\u201d The Stroll is available on HBO and Max from 21 June and in the UK at a later date"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/titanic-sub-search-underwater-noises-picked-up-by-canadian-plane-us-coast-guard-says", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Titanic sub search team still hearing underwater noises, says US Coast Guard", "lead": "Sounds are \u2018inconclusive\u2019, says US Coast Guard captain, but focus of search relocated to that area", "author": "Richard Luscombe and Graham Russell", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:22:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223503", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ec05383822a4b1965ff7705b8a35d5298fd9e72f/0_35_800_480/500.jpg", "body": "Search teams in the Atlantic trying to locate the missing Titan submersible said they were still hearing underwater \u201cnoises\u201d on Wednesday, but added that the sounds were \u201cinconclusive\u201d and not confirmation the crew was still alive. A US Coast Guard captain, Jamie Frederick, told a lunchtime briefing \u201cseveral flights\u201d of Canadian P3 aircraft had heard the noises, reported by several media outlets as \u201cbanging\u201d, on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that the focus of the search was relocated to that area. \u201cWe need to have hope. But I can\u2019t tell you what the noises are. What I can tell you is we\u2019re searching where the noises are, and that\u2019s all we can do at this point,\u201d Frederick said, adding that recordings were being analyzed by navy subsurface acoustics experts. The 22ft (6.7m) Titan and its five-person crew have been missing since Sunday, when contact was lost almost two hours into a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, 12,500ft below the surface, about 400 miles south of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. A giant international search and rescue operation involving US military aircraft and vessels, the Royal Navy and private companies, has been under way since Sunday night. Aerial searches and underwater probes by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) \u201chave yielded negative results\u201d, Frederick said. If they are still alive, the Titan\u2019s crew are down to their last few hours of air, with the vessel\u2019s initial 96-hour supply of oxygen set to expire at about 5am ET (10am BST) on Thursday. \u201cThis is a search and rescue mission 100%,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cWe are smack dab in the middle of search and rescue, and we\u2019ll continue to put every available asset that we have in an effort to find the Titan and crew members. The oxygen, that\u2019s just one piece of data, but that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s important.\u201d Frederick would not be drawn on the chances of survival of a crew which includes the British explorer Hamish Harding, businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, or discuss a possible end point to the operation. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re in a position where you have to make a tough decision, but we\u2019re not there yet. If we continue to search, potentially we could be at that point. That\u2019s a discussion that we will have with the families long before I\u2019m going to discuss that in public.\u201d More vessels, including ROVs, were due to arrive on Wednesday to assist a \u201ccomplex response effort\u201d covering an area twice the size of Connecticut. Frederick said ever-changing weather conditions and sea currents were creating additional challenges. Navy R Adm John Mauger, who is heading the search for the Titan, confirmed earlier that an aircraft detected noise in the water picked up by sonar buoys the day before, but said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the source of that noise.\u201d He told CBS News there were a lot of metal objects at the site of the Titanic wreck, which could be where the noise was coming from. The discovery on Tuesday led search teams to relocate \u201cin an attempt to explore the origin of the noises\u201d, the coast guard said earlier. The coast guard announcement came after US reports citing internal government memos said banging sounds at 30-minute intervals had been picked up by crews searching for the submersible, and after an explorers\u2019 organisation said \u201cwe understand that likely signs of life\u201d had been detected. Search aircraft with underwater detection capabilities picked up a banging sound every 30 minutes for several hours, CNN and Rolling Stone reported, citing US government memos. The emails did not make clear when the sounds were picked up. The sounds were still heard after four hours, reported CNN, adding that an update on Tuesday night suggested more sounds were heard, though not described as banging. In a statement, the Explorers Club \u2013 which lists Harding on its board of trustees \u2013 thanked those behind the rescue effort, and said: \u201cWe have much greater confidence that \u2026 there is cause for hope, based on data from the field \u2013 we understand that likely signs of life have been detected at the site.\u201d Later, the New York-based club told the Guardian it was \u201cwaiting for updates from the coast guard\u201d before commenting further. Those onboard Titan for the tourist expedition are Harding, 58; Pakistani-born Dawood, 48, with his 19-year-old son, both British citizens; French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77; and Stockton Rush, founder of OceanGate Expeditions. Authorities have not confirmed the identity of any passenger. The US navy sent a deep ocean salvage system called Fadoss that arrived in Newfoundland on Tuesday evening, a US spokesperson told CBC News in Canada. Three US air force C-17 aircraft were confirmed as having landed in Newfoundland carrying equipment headed for the search area, 370 nautical miles (685km) south-east. The Fadoss system is designed to provide \u201creliable deep ocean lifting capacity of up to 60,000lbs (27,200kg) for the recovery of large, bulky, and heavy sunken objects such as aircraft or small vessels\u201d. The Titan submersible weighs 10,432kg (23,000lbs). The recovery system has previously been deployed alongside a US navy remotely operated vehicle called Curv-21, the Cable-controlled Undersea Recovery Vehicle, a 2.4-metre (8ft) craft that can operate as far down as 6km (20,000ft). However, it is unclear if it is being deployed for this search. The Royal Canadian Navy ship HMCS Glace Bay was en route to provide a medical team and a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber. It was expected to be on scene by midday Thursday. The Canadian coast guard Ship (CCGS) John Cabot was expected, the CCGS Ann Harvey was en route, and the CCGS Terry Fox was at the launch base in St John\u2019s, Newfoundland. Magellan, a British firm that specializes in deep ocean investigations and recovery, said it was supporting the mission. A French research ship carrying its own deep-sea diving robot vessel was being sent to the search area at the request of the US navy and was expected to arrive on Wednesday night."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/abortion-poll-election-voters-roe-v-wade-gallup", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Increase in Americans planning to vote for candidate who shares abortion view", "lead": "Finding in Gallup poll comes just before first anniversary of supreme court overturning Roe v Wade", "author": "Erum Salam", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:06:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223521", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/09d7d86d07422da8da940d96e83e649a8b429929/0_189_7011_4207/500.jpg", "body": "More than a quarter of registered US voters say they will only vote for candidates who share their beliefs on abortion, according to a poll released on Wednesday, a total (28%) one point higher than last year. The survey, from Gallup, was released before the first anniversary of Dobbs v Jackson, by which conservatives on the supreme court removed the right to abortion that had been safeguarded since Roe v Wade in 1973. A majority of Americans think abortion should be legal at least in some form. Since Dobbs, abortion rights has been seen as a vital motivating factor in a succession of Democratic successes. According to another poll released on Wednesday, by NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist, 57% of Americans say the court was wrong to bring down Roe. According to Gallup, for many voters who do not solely base their vote on abortion, the issue is still important: just 14% of respondents said abortion was not a major issue in deciding how they vote. That was down two points on the same survey last year and nine points from the previous low, 23%, in 2007. In the new Gallup survey, 56% said abortion was just one issue out of many when deciding how to vote. In 2022, 54% gave that answer. Primary elections continue to serve as a testing ground for the issue. In Virginia, a state that often indicates national voting trends and where abortion access is shrinking, politicians espousing anti-abortion views are losing popularity. On Tuesday, incumbents in favor of limiting or banning abortion access lost their elections. Amanda Chase, who has been in the state senate since 2016 and describes herself as \u201cTrump in heels\u201d, lost her Republican primary. Chase is in favor of completely banning abortion. Another incumbent Virginia state senator, Joe Morrissey, a centrist Democrat, has pushed for limits on abortion access, trying to pass a bill with Republicans to ban abortion after 20 weeks. He also lost his primary, beaten by a former state legislator, Lashrecse Aird, by an overwhelming 70%. Gallup said the Dobbs decision had a profound impact on voters on both sides of the issue. \u201cNot only did the supreme court\u2019s Dobbs decision cause more Americans to identify as pro-choice than had for the prior quarter-century,\u201d the pollster said, \u201cit also caused that expanded group of pro-choice identifiers to attach greater importance to a candidate\u2019s abortion stance when they vote. \u201cMeanwhile, the diminished pro-life segment of the electorate is less energized on the issue than they have been previously, indicating that the desire to see laws changed is more motivating to voters than wanting current laws maintained.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/southampton-announce-new-manager-russell-martin-after-swansea-exit-agreed", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Southampton announce new manager Russell Martin after Swansea exit agreed", "lead": "The Scot, 37, had spent two years with Swansea in the Championship, where he is expected to be replaced by Barnsley\u2019s Michael Duff.", "author": "John Brewin", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:03:25", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223538", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b32cc646e97234f47c9e6d49e26da195260a22bb/0_141_3500_2099/500.jpg", "body": "Southampton have appointed Russell Martin as their new manager, following the club\u2019s relegation to the Championship.

The former Scotland international led Swansea to within three points of a Championship playoff berth in the most recent campaign, but has now been tempted to a club who finished bottom of last season\u2019s Premier League, after a campaign that featured three managers in Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Nathan Jones and latterly Rub\u00e9n Sell\u00e9s.

The patterns, called finger flutings, appear on sections of the longest and most even wall of the cave in La Roche-Cotard in the Loire valley, and were created more than 57,000 years ago, before modern humans arrived in the region, the researchers say. \u201cThese drawings have been applied, are structured, and were not made quickly or without prior thought,\u201d said Jean-Claude Marquet, an archaeologist at the University of Tours. Some of the panels were so rich in markings they might be the product of collaborations, he added. The cave was discovered in 1846 when quarrying work on the bank of the Loire revealed a hitherto buried entrance. Limited excavations in 1912 recovered animal bones and Neanderthal stone tools from the site, but it took more extensive digging in the 1970s and from 2008 onwards to reveal the full extent of the cave. Today, the cave has four main connecting chambers that reach 33 metres deep into the riverbank. Neanderthals appear to have lived in the first chamber and in front of the cave entrance, where the tools and bones were found. The engravings were spotted in the cave\u2019s third chamber where a thin brown film covers much of the crumbly limestone wall. \u201cThe wall is very fragile,\u201d said Marquet. \u201cAll you had to do was touch it to leave a mark.\u201d Analysis of sediments that once blocked the entrance revealed that the cave was effectively sealed from the outside at least 57,000 years ago. Along with the tools unearthed at the site, this suggests that the markings could only have been made by Neanderthals who occupied Europe long before Homo sapiens reached the area about 42,000 years ago. Nearly all of the markings appear to have been made by sweeping fingers across the soft brown film or pressing fingers into it at a height that could be reached by adults or tall teenagers. The patterns are grouped into eight separate panels, according to the study in Plos One. On one panel there are curved lines that meet at a point. Others bear dozens of dots, parallel stripes, and a fan-like pattern. Previous evidence for Neanderthal engravings is patchy and largely confined to marks scratched into bones dating back 40,000 to 50,000 years ago. Paul Pettitt, professor of Palaeolithic archaeology at Durham University, who was not involved in the research, said the researchers presented \u201cas convincing a case as can be made, from a site disturbed by early excavations, that the animal and human marks on its walls were left long before the arrival of our own species in Europe\u201d. \u201cGiven that the cave\u2019s archaeology is exclusively indicative of Neanderthals, with no evidence of subsequent Upper Palaeolithic occupation, presumably because the cave was by this time inaccessible, this provides strong indirect, cumulative evidence that Neanderthals produced the finger markings,\u201d he added. What the markings are meant to convey may forever remain a mystery. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know about these ancient Neanderthal tracks because they\u2019re part of our territory\u2019s past and part of our history,\u201d said Marquet. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know what they mean. We are not Neanderthals even if we have 2 to 4% of their genes.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fb9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/21/health-workers-suicidal-thoughts", "primaryCategory": "society", "subCategories": "test", "title": "One in 10 health workers in England had suicidal thoughts during pandemic", "lead": "Survey shows the impact of Covid on frontline workers, with one in 25 NHS staff attempting suicide for first time", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 18:00:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223575", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cda7497747ac83b31e152cc452d5e05e1e2e20fe/0_155_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "One in 10 health workers in England had suicidal thoughts during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to research that highlights the scale of its mental impact. The risk of infection or death, moral distress, staff shortages, burnout and the emotional toll of battling the biggest public health crisis in a century significantly affected the mental wellbeing of health workers worldwide. The World Health Organization declared in May that Covid-19 was no longer a \u201cglobal health emergency\u201d while saying that it remained a global health threat. Health workers continue to tackle the disease on a daily basis. Globally, about 1.5m new cases were reported in the last 28 days, according to the WHO. Now a study involving almost 20,000 responses to two surveys reveals the full extent of the mental health impact on workers at the height of the pandemic. Research led by the University of Bristol analysed results from two surveys undertaken at 18 NHS trusts across England. The first was carried out between April 2020 and January 2021 and completed by 12,514 workers. The second \u2013 covering October 2020 to August 2021 \u2013 was completed by 7,160. The first survey found that 10.8% of workers reported having suicidal thoughts in the preceding two months, while 2.1% attempted to take their own life in the same period. Some 11.3% of workers who did not report suicidal thoughts in the first survey reported them six months later, with 3.9% \u2013 about one in 25 \u2013 saying they had attempted to take their own life for the first time. Responses showed that a lack of confidence in raising safety concerns, feeling unsupported by managers, and having to provide a lower standard of care were among the factors contributing to staff distress. Dr Prianka Padmanathan, an honorary research fellow at Bristol\u2019s Centre for Academic Mental Health and one of the study\u2019s lead authors, said the findings highlighted the scale of mental health issues during a time of unprecedented concern. \u201cOur analyses show that among healthcare workers who had not experienced suicidal thoughts when first completing the survey, one in 10 reported experiencing them six months later,\u201d Padmanathan said. \u201cAdditionally, almost one in 25 staff reported having attempted suicide for the first time. \u201cImprovements in mental health support and addressing structural issues around workforce and resources might significantly reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviour among healthcare workers.\u201d Simon Wessely, the chief investigator for the survey and professor of psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that having a job is usually better for our mental health than not having a job. But sometimes the nature of the job can increase stress and strain on the individual. \u201cIn these cases, this work reminds us that the best source of support to maintain your health and wellbeing are not mental health professionals or the people in charge of your organisation. It is the person next above you \u2013 your immediate supervisor, manager or report \u2013 and the people around you: your friends, family and colleagues.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s main news: The chief of mercenary group Wagner has reportedly accused Moscow\u2019s top brass of deceiving Russians about the course of Ukraine\u2019s offensive and pointed to Kyiv\u2019s progress on the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, accused opponents of waging a campaign to discredit him and force him out of office on Wednesday after a rift with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Reuters reported. EU governments agreed to an 11th package of sanctions against Russia, aimed at stopping other countries and companies from circumventing existing measures. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has said all Nato allies are backing a plan to give Ukraine a fast track to Nato membership of the kind offered to Sweden and Finland earlier this year. Vladimir Putin announced that new Sarmat nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles would soon enter service. The missiles are designed to carry out nuclear strikes on targets thousands of missiles away but their deployment has proceeded slower than planned. He reportedly said Moscow had seen a \u201clull\u201d in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. Russia\u2019s top investigator reportedly claimed that over 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy accepted in a BBC interview that progress in the country\u2019s current counteroffensive against Russian forces had been \u201cslower than desired\u201d. Zelenskiy told the Ukraine Recovery conference that Ukraine had made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before and could become an engine for green world growth and security for decades. Rishi Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast-track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,\u201d the prime minister said at the conference, held in London. Russian air defences downed three drones in the Moscow region on Wednesday, the defence ministry said, in what it called an attempted Ukrainian attack, Reuters reported. The chief of mercenary group Wagner accused Moscow of deceiving Russians about the course of Ukraine\u2019s offensive and pointed to Kyiv\u2019s progress on the battlefield, AFP reports. Early this month Kyiv\u2019s military launched its counteroffensive in the east and south of the country in an effort to claw back territory lost since last year. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Ukraine\u2019s offensive is failing. But the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose forces had for months led an assault for towns in eastern Ukraine including Bakhmut, accused the defence ministry of not telling the truth and losing territory to Ukrainian troops. \u201cThey are misleading the Russian people,\u201d he said in an audio message released by his spokespeople. A number of villages, including Piatykhatky has been lost, Prigozhin said, pointing to a lack of arms and ammunition. \u201cHuge chunks have been handed over to the enemy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAll of this is being totally hidden from everyone,\u201d \u201cOne day Russia will wake up to discover that Crimea too has been handed over to Ukraine,\u201d he said. Kyiv has reported modest gains, retaking eight settlements in the first cautious steps of a fightback against entrenched Russian positions. The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine plans to resume pumping water from what remains of the massive reservoir behind a nearby dam that burst two weeks ago, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday. Reuters reports: The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week it was unclear whether it would be possible to pump water from the reservoir to cool reactors and spent fuel at Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear plant given how much the reservoir\u2019s level has fallen. While the plant can fall back on other water sources, including a cooling pond with what the IAEA says is months\u2019 worth of water in it, whatever can be pumped from the reservoir should buy more time before stocks have to be replenished. \u201cUkraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is planning to resume pumping water that still remains accessible despite a major loss of water in the Kakhovka reservoir caused by the destruction of the downstream dam earlier this month,\u201d the IAEA said in a statement. For the past two weeks, Zaporizhzhia has received its cooling water from the reserves of a water outlet from a nearby thermal power plant. That so-called discharge channel has also been used to replace water in the cooling pond that evaporated, the IAEA said Kyiv is \u201cnot optimistic\u201d about the renewal of an agreement allowing grain from Ukraine to reach the global market, a senior Ukrainian government official has said. \u201cWe are not optimistic at this time,\u201d deputy prime minister for the restoration of Ukraine, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told reporters on Wednesday, according to AFP. \u201cSince the beginning of May, the corridor efficiency has decreased,\u201d he said, adding that Ukraine recently exported more agricultural products via other routes than through the corridors under the agreement. The deal that grants safe passage for Ukrainian grain to be exported via the Black Sea was signed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN in July 2022. It was renewed again in May but for only two months, until 17 July. Speaker after speaker at the conference drew applause by saying that Russia will have to contribute to the cost of Ukraine\u2019s recovery - put at $400bn by the World Bank in May. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Russia is behind the destruction of Ukraine. And Russia will end up bearing the cost of rebuilding Ukraine.\u201d The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the aggressor must be held responsible. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: \u201cIt is clear that Russia must pay for the destruction it has inflicted. This is why we are working with our allies to explore legal avenues for the use of Russian assets.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said his country was preparing \u201ca fair mechanism that will allow us to confiscate up to $500bn of Russian assets frozen in the west\u201d. But a preliminary paper prepared by the European Commission suggests no legal avenue has been found to seize frozen Russian sovereign assets that does not risk legal challenge. The commission, according to a paper seen by Bloomberg, is proposing a windfall tax could be imposed on Russian companies, but that it is not likely to raise much money. The UK this week proposed that sanctions can be kept in place until Russia has agreed to pay reparations, a route that might lead Russian businesses to put pressure on the Russian government to offer reparations. In the immediate future, Shmyhal said his country needed $14.1bn for 2023 alone and faced a shortfall of $6.5bn that he hoped would be overcome at the conference. Despite it not being a pledging conference, Washington announced an additional $1.3bn directed mainly towards its essential infrastructure and a green power industry. The US promised credit guarantees from the World Bank reaching $3bn over three years to finance Ukrainian public services and \u00a3240m of bilateral aid, intended in particular for mine clearance and humanitarian projects. Germany announced an additional \u20ac381m of humanitarian aid in 2023, and Paris, \u20ac40m, for emergency reconstruction and medical equipment in particular. On Tuesday, the European Commission had proposed an aid package of \u20ac50bn until 2027. But the thrust of the conference was to convince sceptical if well disposed private investors that Ukraine is a politically and militarily safe country in which to invest, and a vibrant civil society, and a reformed judiciary, will block the return of corrupt oligarchs once peace returns. In a show of support, thousands of businesses with a capitalisation of $1trillion signed a \u201cUkraine business compact\u201d, an initiative inviting companies from all over the world to commit to supporting the reconstruction of Ukraine. Zelenskiy has enlisted BlackRock and JPMorgan to advise on the Ukraine Development Fund, a vehicle that seeks to mobilise capital from private and public sector investors toward rebuilding the Ukrainian economy. Clearing the landmines in Ukraine will require an operation comparable to clearing Europe of explosive hazards after the second world war, the UN said on Wednesday. The task will need up to $300m a year over the next five years to clear those landmines causing the biggest drag on Ukraine\u2019s economy, Paul Heslop, the head of UN mine action for the UN Development Programme in Ukraine, was quoted by AFP as saying. \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing in Ukraine is very much what was faced in Europe at the end of world war two,\u201d he told a news conference in Geneva. He said Europe solved its explosive hazard problem within 15 years of the end of the war. Kyiv\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, accused opponents of waging a campaign to discredit him and force him out of office on Wednesday after a rift with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Reuters reports. The former boxing champion\u2019s political future is uncertain after a public outcry over the deaths of three people locked out of an air raid shelter during a Russian attack on Kyiv this month. An audit ordered by Zelenskiy found only 15% of Kyiv\u2019s 4,655 bomb shelters were suitable and only 44% were freely accessible, and prosecutors on Tuesday served a formal \u201cnotice of suspicion\u201d to a senior Kyiv security official accused of mismanagement. Klitschko posted a video message on Telegram in which he appeared to criticise investigations over the situation with the shelters, decrying \u201cendless searches\u201d that were making it hard to run the capital efficiently. He said: Today there is a heavy campaign to discredit the capital authorities and personally me. In wartime, they bring chaos to the management of the capital. My colleague Patrick Wintour has more on the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, indicating that Nato allies back fast-track membership for Ukraine of the kind offered to Sweden and Finland earlier this year (See post at 15:00). Speaking on the margins of the two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London, Cleverly said the UK was \u201cvery, very supportive\u201d of Ukraine being able to join the alliance without the usual need for it to meet the conditions set out in a Nato membership action plan (Map), he reports. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was more cautious but said circumstances had changed since 2008 when Ukraine was last offered Nato membership on the condition it met the terms set out in an action plan. You can read the full story here: Ukraine expects to be invited to join Nato with an open date at the alliance\u2019s summit in Vilnius next month, the Ukrainian president\u2019s chief of staff said on Wednesday. \u201cWe expect that Ukraine will be invited to Nato with an open date,\u201d Andre Yermak told a webinar held by the Atlantic Council thinktank, according to Reuters. However, on Monday, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, said Nato leaders would not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at the summit in Vilnius in mid-July. Yermak said that consultations were ongoing between the US and Ukraine on measures that Nato leaders would approve in Vilnius to bolster Ukraine\u2019s security until it receives the alliance\u2019s collective security guarantee. US bomber jets have landed in Sweden for the first time in modern history for training exercises with the Nato invitee, the military said Wednesday. AFP reports: Sweden, which abandoned two centuries of military non-alignment to seek Nato membership last year, announced earlier this month that it was ready to host Nato troops and material on its soil even before it becomes a member of the alliance. Two American B-1B Lancers landed at Lulea-Kallax airport in northern Sweden on Monday 19 June, the military said. \u201cWe are carrying out a joint exercise, both the air force and the army, with the Bomber Task Force,\u201d air force spokeswoman Louise Levin told AFP. She did not say how long the exercises would last\u2026 Sweden has been a Nato \u201cinvitee\u201d since June 2022, but its membership bid, which must be ratified by all 31 member states, has been blocked by Turkey and Hungary. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee said on Monday the country\u2019s defence must adapt to focus on the threat posed by Russia and a military attack could not be ruled out. Andriy Kostin, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, has tweeted to say his team are coordinating efforts to document and investigate alleged Russian war crimes. He said: We must modernise our approaches, practices, and techniques. I told colleagues about the \u2018Standards for War Crimes Investigation\u2019 developed by the prosecutor general\u2019s office of Ukraine with the support of our international partners. I emphasised the importance of using modern IT solutions to collect and store evidence and organise the work of prosecutors and investigators. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires of the war: Kyiv said the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine earlier this month caused an estimated $1.5bn in damages to the environment, AFP reports. Kyiv has accused Moscow of \u201cecocide\u201d by blowing up the Soviet-era dam on the Dnipro River, while Russia has blamed Ukraine. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said the \u201cpreliminary estimates\u201d of $1.5bn in environmental damages following the dam breach do not include \u201closses to agriculture, infrastructure, housing, and the cost of rebuilding the plant itself\u201d. We have some updates on the new sanctions the EU has agreed to be taken against Russia (See post at 15:16). The new package forbids transit via Russia of an expanded list of goods and technology which might aid Russia\u2019s military or security sector. The EU package also extends the suspension of EU broadcasting licences of five Russian state-controlled media, Reuters reports. To curb the practice of ships loading Russian crude oil or petroleum products at sea, the package bans access to EU ports for ships which engage in ship-to-ship transfers if there is cause to suspect the cargo was of Russian origin. The package adds a further 71 persons and 33 entities to those banned from the EU and with EU assets frozen. The deal, in the making since April, had been held up by objections from Hungary and Greece over the listing by Ukraine of some of their companies as sponsors of war, because they did business with Russia or in other ways contributed to Moscow\u2019s war effort, according to Reuters. The EU has agreed an 11th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Sweden said the new measures were approved at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. Nato leaders are expected to endorse Ukraine\u2019s membership aspiration at a summit in July, but the alliance is wary of letting the country in during a war, according to reports. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, on Wednesday indicated the UK would be \u201cvery supportive\u201d if Ukraine was able to go through a simplified process for joining Nato. Vladimir Putin reportedly said Moscow had seen a \u201clull\u201d in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. The Russian president said on Wednesday that Russia\u2019s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles would soon be deployed for combat duty. Russia\u2019s top investigator reportedly claimed that over 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said battlefield progress in Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive against Russian forces had been \u201cslower than desired\u201d, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Ukraine\u2019s president has said that his county has made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before, in an address by video link to more than 1,000 businesses and foreign ministers at a two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London. Zelenskiy also urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom. Rishi Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast-track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,\u201d the prime minister said at the conference. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said, according to Reuters. Latvia\u2019s prime minister, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, has been cited by the Kyiv Independent as having said at the Ukraine Recovery Conference that his country is completing the transfer of all of its helicopters to Ukraine. The EU on Wednesday agreed an 11th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Sweden, which holds the bloc\u2019s rotating presidency, said the new measures were approved at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. As part of the package, the bloc has put three Hong Kong-based companies on a list of firms to which the EU restricts exports of sensitive technologies, a document seen by AFP showed. Five companies from mainland China included in an earlier proposal were dropped from the list, a diplomat said, after Beijing pushed Brussels to take them off. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February, the EU has adopted 10 sanctions packages against Russian individuals and companies, inflicting economic and making financing the war more difficult. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, indicated the UK would be \u201cvery supportive\u201d if Ukraine was able to go through a simplified process for joining Nato. He suggested the UK would back suggestions Ukraine would not be required to go through the membership action plan (Map) stage of joining the military alliance. The Map process sees candidate countries receive assessments and advice as they take steps to meet Nato criteria on defence and other matters. If Ukraine effectively skipped this, it would put them in a category with new member Finland. By contrast, North Macedonia took part in a 20-year Map programme before its 2020 entry. Speaking at a press conference at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London, Cleverly said: \u201cWe have seen Ukraine evolve, and evolve incredibly quickly. \u201cJens Stoltenberg at the Nato informal foreign ministers (summit) said that actually, many of the requirements of membership action plan are actually being delivered. \u201cThe reform of their armed forces is happening whilst engaged in conflict. \u201cI think the UK\u2019s position would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to both Sweden and Finland didn\u2019t require that and Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to reform the military for requirement of Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield. \u201cAnd I think all Nato allies recognise that.\u201d The UK has pledged to offer new virtual reality (VR) training for at-sea Ukrainian cadets as part of a new package of support. The UK government said the training would be provided through VR headsets to help participants practise for real-life scenarios. Ukrainians will also be sponsored to take part in three-year cadetships to UK container ships and other large vessels, with the new package confirmed as the transport secretary, Mark Harper, appeared at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said: Our support for Ukraine and its people is unwavering, and we\u2019re not going to let Russia\u2019s abhorrent actions sink Ukraine\u2019s great reputation in areas like seafaring By sharing the UK\u2019s world-renowned expertise in aviation and seafaring, we are steadfast in our commitment to ensuring Ukraine\u2019s transport system recovers from Putin\u2019s illegal invasion. The Department for Transport will also support secondments for Ukraine\u2019s air traffic controllers to train in the UK, with the latest funding following on from \u00a310m previously announced to help repair Ukraine\u2019s rail infrastructure. Harper joined other UK ministers in appearing at the conference, which was opened by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and addressed via video-link by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Vladimir Putin said in remarks shown on Russian state television on Wednesday that Moscow had seen a \u201clull\u201d in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. The Russian president also said that although Ukraine retained offensive potential, Kyiv already understood that it had \u201cno chance\u201d in its counteroffensive, Reuters reports. Kyiv\u2019s forces have had \u201cpartial success\u201d in the last day and are digging in and attacking on the southern front, while weathering a big Russian assault in the east, a senior Ukrainian defence official said on Wednesday. None of these claims could immediately be independently verified. Ursula von der Leyen has said she proposed to EU members states to cover 45% of all the financial needs of Ukraine until 2027. Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery International Conference in London, the European Commission president said: Until 2027, Ukraine\u2019s remaining fiscal gap is about 60 billion euros. The needs for fast recovery are about 50 billion euros. That makes in total \u20ac110bn until 2027 that are not covered. Therefore, yesterday I proposed to EU member states to cover 45% of this gap \u2013 this is in total \u20ac50bn for Ukraine. The EU pumped \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) into Ukraine in the last year, diverting cash from energy and cohesion funds to respond to the crisis. On Tuesday it pledged a further \u20ac50bn in loans and grants, with the UK and the US following suit with a promise of $3bn and $1.3bn respectively in financial supports. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has looked at the financial pledges western countries have made to Ukraine, considering whether it is enough to finance the huge recovery needed to rebuild the war-ravaged country. You can read her analysis here: Japan will host a conference to encourage companies to invest into Ukraine some time between the end of the year and early 2024, foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, was quoted by Reuters as saying. Japan was also planning to support Ukraine through projects focused on mine clearance, basic infrastructure such as electricity, agriculture and strengthening democracy, Hayashi told the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia\u2019s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, would soon be deployed for combat duty, Reuters reports. In a speech to new graduates of military academies, Putin stressed the importance of Russia\u2019s \u201ctriad\u201d of nuclear forces that can be launched from land, sea or air. \u201cThe most important task here is the development of the nuclear triad, which is a key guarantee of Russia\u2019s military security and global stability,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready about half of the units and formations of the Strategic Missile Forces are equipped with the latest Yars systems, and the troops are being re-equipped with modern missile systems with the Avangard hypersonic warhead.\u201d The first Sarmat launchers would be put on combat duty \u201cin the near future\u201d, the Russian president added. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, meanwhile, has told graduating military academy students that the \u201ccollective West\u201d was waging a \u201creal war\u201d against Russia. A UN official said on Wednesday that the mines dislodged by the flood waters from Kakhovka dam in Ukraine could float downstream and reach as far as Black Sea beaches, Reuters reports. Paul Heslop, head of UN Mine Action at the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine, told reporters in Geneva that PMF-1 mines, also known as \u201cbutterfly\u201d mines, were light enough to float downstream for a large distance. He said: I would not be surprised to see that those mines have either got down as far as the sea or over the coming months, as the water is continuing to flow, will be transported down there. Unfortunately, we could see anti-personnel pressure mines washing up on beaches around the Black Sea. The collapse of the Russian-held dam on 6 June unleashed floodwaters across southern Ukraine and Russian-occupied areas of the Kherson region, killing more than 50 people and destroying homes and farmland. Poland\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs has tweeted that it has prepared a law enabling the extension of insurance coverage for the transport of goods to and from Ukraine, as well as investment activities. Britain, the US and the EU pledged billions of dollars of extra help to rebuild Ukraine on Wednesday. European Commission chiefs want Hungary to answer urgent questions over claims that Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred there from Russia without the involvement of Kyiv. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has forged strong political and economic ties with Moscow and said earlier this month that Budapest had received a group of 11 Ukrainian prisoners of war from Russia. Ukraine repatriated three of them on Tuesday and is demanding access to the remainder accusing Orban of a publicity stunt. Hungarian and international media quoted Orban\u2019s chief-of-staff, Gergely Gulyas, as saying the soldiers arrived in Hungary of \u201ctheir own free will\u201d and that Kyiv was informed after their transfer. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that they relevant Hungarian authorities explain to their Ukrainian counterparts. We are seeking asnwers,\u201d said a spokesperson for the European commission. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said battlefield progress in Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive against Russian forces had been \u201cslower than desired\u201d, the BBC reported on Wednesday. \u201cSome people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It\u2019s not,\u201d it quoted the Ukrainian president as saying in an interview. Ukraine has reported recapturing eight villages in the south in the last two weeks. Though small, the advances are the biggest by its forces since November as they push into heavily fortified and mined Russian-held areas. Rishi Sunak met Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, as well as Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister met with the president of the European commission, president of Estonia, prime ministers of Latvia and Ukraine, and the US secretary of state this morning. The prime minister thanked the leaders for attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London and for their strong and ongoing support to Ukraine. Reflecting on the work that had already begun in Ukraine to recover and rebuild, the Prime Minister said it is inspiring to see that progress happening at the same time as the armed forces of Ukraine pushed back Russian forces. Discussing the important role of the private sector in the rebuild of Ukraine, the prime minister said it was fantastic to see so many companies and businesses attend the London summit. Officials and business leaders at the Ukraine Recovery Conference should ensure that any \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the war-ravaged country includes ensuring children are not separated from their families, Disability Rights International, Hope and Homes for Children, Human Rights Watch and Lumos say. The groups said replacing Ukraine\u2019s institutional care system with modern social services, that strengthen families to help keep them together, should be a key feature to the reconstruction plans. Mark Waddington, CEO of Hope and Homes for Children, said: There\u2019s a hidden humanitarian crisis playing out in Ukraine, where millions of families are displaced, social services are in tatters, unemployment is growing, food prices are rocketing, daily air raids are the norm and trauma from Russian occupation is widespread. As a result, many parents are struggling to cope, and thousands of children are at risk of being placed in harmful institutions. Now, at a time of war, children need loving and comforting families more than ever. The Ukraine Recovery Conference offers an incredible opportunity to talk about physical reconstruction of buildings, roads and infrastructure, but it must also address social reconstruction that directly serves families and children. This must include a commitment to closing every last children\u2019s institution in Ukraine, and creating a modern care system that helps to keep families together. Families are the future of Ukraine, and leaders at the recovery conference must not ignore this. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine has succeeded in making the EU as united \u201cas it has never been before\u201d, with his country \u201cactivating the moral force of Nato\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s president is pushing for Ukraine to join Nato and the EU. Russia\u2019s top investigator has said that more than 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians, Reuters reports. The comments were made by Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Investigative Committee, Russia\u2019s equivalent of the FBI in the US. He was reported as saying the courts operating on territory in parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian forces had been working hard to jail people who had fought on the Ukrainian side against Russia. \u201cAfter the liberation of Mariupol and other settlements, many Ukrainian nationalists surrendered. In the course of further work, we began to establish their involvement in crimes against peace and human security, including the killing of civilians,\u201d Bastrykin told Russia\u2019s Tass news agency. He said 90 criminal cases had been sent to courts. \u201cBased on the evidence gathered, courts have already convicted more than 30 defendants, sentencing them to long terms of imprisonment and some to life imprisonment,\u201d Bastrykin added. The alleged war crimes referred to by Bastrykin could not immediately be independently verified. Russia is itself under pressure for alleged war crimes, with the international criminal court having issued an arrest warrant in March against Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. The Kremlin has rejected the allegation as false. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has set out a new war insurance mechanism to support Ukraine\u2019s recovery, Reuters reports. \u201cI\u2019m announcing today the establishment of an insurance mechanism to cover investments in Ukraine against war-related risks via the French public investment bank,\u201d Colonna said at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London on Wednesday. She added that the French government\u2019s plan was consistent with the insurance mechanism proposed by Britain and Ukraine. The comments come as the UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom. The Ukrainian president addressed the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London via video-link on Wednesday, as Rishi Sunak and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated their support for the country. Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,\u201d the prime minister said at the conference. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said, according to Reuters. Ukrainian forces are \u201cvery actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine,\u201d President Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I\u2019ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Speaking after Zelenskiy, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Ukraine would join the EU. Addressing the conference, she praised the progress and speed of reform in the country, she said Europe could never match the country\u2019s sacrifice but did stand united behind it. She spoke about a recent visit to Ukraine: I saw a country that does everything possible to rise from the ashes of the war. Everything they are fighting for, and what they are dying for. They show it on the battlefield. They show it on the streets. They show it in the classrooms. They are fighting for their future. Setting out her hopes for the future of Ukraine, Von der Leyen said it would become a \u201ccountry that attracts foreign investment, a country that is master of its future, a country that is a member of the European Union\u201d. She added: Together we gather here to tell Ukrainians that their dream is also our dream [\u2026] Ukrainians tell us, when they imagine their future, they see Europe\u2019s flag flying over their cities. I have no doubt that Ukraine will be part of our union. Zelenskiy ends his speech with an impassioned please to political and business leaders, stressing that the future of Ukraine is also the future of the world. We are building much more than one country. We are building a world, as it will be during the lifetime of our generation and after us. Will it be peaceful? Will it be stable?Will it be democratic? It depends on each and every one of us. After thanking Sunak \u2013 who he mentions he has not seen in \u201cquite a while\u201d \u2013 and the UK, he ends with \u201cSlava Ukraine\u201d. Zelenskiy moves onto to talking about the importance of Ukraine in strengthening democracy throughout the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, not only to steal our land, resources and people, without Ukraine that can be no Russian plan. [\u2026] Russian bosses are very, very afraid of our democracy. Why? Because democracy paves the way for the rule of law [and] getting rid of corruption. Under the key principle of our countries, every person matters. This is very important. And of course, democracy is in the nature of Ukrainians, and we will do it anyway, no matter what they think, or do in Russia. But we all have to realise that the more democracy we have, the greater is the strength in our entire region. The more rule of law we have, the more law will work here on the eastern flank of Europe. The Ukrainian president argues that the war is showing the rest of the world the weaknesses that other countries have to address, from the transformation of energy to modern warfare including the threat of cyber attacks. We are doing all these in Ukraine. We need the experience of our partners in all these. We build security together and thus may convince the world that democracies can be defended. Zelenskiy stresses the huge need for reconstruction in Ukraine. There is currently no place in the world where there is a need to construct and rebuild as many objects as in Ukraine. Every new day of Russian agrression, brings new ruins. Thousands, thousands and thousands of destroyed houses, devastated industries, burned lives. He accuses Russia of committing \u201cthe largest crime of ecocide in Europe\u201d by destroying the Nova Kakhovka dam. Zelenskiy says he sees no alternative to the green transformation of the economy, and that the war has proved the extent to which energy is a key security issue. It is green energy that guarantees real energy stability. Ukraine can be and will be one of the key suppliers of clean electricity and green hydrogen to ensure that. The potential of this interest here alone is about $400bn. Zelenskiy says his country is developing strong bilateral alliances with leaders of democratic world, including the U K, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia all the EU members. These alliances provide new power in defence, the economy and global prospects for democracy, he says. He points out that political and economic stability in Ukraine benefits the whole globe, saying that at least 600 million consumers around the world directly depend on Ukraine\u2019s agricultural production. Zelenskiy says that when the country underwent a blockage by Russia, the world was threatened by price rises and social collapse. He says Ukraine has now partially restored movement of agriculture which is bringing stability and economic benefits around the world. Zelenskiy thanks the nations supporting Ukraine and says he hopes the conference will come up with concrete projects. He says Ukraine has succeeded in uniting the European Union like never before, which is reflected in \u201cmany political economic sanction and humanitarian decisions\u201d. He adds: Ukraine has activated all the power of solidarity for which the EU was configured. The moral leadership in protecting peace \u201cis only possible with Ukraine\u201d, he says. Moving onto to Nato, he says: We are already defending the common space of freedom in the alliance and are only waiting for the alliance leaders to recognise this [political\u2019] reality.\u201d Zelenskiy says growth and strong investments must be preceded by trust and the plan for Ukraine must be \u201cpreceded by confidence that that\u2019s what has been rebuilt will not fall\u201d. He argues that while no one has the power to eradicate evil, it can be overcome. He says the world is watching to see if normal life can be restored in Ukraine. If it is, that will be an \u201cideological blow\u201d to the aggressor, he adds. And it\u2019s not about bricks, but about life in general. The world is abandoned with ruins reminding us of the wars of the past. And politics in different regions, unfortunately, is abandoned with sick ideas of hate, rage and resentment which point to possible wars in the future. [\u2026] No one has the power to cleanse the depths of human nature from the evil that some sometimes rises to the surface and destroys and kills. But given time, and right now, we are able to protect lives and overcome their ruins. [\u2026] The eyes of the world are looking at us and at whether we will defeat Russian aggression exactly as freedom deserves to win \u2013 that is without compromising our values. Also the world is watching to see if we will restore normal life in such a way that our transformation will land an ideological defeat on the aggressor. We protect Ukraine and thus we protect freedom. And when we build Ukraine we will build freedom, country, region, continent, world. It\u2019s a global task. Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is now addressing the conference. He says: Mr Prime Minister, thank you for your kind words about Ukraine and our soldiers. And thanks for your leadership and the support the UK provides to Ukraine. Thank you that we are really united in defending freedom. Dear leaders of politics, business and public opinion. Dear presidents, prime ministers, ministers, heads of international organisations, and of course, dear journalists, when we are talking about recovery we are talking about millions of jobs, billions in corporate profits and GDP. And not only for Ukraine but for all our countries mine and yours. Countries that want, and will, live freely. Sunak ends his address with a message of hope, telling the story of a Ukrainian soldier. He says: He was stationed in an empty house, not far from the frontline, surrounded by the destruction of war. When he could snatch a moment of free time, he used it to plant seeds. He was trying to create a plot of vegetables, hoping that by the time the homeowners returned, they would have begun to grow. What a profound expression of hope. And, you know, from that house to this hall, we\u2019re doing the same thing. We\u2019re planting the seeds of Ukraine\u2019s future. Today, we can water them and in time the Ukrainian people will harvest them. Sunak goes on to say the business, governments and financial institutions must partner to invest and shore up the country. He says: To make this happen. The British government will continue to play its full part. And I\u2019m proud that today we\u2019re announcing a multi year commitment to support Ukraine\u2019s economy. Over three years, we will provide loan guarantees worth $3bn we\u2019re also launching a new UK Ukraine tech bridge to foster investment and talent, along with support for green energy and more all part of a vast collective effort from allies and partners around the world, including significant new support from the EU, which is also being announced this week. Financial institutions are playing their part. The IMF is putting $15bn into Ukraine over the next four years as part of a $115bn commitment by the G7 and its partners and institutions like the EBRD providing seed capital to support private sector led growth. Because above all, we must build a platform for business. Only they can truly crowd in the innovation and investment that Ukraine needs. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re launching the Ukraine business compact for the private sector to pledge their support for Ukraine\u2019s recovery and reconstruction. And I am delighted to announce today that over 400 businesses from 38 countries with a combined market cap of $4.9tn has now signed up the City of London has a huge amount to offer. And that deepened liquid capital markets and world class finance expertise. So there is no better place to announce today the New London conference framework for war risk insurance. This is a huge step forward towards helping insurers to underwrite the investments into Ukraine, removing one of the biggest barriers and giving investors the confidence they need to act. Sunak outlines how Ukraine must be supported to fast track recovery and support this \u201chelp Ukraine unleash its potential\u201d. He says Russia must pay for the violence it has inflicted on the country. Sunak says: It\u2019s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted. So we\u2019re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets. And on Monday, we publish new legislation to allow us to keep sanctions in place until Russia pays up. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is now speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, saying the conference is \u201cplanting the seeds of Ukraine\u2019s future\u201d. We covered the trail of his speech below (see 7.47), but here is some more: Sunak says: Before this terrible war Ukraine\u2019s economy was becoming a huge investment opportunity. It was the breadbasket of Europe, exporting millions of tonnes of food and grain each month. Top five exporter of iron ore and steel, a leader in energy, pushing forward renewables hydrogen and electric vehicles, and the startup nation, which helped spark names like PayPal, WhatsApp and revolute with a thriving tech sector, which actually had a record year in 2022. Because the truth is that opportunity is still there today. In fact, the war has only proved how much Ukraine has to offer. When I visited Kyiv, last November, I saw this for myself. I saw Ukraine\u2019s incredible spirit, a spirit yes of strength and defiance. But also of ingenuity and innovation. In a converted office block, I met tech experts, civilian and military, who were working together to find new ways to bolster the country\u2019s defences. They were networking mobile phones, so that people across Ukraine could download an app, which would allow their phone to pick up the sound of the showerhead drone feedback the location so that Ukrainian air defence could track them and shoot them down during the winter Russia tried to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy grid. By February over 40% of power generation was down. But now because of that incredible ingenuity and defiance, Ukraine has got the grid back online, and they\u2019re even able to start exporting electricity back to Europe. As we\u2019ve seen in backwards and Mariupol. What Russia cannot take, it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine\u2019s economy. And the scale of the challenge is real. The war brought a 29% Fall in Ukraine\u2019s GDP last year. [more follows] The Ukraine Recovery Conference has started in London this morning. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, is addressing the conference. He says: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. There are over 1,000 public and private sector decision-makers here. Governments representing 61 states, 33 international organisations, over 400 businesses and 130 civil society organisations. After nearly 18 months of Ukraine withstanding the Russian full scale invasion, the international community is coming together today with a shared belief and confidence in Ukraine\u2019s future. Russia\u2019s full scale invasion has caused untold suffering, but Ukraine is rebuilding now. Recovery offers an opportunity not only to repair what was lost, but stride forward and to rebuild an economy that is more modern, more open, greener and more resilient. When I visited Kyiv recently, I could see the construction equipment from JCB already visible everywhere. This you are see is about unlocking Ukraine\u2019s potential, supporting Ukraine\u2019s immediate recovery needs and unlocking a private sector led recovery. After the sacrifices and suffering of the war, Ukrainians are planning for a better future. And it is in the interests of the world, that the country they rebuild should be stronger than ever, integrated into global markets, and self reliant. Ukrainian forces are reinforcing positions they have reached in areas of the southern front line after having \u201cpartial success\u201d fighting Russian forces, a military spokesperson said today. Reuters reports: Ukrainian forces are conducting offensive operations in the direction of the Russian-occupied cities of Melitopol and Berdiansk in the Zaporizhzhia region, general staff spokesperson Andriy Kovalev said, listing names of southeastern villages. \u201cThey had partial success in the directions of Novodanilivka \u2013 Robotyne, Mala Tokmachka \u2013 Verbove, Vilne Pole \u2013 Makarivka, they are consolidating at the achieved boundaries,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Ukraine military media centre. Ukraine is also fighting to hold back an advance of Russian troops in the east, with \u201cespecially heavy fighting\u201d taking place along near Lyman in the Donetsk region, he said. Ukraine said on Monday it had recaptured eight villages in two weeks of counteroffensive operations in the occupied south but that the Kremlin\u2019s forces were trying to regain the initiative in the east by stepping up attacks. The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its update on the situation in Ukraine: Intense fighting continues in sectors of southern Ukraine. However, over recent weeks, Russia has continued to expend significant effort building defensive lines deep in rear areas, especially on the approaches to occupied Crimea. This includes an extensive zone of defences of 9 km in length, 3.5 km north of the town Armyansk, on the narrow bridge of land connecting Crimea to the Kherson region. These elaborate defences highlight the Russian command\u2019s assessment that Ukrainian forces are capable of directly assaulting Crimea. Russia continues to see maintaining control of the peninsula as a top political priority. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its forces thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack on the Moscow region, and that three drones had been shot down. The UK has backed $3bn of World Bank loan guarantees to shore up Ukraine\u2019s economic stability, the government announced today. In what the government is calling the support \u201cthe first bilateral package of multi-year fiscal assistance to be set out by a G7 country\u201d. At a two-day Ukraine recovery conference in London today, Sunak will outline a package which will also include \u00a3240m ($306m) of bilateral assistance and an expansion of British International Investment in Ukraine. The UK\u2019s support is backed by the Ukraine Business Compact which consists of more than 400 companies from 38 countries, with a combined annual revenue of over $1.6tn, who today pledge to back Ukraine\u2019s recovery and reconstruction. Virgin, Sanofi, Philips, Hyundai Engineering and Citi are among the companies involved. The compact will, according to the government, trade, investment, peer-to-peer expertise sharing and responsible business practice in Ukraine, ensuring it can rebuild as a resilient, agile and prosperous economy. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: As we\u2019ve seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine\u2019s economy. The scale of the challenge is real, the war brought a 29% fall in Ukraine\u2019s GDP last year, but just look at the streets of Kyiv, despite the threat of attack, people are getting on with their lives \u2013 and getting on with business. [\u2026] I\u2019m proud that today we\u2019re announcing a multiyear commitment to support Ukraine\u2019s economy, and over the next three years, we will provide loan guarantees worth $3 billion. President of the World Bank Group, Ajay Banga, said: The UK government\u2019s generous guarantees to the World Bank Group will support the people of Ukraine at a critical moment. The World Bank Group is designed to do hard things like helping people rebuild their lives after devastation. With this support, we will keep delivering on that mission and help Ukrainians imagine a life after the war. After more than a year of war in Ukraine, the package is designed to encourage the private sector to use its resources to help speed Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction. To deal with the issue of insurance against war damage and destruction, the prime minister will also launch a framework a range of measures designed to \u201cde-risk\u201d Ukraine to increase investor confidence, including providing guarantees and insurance for reconstruction projects now while the conflict is ongoing through the Multilateral Investment Guarantees Agency. He will also launch the London Conference Framework for War Risk Insurance at the summit and that some major companies had already signed up to the Ukraine Business Compact, a statement of support for Ukraine\u2019s recovery. In addition Sunak is announcing up to \u00a3250m of new capital for the UK\u2019s Development Finance Institution - British International Investment (BII) \u2013 to support infrastructure projects, energy markets, financial services and agriculture. Ahead of the conference, a senior Ukrainian official said Ukraine is seeking up to $40bn to fund the first part of a \u201cGreen Marshall Plan\u201d to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry. The total reconstruction bill is likely to be huge, with Ukraine, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations estimating in March that the cost was at $411bn for the first year of the war. It could easily reach more than $1tn. Ukrainian forces are gaining some ground towards Melitopol and Berdiansk in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Andriy Kovalev, a spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has said according to Reuters. \u201cThey had partial success, they are gaining ground,\u201d Kovalev was quoted as saying in a post on the Ukraine Military Media Center\u2019s Telegram channel, adding that the gains were near the settlements of Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne, among others. Ukraine continues to hold back the advance of Russian troops in the east of the country, with \u201cespecially heavy fighting\u201d taking place along near Lyman in the Donetsk region, he added. \u201cIntense fighting\u201d is continuing in southern Ukraine, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence says in its latest update on the conflict. It reports that Russia has recently spent \u201csignificant effort building defensive lines deep in rear areas, especially on the approaches to occupied Crimea\u201d, highlighting Moscow\u2019s \u201cassessment that Ukrainian forces are capable of directly assaulting Crimea\u201d. \u201cRussia continues to see maintaining control of the peninsula as a top political priority,\u201d it says. Back to the drones reportedly intercepted in Russia. The country\u2019s Tass news agency has reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, that another drone was shot down near Lukino village in Moscow region, according to Reuters. Tass also reported two of the drones were intercepted on their way to the Taman Division of Russia\u2019s Ground Forces. The division is based in Kalininets, some 60km (37 miles) from the Kremlin. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. It was not immediately known who launched the drones. In May, drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow, in what Russia said was a Ukrainian attack and one politician called the most dangerous attack on the capital since World War Two. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. More from the ISW analysis, which reports that the Belarusian General Staff has confirmed that Belarus has amended the language of its constitution to renounce its neutrality and non-nuclear status. Deputy Head of the Faculty of the Belarusian General Staff Colonel Andrey Bogodel stated on June 20 that in order to respond to \u201cexternal challenges and threats,\u201d Belarus has made requisite changes to its constitution renouncing its neutrality and removing the wording on its non-nuclear status. The move comes after Russian president Vladimir Putin last week said the first tactical nuclear weapons to be stationed in Belarus had arrived. Responding to the announcement, US president Joe Biden said the threat that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons was \u201creal\u201d. The Institute for the Study of War highlights Russia\u2019s efforts to expand its military recruitment pool in its latest assessment, noting that it has lowered its eligibility requirements once again. It points to a report by Tass newswire which says that the Duma on Tuesday adopted the third and final reading of a law which will allow citizens with criminal records and those deemed \u201cpartially fit\u201d for military service to sign contracts with the military during wartime. The Russian Ministry of Defence has already recruited about 15,000 prisoners since February, according to the Russian human rights organisation Rus Sidyashchaya, the ISW writes. The wires have sent through a series of images from the Without Limits clinic in Kyiv, which helps people learn to walk again using prosthetic limbs. The clinic says it has seen a massive increase in demand since the Russian invasion began in February 2022 and estimates 80% of its patients are former soldiers. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said according to Reuters. \u201cDebris was found, no damage or casualties,\u201d Vorobyov said, adding that the drones fell near the village of Kalininets. Russia\u2019s channels on the Telegram messaging app, including one with links to the security services, said at least one more drone was intercepted near the village of Lukino. Ukrainian forces are \u201cvery actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine,\u201d president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. \u201cProtection against terror means the destruction of terrorists. And it is a guarantee that the evil state will never again have the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine,\u201d he continued. Ukraine is now more than two weeks into its counteroffensive and has made small advances. General Oleksander Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s commander of land forces, said on Telegram on Tuesday that his troops were making progress on the flanks of the shattered eastern city of Bakhmut, which fell to Russian mercenaries last month after months of fighting, Reuters reported. Ukrainian troops, he said, were repelling increasingly intense Russian attacks near Kupiansk in the northeast. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces in the south were \u201cgradually, in small steps, but very confidently, making advances. We could even use the allegory that we are carving up every metre of land from the enemy.\u201d Leaders and representatives from more than 60 countries are expected in London from Wednesday for a two-day conference to secure funding to help Ukraine recover from the ravages of war. The EU will provide Ukraine with $54.58bn in aid for 2024-27, the bloc\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the summit, while the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to unveil a major package, including $3bn of additional guarantees to unlock World Bank lending, according to his office. More from AFP: The International Ukraine Recovery Conference 2023, hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is the second to be held since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The first, in Lugano, Switzerland, in July last year saw Kyiv\u2019s allies commit to supporting Ukraine through what is expected to be an eye-wateringly expensive and decades-long recovery. Ukraine\u2018s Prime Minister Denys Shmygal told them rebuilding could cost at least $750 billion. The World Bank has since put an estimate of $14 billion on Ukraine\u2018s immediate needs for repairing the damage caused by the bitter fighting. But a recent study by the World Bank, the UN, the European Union and the Ukrainian government said the wider recovery of the economy would cost $441 billion. Whatever the final amount, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has likened it to the amount of money needed for the US-led Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Ukrainian forces in the south and east are \u201cactively destroying the enemy\u201d, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address, more than two weeks into Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. Ahead of a major conference in London at which the UK and EU are set to pledge billions of dollars in aid for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Zelenskiy also assured his international partners that \u201cUkraine uses every weapon and every shell as efficiently as possible and always to protect lives\u201d. He said Ukraine\u2019s recovery \u201cwill become not only construction projects, but also a global project of protection\u201d. \u201cA rebuilt Ukraine, a transformed Ukraine, a strengthened Ukraine is a carrier of security and a guarantor of security, it is protection against any form of Russian terror and protection against any repetition of Russian aggression,\u201d he said. In other developments: Ahead of the conference, a senior Ukraine official said the country would struggle to absorb the expected billions of western private and public sector aid for its recovery not due to corruption, but a simple lack of capacity to process and invest such huge sums. \u201cHistorically the largest amount of money we have been capable of working with was $6bn a year in 2014,\u201d said Mustafa Nayyem, the head of the Ukraine State Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development. Russia has threatened strikes on Kyiv\u2019s \u201cdecision-making centres\u201d if Ukraine uses western-supplied missiles against the occupied peninsula of Crimea. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said the potential use of US-supplied Himars and UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles against targets in Crimea would mark the west\u2019s \u201cfull involvement in the conflict and would entail immediate strikes upon decision-making centres in Ukrainian territory\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief has accused Russia of \u201cmining\u201d the cooling pond used to keep the reactors cool at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine\u2019s south. \u201cMost terrifying is that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was additionally mined during that time \u2026 namely the cooling pond was mined,\u201d Kyrylo Budanov, head of the GUR agency, said on television, without providing evidence. The Pentagon says that it overestimated the value of the weapons it has sent to Ukraine by $6.2bn over the past two years \u2013 about double early estimates \u2013 resulting in a surplus that will be used for future security packages. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said a detailed review of the accounting found an error of $3.6bn in the current fiscal year and $2.6bn in the 2022 fiscal year, which ended on 30 September. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called for an acceleration of Black Sea grain shipments from Ukrainian ports under a deal allowing safe wartime exports, a UN spokesperson said as Russia threatens to quit the pact which is due for renewal on 17 July. Guterres was disappointed by a slowing pace of ship inspections, spokesperson Farhan Haq said, and the exclusion of Pivdennyi (Yuzhny) port \u2013 one of three Ukrainian ports covered by the Black Sea export deal. Kyiv has repatriated three Ukrainian prisoners of war from Hungary where they were transferred from Russia without coordination with Kyiv, said Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko, who had previously accused Hunary of ignoring Kyiv\u2019s requests for access to the PoWs. Ukrainian diplomats and other relevant Ukrainian authorities were working to try to bring back the remaining prisoners of war, Nikolenko said. Prosecutors said they had served a notice of suspicion to Kyiv\u2019s head of municipal security after three people died in a Russian air attack when they were unable to get into a bomb shelter. The deaths on 1 June caused public outrage and prompted the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to vow a harsh response. The destruction of the vast Kakhovka hydroelectric dam has caused \u20ac1.2bn euros of damage, the Ukrainian environment minister Ruslan Strilets has told his EU counterparts. He also warned that mines unearthed by flooding could wash on to other European countries\u2019 shores and that \u201cthere are things that we can never restore. These are the ecosystems that were washed away into the Black Sea.\u201d The Ukrainian kickboxing champion Maksym Bordus has been killed fighting Russian forces, according to a website that lists athletes killed in the war. Bordus was killed on 11 June in \u201cfierce fighting against Russian invaders\u201d, according to Sport Angels, a Ukrainian website set up with the assistance of the Sports Committee, which brings together NGOs and federations from non-Olympic sports."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fbb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/21/royal-ascot-2023-day-two-prince-of-waless-stakes-royal-hunt-cup-and-more-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Royal Ascot 2023 day two: Frankie Dettori ends drought on Gregory in Queen\u2019s Vase \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "After Mostahdaf sprang a surprise to win the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, the Italian claimed his 78th winner at the meeting on a Gosden horse", "author": "Tony Paley and Greg Wood at Royal Ascot", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:52:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223611", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/436dcb30340a8d42b8cc40f09b3867b6cf11efcf/0_192_4560_2736/500.jpg", "body": "We had to wait till near the end of day two but it was definitely worth the wait for the first winner at this meeting from Frankie Dettori who is, and you may not have read this anywhere, riding at his final Royal Ascot. From the moment I first saw the Italian live \u2013 at an ordinary Saturday night fixture at Ripon races in the late 1980s when I was told to watch out for him and also that he already knew he was very good \u2013 he has been a highlight of the racing scene. It is no exaggeration to say that along with Lester Piggott, and John McCririck he has been one of the very few racing personalities to make the crossover and become well known outside the sport itself. Racing is going to miss him \u2013 his infectious enthusiasm and his genuine outstanding talent \u2013 when he quits the saddle at the end of the year. Matt Chapman, the ITV Racing presenter, told him after his victory today that trainer John Gosden had said after the race that \u201cGregory is going to be my Gold Cup horse and I want Frankie to be riding him.\u201d Dettori told Chapman not to joke about it. It\u2019s clear this mercurial character is going to miss race-riding as much as we are going to miss seeing him. 1 Big Evs 20-1 2 Johannes Brahms 10-3 f 3 Inquisitively 18-1 And they\u2019re off \u2026 Scoops Ahoy is fast out of the stalls \u2026 Bombay Bazaar is close up \u2026 Big Evs is going well \u2026 and nothing was ever going to catch him once he kicked clear.

He is currently vying for favouritism with Barnwell Boy, from the Charlie Johnston stable, who was similarly impressive after making the long trip south to Goodwood for his debut just under a month ago. Up-and-coming Newmarket trainer Alice Haynes, meanwhile, has two runners, both unbeaten in two starts, as she looks for her first Royal Ascot winner, and they are at opposite ends of the market, with Maximum Impact on offer at around 5-1 and his stable companion, Hala Emaraaty, at 80-1 to follow up wins at Ripon and Redcar.

He certainly looked like a three-year-old to follow when successful in the Cocked Hat Stakes at Goodwood, and while he has yet to race beyond a mile-and-a-half, his stamina for this extended 14 furlongs seems reasonably assured given that he is by a Derby and Arc winner in Golden Horn, out of a Galileo mare who won the Park Hill Stakes, the \u201cfillies\u2019 Leger\u201d, at Doncaster. This being Ascot, though, there are plenty of interesting alternatives if you are looking for a better price, including Circle Of Fire, who is owned by the King and seems sure to appreciate the step up to this trip after a troubled passage in the Lingfield Derby Trial last time out. Peking Opera, who took the Yeats Stakes earlier in the year, and Charlie Appleby\u2019s Chesspiece, a smooth handicap winner in a decent time at York\u2019s Dante meeting, are also worth a second look.

A few potentially key pieces of form to consider, though, include: the Victoria Cup over the last seven furlongs of the straight course in May, which featured Perotto, today\u2019s favourite, in seventh; the Hambleton Handicap at York\u2019s Dante meeting which Astro King, Blue For You, Point Lynas and Isla Kai were all runners, and also the Emerald Mile at the Curragh (video from 3m40sec) where Dunum put up the latest of several fine performances in big field to finish a close second. For me, this annual, confidence-sapping ritual came down to Dunum and Blue For You and I plumped for the former, who has been backed from 16-1 yesterday down to no bigger than 10-1 third-favourite at the time of writing - so be sure to have a bit on Blue For You before he duly romps home.

Three of them \u2013 Bay Bridge, Adayar and My Prospero \u2013 were separated by less than a length in the Champion Stakes over today\u2019s course and distance on Champions day last year, when Bay Bridge battled on bravely on good-to-soft ground to win by half a length with My Prospero finishing strongly after being caught a little flat-footed inside the final two. It is entirely plausible that My Prospero could improve past the pair of them today as William Haggas\u2019s runner has only seven runs behind him to date. Luxembourg, though, seems sure to start favourite, not least as Aidan O\u2019Brien and Ryan Moore were on a real roll on Tuesday, and last year\u2019s Irish Champion Stakes winner is also narrowly in front on the ratings. He also beat Bay Bridge in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh last month, showing versatility as he did so by winning from the front, and he too has scope for improvement this season with only nine starts to his name.

She has a win at the track to her name in last season\u2019s Valiant Stakes, although that was on the round course rather than today\u2019s straight mile, and looks the type to keep improving at four. The same, though, is very much true of John and Thady Gosden\u2019s Grande Dame, who is making her seasonal debut here after a progressive three-year-old campaign which culminated in a strong third-place finish in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes. Top-rated on Timeform\u2019s numbers, meanwhile, is the Group One-winning Prosperous Voyage, with Frankie Dettori holding the reins, and the firm\u2019s ratings also suggest that Potapova, available at around 20-1, could be in the mix on her best form, although her two runs so far this season have been disappointing.

O\u2019Brien, twice a Derby winner as a jockey, has been training since 2016 and only turned 30 \u2013 not that you\u2019d know it to look at him \u2013 last month, and has already won the Melbourne Cup twice, an Irish Derby and bagged two winners at the Breeders\u2019 Cup. His Royal Ascot record, however, is a little underwhelming, with just one winner \u2013 State Of Rest in last year\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes \u2013 from 51 starters. His two runners here \u2013 Yerwanthere and Adelaise - top the betting, however, at 9-2 and 11-2 respectively, and both have obvious claims after things did not go their way on their latest outings. Yerwanthere was short of room in a Listed race at Naas last month and makes her handicap debut off 93, while Adelaise, who has more big-field experience, responded well to the fitting of a hood to finish a close third of 20 at the Curragh, on her first start for eight months. Tarrabb, in a first-time tongue tie after a decent return to action at Chelmsford on 4 May, is another to consider, along with Ralph Beckett\u2019s Tamarama, the mount of Frankie Dettori, who was back to winning form in a well-run race at Kempton earlier this month.

Plenty of lively discussion on ITV Racing about whether Frankie Dettori should have got his nine-day ban yesterday for his ride on Saga. He has yet to decide whether he will appeal a nine-day ban which is due to run from 4-12 July, meaning he will be unable to ride likely favourite Emily Upjohn in the Coral-Eclipse at Sandown on 8 July. \u201cI\u2019ve got to consult my legal team and we\u2019ll decide whether I\u2019m going to appeal or not,\u201d Dettori told ITV\u2019s The Opening Show. \u201cI\u2019m glad that nobody got hurt. It\u2019s one of those things, the bend comes very quickly after the start and it can get very congested at that point in the race, but I haven\u2019t had chance to go through it properly yet. I\u2019ll talk to my lawyers today.\u201d A fiendish puzzle to start proceedings on day two, with 27 fillies \u2013 in the absence of Tiger Belle \u2013 sprinting down the straight five furlongs. Nine are unbeaten so far, 13 won on their most recent start and it is difficult to know where to start. The bookies make Beautiful Diamond, an impressive winner of her only start at Nottingham earlier this month, the favourite at around 7-2, and Karl Burke, her trainer, knows what it takes to land this race as he saddled Dramatised to win 12 months ago. But there are a whole host of rivals that would not need to find much improvement to figure, including Relief Rally, Born To Rock and Got To Love A Grey, all of whom are also currently unbeaten. They also all have double-figure draws, like nine of the last 10 winners of this race, and in the final reckoning, that stat draws me ever-so-slightly towards the US-trained challenger, Crimson Advocate, close to the near-side rail in 28. She showed the gate speed and early pace you would expect from an American-trained runner when successful in the Royal Palm at Gulfstream Park \u2013 a \u201cwin-and-you\u2019re-in\u201d for today\u2019s contest \u2013 when she covered the first quarter in 21.83sec, and was not stopping when she hit the wire.

The artists featured are Lara Robinson, Jessica Hills, Clementine St John Webster and Michelle McCullagh. Racegoers are arriving at the track for the second day of the meeting. Frankie Dettori had a shocker yesterday and will be desperate for a winner this week, at his final Royal Ascot in the saddle. He has decent chances including an obvious one in Gregory, who lines up in the Queen\u2019s Vase at 5.35pm. Highfield Princess, who ran an excellent race in defeat in the King\u2019s Stand yesterday, will be lining up again on Saturday in the QEII Jubilee Stakes. Chris Stickels, who got some stick yesterday (see tweet from pro-punter Eddie Fremantle below), has weighed in with the latest information. The going for day two is: Good on the straight course and Good, Good to Soft in places on the round course. GoingStick readings at 8am (the higher the stick reading the faster the ground): Stands side: 7.7 Centre: 7.5 Far side: 7.5 Round: 6.6 Good morning and welcome to Ascot racecourse, where day two of the 2023 royal meeting will get under way at 2.30pm with Frankie Dettori still looking for his first winner of the week and hoping that things don\u2019t go from bad to worse. Tuesday was set up to be Dettori\u2019s day, with several fancied rides and an obvious opportunity to get the meeting off to a flyer. He ended up with three second-place finishes, a late non-runner and, most embarrassingly, a nine-day ban for causing significant interference on Saga \u2013 the King\u2019s only runner on the day \u2013 which rules him out of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown next month. With the obvious exception of Saga, Dettori did not really do a great deal wrong on Tuesday, but his mounts were not quite good enough. When you are the most high-profile jockey of the last 30 years, however, and you announced back at Christmas that this season would be your last, a bad first day at the royal meeting can take on a life of its own. Dettori has four rides on today\u2019s card, three of which are likely to set off at single-figure odds. Tamarama is one of the favourites for the Kensington Palace Fillies\u2019 Handicap at 3.05pm, Prosperous Voyage is around 11-4 for the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes and Gregory is a very warm order for the Queen\u2019s Vase. His other ride, meanwhile, is Reach For The Moon in the Royal Hunt Cup, another runner in the King\u2019s colours and a bitter disappointment when odds-on for the Hampton Court Stakes here last year. But he does not have a mount in the feature event, the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, while Ryan Moore, who is one win behind him in the all-time list at the royal meeting after a treble on Tuesday, has a full book of seven rides, including Luxembourg, the favourite, in the big one. The all-important ground, meanwhile, is currently riding good on the straight course and good, good-to-soft in place on the round. It was a dry night and the forecast is for a possible shower or two during the afternoon, but nothing to be too concerned about. Some thoughts on the seven races on today\u2019s card are here, and the action is under way at 2.30pm with the Queen Mary Stakes \u2013 unless you include the royal procession at 2pm, of course. The Duke of Wellington, no less, popped up in the first carriage yesterday. Is there still a Lord Nelson somewhere who can be tracked down for day two?"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fbc", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/ioc-set-to-withdraw-recognition-of-international-boxing-association", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "IOC set to strip IBA of its recognition as the official boxing body for Olympics", "lead": "The body has failed to address finance and corruption concerns ahead of the sport being reinstated for 2028 Los Angeles Games", "author": "Sean Ingle", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:39:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223628", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ffd4e77b76c0d82264183ab505a547e1000871bc/0_183_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "The International Olympic Committee has never banned an international governing body from running a sport in its 129-year history. Yet that is expected to change on Thursday when an extraordinary session votes to withdraw the IOC\u2019s recognition of the International Boxing Association over its failure to address governance, finance and corruption concerns. The decision is regarded as a formality given that the IOC\u2019s executive board recommended that the IBA, which is run by the Russian Umar Kremlev, be kicked out two weeks ago. Yet while boxing is not yet on the programme for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, the Guardian understands that it will be reinstated and that the IOC is firmly behind the decision because of the sport\u2019s social value. Meanwhile any hopes that the IBA might be given a late reprieve were surely ended last week when Kremlev accused CK Wu, a former IOC member who led boxing between 2006 and 2017, of being \u201ca criminal who was killing boxing\u201d and said \u201che should be shot\u201d. The Russian also claimed the IOC president, Thomas Bach, and its sports director, Kit McConnell, had joined forces with Wu to help destroy boxing. On Tuesday the IOC condemned those comments as \u201cviolent and threatening\u201d and said that to attack individuals for doing their jobs was \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. The IOC initially withdrew recognition for the IBA \u2013 then called AIBA \u2013 in June 2019 because of concerns over judging and refereeing, financial stability and governance. It followed a range of allegations of rigged decisions at the Rio 2016 Olympics and financial mismanagement under Wu, who stepped down despite denying the allegations \u2013 stories that were both broken by the Guardian. Two years later the IOC did not involve it in running the boxing events at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics because of continuing concerns over judging and governance issues, which it believes have not gone away. In an IOC report published this month, the IBA was also criticised for trying to get experts it had appointed to oversee its processes, including Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers International, to sign binding non-disclosure agreements which would have made it impossible for any information to be shared. The IOC report also claimed there was a noticeable change in behaviour by the IBA following its congress in Abu Dhabi last December. \u201cWhat were obviously initially obvious excuses to be uncooperative became open intimidation towards the IOC if it continued with the organisation of the boxing tournament at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 without the IBA\u2019s support,\u201d the report said. However the IBA has claimed that any decision to exclude it is \u201ctruly abhorrent and purely political\u201d. On Wednesday it also published a letter to IOC members from the former world champion Roy Jones Jr, urging them to reconsider. \u201cDespite the criticism the IBA has faced, it is hard to believe that their visible progress has gone completely unnoticed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis attempt to demean boxing appears to be a poorly orchestrated political game with no ultimate winner.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fbd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/windrush-generation-hundreds-sent-back-to-caribbean-from-uk-hospitals", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Windrush generation: hundreds \u2018sent back to Caribbean from UK hospitals\u2019", "lead": "Archives show about 400 long-term sick and mentally ill people were repatriated, according to BBC investigation", "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:34:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223646", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/119977c9b8fb2bfe11e2f7eb4f41d7986670b7a0/0_126_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Hundreds of long-term sick and mentally ill people from the Windrush generation were repatriated to the Caribbean from UK hospitals, sometimes without giving informed consent, according to a BBC investigation. Analysis of formerly classified National Archives documents found that about 400 people were sent back to their countries of birth between the 1950s and the 1970s under a scheme that was supposed to be voluntary but that may not have involved a proper consent process. The children of those who were repatriated say their families were ripped apart and some were never reunited with their relatives. They have called for an inquiry in response to the BBC\u2019s revelations. The investigation\u2019s findings echo the injustices of the Windrush scandal in which thousands of people were misclassified as being in the UK illegally, some of whom were wrongly deported. Most of those affected were repatriated by the National Assistance Board, the forerunner to the Department for Work and Pensions, which was then responsible for the UK\u2019s welfare system. The board agreed with the Colonial Office in 1949 to pay for the repatriation of \u201ccoloured British colonials who through ill health, or inability to adapt themselves to conditions in this country, were unable to support themselves\u201d. Under the scheme, the patient should \u201chave expressed a wish to return\u201d. It also should only have been carried out if it would \u201cbenefit\u201d them and if there were \u201csuitable arrangements \u2026 in their country of origin\u201d. But the BBC uncovered documents suggesting the decision to repatriate was sometimes motivated by a desire to reduce pressure on hospital beds. A letter from the office of the high commissioner of Jamaica in 1963 to the Commonwealth Relations Office says it received \u201ca number of requests from hospital authorities for the repatriation of chronically ill patients largely on the grounds of pressure on beds or other hospital services\u201d. The letter noted that the requests gave the impression that the \u201cinstitutions concerned regard mental disorder and in some cases chronic illness as grounds for repatriation of Commonwealth citizens regardless of whether adequate treatment and care are available\u201d. A UK government spokesperson said the law had changed since the time of these cases. \u201cNow an independent tribunal has to agree that any repatriation would be in the best interests of the patient. We recognise the campaigning of families seeking to address the historic injustice faced by their loved ones, and remain absolutely committed to righting the wrongs faced by those in the Windrush generation.\u201d Joseph Armatrading was one of those sent back. He arrived in the UK from the British colony of St Kitts, travelling on a British passport, in 1954 and lived in Nottingham with his wife and five daughters. He was diagnosed with paranoid psychosis in the 1960s, and in 1966 he was returned to St Kitts. He never saw his family again. His daughter June, now 65, told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting \u2026 This was a vulnerable man. You\u2019re supposed to look after your vulnerable people, and they didn\u2019t.\u201d The BBC investigation uncovered a letter written by a government official admitting that the procedure of repatriating Armatrading had \u201cnot been correct\u201d."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fbe", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/cameron-norrie-jordan-thompson-queens-club-tennis", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cameron Norrie fights back to beat grass-court specialist Jordan Thompson", "lead": "Cameron Norrie recovered to win to 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in round of 16 against Jordan Thompson and said \u2018it was a perfect match to start the grass summer\u2019", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Queen's Club", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:34:27", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223664", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf87b1b01503ff56519447f06afc4dd1ec10ded/0_384_5845_3509/500.jpg", "body": "Cameron Norrie continued his solid start to the grass-court season as he navigated the challenges presented by one of the trickier players on the surface and advanced to the Queen\u2019s Club quarter-finals for the second time. After trailing by a set, Norrie soared, recovering to defeat Jordan Thompson 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. \u201cIt was the perfect match,\u201d he said. \u201cJordan really likes the grass. He played a couple of good points to break me and I played a couple of loose points and that was the difference in the first set. I thought I played great so I didn\u2019t really have to change too much.\u201d In recent years Thompson has established a reputation for his grass-court prowess. The 29-year-old has reached two ATP finals, both on grass, the second in last week\u2019s-Hertogenbosch when he lost against the home favourite, Tallon Griekspoor, in three tight sets. Unlike most players on the tour outside Great Britain, Thompson spent plenty of time in his youth competing on grass and he has developed a suitable all-court game, with a sweet backhand slice and a precise serve, which comes alive on the surface. The Australian was sharp from the beginning. As is often the case on this surface, the opening set was decided by a couple of points. Thompson served immaculately, firing 10 aces in his first five service games and the difference between the two players was one loose service game from Norrie. In the second set Norrie worked his way into the ascendancy. The fifth seed began to read Thompson\u2019s serve much more effectively, landing ample returns while taking care of his own service games. Norrie\u2019s flat backhand, which skids so low on the grass, also proved a nightmare for Thompson as the match extended. After levelling the match, Norrie broke serve in the opening game of the third set and marched to victory. \u201cI was able to come out with a lot more energy in the third set and that was the difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much in it. It was definitely a good match to get through and a perfect match, heading into Wimbledon, to start the grass summer.\u201d Norrie\u2019s quarter-final opponent will be Sebastian Korda, who defeated Frances Tiafoe, the fourth seed, 7-6 (2), 6-3 on Wednesday evening. Norrie said: \u201cIt\u2019s really good to be that consistent but you always want more. It\u2019s really addicting, you want to have better results. It\u2019s been really consistent, which is good, but I want to keep on pushing for more and keep playing my best tennis in the bigger tournaments and especially in a huge tournament like Queen\u2019s.\u201d Norrie had teamed up with Andy Murray in doubles but, after his first-round defeat against Alex de Minaur in the singles on Tuesday, the Scot opted to withdraw from the first-round match against Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram because of fatigue. Lorenzo Musetti became the first player to reach the quarter\u2011finals by defeating Ben Shelton 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a battle between two of the brightest young talents on the tour. At a time when many young players struggle to find their feet on grass, Musetti continues to offer evidence he could one day be a threat on the surface. This is his second consecutive quarter-final on grass after narrowly losing against the eventual champion, Tiafoe, in Stuttgart. While Musetti is most at home on clay, his backhand slice, his skill in the forecourt and his resourcefulness suit the surface well. He also continues to move confidently on the grass. The 21-year-old will next face the 20\u2011year\u2011old Holger Rune, the second seed, who defeated Great Britain\u2019s Ryan Peniston 6-3, 6-4. Elsewhere, Elena Rybakina endured an early defeat at the WTA 500 event in Berlin, her first grass\u2011court tournament since winning Wimbledon last year. Despite a positive start, the Kazakhstani was defeated 6-7 (1), 6-3, 6-4 by Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fbf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/the-guardian-view-on-mortgages-the-crunch-is-coming", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on mortgages: the crunch is coming | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial: </strong>Westminster is forever blowing property bubbles.

Two soaring bills and one Tory MP with two diametrically opposed answers: what could possibly account for the difference? In fairness to Mr Berry, he is hardly the only Conservative alarmed at rocketing mortgage rates, and one doesn\u2019t need Sherlock Holmes to divine why. The politicians most inclined to cite budgetary calculations as the reason for denying hungry children free meals in school holidays are doing hard electoral maths on what it means when 2.4 million households roll off their fixed-rate mortgages just in time for a general election. For at least a century, Conservatives have seen home ownership as their way into the electorate\u2019s collective heart. In the 1920s, Noel Skelton coined the term \u201cproperty-owning democracy\u201d. Six decades later, Margaret Thatcher called for \u201cpopular capitalism\u201d. Then came George Osborne\u2019s help-to-buy scheme, which quite possibly won the Tories the 2015 election. In 2020, Mr Osborne\u2019s protege Rishi Sunak declared a stamp duty holiday. The voters who went into the housing market or up the property ladder under these schemes will be the ones most under pressure now. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, those most at risk are in their 30s and live in London and the south-east. They have the biggest home loans coming up for renewal. For many of these households, a political giveaway to secure a couple of extra points in the polls will become a financial takeaway causing huge personal stress. Conservative aides may curse the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, as the man who could lose them the next election, but a better culprit is now sitting inside No 10. One person\u2019s mortgage is another\u2019s rent, and there are plenty of reports of tenants seeing their monthly outgoings rise as their landlords struggle with higher bills. That is one reason why it would be unfair for the government to introduce another version of mortgage relief, as Mr Berry is suggesting \u2013 because it would be taxing renters to subsidise landlords. Owning an asset should not be a precondition for getting public money. Despite its longstanding promises, this government is yet to ban no-fault evictions, and its proposed upgrade of tenants\u2019 rights leaves a lot to be desired. As the impact of higher rates is felt in the property market (the Office for Budget Responsibility projects a 10% fall in house prices), the government should work up a package of measures that mitigates the likely turbulence, and that protects private tenants as well as others. For now, however, the best course is to demand that lenders show mortgage holders maximum forbearance, allowing them to change the term, or pay only the interest, on their loans for a while. These are among proposals made this week by Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, stealing a march on her opposite number, Jeremy Hunt, who meets the mortgage industry on Friday. The mortgage market is far more regulated than it was in the early 1990s. Let us hope that it is regulated enough. We shall soon find out. But one lesson from this latest crisis is surely clear: running a country\u2019s economics and politics on the basis of keeping a property bubble inflated is a guaranteed recipe for disaster."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-brexit-slowly-getting-it-right", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Guardian view on Labour and Brexit: slowly getting it right | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The opposition is playing catch-up with public opinion in recognising that Britain needs reintegration with Europe", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:25:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223703", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b15d523ddee9c46e0face6f9647f421c8b95466b/225_214_2837_1702/500.jpg", "body": "When David Cameron was leader of the opposition and well-placed to become prime minister, he urged his colleagues not to rock the boat by \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe. But on they banged, eventually driving Britain out of the European Union. Now it is Sir Keir Starmer who frets about European zeal unbalancing his stride towards power, although this time the demand is reconciliation with Brussels. The opposition leader\u2019s electoral route to Downing Street passes through pockets of pro-Brexit opinion and he doesn\u2019t want to upset swing voters with an appearance of contempt for their judgment. The two situations are not equivalent. Tory Eurosceptic ultras waged a mythological crusade against an imaginary oppressor. Labour\u2019s pro-Europeans have evidence that Brexit isn\u2019t working. It might not be possible to separate out the exact portion of a cost of living crisis that is caused by the UK\u2019s self-imposed exile from the EU single market, but it is beyond doubt that raising barriers to trade and impeding labour flows have increased costs, gunged up supply chains and stoked inflation. Business investment has been flat since the referendum \u2013 a reflection of general uncertainty and mistrust in a capricious and incompetent British government. Those facts are percolating through the national conversation. Opinion polls show consistent majorities for the view that Brexit has been bad for Britain. Even more slowly, the opposition is noticing the change. In a speech to a trade conference earlier this week, David Lammy made an emphatic commitment to European rapprochement. \u201cThe EU are our biggest trading partners and our allies as we face war on our continent,\u201d the shadow foreign secretary said. \u201cIf you do not think Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe is of fundamental importance to our future, you are living in a fantasy.\u201d On the substance of what a closer relationship might look like, Mr Lammy is less bold. Labour is committed to a programme of entirely sensible tinkering at the edges of the problem \u2013 alignment with EU regulations as a precondition for lowering trade barriers; more liberal visa policies; renewed partnership with cultural and scientific institutions that make up the wider constellation of the European project. That is an agenda for reintegration at the periphery of Europe, which is sound diplomacy and helpful at the economic margins, but cannot substantially shift the dial as long as Britain is still outside the single market and customs union. On that front, Labour is wedded to a hard Brexit, not least because anything softer reopens questions of sovereignty and immigration that Sir Keir would rather keep closed in the run-up to a general election. There may be a growing audience for Brexit-bashing, but it is concentrated in seats that already vote Labour, and even many pro-Europeans balk at the prospect of stirring up bitter divisions. An epic U-turn on Britain\u2019s policy towards Europe would not be a simple or quick manoeuvre, and could not anyway be arranged from opposition. The path of what is politically available is tending towards economic rationality, but not as fast as some pro-Europeans would like. Labour\u2019s caution might be frustrating, but the direction of travel is the right one."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/west-ham-on-verge-of-appointing-tim-steidten-as-new-technical-director", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "West Ham on verge of appointing Tim Steidten as new technical director", "lead": "The German, who made a positive impression during several rounds of talks, has been told his main focus this summer will be replacing Declan Rice", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:21:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223721", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9271d7ec6b75618be00339dbb2384d862f2b2c4e/0_36_2240_1345/500.jpg", "body": "West Ham are to push ahead with the appointment of Tim Steidten as their new technical director. The German emerged as the leading candidate last week only for doubts to emerge over whether his arrival would be finalised. Insiders had insisted it had a 50% chance of going through last Friday. However it is understood that the deal is on the verge of being agreed, handing West Ham a boost as they gear up for a busy summer in the transfer window. Steidten, who left Bayer Leverkusen in March, has made a positive impression during several rounds of talks and has met West Ham\u2019s manager, David Moyes, on at least two occasions. West Ham have been looking to add to their recruitment team after growing dissatisfied with their signings last summer and the appointment of a senior figure will raise doubts over the future of the club\u2019s current head of recruitment, Rob Newman. Paul Mitchell, Lee Dykes, Lee Congerton, Tiago Pinto and Michael Edwards had also been considered for the role by West Ham, but the job is set to go to Steidten. The 44-year-old German held talks with Chelsea last September. Steidten\u2019s arrival will not affect Mark Noble\u2019s role as sporting director. Noble, who called time on his playing career last year, began his new job in January and is still gaining experience. He has not objected to the restructuring and it is felt that West Ham need more resources in their recruitment team. West Ham have made it clear to Steidten that his main focus this summer will be replacing Declan Rice. Arsenal have had two bids rejected for the midfielder and are preparing a third offer. West Ham want at least \u00a3100m for Rice. They have targeted Fulham\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Palhinha, Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse, Manchester United\u2019s Scott McTominay and Bristol City\u2019s Alex Scott, who is also wanted by Wolves. Sources have said the appointment of Steidten will come with the blessing of Moyes, who is staying as manager after leading West Ham to victory in the Europa Conference League final. Moyes, who has a year left on his contract, normally likes to have a significant say in recruitment. Meanwhile, Uefa has announced that West Ham fans will be banned from their next away match in European competition, with a further match suspended for two years. The punishment comes after West Ham fans threw missiles on to the pitch during their Europa Conference League final win over Fiorentina in Prague.

The latest blockbuster report on the tangled subject of supreme court ethics came, again, from ProPublica. The non-profit newsroom has already detailed the close relationship between another hardline justice, Clarence Thomas, and the conservative billionaire Harlan Crow. Supreme court justices are subject to the same ethics rules as other federal judges but effectively govern themselves. The chief justice, John Roberts, has resisted calls to testify in Congress about the Thomas-Crow affair. On Wednesday, Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee, and his fellow Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse said that when Congress returns from the 4 July recess, their committee will \u201cmark up supreme court ethics legislation\u201d. The senators said: \u201cWe hope that before that time, Chief Justice Roberts will take the lead and bring supreme court ethics in line with all other federal judges. \u201cBut if the court won\u2019t act, then Congress must.\u201d On Tuesday, Alito published a controversial \u201cprebuttal\u201d to the new ProPublica report, using a Wall Street Journal column to say the piece was coming and to deny wrongdoing. Alito said justices \u201ccommonly interpreted\u201d ethics laws \u201cto mean that accommodations and transportation for social events were not reportable gifts\u201d. The seat on Singer\u2019s plane, the justice wrote, \u201cwould have otherwise been vacant\u201d. Virginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer now with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said a private plane trip was not an acceptable gift. \u201cThe exception only covers food, lodging and entertainment,\u201d Canter told ProPublica. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to move away from the plain language of the statute and the regulation.\u201d Alito said the fishing lodge in Alaska was \u201ccomfortable but rustic\u201d, serving \u201chomestyle fare\u201d. ProPublica said \u201cchefs served multi-course meals of Alaskan king crab legs or Kobe filet [steak]. On the last evening, a member of Alito\u2019s group bragged that the wine they were drinking cost $1,000 a bottle,\u201d according to a fishing guide. Alito said: \u201cI cannot recall whether the group at the lodge \u2026 was served wine, but if there was wine it was certainly not wine that costs $1,000.\u201d ProPublica detailed how Singer took Alito to Alaska in summer 2008, while engaged in a high-stakes case between his hedge fund and the government of Argentina. The case eventually reached the supreme court, Alito joining a 7-1 decision against Argentina. Singer denied wrongdoing or discussing business with Alito. Alito said he had never been aware of connections between Singer\u2019s businesses and cases before him. Abbe Smith, a Georgetown law professor, told ProPublica Alito should have recused himself because of the gift from Singer. If she were representing a client in such a case and \u201cfound out [about the gift] after the fact\u201d, Smith said, \u201cI\u2019d be outraged on behalf of my client. And, frankly, I\u2019d be outraged on behalf of the legal system.\u201d The rightwing activist Leonard Leo, who has done much to shape conservative dominance of federal courts including the supreme court, and who recently received $1.6bn to further his work, accompanied Alito and Singer to Alaska. Leo told ProPublica: \u201cNo objective and well-informed observer of the judiciary honestly could believe that they decide cases in order to cull favour with friends, or in return for a free plane seat or fishing trip.\u201d Kyle Herrig, president of the watchdog Accountable.US, said: \u201cAs the supreme court corruption crisis grows with yet another apparent violation of the court\u2019s bare minimum ethics code, it\u2019s no surprise that Leonard Leo is right in the middle. He\u2019s the corrupting influence responsible for the rot. \u201cAs long as Chief Justice Roberts continues to dodge responsibility \u2026 public trust in our court will continue to plummet. We need reform now.\u201d Whitehouse, who has sought to highlight donors\u2019 influence on the court, responded to Alito\u2019s Wall Street Journal column with incredulity \u2013 and questions. \u201cFirst,\u201d the senator wrote, \u201cwho orchestrated this weird prebuttal \u2026 and did Alito get help from a PR firm? If so, who paid? \u201cSecond, why dwell on the term \u2018facility\u2019 [as Alito called Singer\u2019s plane] but not mention that the \u2018personal hospitality\u2019 reporting exemption is specifically limited to \u2018food, lodging and entertainment\u2019? Failing to mention that other part of the rule wouldn\u2019t fly in most courts. \u201cThird, why not ask the financial disclosure committee of the Judicial Conference, the body set up exactly for that purpose, for its advice on what should be disclosed? That\u2019s why it\u2019s there. \u201cAnd what, he just happened to be flying to Alaska and there just happened to be a private jet going to Alaska with an empty seat, and he just happened to find that out, like on some weird billionaire shared-ride Uber? \u201cOh, and would that \u2018empty seat\u2019 trick fly with legislative or executive ethics disclosures? (Hint: no.) And how about with the financial disclosure committee? (Right, you didn\u2019t ask.) \u201cThis just keeps getting worse.\u201d ProPublica also reported an earlier Alaska trip taken by another rightwing justice, Antonin Scalia, with Robin Arkley II, the businessman who then owned the fishing lodge and who ProPublica said \u201cdoes not appear to have been involved in any cases before the court\u201d. On a visit to the Hubbard Glacier, on a boat called the Happy Hooker IV, Scalia, who died in 2016, reportedly \u201cmixed martinis from Grey Goose vodka and glacier ice\u201d."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/david-cameron-was-warned-2013-uk-risk-assessment-too-secret", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK could have avoided lockdown if better prepared, says Jeremy Hunt", "lead": "Chancellor and former health secretary tells Covid inquiry Britain was too slow to test and isolate", "author": "Peter Walker and Robert Booth", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:19:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223756", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d4f7998bdadee0bee62733da189d8db60f2ec4/0_143_2833_1700/500.jpg", "body": "The UK could have avoided a Covid lockdown if it had prepared better for a pandemic, Jeremy Hunt has argued, saying there was too much focus on a fast-spreading flu-type illness and an assumption that Britain \u201cknew this stuff best\u201d. Hunt, who was health secretary from 2012 to 2018, told the Covid public inquiry that he took some responsibility for what he called the \u201cdeeply entrenched\u201d planning assumption that it would be impossible to stop the spread of a pandemic. So embedded was this idea, he said, that a 2016 pandemic exercise called Exercise Cygnus started from the base point of at least 200,000 deaths, with Hunt being asked by officials whether he would be hypothetically willing to empty every intensive care bed in the UK so nursing staff could save more lives in the community. \u201cThere were no questions asked at any stage as to how do we stop it getting to the stage of 200,000 to 400,000 fatalities,\u201d Hunt, now the chancellor, told the hearing. \u201cIt was an assumption that if there was pandemic flu it would spread, using layperson\u2019s terms, like wildfire. And you pretty much couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d He added: \u201cI think there was a group-think that we knew this stuff best. There was a sense that, perhaps with the exception of the United States, there wasn\u2019t an enormous amount we could learn from other countries.\u201d Hunt said the UK could have looked to countries such as South Korea, which had prepared better for the possible arrival of a non-flu respiratory virus \u2013 one that spread more slowly and with a longer, asymptomatic incubation period. He said that \u201cliterally the only place\u201d where quarantine and testing were discussed was Exercise Alice, a much smaller-scale modelling for a non-flu pandemic in 2016, which he was not even briefed about. The result of such inbuilt assumptions, Hunt told the inquiry, was that by the time a regime of testing and isolation was considered for Covid, the transmission rate was too high. \u201cAnd then it was inevitable that you were going to have to use a lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cHad we got on the case much earlier with that approach, we might have avoided that.\u201d Describing the assumptions of Exercise Cygnus, Hunt said that at one point he was asked to \u201csanction the emptying of all the intensive care beds in the country \u2026 on the grounds that the nursing requirement for those people in intensive care was so big, those nurses could save more lives if they operated in the community. \u201cEffectively, I was being asked to flick a switch, which would have led to instant deaths and I wasn\u2019t prepared to do that,\u201d he added. Hunt said: \u201cI think that the truth is, we were very well prepared for pandemic flu, because we\u2019d been giving a lot of thinking to it. But we hadn\u2019t given nearly enough thought to other types of pandemic that might emerge. With the benefit of hindsight, that was a wholly mistaken assumption.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister \u2013 who was a Cabinet Office minister with a brief to deal with possible emergencies before Covid \u2013 said preparations for a no-deal Brexit meant a pandemic-related group had not met for a year. The pandemic flu readiness board, run jointly by officials from the Cabinet Office and the health department, did not meet from November 2018 to November or December 2020 amid a \u201creprioritisation\u201d, as the government focused on Operation Yellowhammer, the contingency plan for the potential impact of a no-deal departure, Dowden said. \u201cBecause of Yellowhammer, and I think that was the right thing to do, we were prioritising resources to make sure that we were equipped for a no-deal scenario,\u201d he said. Dowden said that the preparations over Yellowhammer obliged departments to work together better and \u201cmade us match fit for when we did have to deal with the actual materialisation of that Covid pandemic\u201d. At the start of the day\u2019s hearing, Sir Mark Walport, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser until 2017, said he had warned David Cameron\u2019s government in 2013 that the UK\u2019s assessment of risks, including from pandemics, was being kept too secret. Walport raised the concern with Cameron in a letter, and told the inquiry that the national risk assessment (NRA) \u201cwas locked in departmental safes most of the time and I felt that that wasn\u2019t the most effective way. \u201cThe whole point of [a] risk assessment is that you will be able to use it, to see if you can stop something happening in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is going to happen \u2013 to mitigate your numbers, reduce its effects.\u201d The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/man-arrested-after-reports-of-stabbing-at-london-central-middlesex-hospital", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Man arrested after stabbings and pickaxe attack at London hospital, say police", "lead": "Two people stabbed thought to be maintenance staff at Central Middlesex hospital, and one has life-threatening injuries, Met says", "author": "Jamie Grierson, Denis Campbell and Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:18:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223774", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b5b35ddf5e1a59619ed75f302cfa9a0b239ac873/419_756_7819_4692/500.jpg", "body": "A man has been arrested after two people were stabbed following a pickaxe attack at a London hospital, and one of the victims is in a life-threatening condition, police have said.

If you\u2019re ever on the M4 in south Wales between Porthcawl and Port Talbot, look over the grassy dunes towards the sea and know that my balls are in there somewhere. I was playing with a friend, a retired butcher from Neath, and a couple of his mates. One of these old boys had been something to do with education; I think he had spent his working life with the local education authority. Nice chap. On our way round we discussed matters various \u2013 his career, the weather, where the hell my ball was and so on. At the conclusion of one of our chats, he said he would give me his card. At first I thought he meant his golfing scorecard but it eventually became clear that he was talking about some kind of business card. In the changing rooms afterwards, said card was handed over. I stuck it straight in my pocket, apologising that as I don\u2019t carry such cards, I couldn\u2019t return the compliment. He looked decidedly disappointed. We had a beer and that was that; we went our separate ways. It was weeks or months later when I found the card in my golf trousers. It was only then that I realised why he had looked a bit crestfallen. It wasn\u2019t because I hadn\u2019t had a card to give him, rather that I hadn\u2019t read his. The card had been through the wash but was still legible. I can\u2019t remember his name but I do remember the three letters after it: MBE. I may be doing him a grave disservice, but it did seem as if he just wanted me to know he had been awarded an MBE. My first reaction was an amused, patronising chuckle. I\u2019m ashamed of that now. Why wouldn\u2019t he be proud? Why wouldn\u2019t it mean something to him, and anyone who knew of it? Why wouldn\u2019t he want the world to know? I think of him every time the anomalies and outrages accompanying an honours announcement devalue the system a little more. Yes, the reference to empire sits somewhere between daft and offensive. And recognising the undoubted achievements of well-known people isn\u2019t of the highest importance \u2013 their work is, by definition, already recognised. But there should always be a place to officially mark the efforts of the largely unsung and under-celebrated. Still, the whole honours system is an aspect of British life that is in need of change \u2013 like potholes, public transport and the sporting of sandals with socks. All normalised. Amid the fire and fury over appointments and non-appointments to the Lords, it struck me that the maddest thing is not what the appointments committee does look at \u2013 it\u2019s what it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s incredible, when you think about it, that its job is merely to check you\u2019re not too dodgy to be allowed in. It doesn\u2019t seem to occur to anybody that it might make sense to look at it the other way round: are the candidates intelligent and dedicated enough to be entrusted with the scrutiny of legislation? Have they got the brains? Could they at least distinguish between their backsides and their elbows? A straight IQ assessment might be a start, along with something akin to the British citizenship test, but obviously a more advanced version, checking that applicants have at least a rudimentary knowledge of how the legislature works and can make head or tail of the language of our laws. Not that I\u2019m remotely under consideration, but I couldn\u2019t possibly accept anything anyway. There are people who deserve recognition for their work much more than I do, and there are certainly plenty of candidates for the Lords with better brains than mine.

The missiles are designed to carry out nuclear strikes on targets thousands of miles away but their deployment has proceeded slower than planned. Ukraine has announced the liberation of only eight villages as a result of its two weeks of offensive operations with heavy mining and Russian air superiority proving to be a major obstacle to progress. Ukrainian forces are also having to face down Russian assaults around Kreminna, in the eastern Luhansk region, and in the Serebryansky forest, north of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. The attacks directed by Moscow, at a time when Ukraine is seeking to make progress further south, has forced Ukrainian generals to move their own troops to fill the gaps, according to military sources. Ukrainian forces are still yet to commit all their reserves to battle, however. Ukraine\u2019s military command created 12 brigades for the counteroffensive, of which nine have been equipped by western powers, but it is believed that only three have been moved to the front. Speaking to the BBC, Ukraine\u2019s president said he would not command his army to make ground purely to sate western demand for progress on the front. Zelenskiy, who was speaking to mark a Ukraine Recovery conference in London, said: \u201cSome people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It\u2019s not. What\u2019s at stake is people\u2019s lives. Whatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best.\u201d Hanna Maliar, a Ukrainian deputy defence minister, said Ukraine was fighting off a \u201clarge-scale offensive of Russian troops in the Lyman and Bakhmut directions\u201d, in the eastern Donetsk region. She added: \u201cNear Bakhmut, the situation is unchanged, several combat clashes take place every day, the line is stable. In general, in the east, our troops are firmly holding their positions, repelling constant enemy attacks and inflicting maximum losses on the occupier.\u201d Putin had also conceded in his comments on Wednesday that Ukraine \u201chas not yet been exhausted, there are also reserves that the enemy is thinking about where and how to introduce\u201d. The Wagner group chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose forces for months led an assault for towns in eastern Ukraine including Bakhmut, repeated his accusations that the Russian defence ministry was losing territory to Ukrainian troops. \u201cThey are misleading the Russian people,\u201d he said in an audio message released by his spokespeople. \u201cHuge chunks have been handed over to the enemy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAll of this is being totally hidden from everyone.\u201d In Russia, authorities claimed that two Ukrainian drones crashed 30 miles outside Moscow as they were approaching the warehouses of a local military unit. Russian media reported on Wednesday that the wreckage of a third drone was found further away from the Russian capital. The defence ministry in Moscow claimed the drones were brought down using radio-electronic means and that no damage or casualties had been reported. \u201cAn attempt today by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack by three aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles on facilities in the Moscow region was thwarted,\u201d the ministry said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/experts-say-rescuing-titan-submersible-a-very-difficult-task", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Experts say rescuing Titan submersible \u2018a very difficult task\u2019", "lead": "Retrieving the vessel and crew from the Atlantic would likely be a slow and complicated process", "author": "Karen McVeigh", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:02:35", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223829", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f27606cbc8a7c4d4ef427c84f537efd02209b351/0_210_3333_2000/500.jpg", "body": "Recovering the missing Titan submersible and bringing its crew to safety in time using the latest advanced deep-sea rescue equipment would be an extremely difficult task, an expert has said. Even if Titan is located, a successful rescue would require remote-controlled vehicles (ROVs) capable of allowing operators on the surface a clear view of the submersible\u2019s location, any obstacles that may be present and where to attach cables capable of lifting it thousands of metres through the water. If the Titan and its five-person crew did arrive at the Titanic wreck, they will be located 3,800 metres (12,500ft) below the surface on the seabed \u2013 too deep for most ROVs to reach. Only a \u201ctiny percentage of the world\u2019s submarines operate that deeply\u201d, David Marquet, a former US Navy submarine commander, told CBC. The US Navy has such ROVs, as does a French research vessel named the Atalante. Both have sent equipment to the site where the submersible is thought to be. Another company, the Guernsey-based Magellan, which specialises in deep sea rescue, said it had been approached by OceanGate, creator of the Titan, to mobilise \u201cby all means necessary\u201d. But it needs aircraft to transport its deep-sea diving equipment, and its chairman, David Thompson, told CNN he had not heard back from the US or UK air forces after asking for planes. If indeed the Titan is found intact, rescuing it will be a race against time. The US Navy\u2019s deep sea salvage system, Fadoss, has previously been deployed alongside a remotely operated vehicle called Curv-21 (cable-controlled undersea recovery vehicle). This 2.4-metre (8ft) craft, about the size of a large refrigerator, can operate as far down as 6km (20,000ft). \u201cThe key gamechanger is the Curv-21,\u201d said R Adm Dr Chris Parry, a former Royal Navy warfare officer. \u201cIt\u2019s got a track record and it is coupled to this fabulous salvage system the Americans have.\u201d That salvage system, Fadoss, is a lift system that the US Navy says is designed to provide \u201creliable deep ocean lifting capacity of up to 60,000lbs (27,200kg) for the recovery of large, bulky, and heavy sunken objects such as aircraft or small vessels\u201d. The missing Titan submersible fits this description, weighing 10,432kg (23,000lbs). In 2021, the Fadoss system was successfully used to pull up a wreck of a MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter from the seabed in Okinawa, Japan, at a record depth of 19,075ft. \u201cBut remember \u2013 it didn\u2019t have people in it,\u201d Parry noted of the rescued helicopter. \u201cIt also took several days.\u201d Any operation to recover the Titan would be more complicated because of the passengers, \u201cif they are still alive and they can get to them in time\u201d. For those inside Titan, the remaining air is dwindling \u2013 about 20 hours as of midday on the US east coast, according to estimates. Even if the site of the missing sub is found, and the salvage system ROVs are deployed \u2013 which will take time \u2013 they would need at least an additional two hours to descend to the seabed. \u201cThey will have to get a cable down, and then it will be a race to get it belted on,\u201d said Parry. \u201cThey will probably have to wrap it around the Titan as they have nothing to bolt it on to.\u201d Doing so would be very difficult. ROV pilots at the surface would rely on images sent back from the vehicles, in order to control grinders, grabs and other equipment on the ROV. Currents and water pressure make matters even more unpredictable. \u201cWhen you are operating at these depths, everything has to go right,\u201d Parry said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc8", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/cricket-brendon-mccullum-defends-tactics-and-blames-england-defeat-on-bad-luck", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Brendon McCullum defends tactics and blames England defeat on bad luck", "lead": "Brendon McCullum, the head coach, defended England\u2019s approach and said they could have won the first Ashes Test with \u2018the rub of the green\u2019", "author": "Simon Burnton", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 17:00:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223847", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/796b66e045ec6516ab9e5ecab1344b99dc587d0a/0_300_4499_2700/500.jpg", "body": "Brendon McCullum has insisted that England\u2019s thrilling, narrow defeat against Australia in the first Ashes Test has not tarnished his team\u2019s freewheeling approach to the game. McCulllum said that despite sustaining the third defeat of his 14 matches as red-ball coach he had \u201chad an absolutely amazing time\u201d, and that it was only a bit of bad luck in key moments that denied them victory. England\u2019s head coach contends that the fact \u201ceveryone left entertained\u201d means that, despite narrow defeat on the field, his approach once again proved a success. Sky\u2019s viewing figures certainly suggest the game caught people\u2019s attention, with its peak audience hitting 2.12 million, the highest it has recorded for a Test match, and an average audience across the fifth day of 1.17 million. \u201cObviously you\u2019d rather have won the game,\u201d McCullum said, \u201cbut the way that we played, I think it\u2019s validated our style of play. If we\u2019d have got a little bit of the rub of the green then we might have been on the other side of it. I\u2019m really proud of the boys to be honest. \u201cI thought their application to how we want to play right throughout was superb. A couple of things didn\u2019t quite go our way at times, that\u2019s the nature of the game, but we firmly believe, the skipper [Ben Stokes] and I, that this gives us our greatest chance. \u201cI would be very surprised if there was too many people who disagree with how we go about playing, because everyone was left entertained. You\u2019re not always going to win and we understand that. We want to keep getting up and throwing punches as a team, and I\u2019m really proud of the way the guys played.\u201d Though Stokes said in the moments after the game ended that his players were \u201cin absolute pieces\u201d and \u201cdevastated that we\u2019ve lost\u201d, McCullum was in more chipper mood. \u201cI had an absolutely amazing time,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was an amazing match with two very different styles of play, but like a heavyweight boxing match not everyone has to fight the same. I\u2019m sure everyone that watched all around the world and everyone who was here at Edgbaston absolutely loved it \u2013 and that\u2019s us included.\u201d England are optimistic that Moeen Ali will be able to play the second Test at Lord\u2019s, which starts next Wednesday, despite wearing a hole in the skin of his spinning finger through repeated contact with the seam of the ball, which limited him to 14 overs in Australia\u2019s second innings and forced Joe Root to bowl 15. \u201cWe knew heading in that we had someone who could fill the void if things didn\u2019t quite work out,\u201d McCullum said. \u201cBut I thought Mo did a fabulous job \u2013 he bowled a couple of jaffas and that was what his role was, to try and make breakthroughs with the ball and with the bat try to disrupt it a little bit, and he did that pretty well too.\u201d McCullum was similarly enthusiastic about the performance of Jonny Bairstow, despite the missed stumpings and dropped catches that have led to renewed calls for Ben Foakes to return as wicketkeeper. \u201cI thought they were pretty tough mistakes,\u201d McCullum said. \u201cI\u2019ve kept over here, it\u2019s not the easiest place to keep. But I actually thought Jonny kept really well throughout. I think he found a natural rhythm and did a really good job, and him coming in at seven is a real weapon for us as well.\u201d Having had a first sight of Australia\u2019s plans to counter England\u2019s attacking play \u2013 which notably included spreading run-saving fielders on the boundary from the very first ball of the match \u2013 McCullum said England would be more attacking still in the second Test. \u201cWe don\u2019t worry too much about the opposition,\u201d the New Zealander said. \u201cI had a bit of an inkling they might try and put some sweepers out, and it\u2019s hard to argue because they won the Test match, right? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll stick solid to that strategy, which I think is great because we\u2019ll go a little harder and I think it makes for a really entertaining next few Test matches.\u201d England\u2019s determination to make the game exciting did not protect them from an International Cricket Council fine for slow over rates, with both them and Australia docked 40% of their match fee and deducted two World Test Championship points. The Test was the first of a new WTC cycle, with the decision leaving England on negative points in the nascent table. More happily for England from the post-match update is that Root, who scored 164 runs for once out across the Test, has leapt five places to top the batting charts in the ICC rankings. Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Travis Head, who occupied the top three positions a week ago, drop to three, six and four respectively with Usman Khawaja, who scored 206 runs across his two innings, moving up two places to seventh."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fc9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/statue-of-liberty-miniature-moves-midwest", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Leaving New York: beloved Statue of Liberty miniature finds new home in midwest", "lead": "\u2018Little Liberty\u2019, a bite-sized version of the New York City landmark has moved to the National Building Arts Center in Sauget, Illinois", "author": "Gloria Oladipo in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 16:58:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223864", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d07cda43be757a1794a2e74542624ee26d9a0f33/0_302_4928_2958/500.jpg", "body": "Little Liberty, a miniature Statue of Liberty long a beloved feature of the Upper West Side in New York City, has officially moved to the midwest.

That particular hustle, which can blow a hole through a woman\u2019s 30s and early 40s \u2013 and even, thanks to the lottery-ticket promise of tiny advances in IVF, later \u2013 is mostly in the rear-view mirror by the time 50 rolls around, and what was once all-encompassing fades. For many women, I think, the predominant feeling looking back is: thank God that particular nightmare is over. A report released this week by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) brings it all flooding back, pinging tiny depth charges off otherwise innocuous-sounding words \u2013 \u201ccycle\u201d, \u201cstorage\u201d, even \u201cwindow\u201d gets a look-in \u2013 and yanking one back to a fraught and what seemed, at the time, never-ending period. According to the HFEA, the number of people in the UK seeking fertility treatment has risen in the last few years, as has the average age of patients, as those forced to hit pause during the pandemic resume treatment. The average age at which women have IVF has risen to 36, up by almost a year on 2018 numbers, and five years older than the average age of women conceiving naturally. And the success rates are soaring, too. \u201cSoaring\u201d, of course, is extremely relative in this landscape, where incremental rises of 1% or 2% in the IVF success rate for women over, say, 40, represent major leaps in what\u2019s possible. More interesting, perhaps, is the genuine surge in numbers of younger women freezing their eggs, from 2,576 cycles in 2019 to 4,215 in 2021, an astonishing jump of 64%. The average age of women who undergo this process in the UK is between 30 and 34, a rise that, elsewhere, is reflected in the number of single women having fertility treatment without men. This figure is up 44% since 2019, almost matched by the rise in the number of women in same-sex partnerships seeking treatment, up 33% in the same period. All of this speaks to an opening up of an industry that in large parts of the world remains hard to access for all but a few. France only relatively recently relaxed its ban on assisted reproduction for anyone but heterosexual married couples; in Italy, a similar ban remains in place \u2013 and that\u2019s before you get to the prohibitive cost. Still, the egg-freezing thing gives me pause. Women trying to pre-empt and mitigate the fertility scramble of their late 30s is a sensible precaution, but it brings its own difficulties. One of these is, obviously, the false sense of security that can come with the idea of egg-freezing as a magic bullet. Fertility clinics offering donor egg services don\u2019t typically solicit donations from 34-year-old women, for the good reason that the eggs of a 34-year-old are much less likely to be viable than those of a woman in her 20s. If you freeze your eggs at 34 and decide to pull the trigger and use them when you are 44, you are not looking at an encouraging success rate. According to the HFEA report, for patients aged 43 to 50, the pregnancy rate per embryo transferred was 6% in 2021: a 5% increase from the early days of IVF in 1991, but still a demoralising number. A bigger problem, perhaps, is that freezing your eggs potentially opens the door to a lot of bet-hedging behaviour. Had the service been more widely available when I was in my early 30s, I would probably have used it, in the interests of pushing back the whole fraught set of decisions for another 10 years. I\u2019m a keep-your-options open kind of person, and that position can be expensive, buying you infinite time to dissemble and defer. At the age of 38, when I started fertility treatment, it was under propulsion from a huge freak-out (unrestrained by contingency plans) that I had already left it dangerously late. I\u2019ve always thought that panic is an underrated motivational force, without which, I suspect, I would have dithered indefinitely. On the other hand, the more widely fertility options become available, and the cheaper they become, the less loaded these decisions start to feel. I recall hearing and reading thoughts by older women on when and how younger women should have babies and thinking: \u201cOh, stay out of it.\u201d Given that the struggle to decide to have kids in the first place can be as hard, if not harder, than the actual process of getting pregnant, the duty owed to younger women by those thankful it\u2019s all in the past is to resist forming an outer circle of people wringing their hands, to share their own experience \u2013 and then, pretty swiftly, pipe down.

Here are the key points: Polling suggested that most people wrongly think Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation would either mean prices going down (32%) or staying the same (31%). Only 23% said that this still meant prices would go up. Later in the day, Downing Street claimed the government is still on course to meet its target of halving inflation by the end of the year. At the Ukraine recovery conference this morning Sunak gave a speech saying \u201cRussia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted\u201d. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, wrote to Sunak urging him to scrap controversial legislation to address the legacy of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles. Later in the day, Ireland said it would consider taking legal action against the UK if parliament passes the Northern Ireland Troubles (legacy and reconciliation) bill. In PMQs, Keir Starmer said the cost of the Tory mortgage penalty is an extra \u00a32,900 a year. Sunak replied that interest rates are at similar levels in Canada and the US and Australia and New Zealand, adding that the government has a plan to reduce inflation. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent, Andrew Sparrow, opined that Starmer won in the exchange, noting that he was \u201con very strong ground today because he devoted all his questions to what he called the Tory \u2018mortgage catastrophe\u2019\u201d. Jeremy Hunt appeared before the Covid-19 inquiry, where he dropped several bombshells, including that quarantining people sooner \u201cmight have avoided\u201d the first coronavirus lockdown, the UK did not sufficiently learn from the experiences of Asian nations which had dealt with virus outbreaks, and that pandemic preparation exercises had \u201ctoo narrow a focus\u201d, only considered mitigation rather than prevention, and did not \u201cask the right questions\u201d. Mark Walport, David Cameron\u2019s chief scientific adviser who also appeared before the Covid-19 inquiry, warned him in 2013 that the UK\u2019s assessment of risks, including from pandemics, was not being used properly to prevent and mitigate dangers and was being kept too secret. Labour insisted it still wants to abolish the House of Lords despite planning to swell its size with new peers in order to push through policy if it forms a government. Suella Braverman rejected calls to move responsibility for the Windrush compensation scheme from the Home Office, with the home secretary saying it would cause \u201cdelay and needless bureaucracy\u201d. More than 1m households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election. Downing Street declined to say whether Shaun Bailey, the former London mayoral candidate for the Conservatives, should take up the peerage given to him in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours after a video emerged of him taking part in a mid-lockdown Christmas party. Thanks for following today. Andrew Sparrow will be back tomorrow morning to update you on all the political news of the day. Senior MPs have backed calls for the Foreign Office to do more to help a British citizen jailed for 25 years in Russia for opposing its invasion of Ukraine. PA reports: British-Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in prison in April after he was convicted of high treason by a Moscow court. Kara-Murza has already survived two poisoning attempts by Russian agents, and has developed a medical condition which has deteriorated during his imprisonment to the point where he has lost feeling in his feet and one of his arms. Evgenia Kara-Murza, his wife, now fears that he will die if he is not released from prison and has called for more action from the British government. Her calls have received cross-party support from MPs, including members of the foreign affairs committee Sir Chris Bryant of Labour and the Conservatives Bob Seely and Alicia Kearns, the committee\u2019s chair. Ministers may be bringing in political \u201csuper-spads\u201d through the backdoor by putting them on the boards of Whitehall departments, a leading committee of MPs has found, as it called for an overhaul of appointment rules, writes Rowena Mason, the Guardian\u2019s Whitehall editor. The public administration and constitutional affairs committee, led by William Wragg, the Conservative MP, called for new guidance to prevent \u201cpersonal and political\u201d friends of ministers being installed as non-executive directors of government departments. It launched its inquiry into civil service boards a year after Matt Hancock was found to have appointed Gina Coladangelo, an unpaid adviser, to the board of the Department of Health and later started an affair with her. The committee said it was \u201cdifficult not to question her independence in this role\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent, Kiran Stacey, has the full report on Labour\u2019s plan to appoint dozens of peers to the House of Lords if it wins the next election, despite promising to abolish the upper chamber altogether. Angela Smith, Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, said Labour\u2019s priority would be to get legislation through parliament if it won the next election, even if that meant increasing the size of an institution it had promised to scrap. The party has come under fire from some, including the Scottish National party, who have accused it of hypocrisy, given the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has previously warned about peerages being handed to \u201clackeys and donors\u201d. Smith told Times Radio on Wednesday: There are 90 more Conservatives than Labour [members]. The priority for Keir will be ensuring he gets the Labour programme through. [Starmer] is looking for people who are interested in doing a job of work, or from a particular area of expertise. When we see appointments from Keir, that is the kind of criteria he will be using. Speaking to the Covid-19 inquiry, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis made it impossible to boost NHS funding sooner to better prepare for the pandemic. The Chancellor admitted feeling \u201cconcerned\u201d about the \u201cfragility\u201d of the NHS and Social Care systems after Exercise Cygnus in 2016 and announced an increase in funding in June 2018. Asked whether this funding announcement was too close to the pandemic to address problems in the NHS, he said: When I arrived NHS budget was \u00a3101 billion; when I left it was \u00a3124 billion. That was negotiation for an additional \u00a333 billion. As a country, we had very fragile finances in 2010 following the global financial crisis, and we had to do some work in order to get ourselves in a position where we could afford the big increase that I negotiated in 2018. I don\u2019t think it would have been possible to negotiated that increase any earlier because I don\u2019t think the funding existed to do so. The\u2019s some reaction to the Institute for Fiscal Studies report, which warns that interest rate rises could mean that 1.4 million mortgage holders lose at least a fifth of their disposable income. Speaking in parliament, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said: We will not hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to strangle the inflation in the economy \u2013 and the best policy is to stick to our plan to halve it. But I also want to make sure we do everything possible to help families paying higher mortgage rates in ways that do not themselves feed inflation. So later this week I will be meeting the principal mortgage lenders to ask what help they can give to people struggling to pay for more expensive mortgages and what flexibilities might be possible for families in arrears. Tom Wernham, a research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: Many families bought homes \u2013 often with sizeable mortgages \u2013 when interest rates were very low. As people\u2019s fixed-term offers come to an end, they are going to be exposed to much higher interest rates. For many, the increase in monthly repayments is going to come as a serious shock \u2013 on average it will be equivalent to seeing their disposable income fall by around 8.3%. And for 1.4 million mortgage holders \u2013 half of whom are under 40 \u2013 mortgage payments are set to rise by an eye-watering 20% of disposable income or more. The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said: With inflation staying high and these new warnings that the Tory mortgage penalty will continue to painfully squeeze family finances, it\u2019s clear this government can\u2019t fix these problems because they are the problem. Instead of squabbling over peerages and parties and ruling out any action on mortgages, the Tories should be taking responsibility and acting now. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said quarantining people sooner \u201cmight have avoided\u201d the first coronavirus lockdown. He said: If there was one thing that could have slowed the progress of Covid when it actually arrived, it was to understand the importance of early quarantining to stop the disease spreading, and to understand there are types of pandemic where it is worth putting a massive amount of effort into slowing the spread. One of the very first [uestions] we should have been asking ourselves is: \u2018Is this one of those pandemics that you can actually slow and save lives early on or not?\u2019 And I don\u2019t think we had asked those questions. The chancellor added that lockdown in the UK didn\u2019t happen until March 2020, adding: In that period, transmission had increased to about 5,000 a day, and then it was inevitable that you were going to have to use a lockdown. Had we got on the case much earlier with that approach, we might have avoided that. The UK did not sufficiently learn from the experiences of Asian nations which had dealt with virus outbreaks, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, told the Covid-19 inquiry. Hunt said: I think there was a groupthink that we knew this stuff best and there was a sense, with perhaps the exception of the United States, that there wasn\u2019t an enormous amount we could learn from other countries. And certainly, this is with the benefit of hindsight, I don\u2019t think people were really registering particularly Korea as a place we could learn from. I think it is very notable that Korea did not have a lockdown in the first year of the pandemic. They avoided a lockdown at all. And what I think is interesting is that the reason they had that superb response \u2014 in the second half of the pandemic, quite a lot of east Asian countries didn\u2019t do very well because they didn\u2019t get their vaccines out as quickly as we did here \u2014 but in that first year I don\u2019t think there was any doubt that places like Taiwan and Korea did incredibly well. Speaking at the Covid-19 public inquiry, Jeremy Hunt suggested the government had \u201ctoo narrow a focus\u201d when preparing for a pandemic as part of Exercise Cygnus in 2016. Speaking about the exercise, Hunt, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, told the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel, Hugo Keith KC: We didn\u2019t ask the other question which was: what can we do to stop it getting to that point where 200-400,000 people have died? I don\u2019t think we were asking the right questions. What we should have done is thought much more widely about the question. I think that operation had a very narrow focus, a too narrow focus. He added that there was not \u201cnearly enough thought\u201d put into preparing Britain for a pandemic not based on flu. He said: There was another assumption that we were very good at dealing with pandemics. We all thought it. By the way, it wasn\u2019t just us. Johns Hopkins University in America said that the UK was the second-best prepared country in the world in the global health security index in 2019. They had subcategories and one of their subcategories was which countries were best prepared for preventing the spread of a virus and scaling up treatment quickly, and we were top. We weren\u2019t second best, we were top. And so there was I think a completely wrong assumption and I think the truth is we were very well prepared for pandemic flu because we had put a lot of thinking into it. Exercise Cygnus was a huge thing. But we hadn\u2019t given nearly enough thought to other types of pandemic that might emerge and that was, with the benefit of hindsight, a wholly mistaken assumption. The Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth, has the full report on this morning at the Covid-19 public inquiry: David Cameron\u2019s chief scientific adviser warned him in 2013 that the UK\u2019s assessment of risks, including from pandemics, was not being used properly to prevent and mitigate dangers and was being kept too secret, the inquiry has heard. Professor Sir Mark Walport, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser until 2017, wrote to the then PM about his concerns, and told the inquiry that the national risk assessment \u201cwas locked in departmental safes most of the time and I felt that that wasn\u2019t the most effective way\u201d. \u201cThe whole point of [a] risk assessment is that you will be able to use it to see if you can stop something happening in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is going to happen \u2013 to mitigate your numbers, reduce its effects.\u201d Walport, a member of the prime minister\u2019s council for science and technology until 2020, backed calls from Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, for the creation of a new post of minister for resilience. Labour has insisted it still wants to abolish the House of Lords despite planning to swell its size with new peers in order to push through policy if it forms a government. PA reports: Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesman said he was standing by the pledge to get rid of the upper house in the first term of a Labour administration, but said there could be \u201cinterim reforms\u201d. Under the current makeup, Labour would need 90 more peers to surpass the Tories\u2019 263 members and become the largest party in the upper house. The party conceded that it may take more than one term to shift the balance but said it still wants to replace the \u201cindefensible\u201d Lords with a new elected chamber in a first term. Starmer\u2019s spokesman said: Every government when they first come into power do not have a majority within the House of Lords because of the nature of the appointments process. And every government as a matter of custom and practice looks to make appointments to the House of Lords but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s done in one fell swoop, it\u2019s something that takes time and often takes more than a term in government for that to happen. That reform of the House of Lords will be in the first term of a Labour government. He said new Labour peers would be expected to back abolition, with the full details of the policy to be set out ahead of the next general election. There\u2019s more from the Covid-19 inquiry today as Jeremy Hunt makes his appearance. The chancellor said that Exercise Cygnus, which was designed to assess the UK\u2019s preparedness and response to an influenza pandemic, should have focused more on prevention, rather than assuming that \u201cyou pretty much couldn\u2019t stop it\u201d. Hunt, who was health secretary between 2012 and 2018, said the cross-government exercise in October 2016 was not to examine the UK\u2019s preparedness but to \u201cestablish how well the UK would cope in a situation in which pandemic influenza had already taken hold\u201d. He told the inquiry\u2019s lead counsel, Hugo Keith KC: I know you may well want to talk about the issue of groupthink, but I think this was the first example. Looking back with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 this was not what I thought at the time and I, with retrospect of course \u2013 I wish I had challenged at the time. But there were no questions asked at any stage as to how do we stop it getting to the stage of 200-400,000 fatalities. It was an assumption that if there was pandemic flu, it would spread, using layman\u2019s terms \u2018like wildfire\u2019, and you pretty much couldn\u2019t stop it. Suella Braverman has rejected calls to move responsibility for the Windrush compensation scheme from the Home Office, saying it would cause \u201cdelay and needless bureaucracy\u201d. PA reports: The scheme, set up in the wake of a scandal in which many British citizens were wrongly detained or deported, has been criticised, while the process of handling claims and offering payouts has been branded slow and inefficient. But the home secretary said changes had been made to simplify the scheme for users, and maintained it should be kept under the Home Office remit. In an interview with ITV News as Britain prepares to mark the Windrush 75th anniversary, she said: It\u2019s right that the Home Office maintain ownership over the scheme because to do otherwise would cause delay and needless bureaucracy. Campaigners and a lawyer who has helped claimants over the years have argued that people do not have faith in the Home Office, and said it is inappropriate to have the \u201cperpetrators\u201d of the scandal running the compensation scheme. Meanwhile, Age UK has said the scheme is letting down older people with \u201cincreasing numbers dying before ever receiving the compensation they are due\u201d. The government has accused peers of trying to delay strike reforms that unions fear will make it easier to sack workers. The House of Lords had made a series of amendments to the strikes (minimum service levels) bill aimed at protecting workers and trade unions, requiring the government to consult further and conduct an impact assessment on the changes. But today, the House of Commons overturned the amendments after pleas from the government frontbench to allow the bill to become law. The bill would allow ministers to impose minimum levels of service during industrial action by ambulance staff, firefighters, railway workers and those in other sectors deemed essential. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has called for an \u201curgent rethink\u201d by ministers and warned that the bill, if not amended, will mean that workers who lawfully vote to strike could be forced to attend work or be sacked if they do not comply. Peers have been trying to amend the bill to ensure workers cannot be sacked if they fail to comply with a work notice on strike days. But MPs rejected the Lords amendment aimed at ensuring this protection 277 to 209, majority 68. Peers\u2019 attempts to ensure the government consult further on the bill and conduct an impact assessment were rejected by MPs 283 to 205, majority 78. A series of amendments from the Lords aimed at ensuring unions are not tasked with ensuring their members obey work notices were also overturned. MPs rejected them 280 to 214, majority 66. Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said the amendments from peers were not a \u201cmeaningful attempt\u201d to reach agreement, adding: I fear we are having a somewhat repetitive debate which is delaying us from getting on with the important business of minimising disruption to the public during periods of strike action. Justin Madders, Labour\u2019s shadow business minister, said the Lords were attempting to make the bill \u201cslightly less draconian\u201d, adding that Labour opposes the legislation as a whole. He said: This bill is the act of a weak government that has lost the authority and the will to govern for everyone, a government that prefers legislation to negotiation, prefers diversion to resolution and prefers confrontation to consultation. The proposals are currently in the stage of the parliamentary process known as ping-pong, in which the unelected Lords and the Commons send the bill back and forth until they can agree the final wording. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has said the UK would be \u201cvery supportive\u201d of Ukraine being allowed to skip part of the process for joining Nato. Speaking at a press conference at the Ukraine recovery conference in London, he said: We have seen Ukraine evolve, and evolve incredibly quickly. Jens Stoltenberg at the Nato informal foreign ministers (summit) said that actually, many of the requirements of membership action plan are actually being delivered. The reform of their armed forces is happening while engaged in conflict. I think the UK\u2019s position would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to both Sweden and Finland didn\u2019t require that and Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to reform the military for requirement of Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield. And I think all Nato allies recognise that. Also unveiled at the conference was a pledge from the UK to offer new virtual-reality (VR) training for at-sea Ukrainian cadets as part of a new package of support. The government said the training would be provided through VR headsets to help participants practise for real-life scenarios. Ukrainians will also be sponsored to take part in three-year cadetships to UK container ships and other large vessels. The Department for Transport will also support secondments for Ukraine\u2019s air traffic controllers to train in the UK, with the latest funding following on from \u00a310m previously announced to help repair Ukraine\u2019s rail infrastructure. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, has said he was reassured during his time in the Cabinet Office that the UK was in a \u201cpretty strong state of preparedness\u201d for any future pandemic. Speaking to the Covid-19 inquiry, he said that preparations for a no-deal Brexit put the country in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond to other challenges. Dowden, who was minister for the Cabinet Office from July 2019 to February 2020 and had previously worked in the department, said he had taken an interest in planning, including for a possible flu pandemic. He said: I asked for further specific briefing on that \u2013 received that briefing \u2013 and indeed, throughout my time as a minister, received further briefings, all of which were consistent with advice that we were broadly in a pretty strong state of preparedness. Hugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Dowden about a 2019 memo about the national security council THRC \u2013 threats, hazards and resilience contingencies programmes \u2013 which suggested that work on pandemic influenza was expected to be affected by the \u201cstep-up in planning for a no-deal exit from the European Union\u201d. Dowden said: We had to ensure that we allocated resources according to where the greatest risk lay. Now, it was the case at that time that \u2018no deal\u2019 was the default position of the government, so \u2013 and this is worth remembering the kind of frankly, apocryphal warnings that were being delivered about the consequences of no-deal Brexit, for example in relation to medicine supplies and elsewhere \u2013 it was appropriate that \u2026 we shifted the resilience function to deal with this. He added that there was a \u201cflip side\u201d to the preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 known as Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 which made the UK \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for the pandemic. Dowden\u2019s evidence contrasts with that from the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, who also gave evidence in the morning. Professor Sir Mark Walport, who held the post from 2013-2017, said the UK was \u201cnot operationally prepared\u201d for a pandemic. He said: I think that focus in richer countries had moved away from infectious diseases after the second world war. With the rise of chronic inflammatory diseases, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, there was much more of a focus on those and away from infection. The Liberal Democrats are blaming the government\u2019s \u201cchaotic mismanagement of the economy\u201d for the \u201csavage cuts\u201d that homeowners are facing to their disposable incomes due to rising mortgage rates and are calling for ministers to provide support. Responding to the Institute for Fiscal Studies report showing that interest rate hikes could mean that 1.4 million people lose 20% of their disposable income, Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem\u2019s Treasury spokesperson, said: These stark figures show struggling homeowners are facing savage cuts to their incomes as mortgage rates go through the roof. The blame for this lies squarely with this Conservative government and their chaotic mismanagement of the economy. Jeremy Hunt has totally failed to get inflation under control and millions of families are paying the price through a crippling Conservative mortgage penalty. It is shocking that the government is still refusing to help struggling households despite being responsible for this cost of living catastrophe. Rachel Hall here taking over from Andrew Sparrow for the rest of the day. If there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve missed, do drop me a line. Downing Street claims the government is still on course to meet its target of halving inflation by the end of the year. At the time Rishi Sunak made the promise in January, inflation was running at 10.1%. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing, asked if Sunak was on course to fulfil his pledge, the PM\u2019s spokersperson said: \u201cThat remains the target.\u201d Asked of the government was on track to meet it, the spokesperson said: Yes. Despite some of the coverage at the time [of the announcement of the pledge] this was never something that was straightforward. It was rightly an ambitious target that we remain committed to and it can only be achieved with fiscal discipline. That is all from me for today. My colleague Rachel Hall is now taking over. Ireland will consider taking legal action against the UK if parliament passes the Northern Ireland Troubles (legacy and reconciliation) bill, Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM) said today. Speaking in the D\u00e1il in response to the question from Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, who asked what the Irish government would do if the bill were passed, Varadkar said: The bill has not yet been enacted, and certainly if it is enacted, if it does become law, we will then at that point give consideration to whether an interstate case is appropriate, so we certainly don\u2019t rule that out. An interstate case would involve Ireland taking the UK to the European court of human rights on the grounds that the bill breached the European convention on human rights because the convention obliges the UK to ensure Troubles-related deaths are properly investigated. Explaining why Ireland opposed the bill, Varadkar said: I just want to reiterate and restate the government\u2019s opposition to this legacy bill. We think it\u2019s entirely the wrong approach to give former army servicemen, former IRA and paramilitary terrorists immunity from prosecution. We owe it to the victims to make sure that we all do everything we can to make sure that any information that can be given to the police is given to the police and that those people are prosecuted if at all possible. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re very much against this legacy bill and I\u2019ve made that very clear to the prime minister, as has the t\u00e1naiste [Miche\u00e1l Martin] with his counterparts. It\u2019s been discussed with the US president, and is discussed at European level as well. Unionists in Northern Ireland also oppose the bill. See 11.06am. Downing Street has declined to say whether Shaun Bailey, the former London mayoral candidate for the Conservatives, should take up the peerage given to him in Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours, PA Media reports. PA says: Bailey has come under pressure to turn down his peerage after a video emerged of a mid-lockdown Christmas party at Conservative headquarters thrown by his campaign. Asked whether he should take up his seat in the Lords, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary said: \u201cThat is a matter for the individual.\u201d If he did take his place in the upper chamber, it would be \u201ca matter for the whips\u201d whether he sits as a Conservative. The press secretary insisted Rishi Sunak had merely been following the precedent in allowing Johnson to recommend honours for his supporters. More than 1m households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. Richard Partington has the story here. The IFS paper is here. Here is an extract from the IFS report. In March 2022, households with a mortgage were spending an average of \u00a3670 per month on mortgage payments, \u00a3230 of which was on interest payments. Figure 1 shows how those figures will change if mortgage interest rates remain at their current level, relative to a situation where the March 2022 interest rates persisted. On average those in mortgage-holding households will pay almost \u00a3280 more each month, with 30 to 39-year-olds paying almost \u00a3360 more. This will be a significant hit to mortgagors\u2019 disposable incomes (i.e. incomes after mortgage payments) at a time that families are already under strain \u2013 on average disposable incomes will fall by 8.3%, with those aged 30-39 again seeing the biggest hit (almost 11%). For some the rise will be substantially larger: almost 1.4 million \u2013 690,000 of whom are under 40 \u2013 will see their disposable incomes fall by over 20%. And here is the IFS chart illustrating these figures. It was obvious that Keir Starmer won those exchanges when Rishi Sunak started his final answer with the words: \u201cNo amount of personal attacks and petty point-scoring will disguise the fact that [Starmer] does not have a plan for this country.\u201d Complaining about \u201cpersonal attacks and petty point-scoring\u201d at PMQs is a serious category error; it is a bit like playing football and then moaning about your opponents only being interested in kicking the ball into the back of your net. PMQs is an environment where leaders have to combine clear, broad-brush strategic messaging with sly digs that undermine the standing and authority of their rivals. It is a hard trick to pull off; too high-minded, and you look naive; too personal, and you just look nasty. Starmer gets the balance just about right, and today his jibes against Sunak were considerably more effective than anything coming in the opposite direction. In his second question, he mocked Sunak\u2019s novel explanation for why he was not answering questions about the privileges committee\u2019s report. I realise the prime minister spent all week saying he doesn\u2019t want to influence anyone or anything. He is certainly keeping to that with his answer. Later Starmer delivering a cutting joke about Sunak\u2019s interest in the California mortgage market, and there was a slightly less funny, but perhaps equally potent, sneer about Sunak\u2019s use of helicopters. Increasingly, Sunak\u2019s flight habits may be creating, or exacerbating, an image problem, because they reinforce the view that he is not like ordinary people. Caring for ordinary people, and understanding their problems, are two areas where Starmer has the biggest advantage. But jokes will get you nowhere without an argument, and Starmer was on very strong ground today because he devoted all his questions to what he called the Tory \u201cmortgage catastrophe\u201d. As is often the case, a story about an individual conveyed the political argument most effectively. This morning I spoke to James in Selby. He\u2019s a police officer, working hard to keep people safe every day. The Tory mortgage penalty is going to cost him and his family \u00a3400 more each and every month. That\u2019s nearly \u00a35,000. He told me this morning that they\u2019ve decided to sell their house, to downsize and he\u2019s just told his children they\u2019re going to have to start sharing bedrooms. Why should James and his family pay the cost of the prime minister\u2019s failure? Sunak was never likely to have a brilliant comeback on this issue. His responses were a mixture of: 1) it\u2019s a global problem; 2) we have a plan, and we are taking action; and 3) Labour would make it worse. None of these points sounded as if were likely to be very persuasive to James in Selby. Sunak also did not seem to have resolved whether or not the Tories are attacking Labour for not having a plan for the economy, or for having a plan for the economy which is flawed. At various points he deployed both arguments. Either would have worked; combined, they don\u2019t. The one surprise, perhaps, was that Starmer did not say more about the privileges committee debate, and Sunak\u2019s abject failure to take a stance on it. Given that real life (ie mortgages) can and should trump the Westminster personality pantomime, Starmer\u2019s decision to mostly leave this issue was probably the right one. But when Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan raised it later, and challenged Sunak to respond to the claim that he had been \u201cweak\u201d (see 12.24pm), his response was particularly underwhelming. Starmer could probably have scored a clear hit on this topic too. Tim Farron (Lib Dem) says 3.5 million people live in radiotherapy deserts. His constituents need to do a three-and-a-half hour round trip to get this treatment. Sunak says he is aware of the problem. The NHS is rolling out local diagnostic centres, he says. Deidre Brock (SNP) says with Boris Johnson finally exposed as a liar, and more and more evidence coming out about the damage of Brexit, will Sunak apologise for backing it. Sunak says the UK has grown faster than France and Italy since it left the single market. Steve McCabe (Lab) asks if any of the papers the government is trying to withhold from the Covid inquiry relate to the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme promoted by Sunak when he was chancellor. Sunak does not answer directly, but says more than 55,000 documents have been handed over. David Davis (Con) asks about British universities helping the Iranians with research that might have a military function. Sunak says these allegations are being investigated. Andrew Slaughter (Lab) asks if the government is still committed to finishing new hospitals in his constituency by 2030. Sunak says the hospital-building programme has been expanded, but schemes in cohort four will be in construction by 2030. Kevin Brennan (Lab) asks if the word \u201cweak\u201d describes the PM\u2019s performance this week. Sunak says what is weak is Labour\u2019s unwillingness to stand up to the unions that fund them. Asked by Dame Meg Hillier (Lab) if a law breaker should be allowed to become a law maker, Sunak says he has just followed precedent on honours. That was a reference to Shaun Bailey, who was made a peer in Boris Johnson\u2019s honours list, and who attended a Tory party where lockdown rules were ignored. Anne Marie Morris (Con) says nearly half of people have been somewhere where cash is not accepted. Will the PM ensure that any entity providing a public service have to accept cash. Sunak says, as technology changes, organisations should be able to decide what forms of cash they accept. Liam Fox (Con) says the UK is performing better than EU countries in some respects. Sunak says Fox is right to highlight the improvement in the economic outlook. Unlike Labour, the government won\u2019t talk Britain down, he says. Stephen Farry (Alliance) says there is still no executive in Northern Ireland. Will the PM work on a financial package for a restored executive. Sunak says he shares Farry\u2019s frustrations on this. He wants the executive restored. Over \u00a37bn has been given to Northern Ireland since 2014, on top of Barnett funding. He says the government is considering what more is needed. Stephen Flynn, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, quotes some of Sunak\u2019s comments about improving economic performance, and says Sunak has taken honesty lessons from Boris Johnson. Sunak says the government is on track to reduce inflation. Flynn says Ireland, and the eurozone area, have better inflation records. Will Sunak admit that Brexit broke the economy? Sunak says the rise in inflation and interest rates is a global phenomenon. Government involves difficult decisions. The SNP won\u2019t do that, he says. Philip Davies (Con) asks Sunak to commit to new oil and gas production in the UK. Sunak says that is an excellent point. A block on North Sea oil and gas investment would mean dependence on imports would rise. Starmer says things may look fine from the vantage point of Sunak\u2019s helicopter. With the honours list, the Tories are rewarding those guilty of economic vandalism. Sunak says Starmer is making petty points. But he cannot disguise the fact he does not have a plan. Labour is all talk; the government is delivering, he says. Starmer says over the next two years 7.5 million people will be in the same boat. Repossessions are up. What is the PM doing about that? Sunak says the mortgage interest scheme is more generous. Borrowers are being allowed to extend their terms, or switch to interest-only payments. He says repossessions are still at a level below the level pre-pandemic, and three times below the level inherited by the Tories. Starmer says Sunak may have a keen interest in the mortgage market in California, but he is talking about the UK. He says he spoke to someone this morning who is having to move to a smaller home because his mortgage was going up \u00a35,000 a year. Sunak says Labour\u2019s policy would make things worse. He says the IFS says Labour\u2019s plans would put up interest rates. The IMF has said what the government is doing is right. Starmer says the cost of the Tory mortgage penalty is an extra \u00a32,900 a year. How is that delivering for home owners? The question [Sunak] refuses to answer, he actually knows the answer to this question, is \u00a32,900 extra. That\u2019s the cost to the average family of the Tory mortgage penalty. Now he was warned by experts about this as long ago as autumn last year, but he either didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t believe it or didn\u2019t care because he certainly didn\u2019t do anything, and when I raised this a couple of months ago, he had the gall to stand at that despatch box and say he was delivering for homeowners. How is an extra \u00a32,900 a year on repayment delivering for homeowners? Sunak says interest rates are at similar levels in Canada and the US and Australia and New Zealand. The government has a plan to reduce inflation. Labour borrowing would make the situation worse, as would banning new exploration in the North Sea, and giving in to unions. Labour polices \u201care dangerous, inflationary and working people would pay the price\u201d. Perhaps [Starmer] could explain why interest rates are at similar levels in the US, in Canada, in Australia and New Zealand, why they\u2019re at the highest level in Europe that they\u2019ve been for two decades. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we have a plan to reduce inflation, but in contrast what do we hear from [him]. He wants to borrow an extra \u00a328bn a year, that would make the situation worse \u2026. He doesn\u2019t have many policies, but the few that he does have all have the same thing in common, they\u2019re dangerous, inflationary and working people would pay the price. Starmer says Sunak has spent the week saying he does not want to influence people; that answer shows he is still doing it, he suggests. He says Tory economic failure is to blame. How much will this cost householders? Sunak says the government is getting on with the job. Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Windrush generation. And he says the passing of Glenda Jackson leaves a space in our cultural and political life that cannot be filled. Does the PM agree with his MP who said Britain faces a mortgage catastrophe? Sunak says the government needs to help people with mortgages. That is why the government wants to halve inflation. He said that was important before he got that job. The IMF backs that. Mark Menzies (Con) asks about support for the nuclear fuel industry. Sunak says the government is supporting the industry. The domestic nuclear fuel sector has a critical role to play, he says. Patricia Gibson (SNP) asks how much living standards have fallen since Sunak has been in office. Sunak says the government has done much to support people with the cost of living. Rishi Sunak starts by talking about the Ukraine recovery conference. And he pays tribute to the contribution of the Windrush generation on the 75th anniversary of the boat\u2019s arrival. We may get a lot of economics at PMQs today. Graeme Wearden has all the latest on his business live blog. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. In the Commons Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, is taking questions. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, tells Heaton-Harris that his party wants the government to legislate to ensure that the Northern Ireland protocol does not constrain trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Heaton-Harris says the government is willing to provide these assurances in legislation, but he says he also wants the DUP to say when it is willing to lift its boycott of power sharing at Stormont. This is from Damian Lyons Lowe, head of the polling firm Survation, on Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation, and his company\u2019s research as to what people think it means. (See 9.40am and 10.31am.) On the subject of maths (see 10.31am), this is from Chris Giles, the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, on the difficulty Rishi Sunak now faces in meeting his inflation pledge. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, has written to Rishi Sunak urging him to scrap controversial legislation to address the legacy of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles, PA Media reports. PA says: Donaldson said that an \u201camnesty for terrorists is not only an affront to justice but a gateway to further attempts to rewrite and airbrush the past\u201d. The Northern Ireland Troubles (legacy and reconciliation) bill proposes an effective offer of immunity from prosecution for perpetrators of crimes during the Troubles who cooperate with a truth-recovery body. It would also halt future civil cases and inquests linked to killings during the conflict. While the government introduced a number of amendments to the bill earlier this month, the Stormont parties, Irish government and victims\u2019 groups remain opposed to it. The bill has gone through the Commons and is close to finishing its passage through the Lords, where its report stage debate starts this afternoon. Donaldson said: I have urged Rishi Sunak to recognise that imposing this bill against the express wishes of communities and political parties in Northern Ireland would be a retrograde step. Reconciliation will not be achieved by sacrificing justice. Access to justice must be preserved and the principle of everyone be equal under the law should be protected. The bill must be scrapped and for good. The number of pupils in England issued with a special needs support plan has more than doubled in the last eight years to 180 a day, driving up deficits in local authority budgets to \u201cunmanageable levels\u201d, Sally Weale reports. Here is another finding from the Survation poll showing how many people do not understand inflation, and what Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation would actually mean in practice. (See 9.40am.) It suggests only around a third of people can accurately say what a 5% annual inflation rate would do to the cost of a \u00a31 loaf. One consolation for Sunak is that at least this does vindicate his call for more maths and economics teaching. At the Ukraine recovery conference this morning Rishi Sunak gave a speech saying \u201cRussia must pay for the destruction that they\u2019ve inflicted\u201d. Alexandra Topping has full coverage on our Ukraine live blog. Good morning. Inflation figures are out today, and they are worse than expected. Richard Partington has the story here. And Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog. This is certain to be come up at PMQs later. Rishi Sunak used to work in finance before becoming an MP (his first job was at Goldman Sachs) and he is something of an economic geek. In some respects that makes him well qualified to lead the country at a time of economic difficulty. But geeks don\u2019t always have a good grasp of how the public at large thinks, and this morning Survation has published some fascinating polling about Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year. The obvious problem with the pledge is that, although it looked easy to achieve at the start of the year, now economists are less certain about that. But potentially a more serious problem is that the pledge has created unrealistic expectations. Halving inflation will not mean that prices go down. But when Survation asked people what it would mean in practice, most people wrongly said that the pledge would either mean prices going down (32%) or staying the same (31%). Only 23% said that this still meant prices would go up. That suggests many people may end up being disappointed when they realise Sunak\u2019s economic promises aren\u2019t delivering quite what they expected. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Rishi Sunak speaks at the Ukraine Recovery conference. Noon: Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. After 12.45pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to first the strikes (minimum service levels) bill, and then to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. Mid afternoon: MPs debate a Labour motion that would set aside government Commons business on 12 July to allow time for the animal welfare (kept animals) bill, which has been dropped by the government, to be passed. 2pm: Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, gives evidence to the Covid inquiry. He will be followed by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor. The current hearings are about preparedness, and so they will be questioned about the government jobs they did before 2020 (Cabinet Office minister and health secretary respectively).

And probably never gonna be.\u201d Those are not the words you might expect to hear from the Denver Nuggets\u2019 point-center Nikola Joki\u0107: a bonafide superstar, two-time league MVP, who was, at the time of these comments, about to head into his (and his franchise\u2019s) first ever NBA finals (where he would win, handily, for that matter). But Joki\u0107 is not the type of superstar we\u2019ve come to expect in the NBA. He has something that has been rare, and even frowned upon, among athletes of his caliber: perspective. So, in a world where work/life balance is a hot button topic, and we\u2019ve recently lived through a pandemic that flipped our lives upside down, why are his sentiments so polarizing? And are they a true anomaly, or a bellwether? The discourse around perspective, how much of it an athlete should have and what the merits or drawbacks are therein, stormed into the NBA zeitgeist earlier this postseason, when Bucks supernova Giannis Antetokounmpo gave his postgame comments after his team\u2019s shock first-round exit at the hands of the eight seed Miami Heat. He was asked by a reporter if he considered the season a \u201cfailure,\u201d in light of the sky-high expectations for the team. Antetokounmpo shook his head. \u201cMichael Jordan played 15 years. He won six championships. The other nine years were a failure? That\u2019s what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong question. There\u2019s no failure in sports. There\u2019s good days, bad days. Some days you\u2019re able to be successful, some days you\u2019re not. Some days it\u2019s your turn, some days it\u2019s not your turn. And that\u2019s what sports is about. You\u2019re not always going to win.\u201d Some, of course, appreciated Giannis\u2019 ability to see the bigger picture, to understand that the definition of \u201csuccess\u201d is broader than hoisting a trophy. But the comments were also met with outrage by others: how dare he not be embarrassed at the way his team went out? Of course sports are about winning. Being an athlete is supposed to be about giving up everything to reach the ultimate goal. The greatest in the sport, like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, were often as famous for their ambivalence towards being liked by their teammates and their obsession with winning as they were for their talents. The idea that there was another way of doing things, and still doing them well, was an affront to the first rule of NBA Superstar Fight Club: being a psychopath when it comes to winning is part of the deal. But maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be. Besides both having one NBA championship, one Finals MVP award, multiple league MVPs and seemingly aligned priorities, Joki\u0107 and Antetokounmpo share another common bond that may give insight into their ability to keep their stardom in healthy perspective: they both come from extremely humble beginnings in European countries (Serbia and Greece, respectively). Europeans tend to have a healthier work/life balance than Americans \u2013 a recent study found that Americans work hundreds of hours more per year than their European counterparts. Beyond that, though, American culture exalts an every-man-for-himself, win-at-all-costs ethos that simply doesn\u2019t exist in most of the rest of the globe. It makes sense, then that, as basketball becomes increasingly global, its stars will become less and less recognizably American, in both their attitudes and approach. It\u2019s interesting, too, that while prioritization of mental health has gained traction in recent years, athletes are often lampooned for putting their own emotional wellbeing first, and mocked for having the very same perspective that makes things like mental wellness possible. But the truth is that we\u2019re living in a time in which our ideas about what male athletes, and men in general, \u201cshould\u201d be are changing. Yet some of us are holding on to an antiquated idea of what it means to be an elite athlete. As a general rule, fans historically wanted their athletes to be superhuman. They get to do the most fun thing for a living, after all, and generally get paid the GDP of a small country to do so. So why wouldn\u2019t they be some extra-special version of a human who is impervious to pain, and isn\u2019t susceptible to the ups and downs of the emotional experience? If they weren\u2019t invulnerable, wouldn\u2019t they be one of us, punching the clock in an unnamed cubicle? It\u2019s been difficult, maybe, for some to reconcile that there are people walking among us who are simply a combination of skilled, gifted, and lucky. And that being the recipients of such good fortune doesn\u2019t make them superhuman, nor does it exclude them from the right to have full, happy, lives in which sports are not the be-all and end-all. In a recent interview with JJ Redick, Joki\u0107 and Antetokounmpo\u2019s fellow European (and soon to be first overall pick in the NBA draft) Victor Wembanyama showed that he, too, possesses a wisdom that affords him perspective when it comes to the game. When asked by Redick how he keeps himself grounded in reality, the 19-year-old said: \u201c[It] is something bigger than basketball. It\u2019s just accomplishing yourself inside this universe. When I need motivation, when I need energy, and I feel tired \u2026 When I need to fight on the court and it\u2019s hard, I always remember: I\u2019m free in that universe \u2026 I always have that in mind. And it doesn\u2019t stop at just basketball. It\u2019s about life.\u201d Whether fans like it or not, the future of sports is evolving. And with it, our antiquated ideas of what an athlete should be, what a man should be, will inevitably evolve too. Players like Joki\u0107, Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama represent this future: global in scope, forward-thinking, grounded. And as these players and others in their image continue to dominate the league, an inalienable truth will be left staring their old-school detractors in the face: there\u2019s more than one way to win."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fcd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/patrick-vieira-moves-to-top-of-shortlist-to-become-new-leeds-manager", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Patrick Vieira emerges as frontrunner to become new Leeds manager", "lead": "Patrick Vieira has moved to the top of the shortlist to fill the managerial vacancy at Leeds, ahead of Daniel Farke and Scott Parker", "author": "Louise Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 16:45:16", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223939", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f42bb44f0362fda1dfe304f367e57ff8cb2fca2d/0_160_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Patrick Vieira has moved to the top of the shortlist to fill the managerial vacancy at Leeds as the club\u2019s board conducts its final round of interviews this week.

The former Arsenal and France midfielder was dismissed by Crystal Palace in March but had previously impressed at Selhurst Park and retains admirers among the Leeds hierarchy. The only caveat is that Vieira is not a Championship promotion expert. In contrast, Farke and Parker can point to their experience of getting teams up from the second tier, with the latter having taken Fulham and Bournemouth into the Premier League and Farke twice doing so with Norwich. Parker is available after being sacked by Club Brugge in March and Farke parted company with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach this month. Leeds have not followed up an initial interest in Carlos Corb\u00e9ran. The former Elland Road first-team coach is managing West Brom but so far at least his former employers have not approached the Hawthorns board about activating the \u00a32.5m release clause in the Spaniard\u2019s contract. Instead the focus seems to have shifted increasingly towards Vieira. Indeed it is not inconceivable that the 46-year-old \u2013 who has also previously managed New York City FC and Nice \u2013 could celebrate his 47th birthday on Friday by securing a new job in West Yorkshire.

Born in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, Andrew was the only son of Kitty (nee Burbidge) and Ray Veal, a shipping manager. After the family moved to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, he went to King Edward VI grammar school in the town. Andrew\u2019s first job was as a trainee chartered surveyor at Parkyns estate agents, which he joined in 1972. There he met Suzanne Woricker and they married in 1976.

He loved his time there, and it was while with NatWest that he began his parallel duties as a special constable.

This was too much for Lindsay Hoyle. He urged MPs to be more cautious in their use of language. There was a danger that people might think Flynn was accusing the prime minister of deliberately misleading parliament. So there we had it. A new precedent. No one can now compare another MP to Boris Johnson, because to do so is to accuse them of lying. Spare a thought for Jacob Rees-Mogg. Or Jake Berry. Now officially banned from being mentioned in the same breath as their hero. From now on, \u201cto do a Johnson\u201d is officially translated in Hansard as \u201cto habitually tell lies\u201d.

Everyone knows it\u2019s been a complete disaster and is keen to distance themselves from it. Especially Sunak himself, who only a few years ago had been one of its leading advocates. How quickly he forgets. No, all that Johnson will be remembered for is as the prime minister who was slung out for an inability to tell the truth. Poetic justice. Still, we should, I suppose, have been grateful that Rish! turned up to prime minister\u2019s questions at all. On Monday he had invented any number of subsequent engagements to avoid having to abstain in person on the privileges committee report vote. According to his spokesperson \u2013 Rish! is increasingly unable to speak for himself \u2013 he had stayed away because he hadn\u2019t wanted to influence anyone or anything. You live and learn. There was I thinking that one of the main functions of any prime minister was to influence people. Perhaps Sunak is high-minded enough to attempt a new kind of politics. One where he will preface any speech he makes with a plea that people should think twice before believing a word he says. Because most of what he will be promising is almost certainly a Johnson. Though, come to think of it, the public are probably well ahead of the prime minister on this anyway. Many of us have learned the hard way that most of what he says comes with a health warning. Even Rish!\u2019s own backbenchers are having to re-evaluate their own leader. They had been promised \u2013 as a bare minimum \u2013 someone who was vaguely competent. Someone who could just about manage to get dressed by himself and could almost talk in meaningful sentences. Only it turns out that they have been badly let down. Sunak has proved to be no marked improvement on any of his predecessors, and his AI software is even worse than Theresa May\u2019s. \u201cI am delivering on the things that the people want delivering on,\u201d he says. Except he isn\u2019t. Things are going from bad to worse. Inflation is stubbornly high, mortgages are becoming unaffordable, people are broke, and we\u2019re still waiting on the promise of a government of honesty, integrity and accountability. The faces of his own MPs says it all. They are morose, almost silent. Lost in their own despair. Thinking of possible career moves after the next election. And that\u2019s just the few who bother to show up. Week by week there are more and more empty spaces on the Tory benches. Predictably, it was yet another slam-dunk win for Keir Starmer. He gives the impression of a man who is enjoying himself. A man who is now allowing himself to believe that he will be the next prime minister. A man not afraid to do whatever it takes to win power. Though that increasingly means just pointing out the obvious. Like, you promised to halve inflation. And what are you going to do about mortgages? Rish! didn\u2019t actually have any answer to anything. On inflation, he just got a bit hazy. Oh, that? That\u2019s a global problem. Except you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t take the credit for bringing it down \u2013 if and when that happens \u2013 if you\u2019re going to say \u201cnothing to do with me, guv\u201d when it remains high. That\u2019s a binary problem even Sunak\u2019s limited Artificial Stupidity ought to be able to cope with. As for mortgages, he was going to do \u2026 precisely nothing. Just hope that something worked out in the end. It wasn\u2019t his fault if people had borrowed more than they could afford. Maybe they could downsize or something. He looked hopelessly behind him for inspiration from Jeremy Hunt. Who just looked blank. And a bit guilty. Jeremy genuinely knows nothing about economics. Or maths. His first move as chancellor was to buy a copy of Quantitive Easing for Dummies. It\u2019s a worry. A chancellor who knows less about the economy than I do. Starmer found time to get in a few digs about absenteeism, taking an interest in California interest rates \u2013 not that Sunak actually has a mortgage; he could buy a whole village for cash \u2013 and his penchant for helicopter travel. Rish! looked rattled. Chippy. Snippy. He can dish out the personal attacks but he can\u2019t take them. He likes to be treated as a prince. All he could do was insist that Labour was ruining the country. He hasn\u2019t quite got how this works. Or maybe he\u2019s 18 months ahead of us and thinks Labour is in power. There was no respite from the Labour backbenchers. Meg Hillier wondered if it was right for rule-breakers to become rule-makers. Sunak pleaded Pontius Pilate. He had merely waved Johnson\u2019s honours through. Spinelessly. Unbothered that they had been drawn up by a discredited liar. Kevin Brennan asked what Sunak would call a prime minister too scared to vote against Johnson. \u201cWe are delivering \u2026\u201d Rish wittered. He isn\u2019t. He really isn\u2019t. Rattled again, he went to admit that Tory promises on hospitals weren\u2019t going to be kept. Sunak raced for the exit. Desperate to get away. Even he can see how this one plays out. It had been tempting at the start to think his poor performances at PMQs were one-offs. That he would improve. But he won\u2019t. Because he can\u2019t. He\u2019s genuinely not very good at being prime minister. And the economy is not going to improve any time soon. Things will only get worse. And he and the Tories are stuck with him. It\u2019s hard to tell who is enjoying this the least."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fd0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/england-under-21s-european-championship-georgia-gareth-southgate", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England Under-21s seeking glory in Georgia \u2013 along with Southgate\u2019s eye", "lead": "Lee Carsley\u2019s European Under-21 Championship squad want to be England\u2019s first victors since 1984 and to stake a senior claim", "author": "Louise Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 16:00:46", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.223991", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f4abba84212786b28becb4133d3045ab33047140/0_289_4364_2620/500.jpg", "body": "Some of the brightest young talents in English football have congregated in the city known as the Las Vegas of the Black Sea, but Jack Grealish need not fear he is missing out. Rather than looking to tour Batumi\u2019s famed clubs and casinos, Lee Carsley\u2019s England Under-21s squad have travelled to this subtropical region of Georgia at the foot of the Caucasus for business rather than pleasure. If their principal mission is to be the first England side to win this age group\u2019s European Championship since that of 1984, Carsley\u2019s players will also be hoping to catch the eye of Gareth Southgate as they kick off their campaign against the Czech Republic on Thursday evening. The England manager\u2019s attendance at a 16-team tournament jointly hosted by Georgia and Romania emphasises its role as a form of international finishing school. Yet although Arsenal\u2019s Emile Smith Rowe possesses three senior caps, several of Carsley\u2019s 23-man squad remain light on Premier League experience. The Manchester City centre-half Taylor Harwood-Bellis and the goalkeeper James Trafford are examples of talents possessing plenty of potential who still await their Premier League debuts. Smith Rowe, meanwhile, made a modest 12 top-tier appearances for Mikel Arteta\u2019s team last season, all off the bench. It means Carsley is likely to lean heavily on an experienced contingent including the Aston Villa midfielder Jacob Ramsey, a veteran of 35 appearances for Unai Emery\u2019s upwardly mobile side last term. If Ramsey should prove a key figure in an initial group stage also involving Israel and Germany, Nottingham Forest\u2019s similarly battle-hardened Morgan Gibbs-White will hope to drift between the lines separating midfield from attack, while the winger Anthony Gordon will be determined to prove precisely why Newcastle paid Everton an initial \u00a340m for his services in January. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can do well,\u201d says Carsley, whose midfield options also include the relatively experienced Liverpool pair of Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones, in addition to Tottenham\u2019s Oliver Skipp. \u201cWe tried to pick as many players who have been playing for their clubs, particularly towards the end of the season, and there\u2019s plenty of caps in there. I feel like we\u2019re in a good position to really attack every team.\u201d Despite England\u2019s ranking alongside Spain, France, Italy and Germany as one of the favourites to lift the trophy in Batumi on 8 July, Carsley detects no reason for complacency. \u201cThe stats would tell you from past under-21 tournaments that we haven\u2019t won it since 1984 and we\u2019re rated sixth or eighth in the coefficient rankings,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to win it we\u2019re going to have to perform above our current rating.\u201d Given Uefa rules dictate players had to be 21 or under only at the start of the qualifying process in January 2021, Carsley\u2019s squad includes 11 players over the age of 21, including three who have already celebrated their 23rd birthday. Such maturity will preface plenty of farewells next month. \u201cA lot of these players won\u2019t be able to play for the under\u201321s again,\u201d acknowledges England\u2019s coach, whose side face Israel in Kutaisi on Sunday and Germany in the same Georgian city next Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve told them we won\u2019t get this time back. \u201cBut no one should see this as bowing out [from involvement with England] because the pathway\u2019s there; if you\u2019re performing well in the Premier League then you\u2019ve got a really good chance of being involved in Gareth\u2019s thoughts.\u201d Levi Colwill has already featured in Southgate\u2019s plans, having recently been called up to train with the senior setup. The Chelsea centre-half \u2013 whose playing style has been likened to that of John Terry \u2013 impressed enormously while on loan at Brighton this past season and, at only 20, appears more than capable of eventually earning full international honours. If Southgate is particularly intrigued to see how Colwill copes with potentially marking Germany\u2019s Youssoufa Moukoko \u2013 the 18-year-old Borussia Dortmund forward arrives in Georgia having already represented his country\u2019s seniors at the World Cup in Qatar \u2013 scouts from Newcastle and Chelsea are expected to be fixated by Sandro Tonali. The 23-year-old captain of the Italy side at the tournament, and holder of 14 senior caps, shone in a defensive midfield role for Milan last season. Representatives of Chelsea, Newcastle and others are also likely to take a close looks at Lyon\u2019s 19-year-old Rayan Cherki, an attacking midfielder expected to be a key component of France\u2019s challenge. Carsley\u2019s immediate concern is to finish in the top two of Group C and avoid any embarrassing slip-up against a Czech Republic side England beat twice as they won eight of their 10 qualifying games. \u201cIt\u2019s important we enjoy this challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t we win it, too?\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fd1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/21/new-guidance-needed-to-stop-ministers-putting-friends-on-whitehall-boards", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New guidance needed to stop ministers putting friends on Whitehall boards ", "lead": "MPs call for shakeup to stop \u2018super-spads\u2019 being made non-executive directors in government departments", "author": "Rowena Mason Whitehall editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 16:00:01", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224009", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/becd3817b2eb3cc82032f0c7ecd4ac9b3f871859/0_0_2943_1765/500.jpg", "body": "Ministers may be bringing in political \u201csuper-spads\u201d through the backdoor by putting them on the boards of Whitehall departments, a leading committee of MPs has found, as it called for an overhaul of appointment rules. The public administration and constitutional affairs committee, led by the Conservative MP William Wragg, called for new guidance to prevent \u201cpersonal and political\u201d friends of ministers being installed as non-executive directors of government departments. It launched its inquiry into civil service boards a year after Matt Hancock was found to have appointed his unpaid adviser Gina Coladangelo to the board of the Department of Health and later started an affair with her. The committee said it was \u201cdifficult not to question her independence in this role\u201d. Non-executive directors were brought in to provide challenge and an independent view to the boards of Whitehall departments. However, the committee\u2019s report identified another seven examples where politically connected people have been put on Whitehall boards, including the former special adviser and Vote Leave activist Henry De Zoete; the former special adviser Simone Finn; the former Tory and Ukip MP Douglas Carswell; the former Labour MP and Vote Leave campaigner Gisela Stuart; and the former chief of staff in No10 Nick Timothy. It also highlighted examples where Gerry Grimstone, a non-executive in the Department for International Trade, and Theodore Agnew, a non-executive director in the Treasury and Cabinet Office, became government ministers in the House of Lords. Other instances not mentioned by the committee include the former Conservative vice-chairman Dominic Johnson, who was appointed to the Department for International Trade and is now a minister; and Ben Goldsmith, the party donor and brother of the Tory peer and former cabinet minister Zac Goldsmith, who is on the board of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. They highlighted evidence from Miranda Curtis, who was a lead non-executive in the Foreign Office until 2020, said: \u201cWe have all experienced appointments being made in departments of political allies of ministers or secretaries of state, who come in as super spads. That is clearly a different role from the role of an independent non-exec.\u201d Michael Jary, the lead non-executive for the government, told the inquiry he had not observed it was a problem. But the committee said it was significant that there was a view, real or perceived, that non-executive directors could be appointed as political advisers to ministers because of their supposedly fundamentally different purposes. It said: \u201cThe ministerial code and corporate governance code state that departmental boards should only focus on operational delivery, not policy.\u201d It called for an urgent overhaul of the corporate governance code for non-executives, saying it was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, and a ban on ministers appointing individuals \u201cwith clear political or personal connections\u201d. The committee also said ministers should avoid replacing all departmental non-executives when they take over and for the commissioner for public appointments to regulate the appointments. A report from the Institute for Government found in 2021 that about 20% of the 94 non-executive directors then in post have political experience or allegiances. At the time, it called for a complete overhaul of how they are appointed, saying it was \u201cimpossible to know whether candidates are genuinely being appointed on merit, or if advantage is being given on grounds of political affiliation\u201d."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fd2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/ukraine-recovery-london-conference-volodymyr-zelenskiy-eu", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nato allies back fast-track membership for Ukraine, says Cleverly", "lead": "UK foreign secretary says Ukraine has \u2018evolved quickly\u2019, as Zelenskiy tells summit it can be engine of green growth", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:54:11", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224026", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/41d6e1af0026ca380e1cf853b651b22afa0906ba/0_141_4582_2749/500.jpg", "body": "The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has said all Nato allies are backing a plan to give Ukraine a fast track to Nato membership of the kind offered to Sweden and Finland earlier this year. Speaking on the margins of the two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London, Cleverly said the UK was \u201cvery, very supportive\u201d of Ukraine being able to join Nato without the usual need for it to meet the conditions set out in a Nato membership action plan (Map). The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was more cautious but said circumstances had changed since 2008 when Ukraine was last offered Nato membership on the condition it met the terms set out in an action plan. The issue of the terms on which Ukraine is offered Nato membership has been dividing allies before a Nato summit next month. There have been concerns in the US and Germany that early Nato membership for Ukraine might provoke Russia, and change the Nato structure. Cleverly said the Ukrainian army through the war had modernised and aligned its weaponry with Nato to make it possible to dispense with an action plan. The offer is conceived as an alternative to offering Ukraine a timetable for membership at the Nato summit in Vilnius next month. Ukraine would like a pathway with specific dates. All sides have agreed that Ukraine cannot join Nato \u2013 and thus be covered by its guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all \u2013 until the war is over. But the offer to drop the Map would be a signal of European intent. The prospect of relatively imminent Nato membership is also seen by Ukraine\u2019s leadership as a precondition to persuading western companies that investment in Ukraine\u2019s economic recovery is a worthwhile risk. Cleverly said: \u201cWe have seen Ukraine evolve and evolve quickly. Jens Stoltenberg at the Nato foreign ministers [summit] said many of the requirements of the membership action plan are actually being delivered. The reform of their armed forces is happening while engaged in conflict and I think the UK\u2019s position is that it would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to both Sweden and Finland did not require that. \u201cThe Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to military reform required for Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield, and I think all Nato allies recognise that.\u201d Colonna was also supportive, if more qualified. She said: \u201cPerhaps we won\u2019t require the membership action plan mechanism \u2013 perhaps not, I say, perhaps not \u2013 which was planned in 2008. We are a long way from 2008. Time has passed, the situation is quite different.\u201d Speaking by video link, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked the conference: \u201cWhat does the world see now? Does it recognise Nato\u2019s moral leadership in protecting peace? This is only possible with Ukraine in the alliance.\u201d He also accepted in a BBC interview that progress in the country\u2019s current counteroffensive against Russian forces had been \u201cslower than desired\u201d. Zelenskiy also told the conference that Ukraine had made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before and could become an engine for green world growth and security for decades. The Ukrainian president argued that the fight for his country was a way to protect freedom and security across the world and, once at peace and free from Russian interference, Ukraine could be \u201cthe largest source of economic, industrial and technological growth in Europe for decades and decades\u201d. He told the two-day conference it was time to move from visions of Ukraine\u2019s recovery to specific agreements. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told the meeting Ukraine was running a budget deficit to 2027 of \u20ac60bn (\u00a352bn) and blamed the destruction on \u201cone man\u2019s delusional attempt to restore a lost empire\u201d. She said she was sure Ukraine would become a member of the EU, and gave an upbeat progress report on Ukraine meeting its pre-accession commitments towards democracy, judicial reform, media freedom and anti-corruption. \u201cUkraine had accelerated its reform programme with impressive speed and resolve,\u201d she said, adding that before the summer break the EU would give a report on how Russia should pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said the US was providing a further $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) in aid, including $520m to overhaul Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, of which half had been destroyed by Russia. A further $675m would be provided to update its infrastructure, ports and border crossings, including funds to digitalise trade. He said the US had provided $60bn in aid but eventually only the private sector could provide the investment Ukraine needed. Blinken also said: \u201cRussia will eventually bear the cost of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.\u201d Richard Branson, the Virgin owner and a Ukraine ambassador for business, condemned those companies still operating in Russia and called for sanctions to be strengthened and loopholes to be tightened. Zelenskiy tried to present a vision of how a postwar Ukraine could become a future bulwark for security, stability, democracy and prosperity across the west. He said Ukraine could provide grains to 600 million people, lithium for batteries, metallurgy, fertilisers and green energy. He added that there was no alternative to the green transformation of the economy saying \u201ceach strike on our energy facilities ends the era of fossil fuel dominance and a world over-dependent on one supplier, Russia\u201d. He said Vladimir Putin had invaded Ukraine not only to steal resources, but because Russia was \u201cworried about our democracy because democracy paves the way for rule of law and getting rid of corruption\u201d. He urged western leaders to have the \u201ccourage\u201d to acknowledge that his country was already a key part of their economic and defence alliances. \u201cWe are only waiting for the courage of the alliance leaders to recognise this reality, politically,\u201d he told the conference. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, said: \u201cBefore this terrible war, Ukraine\u2019s economy was becoming a huge investment opportunity. It was the breadbasket of Europe, exporting millions of tonnes of food and grain each month, a top-five exporter of iron ore and steel, a leader in energy \u2013 pushing forward renewables, hydrogen and electric vehicles \u2013 and a startup nation [\u2026] with a thriving tech sector, which actually had a record year in 2022. \u201cThe truth is, that opportunity is still there today \u2013 in fact the war has only proved how much Ukraine has to offer.\u201d He highlighted Ukraine\u2019s technological expertise, saying IT experts and the military had developed a mobile app to track the Shahed drones being used by Russia. Sunak said that when he visited Kyiv in November, he saw the people\u2019s spirit of \u201cingenuity and innovation\u201d. Speaker after speaker at the conference drew applause by saying that Russia would have to contribute to the cost of Ukraine\u2019s recovery, put at $400bn by the World Bank in May. Blinken said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Russia is behind the destruction of Ukraine. And Russia will end up bearing the cost of rebuilding Ukraine.\u201d But a preliminary paper prepared by the European Commission suggests no legal avenue has been found to seize frozen Russian sovereign assets that does not risk legal challenge."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fd3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/heather-knight-lauren-filer-cricket-england-australia-womens-ashes-test-trent-bridge", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "England bid to topple Australia and inject \u2018bang\u2019 into Women\u2019s Ashes opener", "lead": "Lauren Filer\u2019s ability to \u2018bang the ball\u2019 has earned the pace bowler an unexpected place in Heather Knight\u2019s side for the Ashes Test at Trent Bridge", "author": "Raf Nicholson at Trent Bridge", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:53:33", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224045", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/62f376ae8d5955060dc62ae7d72343069307446d/0_122_2700_1620/500.jpg", "body": "Lauren Filer\u2019s ability to \u201cbang the ball in\u201d has earned the pace bowler an unexpected place in Heather Knight\u2019s side for Thursday\u2019s Ashes Test. The England captain is seeking an aggressive attack that can take all Australia\u2019s wickets to secure a first result in a women\u2019s Test since 2015. \u201cMyself and Jon [Lewis, the coach] are on the same page about how we want the team to play,\u201d Knight said. \u201cWhen I started out playing Test cricket I felt I had to go super-defensive, it was all about survival. I want all the girls to have in their minds how they\u2019re going to take the game forward with the ball or with the bat. \u201cShe [Filer] is one of the quickest in the country and she gets bounce. She can move the ball both ways and she can bang the ball in. We need a team that\u2019s going to take 20 wickets.\u201d Danni Wyatt, after representing England in 245 white-ball matches over 13 years, will at last be handed a Test cap when the match starts. \u201cShe\u2019s really chuffed,\u201d Knight said. \u201cProbably at one point she felt like she was never going to get a Test cap, but we\u2019ve picked her because we want her to play exactly how she does in the middle-order in ODI cricket. She\u2019s one of the best players and the best attackers of spin in the world game.\u201d Alice Capsey, who had been widely expected to make her Test debut, was released from the squad on Tuesday and will feature in the concurrent T20 series between England A and Australia A. Australia have not yet confirmed their XI but are also expected to field two debutants: the former Ireland all-rounder Kim Garth and the 20\u2011year\u2011old batter Phoebe Litchfield. With the captain, Meg Lanning, sitting out the series because of unspecified medical reasons, and her stand-in, Alyssa Healy, having signalled her desire to drop down to the No 5 spot, Litchfield is likely to open the batting. The women\u2019s Ashes is played for points in all three formats with the Test match worth four points \u2013 compared with two for the three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s. A win at Trent Bridge will be the key to success in the series. Australia are firm favourites: they have held the Ashes since 2015, are holders of the 50-over and 20-over world titles, and are fresh from successfully defending the latter in South Africa in February. Given the infrequency of women\u2019s Tests, though, this is something of a wildcard. Of the two sides, it is England who have more recent experience of the format, having faced South Africa at Taunton last season. Australia\u2019s last Test was the breathtaking Ashes encounter at Canberra in January 2022. England came within 12 runs of chasing down their 257-run target before clinging on for the draw with one wicket to spare. \u201cThe last innings at Canberra was exactly how I want us to play this Test match,\u201d Knight said. \u201cWe went out there to try to win, be really aggressive. We\u2019ve learned a hell of a lot from that match, when the heat was on.\u201d There is another complicating factor: this will be the second women\u2019s Test to be played over five days (the previous one took place between the same opponents at Sydney in February 1992). That makes it a tough one to approach tactically for both teams, who are used to having to manufacture a result within a more limited time-frame. Five days means more time to bat. That bodes well for Ellyse Perry, who hit a double-century in the 2017 Sydney Ashes Test and has a Test average of 75, as well as for Knight.

The All England Club has teamed up with tech group IBM to offer AI-generated audio commentary and captions in its online highlights videos. The service will be available on the Wimbledon app and website and will be separate to the BBC\u2019s coverage for the 3 July-16 July tournament. It will use IBM\u2019s watsonx AI platform, which has been trained in the \u201cunique language of tennis\u201d with the help of the All England Club. The club already uses IBM\u2019s AI technology to provide features such as its player power index, which analyses player performance. The coverage will also include AI-powered analysis of singles draws, examining how favourable a player\u2019s path to the final might be. \u201cThis new insight will help tennis fans to uncover anomalies and potential surprises in the singles draw, which would not be apparent by looking only at the players\u2019 ranking,\u201d said IBM. Data, such as tracking data for the ball, tracking data for the players and the type of shots the players make from different parts of the court, is collected from a variety of sources around the court. It will then be fed into IBM\u2019s platform, where it will be processed by the company\u2019s AI models before ultimately being fed to a chatbot-style system that produces natural language commentary, specifically fine-tuned in the language of tennis and Wimbledon. That commentary can also be handed on to a second text-to-speech AI to turn it into audio commentary in near-real-time. IBM said the move was a step towards generating AI commentary on full matches. The European broadcasting union announced this month that the cloned voice of the commentator Hannah England will be used to provide commentary for the European Athletics Championships. England\u2019s voice will be used to replicate the content of the event\u2019s live blog for commentary on the European Athletics YouTube channel. Watson, IBM\u2019s branding for its suite of AI tools, made headlines more than a decade ago for playing \u2013 and winning \u2013 a game of the American TV show Jeopardy!, where contestants answer general knowledge questions with peculiar phrasings.

Dettori seized control of the Queen\u2019s Vase from the off aboard Gregory, the even-money favourite, and simply refused to yield as Saint George and Oisin Murphy ground their way to within a head of the leader in the straight. It was the moment that Dettori and also the meeting had needed and, having fought off Saint George after he came alongside a furlong out, Gregory stayed on again to finish a length and a half clear at the line. It was a performance with \u201cSt Leger\u201d running through it like a watermark and Gregory is now favourite for the final British Classic of the season, and also of Dettori\u2019s long career. \u201cI thought this winner was never going to come this year,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cI had three seconds yesterday, but I knew this would be my best chance. \u201cI was in front a long time and when Oisin came to me, I thought: \u2018Oh no, not second again.\u2019 To ride a winner at my last Royal Ascot is fantastic. It\u2019s great, my family is here, it\u2019s the only day they all are. He jumped great and got to the front and I knew he stayed very well.\u201d Dettori is still pondering whether to appeal against a nine-day ban for careless riding imposed by the stewards on Tuesday after he was found to have caused significant interference aboard Saga shortly after the start of the Wolferton Stakes. The suspension is scheduled to rule him out of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown next month, when he is due to ride Emily Upjohn, the current favourite. \u201cYesterday, Chaldean ran super and found one too good,\u201d Dettori said of his runner-up in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. \u201cThe filly [Inspiral] got a bit tired maybe and then I got run over [on Absurde] in the last by Ryan [Moore, on Vauban] so they all ran well, but you need luck as well. \u201cI\u2019ve got my lawyers looking [at the suspension]. It\u2019s sad to be missing Emily, but I\u2019m glad nobody got hurt. It\u2019s that point of the race that you get to a bottleneck and we all got together. If there\u2019s room to appeal, we will, but I\u2019m not going to do it just to waste everybody\u2019s time.\u201d Gregory completed a double on the day for his trainers, John and Thady Gosden, after Mostahdaf, last seen in Europe when finishing last of the 20 runners in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe eight months ago, had left some of best 10-furlong horses in the world looking like statues in Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes earlier on the card. Gosdens\u2019 five-year-old spent the early part of the year in the Middle East, winning a Group Three in Saudi Arabia with ease before finishing out of the frame behind the exceptional Equinox on World Cup night in Dubai. He arrived at Ascot off an 88-day break and started as the 10-1 fifth pick in the betting in a six\u2011strong field but he brushed aside his better\u2011fancied opponents, including the 1-2-3 from the Champion Stakes of last year, in a matter of strides and finished four lengths clear of Luxembourg at the line. \u201cI expected him to run on well in the straight,\u201d John Gosden said, \u201cbut not to make them look like they were standing still. In fairness to him, he won the Neom Cup in Riyadh in that style, he just flew away. When the ground dries up, he\u2019s brilliant. \u201cWe were going to run him in the Brigadier Gerard [in May] but he hadn\u2019t quite recovered from his Middle Eastern campaign, and he took on a certain Japanese horse in the Sheema Classic [in Dubai]. A mile and a half is beyond him, he\u2019s a mile-and-a-quarter horse, but he was the only one that put it up to him [Equinox] and gave it his best go.\u201d Mostahdaf was unplaced in the one-mile St James\u2019s Palace Stakes here two years ago and finished second, over 12 furlongs, in the Hardwicke Stakes in 2022. After his latest victory, however, he seems sure to stick to 10 furlongs and will be a force to reckon with wherever he runs. \u201cHe\u2019s been knocking at the door in some big races but it\u2019s only now it\u2019s really come to fruition,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cI probably went a bit too soon, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.

Earlier this year, the Marquess of Salisbury, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, opposed an application by the Open Spaces Society (OSS) to register a 1.8-hectare (4.45-acre) area of land on his estate as a common. Gascoyne-Cecil is a Conservative politician, once an MP and minister, and now sits in the Lords as a hereditary peer. Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, which was built by Gascoyne-Cecil\u2019s ancestor the 1st Earl of Salisbury in 1611, is one of the UK\u2019s biggest country homes. Some of its gardens are open to the paying public, and prices to visit start at \u00a38 for the day. However, some land on the estate is now freely accessible after Hertfordshire county council granted a request to register it as common land. The area was determined to be common because it counts as \u201cwaste land of a manor\u201d and under the law this means the public has access rights. The land, which comprises a mixture of grass, shrub and trees, has now been added to the common-land register, and the public has the right to walk there. Although it is almost 4 miles (6km) from his home, Gascoyne-Cecil objected to the application. Frances Kerner, the OSS\u2019s commons re-registration officer, said: \u201cI am delighted that the land at Wildhill Road has been added to the register of common land and that the public will be able to enjoy its beauty. \u201cIronically, the marquess recently hosted Future Countryside, an important conference tasked with discussing the many challenges faced by people who live in, work in and visit the countryside. Disappointingly, the society was not invited to the conference, but we hope that any future events held by the organisation will include the society and others who champion access to our splendid countryside.\u201d In 1969, the land was provisionally registered as common but, according to the OSS, following an objection that year, the provisional registration was cancelled. It then was too late to register the land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. However, the Commons Act 2006 reopened the opportunity to rescue lost commons. Under paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the Commons Act 2006 the excluded land became eligible for re-registration. The application, made by the society, to register the land duly provided evidence that the excluded land is waste land of a manor, which means that it can be registered as common land. According to the OSS, waste land of a manor is land of poor quality, which the lord or lady of the manor could not cultivate, and under the law this has been counted as common land. The council found that the tests in the 2006 Act had been met, and that the objection did not overcome these tests, and on that basis it amended the register. Hatfield House and the marquess declined to comment."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fd7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/uswnt-roster-womens-world-cup-2023-soccer-australia-new-zealand", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Morgan and Rapinoe heading to their fourth World Cup as USA name squad", "lead": "Alex<strong> </strong>Morgan, Kelley O\u2019Hara and Megan Rapinoe are heading to their fourth Women\u2019s World Cup after being selected for this year\u2019s tournament", "author": "Tom Lutz", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:30:51", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224116", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/61c0823fb08e9f285a12e514ff6c547c654b50d9/0_83_5568_3341/500.jpg", "body": "Alex Morgan, Kelley O\u2019Hara and Megan Rapinoe are heading to their fourth Women\u2019s World Cup after being selected for this year\u2019s tournament in Australia and New Zealand. The trio were members of the team who won the World Cup in 2015 and 2019. Also included in head coach Vlatko Andonovski\u2019s squad are Alyssa Naeher, Crystal Dunn, Emily Sonnett, Julie Ertz, Lindsey Horan and Rose Lavelle, who have a chance to win another World Cup title after playing at the tournament in 2019. \u201cThe task of selecting a World Cup Team is never easy, but I\u2019m proud of the players for their work ethic and focus during the process and of our coaching staff for doing the work to put together the best team possible,\u201d said Andonovski. \u201cIt\u2019s the players that make the biggest impact on our environment, they push each other to be better and I know as a group they are extremely motivated to make our country proud at the World Cup. Every player has a different journey to get to this point so our roster has some amazing stories and we have a really good mix of veterans and younger players.\u201d The roster was announced in a social media video that included names such as musicians Lil Wayne and Taylor Swift, actors Issa Rae and John Cena, WNBA star Brenna Stewart, NFL quarterback Jalen Hurts and Joe Biden. \u201cFrom lifting trophies to fighting for gender equity, these women have been a source of inspiration for Americans of all ages,\u201d said the US President. The USWNT\u2019s captain, Becky Sauerbrunn, will miss this year\u2019s tournament through injury along with another star from France 2019, Mallory Swanson, who has been the team\u2019s most potent attacking threat in recent times. Two other important midfielders, Sam Mewis and Catarina Macario, will also miss the tournament after injury struggles. Ashley Hatch, who had been Morgan\u2019s back-up in the US squad for some time, was not selected after disappointing performances for the national team. Instead Sophia Smith, who is heading to her first World Cup, is most likely to step in for Morgan in Australia and New Zealand. Perhaps the biggest surprise is Andonovski\u2019s inclusion of Savannah DeMelo, who is just the third uncapped USWNT player to make a World Cup squad since Debbie Keller in 1995 and Shannon Boxx in 2003. Boxx went on to win three Olympic gold medals and a World Cup with the US, along with 195 caps. Another notable selection is Alyssa Thompson who, at 18, is the second-youngest player to make a USWNT World Cup squad. Thompson is named alongside other young stars such as 21-year-old Trinity Rodman and the 22-year-old Smith as Andonovski continues to bring in new talent: 14 of the 23-woman squad will be at their first World Cup. Rapinoe, who will turn 38 next month, is the oldest player in the squad. The US are looking to win their fifth World Cup after their victories in 1991, 1999, 2015 and 2019. They start their campaign against Vietnam on 22 July (21 July in the US) in Auckland. They then face a tough test against the Netherlands, the world\u2019s No 9 ranked side, before rounding out the group stage against Portugal. \u201cOur players understand the challenges and the competitive environment we are heading into, and they love it. We have a roster with depth and versatility and that will help us take on all the challenges that will be coming our way,\u201d said Andonovski.

Subjectivist was just four years old when he beat a field that included Stradivarius, one of the best stayers of recent decades, in the 2021 Gold Cup, and seemed poised to dominate the division for several seasons to come. He suffered a career\u2011threatening tendon injury soon afterwards, however, and had been off the track for 618 days when he returned to action in Saudi Arabia in February, finishing 12th of 13 runners. But Subjectivist (4.20) seemed much more like his old self in the Dubai Gold Cup a month later, when he briefly looked the likeliest winner in the straight before fading late on. His rivals on Thursday inevitably bring much stronger recent form to the table, including a Classic victory in last year\u2019s St Leger in the case of Eldar Eldarov. The fact remains, however, that Subjectivist\u2019s emphatic success here two years ago is the best piece of form on offer, and if his stable has indeed nursed him back to his best for the race on Thursday he could be significantly overpriced at around 10-1. Ascot 2.30 The US-trained American Rascal and No Nay Mets need to be taken seriously after Crimson Advocate\u2019s Queen Mary win on Wednesday, but Elite Status could not have been any more impressive in the National Stakes last time and is surely the one to beat. Ascot 3.05 Valiant King led on the bridle before pulling nearly six lengths clear in a useful time to break his maiden at Navan in May, and has looked sure to benefit for the step up to 12 furlongs on both his starts this season. Ascot 3.40 A huge field for the Ribblesdale but Al Asifah was hard\u2011held when winning by six and a half lengths at Goodwood 10 days ago and can take this Group Two on the way to even better things. Ascot 5.00 This is always one of the most wide-open handicaps all year so it could be worth chancing Physique at around 33-1. He was nearest at the finish in a well-run race at Goodwood this month and the excellent apprentice Mohammed Tabti takes off what could be a very useful 7lb. Ascot 5.35 Caernarfon\u2019s third\u2011place finish in the Oaks last time seems to have been dismissed as a fluke in the betting, but Jack Channon\u2019s filly has several solid runs to her name and catches the eye at around 12-1.

The party has come under fire from some, including the Scottish National party, who have accused it of hypocrisy, given the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has previously warned about peerages being handed to \u201clackeys and donors\u201d. Smith told Times Radio on Wednesday: \u201cThere are 90 more Conservatives than Labour [members]. The priority for Keir will be ensuring he gets the Labour programme through.\u201d She added: \u201c[Starmer] is looking for people who are interested in doing a job of work, or from a particular area of expertise. When we see appointments from Keir, that is the kind of criteria he will be using.\u201d Labour\u2019s intention to appoint many more peers was revealed on Wednesday by the Times. A spokesperson for Starmer later said it would be \u201cessential\u201d for a Labour government to get its legislation through parliament and that doing so would require more peers from the party. They said: \u201cIt is the nature of the way in which the process will have operated that the governing party of the day will not be the largest party in the House of Lords. So, of course we are going to be looking to make appointments.\u201d They added that anyone appointed as a Labour peer would be expected to adhere to the party\u2019s policy positions, including abolition of the chamber. Starmer has promised to abolish the Lords and replace it with a smaller, cheaper democratically elected second chamber. Labour would not commit to doing so in a first term in government, saying only that it hoped to do so. The party is consulting on how it can go about abolishing the Lords, which has proved stubbornly resistant to reform for decades. Starmer\u2019s spokesperson said on Wednesday there could be \u201cinterim reforms\u201d along the way to abolition. Tommy Sheppard, the SNP MP, said: \u201cIt will come as no surprise to voters in Scotland that, yet again, Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party is U-turning on another pledge \u2013 this time to reform the House of Lords.

We adjusted to the environment.\u201d Now 92, Vollin is one of the last remaining former residents of Queen City, a historically Black neighbourhood in Arlington, Virginia, erased to make way for the rushed construction of the Pentagon during the second world war. He spent a lifetime mourning its passing. But now he is delighted by a public artwork that honours its memory. Queen City by artist Nekisha Durrett is a 35-ft tall, well-like brick tower in Metropolitan Park, Arlington, that peers over trees and architecture to mark the site of what existed before. Durrett commissioned 17 Black ceramists to make 903 ceramic teardrop vessels that signify the 903 individuals of Queen City displaced after losing their homes with almost no notice. Queen City had thrived for 40 years before the wrecking balls came. Vollin, whose father worked in a brickyard, recalls that while it lacked electricity or running water, the sense of community was irreplaceable. \u201cEven though it was a poor area, we were like family,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re so poor, you have friends and you have neighbours who look out for you. You\u2019d go into a house and there was food. It was just a close knit community that was devastated.\u201d He was around 10 years old when, in 1941, he learned his home would be taken away. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much time to think about it. I think they made a decision in February that we had to get out in March. We did not own our home and so we were homeless. We were left devastated, had no place to go. \u201cMy grandfather was once a slave and this seemed like it was almost a new form of slavery that would once again make us homeless. They put us in a trailer camp and I guess we stayed in there for two or three years. I went from one trailer camp to another trailer camp in filthy conditions. \u201cI used to bring water into the trailer to keep clean. Still I don\u2019t remember ever missing a day of school because I was just determined. What I viewed as my stumbling blocks I used as stepping stones all through my life and consequently I have gone on to be successful as an educator.\u201d With war raging in Europe, Franklin Roosevelt, then president, had approved the use of \u201ceminent domain\u201d \u2013 the right of a government to expropriate private property for public use \u2013 to seize 411 acres of land near Washington. Eighty decades later, Vollin remains sharply critical of the decision. \u201cEminent domain is supposed to be used to build bridges and roads and things to enhance a community. I maintain that in this case it was used to destroy a community. Eminent domain has been used all over this country in low-income, Black and other areas to destroy communities and take property. \u201cWhat they did was extremely illegal. Any time you destroy the hopes, dreams and aspirations of people, it is an atrocity. There were churches that were destroyed, there was a fire department that was destroyed, there were businesses that were destroyed. I brand this as an atrocity, what they did to us.\u201d Construction of the Pentagon began on 11 September 1941 (the site was bordered by five roads so the developers opted for a five-sided building) and was officially completed just 16 months later, thanks to 1,000 architects and 14,000 tradesmen working around the clock. The Pentagon is the world\u2019s biggest low-rise office building with 6.5m sq ft of office space and 7,754 windows. It was meant to be turned into a hospital, office or warehouse after the war but instead became a permanent symbol of American military might. Vollin, a civil rights activist and former school principal, reflects: \u201cThat was quite a contrast in tearing down a community to build a war department. I\u2019ve never been in the Pentagon; I have no desire to go into the Pentagon at all. There was property everywhere else. They could have gone to Maryland or DC to build the Pentagon so I have no real regard for that area.\u201d The jarring story of a Black neighbourhood being displaced by the military industrial complex resonated with Durrett, 47, a multimedia artist whose goal is to unearth lesser known Black histories. In a joint video call with Vollin from his home in Washington, she says: \u201cThis 411-acre footprint of the US government stomped out this community. \u201cIn their haste and their willful ignorance, when they were looking for land to build the Pentagon, they looked across the river in 1941 and pointed to Queen City and said, look there, there\u2019s nothing there, let\u2019s build there. In fact there was a boy there who would grow into a man who was a teacher, a principal, a counsellor, a father, a husband. There were 903 people like William.\u201d Durrett believes a grave injustice was done in the name of eminent domain. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a need to wipe out a community and especially wipe out a community without just compensation, which is also embedded in eminent domain and often not adhered to. There is never just compensation in these instances. Most of the people in Queen City were Black people in America in the 1940s and could not own their property, so they received nothing.\u201d Durrett\u2019s monumental sculpture, Queen City, is intended to honour those people who had little material wealth but were rich in other ways. \u201cThis piece is calling out the divestment in the community \u2013 not having water, not having sewage, not having paved roads and electricity while the rest of Arlington was developed \u2013 but also saying, look at the beauty that was in this place in spite of all of that. \u201cLook at what a community who has very little in the way of material wealth can produce. Knowing that history was what led me to wanting to build something using the very thing that was destroyed in Queen City, which was community.\u201d Durrett worked with a community of her own: consultants and engineers in the Washington area helped produce the piece. Her collaboration with 17 Black ceramists across the country served as a reminder that, while there is only one Pentagon, there are numerous African American communities that have been destroyed. She recalls: \u201cOne of the prompts that I had for them was to describe a \u2018Queen City\u2019 in their community and nearly every one of them was able to bring forward an example of a community similar to Queen City where eminent domain wiped them out. \u201cThere is an example of Queen City in every state in this country. When you begin to scratch its surface, it\u2019s not hard to arrive at the conclusion that this entire country is built on the dispossession of Indigenous people and the enslavement of Black people and the exploitation of immigrants.\u201d The finished artwork exudes power and permanence like one of nearby Washington\u2019s many memorials. The Washington Post described it as \u201ca reservoir for public memory, a symbol of a near-forgotten past\u201d. No one can accuse Durrett of failing to think big. She explains: \u201cThat\u2019s how scale functions for me in my work. It\u2019s a way to make something that is invisible difficult to ignore. This sculpture is almost mundane in this presentation. It was made using very humble material:, brick and concrete. It looks like something from a bygone era, outdated infrastructure, like a well or a smokestack or something emerging from the ground.\u201d The use of 5,000-odd reclaimed bricks is also a nod to the area\u2019s former brickyards where many Black people found work. \u201cA very clay rich soil that made it right for brick production. I was thinking, what would a person from Queen City, who maybe worked in these brickyards, build for themselves using these materials?\u201d Durrett hopes the work will encourage people to realise that history, including Black history, is everywhere around them and to act upon it. \u201cThis piece has a potential to inspire people once they are implicated in this history. How are they going to share the story? How are they going to energise people to change policy? Art has the potential to inspire change. An artwork itself can\u2019t do that but people in community and in concerted effort can bring about significant change.\u201d And how did Vollin, who intends to seek an acknowledgement from the Pentagon over what happened, feel when he first saw the artwork? The grandfather admits: \u201cI\u2019m pretty tough but I was quite tearful when I last saw it. It symbolised that my grandma and those folks that ran Queen City will be remembered. Now she can look down and smile. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a dream coming true. This has bothered me for so many years. Every time I pass by the Pentagon I remember my friends. I never saw many of them again: we were just scattered all over the place. I was very emotional when I first saw it.\u201d As Vollin speaks, that emotion is reflected in Durrett\u2019s eyes beside him. He goes on: \u201cI intend to go there many times and take friends over there to see this amazing structure. Even at my age, it\u2019s reinvigorated me. I\u2019m uplifted to see what this young lady has done. It\u2019s been a sort of vindication, seeing this structure, that we\u2019ll not be forgotten.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fdb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/15000-prize-writers-from-refugee-migrant-backgrounds-footnotes-counterpoint", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": " \u00a315,000 prize launched for writers from refugee and migrant backgrounds", "lead": "The new Footnote x Counterpoints prize for narrative nonfiction includes a publishing agreement, and welcomes work that \u2018crosses cultures and borders\u2019", "author": "Ella Creamer", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:11:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224236", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0ce2ba63eaa1c71b65ef77d13e6df765be3a48c4/120_0_1800_1080/500.jpg", "body": "A new award for writers from refugee and migrant backgrounds has been launched this week, inviting entrants to submit narrative nonfiction work.

You can\u2019t measure that.\u201d Pirrawayingi, mayor of the Tiwi Islands regional council, is addressing about 100 Tiwi people during a break in a combined clan group meeting with Santos about the fossil fuel company\u2019s plans to drill for gas in the sea north of Melville Island. It\u2019s 22 March, six months and one day since the senior Munupi lawman Dennis Murphy Tipakalippa won a landmark federal court case against the drilling permit for Santos\u2019s Barossa offshore gas project. That case, and a subsequent appeal, found that the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema), had failed to assess whether Santos had consulted with everyone affected by the proposed drilling. The Barossa project would involve drilling for gas in the Timor Sea and constructing a pipeline to pump it more than 200km to Darwin for processing. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Tipakalippa\u2019s lawyers successfully argued that the Tiwi Islands traditional owners were an interested party, whose spiritual connection to land and sea country meant Santos was required to consult them. The fossil fuel company was ordered to stop the drilling it had started for eight exploratory wells about 100km off the Tiwi coast. Its drilling rig remains parked offshore, a barely visible speck when seen from the flight between Darwin and Garden Point airport, while senior Santos executives spend weeks meeting clan groups on Melville and Bathurst islands to provide information that should have been available when the company took over the project from ConocoPhillips in 2020. At the 22 March meeting, which Tiwi people gave Guardian Australia permission to attend and report on, there is optimism among the traditional owners and a readiness for a bigger fight they believe they can win. As one Tiwi man says bluntly to the 12 company representatives at the front of the sports club, where a screen displays the blue Santos logo and the words \u201cWe are here to listen\u201d: \u201cSantos, [you] bring all your projects here and we say no, take your project somewhere else.\u201d A massive gas industry expansion Tiwi Islanders are just some of the First Nations peoples who are on the frontline of a proposed massive expansion of the gas industry across the Northern Territory. Guardian Australia spent two weeks in the territory speaking to communities affected by these developments \u2013 from the Barossa offshore gas field to fracking in the Beetaloo basin in the Barkly region, and the Middle Arm industrial precinct in Darwin Harbour \u2013 which the Albanese government has backed with $1.5bn in funding. The political backdrop is one of contradiction. Australia is undergoing more rapid changes in Indigenous and environmental affairs than it has in a decade, with the upcoming referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament, the passage of the Climate Change Act to legislate emissions reduction targets and reforms to cultural heritage laws in the wake of the inquiry into the destruction of Juukan Gorge. At the same time, the federal and Northern Territory governments have stated their support for new gas development \u2013 a position that is incompatible with the goal to limit global heating to 1.5C and poses risks to biodiversity, water and culture. There is strong opposition from many traditional owners to the gas industry\u2019s plans for the territory. Only a small portion of the area covered by these projects falls under land rights legislation that grants traditional owners veto rights over developments. This means many Aboriginal people concerned about the effects of these projects have what former native title lawyer and current executive director of the Environment Centre NT, Kirsty Howey, describes as a \u201ccompromised legal space in which to assert their rights and views\u201d. For offshore projects, even where native title over the sea exists, the law only requires resource companies to notify native title organisations \u2013 not traditional owners themselves \u2013 of their plans. There is no obligation on gas companies, for example, to enter into negotiations for an agreement with traditional owners, unlike for onshore projects such as fracking in the Beetaloo basin. \u201cThat meant that for Tiwi traditional owners, native title was next to useless as a vehicle for asserting their views about the Barossa gas project,\u201d Howey says. In fact, the federal court determined it was actually Australia\u2019s petroleum laws that gave them a right to be consulted. \u201cThat was the real significance of the case, it sidelined native title and has forced gas companies to consult with First Nations people directly about offshore projects in a way they haven\u2019t previously,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the same time, this falls far short of a veto. While Santos is required to provide information to Tiwi people about the project, Tiwi people still don\u2019t have the right legally to stop it.\u201d \u2018We are with the land. We are one\u2019 Front beach at Pirlangimpi is a sliver of bay shaded by bush apple trees that look out across still seas and Bathurst Island\u2019s Ten Mile beach. The tides here have advanced 40m to 50m in recent decades. The seas around the Tiwi Islands are home to mud crabs, fish and turtles, important sources of food for Tiwi people and a part of dreaming stories that connect them to the land and sea. In their dreaming, the rainbow serpent Ampiji protects sea country and will show itself as a warning if something is about to happen. Tiwi people say Ampiji showed itself at Front beach on Munupi country in 2018. They say if gas drilling and a pipeline that would come within 7km of the islands go ahead, Ampiji could be disconnected from areas it protects, making people vulnerable and interrupting the entire system they live by. \u201cWe believe that if anything is disturbed on land or sea, then there are repercussions,\u201d Pirrawayingi says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we believe earthquakes start, because they\u2019re drilling the land. And when they\u2019re drilling the land, they\u2019re drilling inside our body, because we are with the land. We are one.\u201d Court judgment a \u2018gamechanger\u2019 At the sport and rec shed, Santos representatives are making an effort. By any measure, the Barossa project is facing trouble. In addition to having its drilling approval overturned in court, Santos has been ordered to start underwater cultural surveys for its pipeline after a raid by the offshore petroleum regulator on the company\u2019s Adelaide offices in December established it had not done this work. Multiple other environmental and operational approvals are outstanding. In the period in which Santos was consulting Tiwi people, the federal parliament has also been debating amendments to the safeguard mechanism that are meant to limit emissions from industry. Weeks later, those amendments passed, setting the baseline for new gas projects at net zero, which some analysts say could make the Barossa gas field, with its 18% CO2 content, unviable. Santos says it plans to push ahead after taking a \u201cfinal investment decision in 2021 on this very important project for regional energy security and for the Northern Territory economy\u201d. A company spokesperson says gas from the project has already been sold on long-term contracts to customers in Japan and South Korea. They also said a proposed carbon capture and storage project in depleted gas reservoirs beneath the Timor Sea \u201cwill make Barossa and Darwin LNG one of the lowest-carbon LNG projects in the world\u201d. At the 22 March meeting, company representatives have brought visual materials at the request of Tiwi people. They begin by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here to seek your feedback, we take it very seriously.\u201d Any specific questions that they can\u2019t answer, they promise to respond to later. They tell the audience that Santos representatives will be a regular presence on the islands over the coming months and may approach people and ask them questions. Among the executives in the room are Santos\u2019s executive vice-president \u2013 eastern Australia, Brett Darley, and the vice-president of environment, health, safety, security access and Aboriginal engagement, Nick Fox. Also present is Richard Lilly from Allens, the legal firm that acted for the company in court. The difference between the company\u2019s behaviour in this meeting and its aggressive tactics during the 2022 legal battle is marked. During court proceedings, Santos cross-examined First Nations witnesses during an on-country hearing to try to cast doubt over their evidence about cultural and spiritual connections to sea country. At various turns, the company\u2019s litigation tried to diminish the interests of Tiwi people, even comparing their spiritual and cultural interest to a pastime or hobby. Alina Leikin, senior counsel at the Environmental Defenders Office, which acted for Tipakalippa, said the federal court judgment was a gamechanger for First Nations people and communities affected by offshore fossil fuel projects. \u201cBefore, mining companies could completely ignore and sideline First Nations people,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even give people the respect of informing them about projects on their doorstep that could have catastrophic consequences on their cultural practices and the way of life they have preserved for millennia. \u201cThe court dragged mining companies kicking and screaming to acknowledge and finally listen to First Nations people.\u201d Santos says it wants input Darley tells the meeting the company is there to be open and transparent and wants Tiwi people to have input into its plans. He invites audience members to take as many notes as they want, as Santos staff run through the potential effects of drilling and how Santos will manage them to be \u201cas low as reasonably practicable\u201d. Santos has prepared a series of videos to try to address concerns Tiwi people have raised about vessel collisions, the potential for drilling to cause a spill \u2013 which the company says is a remote risk \u2013 and the effects this would have on marine life. One video shows an interactive map demonstrating there is already a lot of shipping traffic in the region. People ask Santos to come back with another one showing what vessel movements would look like during the project\u2019s construction and operations. A second video explains that the project will be a source of natural gas for many years for things that are essential to Australia and the world. It includes an animation of a drilling pipe making its way past fish into the sea and notes there is a \u201csmall risk\u201d something could go wrong that affects the environment. A third video is a simulation of how a drilling platform would behave in a one-in-10,000-year storm event. The platform bobs up and down in a clear tank of water that Tiwi elder Therese Wokay Bourke tells the room \u201clooks like a bathtub\u201d and not rough seas. To demonstrate the width of the pipeline that would be laid to transport the gas, one of the executives holds up a hula hoop. A longer video features a narrator reading slabs of text listing potential risks \u2013 such as noise and light disturbance, toxic vehicle pollution and the introduction of invasive marine species \u2013 and the controls used to manage them. The video uses regulatory jargon, moves quickly and ends with \u201cwe are here to listen\u201d. At no point does Santos raise the impacts of greenhouse gas pollution. It says this will be dealt with at a later stage. Throughout, questions from the floor show the level of distrust in Santos\u2019s assurances that the environment and sea country will be protected. \u201cWhat about the dolphins that died in Western Australia?\u201d Wokay Bourke asks. Her question is in reference to a whistleblower statement tabled in parliament in February, by the independent senator David Pocock, that alleged the company had covered up the severity of a condensate spill from another project off the northern WA coast. One man wants to know if drilling will lead to increased seismic activity in the area. \u201cYou guys are just here to make everybody happy,\u201d he says. Community members unable to attend have given Tiwi representative and campaigner Antonia Burke a list of questions for Santos to take on notice: Who will clean up a spill if it occurs? Will Tiwi people be compensated if that happens? Will turtles, already under pressure from the climate crisis, be killed by ship movements? Will the project affect the marine food sources the community relies on? After people ask Santos to leave the meeting briefly so they can talk among themselves, Pirrawayingi tells the room: \u201cIt\u2019s about time we dictate how we want things done. \u201cBecause we did white fella way, now it\u2019s about time for them to call on what we want.\u201d \u2018Tiwi people are certain they will win\u2019 When Dennis Murphy Tipakalippa received the judgment in his case last year, he felt relief, like he was \u201con top of the world\u201d. Sitting under the shade of a bush apple tree on Front beach, he is talking about the life cycles of species around the islands. Birds that lay their eggs at Seagull Island each year and turtles that return again and again to the same nesting grounds. There are camping and hunting spots used by Tiwi families over generations. There are things \u201cin the sea that we get to eat over hundreds of years\u201d. He says there are sites under water that represent intangible spiritual heritage. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to go ahead,\u201d he says of the development. Wokay Bourke says it\u2019s obvious that Tiwi people are very concerned but she questions what Santos will do about that. \u201cMaybe they understand it but I don\u2019t think they give a shit,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of [the meetings] really, because it feels like they still want to go ahead and do it regardless of how we feel.\u201d Leikin says without a legislated requirement for First Nations people to give free, prior and informed consent for a project, Tiwi people have to fight a battle with Santos rather than simply being able to say no. \u201cTiwi people are certain they will win, one way or the other,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are confident that when Santos and the regulator hear and appreciate the depth of Tiwi spiritual connection to sea country and the irreparable harm the project will cause that the project will not proceed.\u201d Two days before Santos\u2019 annual general meeting in April, traditional owners lodged human rights complaints against 12 banks for their involvement in the Barossa project. Tiwi people and Gomeroi people, who are fighting Santos\u2019s Narrabri gas project in New South Wales, attended the meeting to ask questions. A further human rights complaint, against superannuation funds, was lodged a few weeks later. Last week Santos concluded its consultation meetings about the drilling, but meetings about other aspects of the project, including underwater cultural heritage, continue. The company has developed a handout in response to questions raised during the meetings, including on the key concern of how a spill would be dealt with. It reiterates that the company considers the risk of a worst-case scenario spill to be \u201cextremely low\u201d but gives an undertaking that Santos would call Tiwi Resources, which is owned by the clan groups, within eight hours of any event. It also says it will train Tiwi rangers in rapid spill assessment response. Santos has provided a photo of what a spill assessment kit looks like \u2013 a box with personal protective equipment, nets for collecting dead marine life and bottles for sampling. A company spokesperson says Santos has published detailed information about the project and responses to frequently asked questions on its website. They say Santos also advertised extensively across Australia to provide ample opportunity for any relevant people to be consulted. \u201cWe have applied many of our onshore processes for consultation and we are confident that this will lead to enduring partnerships with Tiwi Island people,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have taken on board feedback from Tiwi Islanders about how they want to be consulted, including in clan meetings on country, with the use of more maps, visual information and videos, with interpreters present and so on. \u201cSantos has provided extensive information about the very low potential for spills, their potential impacts and spill response processes.\u201d But Antonia Burke says at every juncture it has been Tiwi people who have had to push for more information. Despite the effect of the court case, she says the consultations have focused on the technical and regulatory aspects of the proposal and have failed to properly grapple with cultural heritage and the connection Tiwi people have to their country. \u201c[Santos] never consider or talk about cultural heritage, human rights and spiritual connection to land and sea country,\u201d she says. Santos\u2019s spokesperson says the company \u201chas listened respectfully to all the concerns Tiwi people have raised, including in relation to cultural heritage and connection to country\u201d. Pirrawayingi says he wants people to understand \u201cwhat it\u2019s like being an Aboriginal person connected to the sea and the land\u201d.

Day\u2019s death led to her daughter Apryl Day campaigning to stop black deaths in custody and start the national Dhadjowa Foundation to support and advocate for families whose loved ones have died in custody. Day said she felt the database reduces her mother to a faceless number. \u201cThey are putting my mum and our loved ones into a database and dehumanising them and making them another statistic which is what we actively try not to do when campaigning and advocating for our loved ones. \u201cThey are extracting information and putting all of our pain and our heartache and my mum\u2019s life and legacy that she left behind into just another number on a database.\u201d She said the government had failed to consult with families or her organisation about the database saying it was a missed opportunity to work with families directly impacted. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even consulted us about the database, let alone consulted us about including our loved one within this number.\u201d Day is urging states and territories to address systemic racism and incarceration contributing to deaths in custody, such as racial profiling and racism in healthcare, homelessness and closing youth detention centres. Guardian Australia examined every Indigenous death in custody from 2008 to 2021, but the numbers tell only part of the story. Reading more than 500 coronial reports, Guardian Australia found an ongoing record of systemic failure. The database continues to be updated. Previously the number of Aboriginal people dying in custody since 1991, the year of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, was unknown. The National Indigenous Australians agency told Senate estimates in March 2021 it relied on media reports, and the Australian criminal institute agreed to increase their reporting from annually to quarterly. Under pressure from this project, the government committed to a real-time database \u2013 one of the recommendations of the 1991 royal commission. A spokesperson from the Attorney General\u2019s office said that real time reporting was an election commitment as well as a key recommendation from the royal commission. The government said its committed to addressing the underlying causes contributing to the over-representation of Indigenous people in the justice system and is investing $81.5m to support community-led justice reinvestment programs in 30 communities."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fde", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/kenya-plantation-deaths-families-fight-for-answers-del-monte", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018They don\u2019t value life\u2019: families fight for answers over Kenya plantation deaths", "lead": "Del Monte launches investigation after guards at huge pineapple farm are alleged to have killed three men in the last four years, leaving relatives distraught", "author": "Emily Dugan, Edwin Okoth and Matthew Chapman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:00:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224289", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf23ebf7c1a0ed5a4d4754d54359d857e30d27ec/0_126_6240_3744/500.jpg", "body": "Ever since her son\u2019s battered body was found on the roadside by Del Monte\u2019s Kenyan pineapple farm last summer, Grace Mbinya has been trying to block out what happened to him. She has deleted images of him from her phone, hidden his only framed photo and avoids tending to her garden where his grave lies. Stephen Thuo Nyoike, then 22, had gone with friends to the plantation near Thika to steal ripe pineapples on the evening of 30 August. The next day, his body was discovered face down in the red dirt by a road next to the farm, his forehead caved in and his throat strangled with a wire. Stephen was an apprentice welder and had promised his mother he would one day buy the family a better home. She remembers him as thoughtful and kind \u2013 her last memory was of him planting yams and cooking her a dinner of ugali, greens and tea two nights before he died. \u201cI just want justice for my son,\u201d she said, sitting in the dark front room where they last sat together. \u201cThey should have just arrested and jailed him \u2026 where he is now, I can never see him and I will never see his children.\u201d Stephen is one of three men whom Del Monte security guards are alleged to have killed in the last four years. A joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) has uncovered claims of violence by guards at the plantation over a number of years. The global fruit company is taking the allegations \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and carrying out a \u201cfull and urgent investigation\u201d into them. Less than an hour after leaving Nairobi on the main road heading north, you enter Del Monte country. It is estimated that the company\u2019s plantation near Thika covers more than 40 sq km, stretching across two counties with space for a factory, public roads, schools and a police station. Its size means people living in the villages and towns around it often travel through the farm on public roads. Poverty and unemployment are rife in the area, despite the plantation being the single largest exporter of Kenyan produce to the world. Organised pineapple theft by groups of young men is common. Patrolling the fields behind the cheerfully painted red, yellow and green Del Monte signs are teams of khaki-clad security guards armed with long wooden clubs called rungus. While their use in security is legal in Kenya, the alleged behaviour suggests the use of violence has been excessive. One of the last people who says he saw Stephen alive is a man who went with him to the farm on the night of 30 August to steal pineapples. The man said it was their second raid of the evening and they were carrying bundles through the field when they heard a sack of pineapples fall to the floor. \u201cI looked back and saw the guards with torches. I heard a harsh voice shouting: \u2018Catch! Catch! Kill!\u2019,\u201d he said. On hearing the guards, the men ran. Stephen\u2019s friend claimed he found a bush to hide in and watched as about eight guards in green uniforms allegedly beat Stephen with rungus. He claimed that after about half an hour of beating, Stephen stopped shouting and his motionless body was carried into a Del Monte vehicle. He said he waited while the guards were inside before he saw the vehicle drive towards the main road. He has never spoken publicly about what he saw and claims he was too afraid to go to the police because he had been stealing. \u201cIf you go and report to the police, you\u2019d be arrested immediately,\u201d he said. Stephen\u2019s body was found by the highway the next day. His father, Joel Thuo, reported his death to police after going to identify his lifeless son. A postmortem gave his cause of death as \u201cpressure to the neck due to ligature strangulation\u201d and \u201chead injury due to blunt force trauma to the head\u201d. He said police did little to pursue the case. \u201cOnce I reported it to the police, they came to the scene, took pictures, did all the analysis and then took the body to the morgue.\u201d He said he was not aware of \u201cany other follow-up done by the police in terms of investigations\u201d. Joel said that when he tried to follow up, \u201call they [police] would tell me is to go and produce evidence. And for me, there is no evidence that I could give. Because my son was killed in the small hours of the morning and the ones whom he was with, they are not willing to cooperate to give that evidence.\u201d A senior police officer could not explain why, eight months on, there had been no investigation into Stephen\u2019s death. Joel wants Del Monte to act. Speaking about the guards he believed attacked his son, he said: \u201cThey don\u2019t value life. What they value most is pineapples.\u201d *** When pineapples are for sale on the roadside in Murang\u2019a county, locals say it is safe to assume they were stolen from Del Monte. The farm has few obvious fences and entrenched poverty in the surrounding community makes the temptation to pick their fruit high. A group of young men selling pineapples on the main road near a long stretch of unfenced Del Monte fields chuckled knowingly when asked where they got them. They did not take long to admit their provenance. Some of the pineapple theft is organised: men travel into the farm in groups to fill sacks with pineapples and carry their plunder out by motorbikes. Another group of men were frank about pineapple theft being their main source of income. Some were orphans who have been sneaking on to the farm to take the fruits from the age of eight, selling them individually for less than 30p so they could buy food. A former gang leader in his 30s who called himself Master said that sometimes groups of more than 20 men would go to the farm and throw stones at guards if they tried to stop them. Master said he no longer raided the farm but when asked why he had, he said: \u201cI went there because of poverty and to get a means of survival.\u201d *** Aside from clashes between security and young thieves, Del Monte\u2019s guards have also been accused of indiscriminate violence. When a minibus carrying 14 people home from a dowry party stopped on a road through the farm on the evening of 25 September 2021, its passengers were set upon by guards, according to three who spoke to the Guardian. The passengers claimed their driver had stopped to mend a headlight and that the group had got out to use the toilet when guards emerged from the fields and started beating them with rungus. The three passengers said they were all dressed in their best party clothes and described guards hitting those in the group so hard that one was left with a broken leg. They alleged all the adults onboard were beaten and that they only stopped when they continued to scream they were not thieves. One of the passengers, a 50-year-old man who said his leg was broken in the incident, said: \u201cI tried to plead with them. I told them we were not there to steal pineapples. We were coming from the dowry party and our vehicle became faulty, that is why we had stopped. And at that point, they left.\u201d He said he felt the guards \u201cjust walked casually\u201d back into the fields after leaving them injured. \u201cI think they realised they had mistaken us because we didn\u2019t have any sacks with us and were dressed very smartly,\u201d he said. The man alleged he was so badly injured he had to be carried back into the bus and was unable to work for seven months. The incident was reported to police, but he claimed it was not investigated further. *** John Rui Karia, 52, was a former casual worker for Del Monte who scraped together a living selling long grass to passersby on the bank of a highway that backs on to one of the farm\u2019s pineapple fields. John died in December in circumstances that are under investigation by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. On the evening of 21 December, John was resting in his usual roadside spot alongside another man when Del Monte guards walked up and began beating them, people told the Guardian. They claimed the guards had been drinking and that the attack was unprovoked. Boniface Nduva, 34, was working on the opposite side of the road digging sand and loading it on to trucks when he alleged he saw Del Monte guards beating the men before putting them in a car. \u201cWe ran to help but the guards were faster,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [the alleged victims] were sleeping opposite Del Monte. They were not stealing. They were at work all day and were just tired, sleeping.\u201d Fellow grass seller Dennis Mutiso, 40, said he was sitting at the roadside nearby when he saw Del Monte guards approach the two men. Speaking at the spot where he alleged John was attacked, Mutiso said they \u201cstarted beating them and then the old man, Rui, started screaming. When I heard that I ran away and then I heard them being loaded into the Del Monte car. They were being stamped on when they were inside the car.\u201d He and the other man were then taken to Del Monte\u2019s office, where they were allegedly beaten further, along with a third man. From there they were taken with pineapples to Ngoliba police station and charged with pineapple theft. The next day they were taken to court in a Del Monte vehicle and convicted of pineapple theft after pleading guilty. Two men claimed John was so incapacitated by the previous night\u2019s assault that he had to be carried out of Del Monte\u2019s car to get into court. One alleged he saw him vomiting blood. John was sent to Thika prison on remand and died a week after his arrest, on 28 December. According to a document from a doctor at Thika hospital, he was pronounced dead on arrival that day having \u201ccollapsed in the prison\u201d with a \u201chistory of trauma about 1 week ago\u201d. A pathology report from the hospital seen by the Guardian gives the cause of death as \u201chead injury due to multiple blunt force trauma to the head\u201d with \u201cabdominal and multiple soft tissue injuries\u201d. *** When 26-year-old Bernard Murigi Wanginye was suspected of being beaten to death by Del Monte security guards in 2019, his father, Gilbert, was so determined to get justice that he took the case all the way to the inspector general in Nairobi, the country\u2019s most senior police officer. Five Del Monte guards, who were arrested on suspicion of murder that summer and immediately sacked by Del Monte, are still in custody. The former guards all pleaded not guilty. Four years on, there has still been no trial. Gilbert, 70, described his uphill battle for justice. Speaking outside the simple tin-roofed home in Kihiu Mwiri that Bernard built for the family, Gilbert clutched a pink A4 folder with the precious documents that helped secure the arrests. His son\u2019s body was lying a few metres away, buried beneath a mango tree. Bernard was the second youngest of Gilbert\u2019s seven children, and worked cutting stones in a quarry within the Del Monte farm. \u201cWhenever he used to work at the quarry he used to support us very much,\u201d Gilbert said, adding that they never went without food while he worked there. \u201cHe was a very obedient boy who used to assist us very much,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWhenever I remember my son I really get down.\u201d Work at the quarry was relentless and badly paid but a sack of pineapples picked from the farm was a quick way to make 1,500 shillings \u2013 about \u00a38 \u2013 once a motorbike driver was paid his share. Bernard died after going with friends to the farm on the night of 20 April 2019 to steal fruit. When Gilbert went to the morgue to identify his son, he was so appalled by his condition that he fainted. He said Bernard\u2019s body was naked and encrusted in earth, with horrific injuries. Bernard\u2019s mother, Alice Wambui, took one look and left the room. \u201cHis head was badly damaged and I could not look for long. I just walked out,\u201d she said. Alice, 67, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no justice at all for Bernard.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m urging the people out there to please assist us to get justice for our sons and not buy products from Del Monte until they resolve all the pending issues from the locals.\u201d It is understood that Del Monte says it has planned or implemented improvements including updated radio communications systems, training guards in new formal rules of engagement and enhancing formal processes around allegations of violence. A spokesperson for Del Monte said: \u201cWe take these allegations extremely seriously and have instituted a full and urgent investigation into them. The conduct alleged in these cases is in clear violation of Fresh Del Monte\u2019s longstanding commitment to human rights and the comprehensive policies and procedures we have in place to ensure our operations respect the dignity of all individuals. \u201cOur proactive investigations continue and will be supported by an independent review by a specialist human rights consultancy. We continue to fully support the Kenyan authorities\u2019 investigations, including into the death of John Rui Karia. We are committed to constant improvements in the way we operate to adhere to the highest international human rights standards in all our businesses.\u201d The Kenya police service did not respond to requests for comment."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fdf", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2023/jun/22/yes-australias-gender-pay-gap-is-closing-but-todays-working-women-will-retire-before-it-is-fixed", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Yes, Australia\u2019s gender pay gap is closing.

The bad news is it is happening so slowly that most people working today will be long retired by the time the gap is closed. The latest annual taxation statistics provide a wealth of data about occupation, from who is doing them to who is getting paid the most and least. The data covers 2020-21 and so it is not surprising the occupation that suffered the most was air transport professionals. While the total number employed fell 3%, the average salary of the 14,719 individuals in this sector fell 18%. The next biggest salary decline came for travel advisers \u2013 down 15%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup At the other end of the scale, crop farm workers saw their average salary rise 19%, although they remained one of the lowest paid occupations with an average salary of just $31,164. The very highly paid financial dealers had a great 2020-21 \u2013 with their pay rising 25% to $298,228. For a number of years now I have been using the taxation statistics to highlight gender pay gaps. Hourly rates of pay sound wonderful but if there are two people on $35 an hour and one has just one eight-hour shift a week and the other is full-time, no one thinks they are earning the same amount. The taxation statistics thus reveal the combination of both hourly rates but also who is getting the hours. In March, on International Women\u2019s Day, I noted that in 2019-20 men had a higher average salary in the most male dominated occupation of plumber (technically \u201cconstruction worker \u2013 plumber \u2013 general\u201d) and the most women-dominated occupation of midwife. In 2020-21, that situation remained. Among midwives, the gender pay gap closed just slightly \u2013 from 23.4% to 23.3%. For plumbers the pay gap widened \u2013 out to 35.7%, from 32.5% in 2019-20. If the graph does not display click here. Once again, these extremes are not the exception. In 95% of the 1,025 occupations with at least 50 or more workers, men had a higher average salary \u2013 from the 92 women tennis players with an average salary of $4,276 to the 1,336 male diagnostic and interventional radiologists on an average salary of $421,560. If the graph does not display click here. Worse still, across the 281 occupations in which women make up more than 60% of all workers, men have a higher average salary in 246 (88%): If the graph does not display click here This, as I have reported in previous years, is nothing new. But now we have had five years of occupation data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), we can look for signs of improvements. Alas, across the five years, there has been little change in the percent of occupations that have higher average salaries for men: If the graph does not display click here The greatest disparity lies with the highest-paying occupations. Among the Top 200 paying occupations in 2020-21, only three had women with a higher average salary: magistrates, neurosurgeons and chemical or material engineer consultants. This reflects the overall share of income. Women made up 47% of all taxpayers in 2020-21 but were overrepresented in the bottom five income deciles, and they accounted for just 29% of the richest 10% of taxpayers: If the graph does not display click here It is not all bad news on the gender pay front, but finding the bright spots does take some looking. Among sports players, we do see some signs of the increasing professionalism leading to a shrinking of the gender pay gap. In 2016-17 women made up just 21% of all professional cricketers, and the pay gap was 82%. By 2020-21 women made up 31% of all cricketers getting paid to play and the pay gap was down to 51%. Yes, men still had an average salary double that of women, but women\u2019s average salary had risen from $38,654 in 2016-17 to $101,092 in 2020-21. And in that same period the number of women professionally playing cricket had risen from 66 to 111. If the graph does not display click here Unfortunately, the solution of getting more women in an occupation does not always work. The share of gynaecologists who are women rose from 51% to 57% and yet the gender pay gap increased: If the graph does not display click here Among journalists, the situation is more clear. For a long time it has been a profession with more women than men, but one where men have had higher average salaries. But the gap is closing, slowly, yes; but definitely closing: If the graph does not display click here But the good news is tempered by the reality that fewer people now work in the profession \u2013 down 6% since 2016-17. The gender pay gap of journalists closely reflects the overall picture. While the number of occupations in which men are higher paid has hardly changed, the average gender gap within all occupations is slowly falling: If the graph does not display click here In 2016-17 the average pay gap was 21.5%. It has now fallen to 19.4%, which is good. Yet at this rate the gender pay gap will not be fully closed until 2056. It is closing, but there is little sign it is closing faster than in the past.

Our real estate agent told us we have a \u201cchange of arrangement\u201d \u2013 from tomorrow tenants are fully responsible for garbage bins (collection day, removal in and out kerbside, cleaning of bins). They assigned bins for each unit. I\u2019ve been renting in different buildings in New South Wales and this is always the manager\u2019s responsibility (unless it\u2019s a stand-alone house/townhouse). Can I consider this a breach of my lease contract? Is it legal to make a change to a lease like this? Firstly, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had an unexpected change made to your living arrangement. You\u2019re absolutely right to question whether the agent can make this unilateral change on the landlord\u2019s behalf without notice. I haven\u2019t seen your particular rental agreement but the NSW Fair Trading standard form residential tenancy agreement does not include anything express about responsibility for garbage bins \u2013 the same goes for standard residential tenancy agreements in Queensland and Victoria. As a first step, you should review your rental agreement and confirm that additional terms have been included which state the landlord is responsible for taking out and bringing in the bins on collection day, and cleaning of the bins. If this term is included, check also if there are any provisions in your agreement that would allow the landlord to change an additional term without notice or by consensus with you as the tenant. If you do have the additional term in your rental agreement and no provision for the landlord to change it, you should seek legal advice about whether the landlord could be in breach of their contract. Without being able to see your lease agreement, it\u2019s unclear whether this is the case or not. Complicating things further, if your landlord (or agent on the landlord\u2019s behalf) made a verbal undertaking to have responsibility for the bins, this is also considered binding but might be harder to prove if you end up in front of a tribunal. In the case that there was an additional term in your tenancy agreement about the bins, and the landlord has made a change to the agreement that is not allowed by the agreement, you can contest this with the agent. If you choose this route, in the first instance, you should make an appeal to your estate agent in writing, stating the terms of your agreement and that you believe they have been breached. Also state the remedy you\u2019re looking for \u2013 which I assume is for the status quo, with the landlord responsible for the bins, to continue. If you don\u2019t get anywhere with the agent yourself, you can contact Tenants Advice and Advocacy Services in NSW, which will be able to provide you with further advice and assistance. You can also seek independent legal advice if you are willing to challenge your agent or landlord in a court or tribunal \u2013 but ultimately that will be costly, time-consuming and stressful, and it\u2019s unclear what the result might be. In other states, you can contact similar organisations, such as Tenants Victoria or Tenants Queensland. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t have additional terms in your contract regarding the bins, the residential tenancies legislation in NSW does require that the landlord must provide you with reasonable repairs and maintenance. Legislation in other states including Victoria and Queensland has similar provisions. In Victoria this includes that property is \u201cmaintained in good repair and is in a reasonably fit and suitable condition for occupation\u201d, while Queensland has a list of minimum standards for rental housing. But it\u2019s unlikely this would include taking out or bringing in bins as part of a weekly routine. Tenants are responsible for minor maintenance, which NSW Fair Trading describes as things such as \u201creplacing light bulbs, cleaning windows, dusting, removing cobwebs and routine garden maintenance such as watering, mowing and weeding\u201d. Applying a pub test, it seems likely that taking the bins out and bringing them in once a week would fall under the minor maintenance category. Similarly, it doesn\u2019t seem as though bins would fall under the definitions for \u201cgood repair\u201d in Victoria, or the minimum standards in Queensland. The outcome of your situation will hinge on the particular terms of your tenancy agreement and, unfortunately, unless there\u2019s an express additional term that\u2019s been explicitly breached, you might be taking out your own bins from now on. *** Ask Kat a question Do you have an Australian consumer issue you\u2019d like Kat\u2019s advice on?

Problems upgrading a crucial reporting system have left MP travel expenses unchecked for almost a year and this is likely to continue until mid-2024, the documents reveal. It has prevented public scrutiny of MP expenses with Australians blind to how their politicians are spending taxpayer money on hotels, flights, and office and employee costs. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup This means the most recent data on MP expenses available to the public is almost 12 months old. The new reporting system is expected to come online in mid-2023. But freedom of information documents suggest significant further delays before a return to full transparency. The lack of a functioning reporting system means the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea) has been unable to fully process MPs\u2019 travel and office expense claims since July. That has created a backlog of 12 months\u2019 worth of expense claims that can only be reviewed once the new system comes online. Internal documents show Ipea expects it will take until mid-2024 to work through the backlog on what it describes as a \u201crolling schedule\u201d. Blocks of expense claims from the backlog will need to be compiled into reports by Ipea and sent to MPs for review, before they can be released to the public periodically between mid-2023 and mid-2024. MPs will be given two weeks to review each expenditure report and a one-week break until the next one is sent. For the public, it means yet more delays to accountability and transparency over MPs\u2019 travel claims. It is likely to create a lag of roughly 12 months between an MP making an expense claim and it being disclosed publicly. The special minister of state, Don Farrell, said the current lack of transparency \u201cshould never have occurred\u201d, blaming the former government\u2019s botching of the system upgrade project. Farrell said he had consistently raised concerns over the former Coalition government\u2019s failure to upgrade the system \u2013 known as the parliamentary expense management system (Pems) \u2013 while in opposition. \u201cTo be clear, this should never have occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cLabor has raised multiple concerns over successive years with Pems, including repeated questioning at Senate estimates since the project\u2019s commencement.\u201d \u201cIn November, I wrote to the auditor general requesting a full audit of the project, including its implementation and high cost. I am glad the auditor general has accepted my suggestion, and an audit is now under way.\u201d An Ipea spokesperson said it expected to be able to begin work on the backlog in the \u201csecond half of 2023\u201d. It aimed to publish expenditure reports for 2022-23 periodically through to mid-2024. \u201cThe regular cycle will then continue,\u201d the spokesperson said. The expenses reports released by Ipea promote political integrity, transparency and accountability. They have helped to expose a string of expense scandals. In 2020, Guardian Australia used the reports to reveal that cabinet ministers, the then Labor opposition, and Pauline Hanson had all billed taxpayers to travel the country for political party fundraising events. A review in 2016 recommended against any lag in reporting MP expense claims. It said expense claims should be disclosed to the public every quarter at first, and monthly once an upgraded system was ready. In 2013, the Department of Finance warned any reporting lag would leave Australia behind the rest of the developed world. The department advised the then government that reducing the \u201creporting lag would improve the transparency\u201d of the system and bring it into line with countries such as the UK, France and the US. In those countries, \u201creporting lags have been reduced to less than one month\u201d, it said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fe2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/cricket-pat-cummins-answers-critics-with-one-of-great-ashes-captain-displays", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Pat Cummins answers critics with one of greatest Ashes captain displays", "lead": "Hounded by sections of the media for political correctness, Australia\u2019s leader made vital contributions with bat and ball", "author": "Geoff Lemon", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:00:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224361", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/365ad6aa968f3c7b9e0cc9b85fa90263f72b6be1/0_139_3248_1948/500.jpg", "body": "In the moment after striking the winning boundary at Edgbaston, Pat Cummins looked to have taken his celebration cues from Usman Khawaja. Charging down the pitch for a second run that became obsolete as the ball ricocheted into the rope, he embarked on the turning circle of a semi-trailer back towards Nathan Lyon at the far end and started throwing his gear away as he went. Bat? Didn\u2019t need that any more. Bear hug? That was far more pressing. It was emotion bursting out in its purest form, something instinctive. \u201cI can\u2019t really remember any of it, to be honest,\u201d he told BBC radio, eyes and mind and limbic system still adjusting after the adrenaline bath of those final overs. On one part, though, he was very clear. \u201cNever thought of a draw,\u201d he said about the over when he clubbed two sixes off Joe Root, dynamiting the target down to 37, making the chase seem possible again after Alex Carey\u2019s wicket. If there was intensity in the finish, there was a tempering of it through most of the lead-up. As the partnership with Lyon came through its dicey early stages and solidified, Cummins kept flashing a smile at his longtime teammate, reassuring him with word and gesture, making it seem like this spectacle that had its onlookers in agony could be fun in the middle of the crucible. Perhaps it was. The people waiting outside the lion\u2019s den may have spent a more anxious night than Daniel. As captain, Cummins has been all about equanimity. After Australia had been smashed by India in Nagpur in February he was as breezy as possible, speaking of disappointment, but also enjoyment at a challenge to take on. After the next defeat in Delhi, he wasn\u2019t there, already heading to the airport to get home to his family. We didn\u2019t know at that point that his mind was on matters of life and death, as per the recurring reminder that the peaks and troughs of existence give perspective on the insignificance of sporting results. Cummins was living that contrast and no doubt still is. But that perspective seems to be something innate to him to begin with, not something that was a recent lesson learned. Even before the need to balance personal grief with a sporting task of such pressure and profile, Cummins has not had it easy at the top. He came into the job with no notice as his popular predecessor, Tim Paine, made an unexpected and undignified exit, then found he had a target pinned to him as the head coach, Justin Langer, followed suit. Cummins had been in the job a matter of weeks, but Langer\u2019s exit that had been brewing for more than a year was squarely blamed on him. Given Langer has supporters at the extreme fringe of Australia\u2019s media, what followed was the painfully simplistic mental positioning of old-school cliches about the virtues of toughness versus a supposedly soft modern\u2011day approach. In short, because Cummins has lent his voice to addressing the climate crisis and suggested shouting at players is not a great motivator these people on the sidelines said he didn\u2019t fit into the stereotype of Australian masculinity. In that lane of thought, where correlation and causation are one and the same, any results that followed were put down to this. Beating West Indies and South Africa at home? Didn\u2019t count, they were no good. Beating Pakistan or Sri Lanka away? Just wait, all this political correctness will bring them down at some stage. Two Tests lost in India. Ha. There it is. Would never have happened under Langer, the man who coached two series defeats against India, at home. Bouncing back to win and draw the next two in India? Let\u2019s not mention that. A few months on, over the past week at Edgbaston, here was Cummins again. Being whacked for being too soft after he set defensive fields to counter England\u2019s inevitable opening blast. Not taking a wicket in the first innings, either. Coming out to bat after a poor few years, averaging 11 since early 2019. In that second innings of the match he made a vital 38, taking Australia almost to parity when they might have fallen short. In the third, he took four for 63, the first wicket opening the door on night three, searing through Ollie Pope with the perfect yorker on morning four, taking out Ben Stokes when the opposing captain was set to take the game away, and wrapping up an annoying last-wicket partnership. He said before the match that he usually bowls at 95% pace for more control, but that yorker especially looked the full three figures. His final act required everything. Courage, calm, concentration, the heart to take on the game when he could have gone safety first, knowing that escaping the hole they were in would not be helped by more digging. Punching his fist in solidarity at the yellow-clad Australian spectators, quieting the seething Hollies Stand. In one of the great performances by an Ashes captain, there was one moment to roar and many either side of that to smile."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fe3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/guards-at-del-monte-pineapple-farm-accused-of-killings-in-kenya", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Guards at Del Monte pineapple farm in Kenya accused of killings", "lead": "Exclusive: Investigation uncovers villagers\u2019 claims of violence at farm that is single largest exporter of Kenyan produce to the world", "author": "Emily Dugan, Edwin Okoth and Matthew Chapman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:00:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224381", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/187a3b1304a62d8ee00ba61015ad602ab69c42c3/0_320_6132_3679/500.jpg", "body": "Security guards at a Del Monte pineapple farm in Kenya that supplies most British supermarkets have been accused of brutally assaulting and killing people suspected of trespassing on its land. A joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) has uncovered claims from villagers of violence by guards at the plantation in the last four years. The vast plantation, which is estimated to cover at least 40 sq km, the area of a small city, is about an hour\u2019s drive from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The farm has public roads going through it and directly employs 237 security guards. Guards on the farm are typically armed with wooden clubs called rungus. Their use in security is legal and common in Kenya because of the risk of violent theft, including from young men who regularly go in organised groups to steal pineapples, but the claims suggest the guards\u2019 use of violence has been excessive. The scale of theft has resulted in clashes with guards, who have themselves been injured, including one reportedly losing an eye after a stone was thrown by a thief. The claims of violence by Del Monte security guards over a number of years raise serious questions about the company\u2019s processes and due diligence at the farm. Del Monte said it took the allegations \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and has launched a \u201cfull and urgent\u201d investigation into the claims. It said it is committed to international standards of human rights. The farm, outside Thika, is the single largest exporter of Kenyan produce to the world, including the supply of tinned and fresh pineapple to supermarkets in the UK and elsewhere. Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Ocado and Morrisons are among the supermarkets that stock its fruit. Tesco said it had suspended orders on all products sourced from the farm until an investigation is concluded. Mary Kambo, a programme manager at the Kenya Human Rights Commission, which says it has received multiple claims of violence at the plantation, said: \u201cThere has been real misery that is caused by this farm to local community members \u2026 It\u2019s important that someone who is buying these pineapples knows about the allegations of violence connected to the farm.\u201d The Guardian and TBIJ investigated four deaths allegedly linked to Del Monte security guards: John Rui Karia, 52, died having collapsed in prison last December of injuries. Four people allege he sustained the injuries a week earlier after allegedly being beaten and stamped on by Del Monte guards. He pleaded guilty to pineapple theft but witnesses claim he was resting by the roadside where he sold grass when drunk guards set upon him. Two people alleged he was unable to stand the next day and one of them said he saw him vomiting blood. A pathology report from Thika hospital, seen by the Guardian, gives the cause of death as \u201chead injury due to multiple blunt force trauma to the head\u201d with \u201cabdominal and multiple soft tissue injuries\u201d. A document from another doctor at Thika hospital says Karia was pronounced dead on arrival having \u201ccollapsed in the prison\u201d with a \u201chistory of trauma about 1 week ago\u201d. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights is investigating his death. Stephen Thuo Nyoike, 22, was found dead on the road running alongside Del Monte\u2019s farm with his neck cut with a wire after going to steal pineapples on 30 August last year. A postmortem gives the cause of death as \u201cpressure to the neck due to ligature strangulation\u201d and \u201chead injury due to blunt force trauma to the head\u201d. Two individuals claimed he was last seen being beaten by Del Monte guards on the farm. One of the two alleged they watched from a bush as he was then carried motionless into the guards\u2019 Land Cruiser. Five Del Monte guards have been charged over the death of Bernard Murigi Wanginye, 26, who was allegedly beaten to death on the farm in 2019, according to court records. His body was found on the roadside after he went with a group of young men to steal pineapples. The five guards have been in prison awaiting trial for nearly four years, with no date yet set. Guards have also been accused of brutality dating back to 2013. The body of Saidi Ngotho Ndungu, 27, was found in Del Monte\u2019s dam a decade ago. Two friends said they were with Ndungu and were caught trespassing on the farm. A witness statement given to Kabati police station two days after the body was found claimed guards beat Ndungu with wooden clubs and that he was heard pleading with them not to kill him. The witness said they then heard something being thrown into the dam, according to the statement. Another witness, who also gave a police statement, told the Guardian he last saw Ndungu being beaten by Del Monte guards after they had chased the three of them through the farm. His death certificate gives drowning as the cause. A law firm, Leigh Day, has written to Del Monte on behalf of 134 villagers living near the farm seeking compensation for \u201cserious human rights abuses\u201d allegedly carried out by security staff deployed on the pineapple plantation over the past decade. The letter includes claims of five deaths, including the deaths of Karia, Nyoike and Wanginye, as well as five rapes, plus allegations of serious injuries, including head wounds, broken bones and cuts from blades requiring stitches since 2013. Some alleged victims say they were indiscriminately attacked by guards while travelling on public roads through or near Del Monte land. Passengers travelling by minibus returning from a dowry party on 25 September 2021 allege that they were set upon by guards when it broke down on a public road through the farm. Three of the 14 passengers spoke to the Guardian about the incident, claiming the group were beaten by Del Monte guards with rungus. Records show the alleged attack was reported to police as being by Del Monte guards and hospital documents record injuries including one of the passengers breaking his leg. Local police are accused of turning a blind eye to the incident. One of the minibus passengers, a 50-year-old man who said he was unable to work for seven months after his leg was broken, said it was reported to police but never investigated further. \u201cThey don\u2019t like following up on justice. They only give you [a form to fill out] and that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. A senior local police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described a Del Monte guard losing an eye after having a stone thrown at him by pineapple thieves. The source alleged guards \u201cuse excessive force\u201d, adding: \u201cYou are not supposed to beat somebody.\u201d Alice Wambui, 67, lost her son Bernard Murigi, a labourer who worked in a quarry within the farm, in 2019. Five of the farm\u2019s guards were charged with his murder. They were sacked by Del Monte but four years on there is still no sign of a trial. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s no justice at all for Bernard.\u201d It is understood that Del Monte says it has improved its security and safety practices since Wanginye\u2019s death in 2019. Planned or implemented improvements are said to include updated radio communications systems, training guards in new formal rules of engagement and enhanced formal processes around allegations of violence. Leigh Day partner Richard Meeran, who represents the villagers seeking compensation, said: \u201cOur clients\u2019 allegations of human rights abuses perpetrated by Del Monte\u2019s security guards in Kenya entail a level and pattern of violence, brutality and humiliation that is widespread and gut-wrenching. It is right that these allegations, and Del Monte\u2019s responsibility for them, are tested in court.\u201d A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe are shocked and appalled to learn of these allegations on Del Monte\u2019s Thika farm in Kenya. We have therefore taken the decision to immediately suspend Del Monte fruit products sourced from this farm pending a thorough and credible investigation into these claims. \u201cAny form of human rights abuse is clearly unacceptable and we expect our suppliers to protect the welfare of everyone working in our supply chains, as well as respecting the human rights of the communities in which they operate.\u201d Waitrose said it expected all its suppliers to comply with its strict ethical standards and was liaising closely with Del Monte to determine what actions it has been taking. It welcomed the company\u2019s commissioning of an independent review to investigate the allegations. Sophie de Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, which represents UK supermarkets, said: \u201cWe welcome Del Monte\u2019s investigation into these appalling allegations to delve deeper into the broader context of these crimes and commitment to constant improvements in working practices. Protecting the welfare of workers and respecting communities in supply chains is fundamental to our members\u2019 sourcing practices and any practices falling short of our high standards are not tolerated.\u201d A spokesperson for Fresh Del Monte said: \u201cWe take these allegations extremely seriously and have instituted a full and urgent investigation into them. The conduct alleged in these cases is in clear violation of Fresh Del Monte\u2019s longstanding commitment to human rights and the comprehensive policies and procedures we have in place to ensure our operations respect the dignity of all individuals. \u201cOur proactive investigations continue and will be supported by an independent review by a specialist human rights consultancy. We continue to fully support the Kenyan authorities\u2019 investigations, including into the death of John Rui Karia. We are committed to constant improvements in the way we operate to adhere to the highest international human rights standards in all our businesses.\u201d The Kenya police service did not respond to requests for comment."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fe4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/22/dont-let-big-air-fryer-fool-you-six-everyday-oven-cooking-hacks", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Don\u2019t let Big Air Fryer fool you: six everyday oven cooking hacks", "lead": "From batches of bacon to \u2018mapping\u2019 your grill, this kitchen stalwart offers so much more than baking a cake", "author": "Ann Ding", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:00:43", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224398", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a398e1e9dc902052b035e64d7dba6b5d57e8c351/664_490_4161_2497/500.jpg", "body": "Your oven unit is more than just a cake-baking, potato-roasting, cheese-grilling workhorse. Open the door, fiddle with the temperature and you also have a yoghurt chamber and sterilising cabinet in your kitchen. And if you\u2019ve been tempted to invest in an air fryer or dehydrator, save yourself the trouble \u2013 your oven can do many of the same things. From everyday hacks to long-form cooking projects, these are the lesser-known things you can do with your oven and grill. 1. Batch-cook bacon and sausages If you\u2019re making breakfast for a crowd and want to avoid the long-range artillery fire of bacon grease from a frying pan, the oven is your best friend. Lay your bacon or sausages on a baking sheet and pop them in an 200-220C oven \u2013 anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes for bacon and 25 to 30 minutes for sausages. When it comes to bacon, US food writer J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt has a few different techniques to help you reach your desired spot on the chewy-crispy continuum. If your bacon is destined for a sandwich, he suggests placing another baking tray on top of the bacon to keep it flat while it cooks, leaving it in BLT-ready condition. 2. Crisp up leftover fried food Air fryers are sometimes touted as the best way to reheat fried food, but don\u2019t let Big Air Fryer fool you. According to Choice\u2019s home economics expert, Fiona Mair, \u201cif you\u2019ve got a fan-forced oven, you\u2019ve got an air fryer\u201d. Fried food \u2013 such as chips, chicken and hash browns \u2013 loses its crunch because it absorbs moisture and baking it briefly at about 200C will drive off the excess. For best results, place your leftovers on a rack on top of a tray, so the food isn\u2019t sitting in its own oil. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning 3. Map your grill Kitchen cartography? Not quite \u2013 but you can find out where the hot and cold spots are under your grill. In this method by Cook\u2019s Illustrated, you line the surface of a baking tray with sliced white bread, then pop it under a hot grill. Once the slices have browned, take the tray out. Darker spots are, of course, places where the grill is hotter. Cook\u2019s Illustrated recommends taking a photo of the map to keep, but if yours is anything like mine, you can probably just remember the heat is concentrated in the centre. And once you\u2019ve mapped your grill, you can make cinnamon toast the right way. 4. Make dehydrated fruit Properly dehydrated food has a long shelf life and your options are nearly endless, from kale chips to beef jerky and fruit leather. But if you\u2019re tempted to buy an electric dehydrator (like the ones featured in #fooddehydrator TikTok videos) don\u2019t be swayed. \u201c[Dehydrators] take up so much room,\u201d says Mair. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a huge unit and they do make a lot of noise. And the thing is, [the oven] seems to dehydrate the food much quicker. \u201cYou do have to run it for hours, but not 14 hours, overnight like a dehydrator.\u201d The time it takes will also depend on the thickness of the food. Thinly sliced apples will take about three hours, according to Mair. You\u2019ll want to keep the temperature between 50C and 90C so as not to actually cook the food. With electric ovens, Mair says the fan-forced setting will work best, as the circulating air will be drier and carry moisture off the food quicker. However, it\u2019s still possible with a conventional oven, she says. Although your ingredients might not feel completely dry, once they cool they will firm up and become dehydrated. 5. Kickstart your homemade yoghurt Ovens are built to retain heat, so electric models are great incubation chambers for making never-ending yoghurt or natto (it\u2019s easier than you think!). They can maintain a stable temperature of 40C \u2013 the temperature at which the microorganisms responsible for fermenting yoghurt and natto work fastest. This is easier with newer ovens, which tend to have more precise temperature settings \u2013 some models are able to maintain temperatures as low as 30C (perfect for proofing a sluggish bread dough when the weather is too cold). But you can MacGyver your own solution. Heat the oven to the lowest possible temperature, then turn it off and put your yoghurt in; you could also place a saucepan of hot water in the oven along with your ferment and monitor the temperature with an oven thermometer. 6. Sterilise jars If you\u2019re making jams or pickles (or homemade yoghurt in your oven), you\u2019ll need sterilised glass jars. After giving your jars a hot soapy wash and rinse, place them on a tray while they\u2019re still wet and put them in an oven, preheated to 110-120C, until the jars are completely dry. Here\u2019s a how-to guide from Cornersmith. Note that this is different from heat processing, which will make your homemade jams and pickles shelf-stable; food stored in sterilised jars that is not canned should be kept in the fridge."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fe5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/21/house-prices-will-keep-rising-into-next-year-says-domain-as-immigration-boosts-demand", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "House prices will keep rising into next year, says Domain, as immigration boosts demand", "lead": "Sydney to lead recovery with 6% to 9% increase by next June while Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane will come close to or beat record highs", "author": "Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 15:00:42", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224416", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2a420024c935c92c72c4091d6d74ae771c87eefc/0_147_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "The recovery of real estate prices will extend across Australia and well into 2024 as a swelling population overwhelms the headwinds of higher interest rates and reduced borrowing limits for some prospective buyers, according to data group Domain.

Many economists earlier this year predicted double-digit falls in property prices as Reserve Bank interest rate rises deterred buyers, particularly investors. However, a net-migration surge that added 400,000 people this fiscal year and will add another 300,000-plus next year, helped to stem and then reversed the slide in values. The RBA is concerned the recovery in prices, if sustained, \u201cwould imply less of a drag on consumption in the year ahead than had previously been envisaged\u201d, the minutes for its June board meeting showed. Supply of new housing was also being hindered by high material costs and shortages of skilled workers. Domain estimated net overseas migration would drive demand for nearly 130,000 extra dwellings across Australia in the coming financial year, with NSW, Victoria and Queensland receiving the largest share of new residents. While many newcomers typically opt to rent on arrival, the tight rental market would drive many into home ownership sooner. Powell said the construction sector would find it hard to respond because many firms were struggling even with an uptick in prices in the offing. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the cost of building a new house had risen about 32% but businesses had only been able to extract a 22% rise in \u201coutput costs\u201d for what they sold. Building approval numbers were also falling, pointing to fewer new builds next year. \u201cAll of those things will eventually feed into higher property prices,\u201d Powell said. Headwinds that might restrain property price rises include the RBA lifting interest rates more than one more time before its hiking cycle ends. Some of the buying demand also won\u2019t return if the central bank ends up delaying expected rate cuts until the second half of next year. Similarly, the 400 basis-point increase in the RBA\u2019s interest rate since May 2022 had seen the maximum borrowing capacity shrink significantly. \u201cFor some, the change could dash their hopes of a property purchase as they simply cannot borrow enough to purchase a home,\u201d the report said. Another drag on housing demand and prices could be weak wage growth, making it harder for first home buyers to accumulate a sufficient deposit, Domain said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fe6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/21/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-squeeze-food-energy-interest-rates-mortgages-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank of England must \u2018create recession\u2019 to fight high inflation, Hunt advisor says, as mortgage rates rise again \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Member of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s economic advisory council says BoE must create \u201cuncertainty and frailty\u201d, after UK headline inflation was unchanged at 8.7% in May", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:42:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224433", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/95021c3e3b7fc3662e69373d8785deab7882fca7/0_0_5310_3187/500.jpg", "body": "Time to recap, after a day dominated by depressingly high UK inflation. The Bank of England might need to spark a recession to finally get price rises under control, an economist who advises Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned, as inflation remained persistently high in May. Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management, told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that the BoE must fight against a wage-price spiral taking hold in the UK. Ward said: \u201cThe difficulty for the Bank of England \u2013 I mean, no-one envies them their job at the moment \u2013 is they have to therefore create a recession,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to create uncertainty and frailty, because it\u2019s only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think \u2018Well, maybe I won\u2019t put through that price rise\u2019, or workers, when they\u2019re a little bit less confident about their job, think \u2018Oh, I won\u2019t push my boss for that higher pay\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s that weakness in activity which eventually gets rid of inflation.\u201d Ward was speaking after inflation in the UK unexpectedly remained stuck at 8.7% in May, adding to the pressure on households suffering a surge in mortgage costs. The Office for National Statistics reported that good inflation slowed, but services inflation accelerated at a faster pace in May. Core inflation, closely watched by the BoE jumped to a 31-year high. The money markets are now predicting that UK interest rates will have hit 6% by around the end of 2023. The Bank sets UK interest rates tomorrow \u2013 a hike is nailed-on, with some economists suggesting it could lift borrowing costs by half-a-percent, to 5%. The majority expect a smaller, quarter-point, increase to 4.75%. Mortgage holders are being hit by higher rates \u2013 Moneyfacts reported that the average two-year fixed-term mortgage now costs 6.15%, up from 6.07% on Tuesday. More than 1 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. Tenants are also suffering, with rents rising at the fastest pace for 7 years. And the boss of Berkeley Group has said the property market will remain \u201cchoppy\u201d until interest rates settle, as the housebuilder forecast a 20% drop in sales this year. In other news\u2026. UK government debt has surpassed GDP for first time in 62 years Some of the UK\u2019s best known retailers including WH Smith, Marks &amp; Spencer, Argos and LloydsPharmacy are among more than 200 companies collectively fined \u00a37m for failing to pay the legal minimum wage. The TransPennine Express train service has got \u201cworse rather than better\u201d since transferring to the state-owned operator of last resort (OLR), according to the rail minister, Huw Merriman. Matt Moulding, the founder and chief executive of the online retail platform THG, has finally given up his \u201cgolden\u201d share allowing him to block any attempt to takeover the company. Our Politics Liveblog are covering the Westminster reaction to today\u2019s inflationo report, here: With UK inflation so sticky, Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to halve the UK\u2019s rate of inflation is looking trickier than when he made it. My colleague Phillip Inman explains: May\u2019s data shows that most of the price rises are in areas of discretionary spending, like holidays, recreation and entertainment. Britons have always demanded foreign holidays. And after three years of uncertainty and long periods of restrictions on travel, the sale of flights has rocketed. No one seems to mind that the airlines are hoping to recover some of their pandemic losses with much higher ticket prices. Sunak could still score a victory. He has six months to go. Some of the biggest increases in energy and food prices happened last summer and these will not be repeated over the coming few months, which should mean inflation drops to 5% quite quickly. Still, he thought it was going to be his easiest win and now it looks like being a Johnsonian gamble. He seems to have misread the UK economy, or at least the capacity of businesses to keep increasing prices without much justification. In that, he is not alone. Our Money editor, Hilary Osborne, has examined why the UK property market is so reliant on short-term fixed mortgages, not the long-dates type popular in other countries. She explains: As well as borrowers\u2019 desire for the cheapest deal possible, one industry source suggests that brokers have a role in keeping the market short-termist as they receive fees when a new deal is taken out, and have no incentive to tie in their customers for the long haul. Concern about keeping options open also seems to be a factor. Although many mortgage lenders now allow overpayments and for customers to \u201cport\u201d their loan if they move home, borrowers think short term equals flexibility. Neal Hudson, a UK housing market analyst at the consultancy BuiltPlace, said people might have been put off paying more for a longer-term deal because of expectations that prices would continue to rise and rates would continue to go down. He said: \u201cThe general experience over the past 40 years has been that \u2013 there may have been some short-term pain but in the medium term people have always ended up all right. \u201cThe market has clearly bottomed out now, so will we see a change? Maybe a long-term fix does become more appealing.\u201d More here: Housing analyst Neal Hudson has crunched the numbers on how house prices could fall as mortgage rates rise higher: NatWest is raising the interest rates on some mortgage tomorrow, as lenders continue to ratchet up borrowing costs. NatWest has told brokers it is lifting the rate on selected two-and five year fixed-rate deals by 30 basis points (or 0.3 of a percentage point). This will cover home purchase mortgages, remortgaging products, and those aimed at first-time buyers. This follows today\u2019s market reaction to May\u2019s inflation report, with UK interest rates expected to hit 6% at the turn of the year. PA Media have written a handy explainer about the UK\u2019s inflation problem: Q: What is inflation? Inflation is the term used for the rate at which prices increase over time. If the price of something rises from \u00a310 to \u00a311 over a year, then that would represent annual inflation of 10%. Every month, the ONS reports the annual increases on a raft of items and services, including everything from computer games to a loaf bread. Q: Why is it currently so high? In May inflation struck 8.7%, as it continues to slow from the 11.1% peak it hit late last year. Prices rocketed last year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 caused the price of energy to shoot higher, adding to pressure from supply disruption. It contributed to higher costs for firms making products or offering services, while labour costs also started to rise. Since then, higher food and drink prices are a key reason why inflation has failed to fall as fast as hoped. Olive oil, eggs and cheese are among items to see the sharpest increases over the past year. Q: Why has there been a negative response to flat inflation for last month? Firstly, it is important to highlight that flat inflation does not mean that prices have stayed the same. It means that the rate of price increases is the same as it was in the previous month. In April, the rate of inflation dropped to 8.7% from 10.1% in March. Economists and politicians had hoped that this rate would continue to drop, with expectations it would fall to 8.4% for last month. Inflation flatlining at 8.7% for May could indicate that it will take longer than hoped for inflation to drop to more normal levels, keeping pressure on household budgets. Q: What does it mean for interest rates? The Bank of England has a target to try to get the rate of inflation to around 2%. In order to drag inflation down quickly, the most commonly used policy tool used by the central bank is increasing the base interest rate. Increases to interest rates \u2013 which currently sit at a 14-year high of 4.5% \u2013 are designed to reduce demand from people to borrow money, because of the higher charges they will face, and encourage people to save their cash. It is hoped that lower spending and increased saving will encourage firms to reduce prices to keep customers purchasing products or services, helping to reduce the rate of inflation. How will this affect my mortgage? Some variable rate mortgage deals directly track the Bank of England base interest rate and they automatically increase in line with the base rate. Borrowers can also end up on a standard variable rate (SVR) when their initial mortgage deal ends. The SVR is set by lenders individually but it can often roughly follow movements in the base rate. The bulk of mortgaged UK homeowners tend to take out fixed-rate deals. Swap rates underpin the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages and these have been rising amid expectations around inflation, as it has turned out to be more \u201csticky\u201d than some had expected. Fixed-rate mortgage rates have been on an upwards march in recent days, with the average two-year fixed-rate residential mortgage now sitting at around 6%. Q: When will we see respite from the cost-of-living crisis? Despite the latest setback, inflation is still widely expected to continue to fall. Last month, the Bank of England predicted that inflation would fall to 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Q: What does it mean for the Government\u2019s pledge to halve inflation? The Government pledged to halve inflation annually from a rate of 10.7% at the start of the year, as part of five promises by Rishi Sunak\u2019s Government. At the time, economists had forecast inflation was on track to drop to around 2.9% by the last quarter of 2023, but have reduced this to 5.1%, raising concerns the pledge could be at risk. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in response that the target was \u201cstill absolutely deliverable\u201d but stressed that there is still a long way to go to achieve this. Jim Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank, reckons we live in a financial era where \u201cinflation is always with us\u201d, even if there are periods where it can be more dormant for several years. In a new research note today, Reid argues that the main cause is \u201cfiat money\u201d \u2013 cash directly printed and issued by governments that isn\u2019t pegged to an underlying commodity. Since the world effectively moved to fiat money in 1971, there is no country in the world that has averaged inflation below 2%. It is too easy to create money and run deficits, and the temptation to do that rather than take harder decisions will always be there when the inevitable and fairly regular economic and financial shocks hit. The UK and the US are a bit more likely to have this bias than the EU due to their respective central bank mandates and stricter deficit rules, but the latter is not immune. So even if inflation eventually mean reverts to the central bank targets this cycle, the probabilities are high that it will average above it for the rest of your careers unless you think we have a great reset at some point where markets refuse to buy any more government bonds. Even at that point central banks may simply take up even more slack. Core inflation in the UK could remain higher than in the US or euro area until late next year, Capital Economics fears. Ruth Gregory, their deputy chief UK economist, explains: Inflation in the UK has stayed higher than elsewhere as the UK has endured the worst of both worlds \u2013 a big energy shock (like the euro-zone) and labour shortages (even worse than the US). Admittedly, the upward influence of the energy supply shock is fading. But the tighter labour market will probably mean that UK core inflation stays higher than in the US and the euro-zone until late-2024. America\u2019s central bank chief has warned that interest rates in the US will head higher. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve paused (or possibly skipped) an interest rate, by voting to leave its benchmark rate on hold. But today, Jerome Powell told Congress that most policymakers on the Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC committee expect to push rates higher at future meetings. In prepared remarks for the House Financial Services Committee, Powell says: \u201cNearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. Powell also says the Fed is \u201csquarely focused\u201d on its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, adding\": My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, and without it, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The pound has lost ground today, reflecting concerns that higher interest rates will trigger a recession. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar, dropping below $1.27 for the first time since last Thursday. That suggests that the possibility of higher borrowing costs, and possibly a bumper half-point hike on Thursday, is worrying traders. As Kit Juckes, chief global FX strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The risk of a 50bp rate hike tomorrow has increased, the risk of a deeper slowdown has increased even more. Today\u2019s upward inflation surprise increases the pressure on the Bank of England and raises the risk of a return to an oversized hike at tomorrow\u2019s meeting, say the Markets 360 team at BNP Paribas. But, their base case is for a quarter-point increase, accompanied by \u201cmore decisive language\u201d in the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting, or other post-meeting communications. They predict interest rates will peak at 5.5%, a whole percentage point above today\u2019s levels: The bottom line, regardless of the size of tomorrow\u2019s move, is that the MPC has a lot more work to do to bring underlying inflation under control \u2013 we stick to our terminal rate call of 5.50%. Downing Street has insisted Rishi Sunak is still sticking with his pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year, despite inflation remaining stickily high. The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman told reporters: \u201cThat remains the target.\u201d Asked if they are on track to fulfil the promise, the spokesman said the government was (despite inflation coming in above target for the last few months): \u201cYes. Despite some of the coverage at the time (of the announcement of the pledge) this was never something that was straightforward. \u201cIt was rightly an ambitious target that we remain committed to and it can only be achieved with fiscal discipline.\u201d Here are more details from the IFS\u2019s new report into the financial hit from rising mortgage payments, which warns that 1.4m mortgage holders will lose 20% of their disposable income to rising borrowing costs. Newsflash: Millions of households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the UK\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned. Sounding the alarm as mortgage costs reach the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that almost 1.4m mortgage holders would see at least a fifth of their disposable income erased. It warned the heaviest blow was reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, with the biggest financial hit for households in London and the south east of England where property prices are typically higher than the national average. The biggest rise is for those in their 30s, for whom payments will jump by \u00a3360 per month, or 11% of disposable income. On average, mortgage holders will see their mortgage payments rise by \u00a3280 per month \u2013 equivalent to 8.3% of their disposable income (i.e. income after mortgage payments). Tom Wernham, a Research Economist at IFS, explains that many borrowers face a serious shock when they remortgage. \u201cMany families bought homes \u2013 often with sizable mortgages \u2013 when interest rates were very low. As people\u2019s fixed term offers come to an end they are going to be exposed to much higher interest rates. For many, the increase in monthly repayments is going to come as a serious shock \u2013 on average it will be equivalent to seeing their disposable income fall by around 8.3%. And for 1.4 million mortgage holders \u2013 half of whom are under 40 \u2013 mortgage payments are set to rise by an eyewatering 20% of disposable income or more. Given the cost of living pressures people are already facing due to high food and energy price inflation, these significant increases in mortgage costs could not come at a worse time.\u201d Back in parliament, Rishi Sunak has said it is vitally important that savers are treated fairly, following concerns that savings rates have not risen in line with borrowing costs. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will discuss this matter when he meets with UK banks on Friday, the PM added. Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com says he was called to an \u201curgent private meeting\u201d with Jeremy Hunt today to discuss mortgages. Lewis says he explained that banks should offer \u201cproper forbearance\u201d to struggling mortgage-holders, and not ramp up their profit margins: Duncan Robinson of The Economist questions which of the pair are actually in control\u2026. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, spots some interesting detail in the UK inflation report: Over in parliament, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has asked prime minister Rishi Sunak if he agrees that Britain is facing \u201ca mortgage catastrophe\u201d (as Conservative MP Lucy Allan warned last weekend). Sunak replies that \u201cit is right\u201d to help those with mortgages, which is why the right priority is to halve inflation. Sunak says; Inflation is what is driving interest rates up. Inflation is what erodes people\u2019s savings and pushes up prices, and ultimately makes them poorer. Sunak adds that he highlighted the importance of tackling inflation before he became PM, and adds that the IMF have backed the government\u2019s approach. An unimpressed Starmer replies that Britain is suffering from 13 years of economic failure and last autumn\u2019s \u2018kamikaze\u2019 budget. Q: How much will the Tory mortgage penalty cost the average homeowner? Sunak claims Starmer isn\u2019t aware of the \u2018global macroeconomic situation\u2019 (earning much heckling). Sunak says the government has taken steps to protect borrowers, including lifting support for the UK\u2019s mortgage interest scheme (details here), the new protections agreed with the FCA, and tens of billions of costs of living support. Starmer gives him the answer \u2013 \u00a32,900 per year, for those who need to remortgage from 2024 (that\u2019s according to Resolution Foundation). Sunak shoots back that interest rates have risen in other countries, such as the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and a two-decade high in the eurozone. Our Politics Liveblog has all the action: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt says he wants to ensure UK banks are \u201cliving up\u201d to commitments made to help struggling borrowers. Hunt has held a meeting with consumer champion Martin Lewis today, a day after Lewis said the mortgage \u201cticking timebomb\u201d he warned the UK government about last December has \u201cexploded\u201d. Speaking after today\u2019s meeting, Hunt says he knows many people are worried about their mortgage repayments. He adds: Today I spoke to @MartinSLewis ahead of my meeting with lenders on Friday. I want to ensure banks are living up to the commitments we agreed in December, and what more they can do to help. The FCA\u2019s finalised guidance include options such as extending the term of a mortgage, or letting borrowers make reduced monthly payments for a temporary period. Large increases in UK interest rates used to be rare. When the Bank of England lifted base rate by 50 basis points (half a percent) last August, it was the biggest rise in 27 years (since 1995). That was followed by half-point hikes in September, December and February, with a monster 75-basis point rise thown in at the November meeting, before the Bank returned to smaller quarter-point hikes in March and May (up to 4.5%). The sustained strength in UK inflation in May \u201ccements the case\u201d for the Bank of England to deliver further tightening at its meeting tomorrow, says Gurpreet Gill, macro strategist for Global Fixed Income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Gill, who predicts rates will peak at 5.25%, says a half-point rise tomorrow can\u2019t be ruled out: \u201cWhile our base case is for a 0.25% rate hike at this week\u2019s meeting, the data opens the door to an increased pace of a 0.5% rate rise. \u201cCore and services inflation, alongside food prices, continue to diverge from moderating trends observed in other advanced economies like the US, complicating the path towards the Bank\u2019s target. \u201cWe see upside risks to our terminal rate forecast of 5.25%. However, downside growth risks may exert disinflationary pressure later this year.\u201d Here\u2019s Sky News\u2019s Paul Kelso on the financial market reaction to the UK May inflation report: UK exporters have been hit by falling exports this month, but price pressures appear to be easing too. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)\u2018s monthly healthcheck of UK factories has found that order books recoveedred last month. However, the export order balance fell again to -29 from -26, the weakest since February 2021. And on inflation\u2026.UK manufacturers expect to raise prices by the smallest amount since February 2021 over the next three months. The CBI\u2019s monthly index of manufacturers\u2019 average selling price expectations slowed to +19 in June from +21 in May, its lowest in more than two years but well above its long-run average of +7. CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said: \u201cTotal order books have improved a touch in recent months, but they remain fairly soft. And although output expectations have turned positive again, growth is expected to be quite weak in the three months to September.\u201d Rising interest rates, and rising prices, are both hurting the budgets of low-income families. New research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation this morning show that the numbers of low-income households going without essentials or in arrears has not improved for over a year. JRF senior economist Rachelle Earwaker warns that 5.5 million low-income households have had to cut down on or skip meals because they can\u2019t afford food. Four million reported going hungry, and 2.7 million have reported having a poor diet because of the cost of living crisis. Earwaker adds: Low-income households are struggling to afford their bills, with 4.5 million in arrears, and 2.6 million holding high cost credit loans with loan sharks, doorstep lenders, payday lenders or pawnshops. The JRF are calling for the Government to implement an Essentials Guarantee, to ensure that the basic rate of Universal Credit will at least always covers life\u2019s essentials. UK inflation surprised to the upside today, for the fourth month in a row, reports Berenberg Economics. They have now lifted their forecasts for UK interest rates \u2013 predicting Bank Rate will have risen to 5.25% (was 5.0%) at the end of 2023 and 4.0% (was 3.5%) one year later. Berenberg warns that UK inflation is changing its nature, and becoming more domestically driven, saying: By and large, imported inflation caused by last year\u2019s spike in energy and food prices is receding on trend as energy prices correct and the 2022 surge in these prices washes out of the yoy comparison. The yoy rate for goods prices eased to 9.7% from 10.0% despite higher prices for used cars. However, the more domestically driven increase of services prices advanced from 6.9% to 7.4%. Many services are labour intensive and thus affected by strong wage gains. As reported last week, the rise in weekly average earnings (ex-bonus) accelerated to 7.5% in April from 7.1% in March. Helped by resilient gains in employment (1.2% yoy in April), most households continue to open their wallets despite the gradually building headwind from higher mortgage rates. Resolution Foundation\u2019s chief executive, Torsten Bell, points out that there are winners from higher interest rates: But he\u2019s not impressed by claims that Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng are somehow vindicated over last year\u2019s mini-budget debacle: Sticky inflation is extending the cost-of-living crisis for everyone in Britain, and hardening the mortgage crunch for the seven million households who have a mortgage. That\u2019s the warning from the Resolution Foundation today. James Smith, Resolution\u2019s research director, \u201cThe latest data will reinforce market expectations of how high interest rates will go, and put more pressure on the Bank. This is bad news for anyone with a mortgage, who will be looking out for more positive signals before their current deal comes to an end.\u201d Resolution have calculated that mortgage repayments are set to rise by \u00a315.8bn a year by 2026, meaning an average hit of \u00a32,900 for households remortgaging. Three-quarters of that \u00a315.8bn hit will fall on the richest 40% of households, they add, as higher-income households are more likely to have a mortgage. But rising prices hit poorer households more. They add: Inflation rates for the poorest tenth of households are 25 per cent higher than those for the richest tenth of households as they spend more of their income on food and energy bills. Ben Franklin, research director at the Centre for Progressive Policy says the UK\u2019s high food price inflation, and stubbornly high core inflation, are \u2018particularly devastating\u2019 news. Although food price inflation slowed last month, to 18.3% per year from 19%, there were still some sharp increases in the prices of staples compared with last year. The annual rate of inflation fell for eggs, potatoes, meat, bread, butter and coffee, for example: Eggs: April 37.0%, May 28.8% Low-fat milk: April 33.5%, May 28.5% Yogurt: April 24.0%, May 23.4% Potatoes: April 24.8%, May 22.4% Fruit and vegetable juices: April 21.1%, May 18.0% Ready meals: April 20.8%, May 16.8% Meat: April 17.2%, May 16.3% Bread: April 18.6%, May 15.3% Margarine and other vegetable fats: April 19.0%, May 15.2% Tea: April 19.1%, May 14.6% Butter: April 20.1%, May 14.1% Chocolate: April 14.9%, May 11.7% Pizza and quiche: April 11.9%, May 9.4% Coffee: April 15.3%, May 9.2% But shoppers were hit by rising inflation on other products: Sugar: April 47.4%, May 49.8% Olive oil: April 46.4%, May 46.9% Sauces, condiments, salt, spices and culinary herbs: April 33.9%, May 35.1% Cheese and curd: April 30.6%, May 33.4% Pasta and couscous: April 27.7%, May 28.5% Jams, marmalades and honey: April 17.9%, May 22.9% Crisps: April 14.5%, May 17.8% Fish: April 14.2%, May 16.6% Rice: April 14.9%, May 16.1% Breakfast cereals and other cereal products: April 8.1%, May 12.3% Fruit: April 10.8%, May 11.2% Dried fruit and nuts: April 7.2%, May 10.3% UK tenants were hit by the fastest increase in rents in at least seven years last month. Private rental prices paid by tenants in the UK increased by 5.0% in the 12 months to May 2023, the Office for National Statistics reports. That is the largest annual percentage change since the data series began in January 2016. The ONS reports that rental prices in London grew at the fastest rate in a decade, saying: In the 12 months to May 2023, rental prices for the UK (excluding London) increased by 4.9%, up from an increase of 4.8% in the 12 months to April 2023. Private rental prices in London increased by 5.1% in the 12 months to May 2023, up from an increase of 5.0% in the 12 months to April 2023. This is the highest annual percentage change in London since October 2012. Yesterday, property portal Zoopla reported that the average UK tenant now spends more than 28% of their pay before tax on rent, the highest in a decade. House price inflation slowed in April, new official data shows. The Office for National Statistics reports that average UK house prices increased by 3.5% in the 12 months to April, down from 4.1% in the year to March. The average UK house price was \u00a3286,489 in April, which is \u00a39,000 higher than 12 months ago, but \u00a37,000 below the recent peak in September 2022. It was slightly higher than the \u00a3285,057 recorded in March. Average house prices increased over the 12 months to \u00a3306,000 in England (3.7%), \u00a3213,000 in Wales (2.0%), \u00a3187,000 in Scotland (2.0%) and \u00a3172,000 in Northern Ireland (5.0%). The North East saw the highest annual percentage change of all English regions in the 12 months to April (5.5%), while London saw the lowest (2.4%). The Bank of England must \u201ccreate a recession\u201d to curb inflation, according to Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management. Ward, who is also a member of chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s economic advisory council, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme there are \u201ccertainly signs\u201d that a price-wage spiral is emerging, which the central bank \u201chas to nip in the bud\u201d. Speaking after inflation remained stubbornly high at 8.7% in May, Ward explained: \u201cThe difficulty for the Bank of England \u2013 I mean, no-one envies them their job at the moment \u2013 is they have to therefore create a recession. \u201cThey have to create uncertainty and frailty, because it\u2019s only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think \u2018Well, maybe I won\u2019t put through that price rise\u2019, or workers, when they\u2019re a little bit less confident about their job, think \u2018Oh, I won\u2019t push my boss for that higher pay\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s that weakness in activity which eventually gets rid of inflation.\u201d Ward is also a member of The Times\u2019s shadow monetary policy committee, a group of experts who are today calling for the actual MPC to raise interest rates by half a point tomorrow, to 5%. Ward argued that the Bank of England\u2019s \u201cearlier hesitancy\u201d has put it in an uncomfortable spot. With her shadow MPC hat on, Ward told The Times: It hoped for too long that inflation would go away on its own accord and underestimated the second-round effects now evident in accelerating wage growth. It did not adhere to the \u201cstitch in time saves nine\u201d principle and now will have to raise rates by more and cause a deeper downturn to bring inflation back to target. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the price moves that kept UK inflation disappointingly high in May, at 8.7%: Food and non-alcoholic beverages: up by 18.3% over the last year, down from 19% in April Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: up by 9.3% over the last year, down from 9.1% in April Clothing and footwear: up by 7.1% over the last year, up from 6.8% in April Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: up by 12.1% over the last year, down from 12.3% in April Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: up by 7.5% over the last year, matching April\u2019s reading Health: up by 8.3% over the last year, up from 7% in April Transport: up by 1.2% over the last year, down from 1.5% in April Communication: up by 9.1% over the last year, up from 7.9% in April Recreation and culture: up by 6.7% over the last year, up from 6.3% in April Education: up by 3.2% over the last year, matching April\u2019s reading Restaurants and hotels: up by 10.3% over the last year, up from 10.2% in April Miscellaneous goods and services: up by 6.8% over the last year, matching April\u2019s reading Buy-to-let mortgages have also become pricier. Moneyfacts reports: The average 2-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.44%. This is up from an average rate of 6.40% on the previous working day. The average 5-year buy-to-let residential mortgage rate today is 6.31%. This is up from an average rate of 6.29% on the previous working day. There are currently 2,456 buy-to-let mortgage products available. This is down from a total of 2,525 on the previous working day. Just in: UK fixed-term mortgage rates have climbed again, which will add to concerns about a \u2018timebomb\u2019 in the housing market. The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen to 6.15% today, data provider Moneyfacts reports, up from 6.07% on Tuesday. At the start of May, two-year fixed mortgages were averaging 5.26%, before starting to climb as the financial markets realised UK inflation was looking worryingly sticky. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate jumped too, to 5.79%, up from 5.72% yesterday. Almost 150 mortgage products were pulled from the market since yesterday, as lenders rushh to reprice deals. There are currently 4,498 residential mortgage products available, Moneyfacts reports, down from 4,641 on Tuesday. The surge in mortgage rates is splitting, some of whom want ministers should intervene to defuse Britain\u2019s mortgage timebomb, by reintroducing tax relief on mortgage interest. Yesterday Jake Berry, the influential chair of the the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, told chancellor Jeremy Hunt: \u201cPeople are very concerned about what is being described as the mortgage bomb about to go off. If we don\u2019t help families now, all the other money that we have spent to help them will have been wasted if they lose their home.\u201d The UK\u2019s debt pile reached more than 100% of economic output for the first time since 1961 as government borrowing more than doubled in May, according to official figures this morning The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said net debt reached \u00a32.6 trillion as of the end of May, estimated at 100.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). It is the first time the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen above 100% since March 1961, except for during the pandemic, but this was later revised lower due to stronger GDP figures. It came as government borrowing soared year-on-year to \u00a320bn in May, pushed higher by the cost of energy support schemes, inflation-linked benefit payments and interest payments on debt. May\u2019s borrowing figure was \u00a33bn lower than in April but \u00a310.7bn higher than a year ago and the second-highest May borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. Economists had predicted borrowing of \u00a319.5bn for May. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the Government has been taking \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to balance the books following the pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Hunt said: \u201cWe rightly spent billions to protect families and businesses from the worst impacts of the pandemic and Putin\u2019s energy crisis. \u201cBut it would be manifestly unfair to leave future generations with a tab they cannot repay. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have taken difficult but necessary decisions to balance the books in order to halve inflation this year, grow the economy and reduce debt.\u201d Today\u2019s inflation figure of 8.7% is \u201ca shocker\u201d, says Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School. He believes it will prompt the Bank of England (BoE) into raising interest rate by half a percentage point tomorrow, to 5%, telling us: The BoE predicted, only last month, an inflation rate of 8.22% for the second quarter of 2023. For this to materialize, inflation needs to increase by 7.3% in June. This huge drop from the current 8.7% rate is almost unlikely to happen. To defend its credibility, I sense the MPC will most likely feel \u201cobliged\u201d to raise tomorrow it\u2019s base rate by 0.5 percentage points and assess the very effect in August\u2019s Monetary Policy Report (and next decision). There is no interest rate decision in July\u2026. At 8.7%, inflation remains higher in the UK than in many other advanced economies. In the eurozone, CPI inflation fell to 6.1% in May, down from 7.0% in April. Within the bloc, French inflation dropped to 6% from 6.9%, while in Germany it dropped to 6.3% from 7.6%. In the US, inflation dropped to 4% from 4.9% in April, meaning prices are rising just half as fast on that side of the Atlantic. Price pressures in the UK are being fuelled by a jobs market that is struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit visa rules and the decision by many older workers to quit the employment scene. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: In France, the rate of worker participation is higher than before the pandemic. That is to say, a higher proportion of working age people have a job or have registered to work. In the UK, the participation rate has declined, driving up wages and maintaining the pressure on prices. The UK also imports more than 50% of its food, mostly from the EU, which has proved to be badly affected by rising raw materials costs. Food prices have risen at more than 18% for most of the year, pushing the overall UK inflation rate above those of rival economies. In a new blow to mortgage holders, the cost of UK government short-term borrowing has jumped this morning. The yield, or interest rates, on two-year British government bonds has jumped as high as 5.1% \u2013 a new 15-year high \u2013 up from 4.93% last night. Two-year bond yields are sensitive to interest rate speculation, and are used by lenders to price mortgage rates. City economists say that another interest rate rise tomorrow is a done deal \u2013 the only question is whether the Bank of England plumps for a quarter-point rise in rates, to 4.75%, or goes big with a half-point rise to 5%. The Bank has already raised interest rates 12 times since December 2021, but will not be happy that inflation is still so high. Capital Economics are now predicting that the Bank will go for the half-point rise, to 5%, due to this morning\u2019s inflation report. They cite the increase in core inflation, saying: A lot of attention has focussed on the fact that inflation failed to fall in line with expectations last month and was instead unchanged at 8.7%. But the bigger concern in our view is that core inflation rose yet again, hitting a 31-year high of 7.1%. This marks the UK out from other advanced economies, including the euro-zone and the US, where core inflation has started to fall. There are several factors at play, but an important one is that inflation appears to have infected the labour market and wage setting to a greater extent in the UK than elsewhere. While tomorrow\u2019s MPC meeting is finely balanced, we think that a 50bps increase in Bank rate is now slightly more likely than a 25bps. The consensus remains for a smaller increase, but the markets are pricing in a 50% chance of larger move. Accordingly, a failure to deliver could cause financial conditions to loosen and the pound to weaken, which is the last thing that policymakers at the Bank need right now. Analysts at ING say the Bank of England faces a very difficult dilemma, but suspect rates won\u2019t reach 6%, as the markets are now pricing in. Headline inflation should come down more noticeably over the next couple of months, owing to some pretty hefty base effects. Last June saw a near 10% spike in petrol prices, whereas prices are currently falling, and of course in July we\u2019ll see a material fall in household electricity/gas bills. Core inflation we think should come lower too, though to a much lesser degree and mainly because of further renewed downward pressure from certain goods categories. Headline CPI, we think, will be just below 7% by July and around 4.5% by year-end. Core inflation will probably end the year above 5%. All of this makes life even harder for the Bank of England. We think the bar for another 50bp hike is set pretty high, but a 25bp hike is basically guaranteed, as is another in August. But markets are now fully pricing a 6% peak for the Bank rate, which implies six more rate hikes from current levels. That seems excessive, and we suspect the Bank of England would privately agree. Shares in housebuilders are falling in early trading in London. Berkeley, Persimmon and Barratt Development are all down over 2%, among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index. That suggests traders are expecting further increases in UK interest rates, making mortgages more expensive and dampening demand for new homes. Berkeley reported this morning that it is still seeing \u201cgood levels of enquiry for well-located homes built to a high standard of design and quality\u201d. But it admitted that the housing market is \u201clikely to lack urgency\u201d until consumers have a better idea of how mortgage rates will change over the coming months. There is a sliver of positive news in this morning\u2019s data. UK producers, such as factories, benefited from a drop in input costs last month, giving them breathing room to slow their price rises. Producer input prices rose by 0.5% in the year to May, down from a rise of 4.2% in the year to April, thanks to a fall in crude oil costs. And output price inflation \u2013 what is charged at the factory gate \u2013 rose by 2.9% in the year to May 2023, down from +5.2% in April. On a monthly basis, producer input prices fell by 1.5% and output prices dropped by 0.5% in May. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said the Government would \u201cstick to its guns\u201d, after inflation remained higher than hoped in May He told broadcasters: \u201cToday\u2019s figures strengthen the case for the Government to stick to its guns. \u201cNo matter what the pressure from left, right or centre, we won\u2019t be pushed off course. \u201cBecause if we are going to help families, if we are going to relieve the pressure on people with mortgages, on businesses, we need to squeeze every last drop of high inflation out of the economy.\u201d Hunt has also called for patience, while rising interest rates have their effect on prices, saying: \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in other countries, you can see that rises in interest rates do bring down inflation over time. \u201cThat will happen here but we need to be patient, we need to stick to the course and then we\u2019ll get to the other side.\u201d City investors are ratching up their expectations for Bank of England interest rate rises, following the shock rise in core inflation. The markets are pricing in that UK interest rates will hit 6% by December, up from 4.5% today. Traders are concluding that the BoE will be very concerned that underlying inflation, and service sector inflation, both rose in May. The odds of a half-point increase tomorrow, when the Bank next sets interest rates, has now jumped to over 40%, according to the price of interest rate swaps. Before the inflation data was released, such a 50-basis point hike tomorrow was seen as a 25% chance. Jake Finney, economist at PwC says: UK inflation has once again come in higher than expected at 8.7% in May. This is higher than the 8.5% consensus and the Bank of England\u2019s forecast of 8.3% in May. More troublingly, core CPI - which is considered to be indicative of underlying inflation pressures - unexpectedly increased to 7.1%. The primary culprit for the higher headline figure was services inflation, which increased from 6.9% to 7.4% due to upward pressure from cultural services. It now seems likely that services inflation will take longer to come down than the time it took to come up, especially with wage growth remaining strong. Higher inflation means that the squeeze on household incomes isn\u2019t over yet, despite strong wage growth. It also cements a rate hike from the Bank of England tomorrow and means an August rate hike is now more likely than not. Today\u2019s inflation numbers are \u201ctruly unfortunate\u201d and show the UK has a \u201cserious inflation problem\u201d, reports Melissa Davies, chief econonomist at Redburn. Davies explains: Inflation in the UK remains \u2018hot\u2019 across the board, with both consumer goods and services keeping up the pressure on prices. One of the reasons US inflation is so much lower, for example, is that durable goods inflation has dropped to zero, but not so for the UK, where core goods and services CPI are both running in the high single-digits. The lagged effects of energy price changes are worth around one percentage point on the headline rate now, which will largely come through in July, but this still leaves the economy with a serious inflation issue (the contribution from fuel prices is already negative). Davies adds that there is \u201ca long way to go to rein UK inflation to heel.\u201d Food price inflation has eased in May, but products still cost much more than a year ago. The inflation rate for food and non-alcoholic beverages dropped to 18.3% in the year to May, down from 19% in April. During May alone, food and non-alcoholic drink prices rose by 0.9% between April and May 2023, compared with a larger 1.5% increase between the same two months a year ago. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says: \u201cIt is a really positive sign that food inflation has fallen for the second consecutive month, the first time this has happened since the Ukraine war began. While some prices continue to rise, we are now seeing regular news reports of falling prices on many essential products, such as loo rolls and vegetable oil. It has been good to see larger drops in inflation rates for flour, milk and eggs as retailers continue to invest heavily in lower prices for the future and locking the price of many essentials, helping the UK to deliver some of the cheapest groceries in Europe. Elsewhere, consumers will find themselves under pressure from increased health and communication costs, as inflation rates in both categories rose in May. Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, says rising wages are fuelling the worrying increase in core inflation in May, to 7.1%. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Fitzner confirms that headline inflation rate was unchanged in May at 8.7%, but adds: In terms of what\u2019s under the bonnet, something that may cause some concern is the continuing rise in core inflation. That excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, which has risen to 7.1%, the highest annual rate in core inflation since March 1992. Fitzner explains that while goods inflation has been heading downwards, prices in the services sector \u2013 such as at cafes, restaurants and hotels \u2013 are rising at a faster pace. That lifted services sector inflation to 7.4% (from 6.9% in April), which is the highest rate \u201cin quite a while\u201d. This increase is probably driven at least in part by increases in wages, Fitzner suggests. [data last week showed regular pay increased by 7.2% in the three months to April, a 20-year high]. Falling prices for motor fuel led to the largest downward contribution to monthly inflation in May. Today\u2019s inflation report shows that motor fuel prices fell by 13.1% in the year to May 2023, compared with a fall of 8.9% in April. Average petrol and diesel prices stood at 144.4p and 154.6p per litre respectively in May, down from 165.9p and 179.7p per litre a year ago. Petrol prices fell by 1.4 pence per litre between April and May 2023, compared with a rise of 4.1 pence per litre between the same two months a year ago. Similarly, diesel prices fell by 7.8 pence per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.6 pence per litre a year ago. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.7% in May alone, keeping the annual rate at 8.7%. The ONS says that \u201crising prices for air travel, recreational and cultural goods and services, and second-hand cars\u201d made the largest upward contributions to the monthly inflation. This chart shows how inflation stuck painfully high at 8.7% last month, having soared during 2022. The inflation rate for goods in the UK has eased a little, from 10.0% per year to 9.7%. But that was wiped out by a rise in service sector inflation, where the annual rate rose from 6.9% to 7.4%. Worryingly, core inflation in the UK has risen. If you strip out volatile factors such as food and energy, underlying inflation increased to 7.1% per year in May, up from 6.8% in April, and higher than expected. That\u2019s highest rate of core inflation since March 1992, which will alarm the Bank of England. Newsflash: UK inflation was unchanged last month, bringing little relief to struggling households. The Consumer Prices Index shows prices rose by 8.7% in the year to May, matching the 8.7% recorded in April, the Office for National Statistics has reported. That is higher than the 8.4% inflation rate forecast by City economists, and adds more pressure onto the Bank of England to keep raising interest rates. Since peaking at 11.1% in October, inflation has dropped a little \u2013 but remains over four times above the BoE\u2019s 25 target. The data comes as the government is under growing pressure to intervene to help millions of households facing a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d of higher mortgage payments ahead of the next election. Pay awards by British employers remained the highest in more than 30 years in the three months to May, keeping pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again on Thursday. Human resources data firm XpertHR said the median basic pay settlement in the March-May quarter remained at 6%. That matches the record increases seen in the five rolling quarters before but well below inflation which stood at 8.7% in April (we\u2019ll find out May\u2019s inflation rate in just a moment\u2026..) Wednesday\u2019s data includes pay awards agreed in April, a key month for pay deals between employers and workers. Sheila Attwood, senior content manager at XpertHR, explains: \u201cAlthough inflation is beginning to fall as we enter the second half of this year, it still lies far ahead of pay rises, meaning employees will remain grappling with the effects of a real-terms pay cut.\u201d Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict inflation will drop to 8.4% in May, but could remain sticky. They say: However, with most of the downward contributions coming from fuels and food the risk is that even as headline inflation falls, services inflation (one of the indicators that the MPC have told us they are looking at for signs of persistent inflationary pressures) rises further from last month\u2019s estimate of 6.9% y/y. Ahead of this data, market pricing for tomorrow\u2019s MPC decision is slightly more toward a 50bp move (32bp priced) than the unanimous expectation of 25bp amongst economists. Today is \u201ccrunch time\u201d, says our economics editor Larry Elliott, who believes today\u2019s inflation bulletin could be the most significant piece of government data published this year. Larry explains: It is crunch time for Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, who want voters to judge the government by the progress it makes in tackling inflation and calming the markets. Halving inflation during 2023 was one of the five new year pledges made by the prime minister in January, but the decline so far has been slower than expected. To have any hope of winning the next election, Sunak and Hunt need interest rates to come down fast. It is crunch time for the Bank, which has the job of hitting the government\u2019s 2% inflation target and is now facing mounting criticism. So far the brickbats have tended to come from those who say the Bank was too slow to respond to price pressures and has allowed inflation to become embedded. But there are also those who say because interest rates work with a lag, the Bank risks driving Britain into a deep recession. Wednesday is also crunch time for the UK\u2019s housing market and the millions of people paying mortgages. The ONS says 57% of those who took out fixed rate home loans did so when rates were below 2%. Those whose deals expire in the coming months will be refinancing at three times those rates. Good morning. One of the most eagerly anticipated pieces of UK economic data in recent years will be released shortly. May\u2019s inflation report, due at 7am, will show if the cost of living crisis eased last month, and influence how high UK interest rates will be raised to slow the economy. Economists expect the annual pace of inflation eased last month, to 8.4% in the year to May. That would be a small, but welcome, drop on April\u2019s 8.7% inflation rate. But it would still mean a painful squeeze on household budgets. Mortgage-holders will be desperate to see inflation fall, as borrowing costs have risen sharply in recent months. Yesterday, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage rose to 6.07%, Moneyfacts reporter, the highest since November. Policymakers at the Bank of England are equally keen to see a slowdown in consumer price rises. The BoE\u2019s target is to keep inflation at 2%, so it is forecast to raise interest rates for the 13th time in a row on Thursday, probably from 4.5% to 4.75%. The BoE will also be looking at the latest figures for core inflation (stripping out food and energy), which is expected to stick at an annual rate of 6.8%. The money markets have indicated UK interest rates could hit 6% by early next year. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, thinks 6% could be unlikely, though: \u201cThursday\u2019s rate rise looks nailed on but what is beginning to filter through to markets is uncertainty about what comes next.

Surely nothing can stop the Tartan Army\u2019s march towards world domination, not even acts of God? The summery element to the clock was misleading because all the south side of Glasgow had been hit by torrential rain, leaving a waterlogged pitch. Not that Scotland minded. They showed the world a brand of football they could never know: thrashing the ball through puddles. Callum McGregor gave them an early lead in the sixth minute before referee Istv\u00e1n Vad tooted and took the teams off to dry themselves in the changing rooms while sturdy men \u2013 and the ball boys \u2013 came on to play their role of 12th man with various instruments to push surface water off the pitch with gusto for 90 minutes. While the hard work was being done outside, Georgia were, allegedly, telling officials they did not fancy playing in a bit of drizzle. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck, we\u2019re stuck, we\u2019re stuck,\u201d they cried from the Hampden foyer while pointing at the rain. Eventually they were pushed out on to the pitch by Uefa suits to continue their drubbing by the conditions and a force of nature (a second goal from Scott McTominay). Even Serie A\u2019s leading light Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had no answer for the Scots, whacking a late penalty over to ensure Georgia could not even muster a consolation. Scotland have now beaten Spain, Erling Haaland\u2019s Norway and Cyprus on their way to heading the group. Stevey\u2019s Tartan Army are on the march.

FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS The references to The Decemberists\u2019 \u2018June Hymn\u2019 in Monday\u2019s opening and last line reminded me of \u2018The Rake\u2019s Song\u2019, a (thoroughly disturbing) tale of a man who enters into a partnership, expands that partnership, resents the lack of freedom and so destroys what he has created. It\u2019s probably a stretch to see this as a metaphor for wealthy outsiders targeting football, expanding it for their benefit, getting bored/unhappy and then tearing down what they have created. After all, that would surely never happen with certain owners of certain clubs, who definitely want to be a long-term, supportive partner, and want to put the needs of football and football supporters before their own\u201d \u2013 Will Reddie. Re: Monday\u2019s Football Daily. I hope you will not ignore that rather than England, who are for whatever reason the focus of the article, it was the likes of the Scottish FA and Football Association of Ireland that were the driving forces behind expanding the European Championship from 16 to 24 teams. You\u2019ll be shocked to learn those bodies also supported Fifa expanding its World Cup to 48 teams. Personally, I miss the previous 16-team European tournament, when qualifying had some jeopardy, even if it meant England missing out in 2008.

Sarah Finch is challenging Surrey county council\u2019s decision to extend permission for a well at Horse Hill, near Gatwick airport in the Surrey countryside, which taps a subterranean reservoir developers believe may contain millions of barrels of oil. The case turns on the interpretation of rules surrounding planners\u2019 drafting of environmental impact assessments. The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils\u2019 end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced. She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case. A victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction. Ahead of the case, Finch said: \u201cThe biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that these \u2018downstream\u2019 GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.\u201d The proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,\u201d said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch. \u201cThe supreme court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted. There is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.\u201d Lawyers for Surrey county council dispute Finch\u2019s claim, arguing her approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements was \u201cmisguided\u201d. Mr Justice Holgate considered the case in 2020 and dismissed Finch\u2019s claim for a judicial review of planning permission granted by Surrey county council. Lord Justice Lewison, Sir Keith Lindblom and Lord Justice Moylan dismissed Finch\u2019s appeal in 2022. Such is the significance of the case, West Cumbria mining, the company behind plans for a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria, has submitted its own intervention. The outcome of Finch\u2019s case could seriously affect the future of the proposed mine, which as yet does not include downstream emissions in its impact assessment. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Office for Environmental Protection have also intervened, on Finch\u2019s behalf. Outside the supreme court on Wednesday, Danny Gross, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the case was part of a long struggle to hold the fossil fuel industry to account. \u201cIt will set a crucial precedent that before any fossil fuel project goes ahead the full climate impacts need to be taken into account, because the emissions from extracting the fossil fuels are tiny in comparison to the emissions from burning them,\u201d he said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fe9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/21/die-on-stage-nathan-lane-josette-simon-", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018God, I really need a pint after that\u2019: actors on the toll of dying on stage night after night", "lead": "What\u2019s it like to expire every evening, often in devastating, drawn-out scenes?

But for actors, it can be a regular occurrence. On stage, their character\u2019s demise may come with a sudden gunshot or be devastatingly drawn out and come with a rousing speech. But how does it feel to die night after night after night in such roles? In the National Theatre\u2019s 2017 production of Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, Nathan Lane played Roy Cohn, the real-life political fixer who denied his diagnosis of Aids until the very end. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s indestructible,\u201d says Lane, who faced a double challenge. In the play, Cohn attempts to get the last laugh by faking his own death, before the real one comes along. Lane was required to lie in a hospital bed on stage. \u201cI pulled out an IV,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand this blood would spurt out. And I had to have these body tremors. It has an effect on you psychologically. There\u2019s something about lying in a hospital bed and gown. You do start to feel sick.\u201d Playing Richard III for the Royal Shakespeare Company last year, Arthur Hughes found himself hyperventilating from the \u201cheadrush\u201d of his death scene, surrounded by the ghosts of men he has murdered. \u201cThe end is a real acceleration,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI was barefoot, covered in armour, ranting, raving, running, fighting. It ratchets up and up until he\u2019s dead \u2013 and then it just stops.\u201d Later, the play\u2019s abrupt ending would catch up with him. \u201cSome nights we\u2019d go to the Dirty Duck, the pub over the road, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018God, I really need a pint after that.\u2019 But I soon found out that wasn\u2019t the thing to do.\u201d His head was too noisy. \u201cI\u2019d never played a character where I needed to \u2018de-role\u2019 before, but I had to create a ritual to take it all off.\u201d He would sit on a cushion repeating gentle mantras to himself, shedding the angst that builds to Richard\u2019s death. \u201cI just needed some stillness. I found that if I didn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d Patrick Vaill has been dying nightly, on and off, for 16 years. Death haunts Jud Fry, the lonesome outsider he plays in Daniel Fish\u2019s illuminating revival of Oklahoma!, currently playing in London\u2019s West End. It\u2019s a role Vaill first took in 2007 at college. In one scene, Curly taunts him with the idea that, in death, Jud will have what he has always wanted: to be loved. \u201cDeath is presented to him almost in a romantic way,\u201d Vaill explains. \u201cIt comes as a sort of softening.\u201d When death finally arrives, it is staged somewhat abstractly. \u201cWe don\u2019t do a literal, \u2018I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m bleeding, slow collapse.\u2019 What we shoot for is the emotional reality, the intellectual reality.\u201d Once on the floor, he lets his body relax. \u201cIt\u2019s an almost meditative moment of taking care of yourself, which is oddly similar to what death is presented as, to Jud.\u201d The sense of peace doesn\u2019t last long. \u201cHalfway through the Broadway run, I started to feel the weight of doing this every single day,\u201d says Vaill. \u201cEverything was tight, so I talked to a physical therapist.\u201d The physio made a clear connection between the emotional performance and the physical consequences. \u201cI was reminded by this doctor that, yes, your brain knows that this is fake, you\u2019re not dead, this is your job, this is a story. However, your body hears a bang every night; your body is crying; your body is simulating fear.\u201d Can it be that in an intensive performance of death, the body starts to believe it\u2019s real? Like Hughes, Vaill had to find ways of coping. He showers straight after the show. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d he laughs, \u201cit washes off the blood. But a hot shower reminds your body: this is fake, these are your friends, you love doing this, and at the end of the day, you\u2019re playing.\u201d Theatre may be an ephemeral art form but the physical and mental repercussions of performing over a long period can last. If you were doing the same performance for a film or a TV programme, says Vaill, you could \u201cwreck yourself\u201d, but that simply isn\u2019t possible in theatre. \u201cYou have to do it eight times a week, hopefully for months and months.\u201d As a result, you can\u2019t let the intensity of it all affect your home life. The aftercare of performance is critical, he says, to reassure your mind and body that you are safe. \u201cThat kind of stuff becomes as important as doing your vocal warm-up before the show.\u201d For Josette Simon, getting into the role of Cleopatra at the RSC in 2017 was a far longer and more involved process than getting out of it: she found her mindset would change daily at around 3pm. Cleopatra takes her own life with a poisonous asp. \u201cShe\u2019s right in the middle of the line,\u201d Simon says. \u201cSo I thought she should die with her eyes open.\u201d Doing so upright in her throne, directly facing the audience, was not the easiest dramatic choice. \u201cI made a rod for my own back,\u201d she admits, \u201cbecause I then had to spend the whole of Charmian\u2019s speech with my eyes open, not blinking.\u201d In rehearsal, her eyes would start streaming in seconds. \u201cBut I trained the muscles around my eyes. Every day, I would sit incrementally longer with my eyes like that. Occasionally in production I would feel a tear coming and I\u2019d think, \u2018Come on Charmian, get on with the speech!\u2019\u201d Today, Simon says with a sly smile, she believes she could still win any staring contest. \u201cI\u2019ve got it down to a fine art.\u201d Describing the way she would get into the character, Simon sees no separation between herself and the role. But in that moment of death, when there are no more thoughts in the character\u2019s head for her to imagine, she would drift back to herself. She found it vaguely meditative, focusing on her breathing after the storm she had just delivered. \u201cI was usually quite tired by this point, too,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s three hours and 15 minutes on the stage with extremely long speeches.\u201d Unlike Vaill and Hughes, Simon didn\u2019t have a nightly ritual to shake off the part and her death. For her, she says, \u201cthe character ends at the curtain call. It\u2019s the end of that page and every night is a new page, as if you\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d Although Simon would like to think a theatrical performance engaged with death might spark meaningful conversations off stage, she doesn\u2019t really believe this happened. \u201cWe as a culture are terrible at talking about death,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t even say the word. We can\u2019t take the terror out of it.\u201d This fear of death took centre stage in Victoria Melody\u2019s 2017 show Ugly Chief. When Melody\u2019s father, Mike, was misdiagnosed with a terminal illness, he asked her to organise his funeral. She went one step further and trained to become a funeral director. Together they turned the surreal experience of planning your own sendoff into an anarchic show that aimed to open up a conversation about death. Indeed, a funeral \u201cis like a sad theatre show\u201d, Melody says. \u201cA lot of pomp and creativity goes into making it a dramatic experience.\u201d In making the show together, they dug up topics they had avoided for years. He scrapped the initial eulogy she wrote for him because it made him into a saint, when in fact he\u2019d been, she realised, a \u201cchain-smoking, angry, depressed man who played Football Manager all day, so I left home at 16\u201d. Instead, they wrote his eulogy together. \u201cWe had people write to us after the show,\u201d Melody remembers. \u201cWe had a dad who said it made him get in touch with his estranged son and mend their relationship, and we had an email from the son saying thank you.\u201d The act of creating the show was transformational for her own dad, too. \u201cHe\u2019d been an alcoholic my whole life,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAfter that tour, he stopped drinking. I don\u2019t think it changed his attitude to death, but I do think it made him want to live longer.\u201d On Broadway, Nathan Lane recently performed opposite Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in Pictures from Home, a play based on photographer Larry Sultan\u2019s moving book about his ageing parents. Does taking part in another show about grief make Lane think more about his own mortality? \u201cSure,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cbut I don\u2019t need a play to do that. I think about death all the time. The more you see contemporaries die, you really think, boy, you just have to appreciate every moment.\u201d He points to one of Wanamaker\u2019s lines in Pictures from Home: \u201cOf course I\u2019m terrified of it, but we\u2019re all going to die. Hopefully, you do it well.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fea", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/glastonbury-2023-festival-officially-begins-amid-torrential-downpours", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glastonbury 2023: festival officially begins amid torrential downpours", "lead": "Wet weather forecast to ease by Friday, when there is doubt over whether headliners Arctic Monkeys will perform", "author": "Tobi Thomas", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:22:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224506", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/315213c95ee620f73152d3cebbc52e710d185001/0_324_4227_2536/500.jpg", "body": "The UK\u2019s biggest festival has officially begun with the founder greeting attendees at the gates amid a burst of torrential rain.

More than 200,000 people are expected to attend. \u201cWelcome to Glastonbury,\u201d the co-organiser Emily Eavis said, addressing thousands of queuing festivalgoers. Speaking to the PA Media news agency, Eavis said it felt good to greet the crowd. \u201cI love welcoming people in \u2013 it\u2019s always my favourite moment.\u201d Michael Eavis, the co-founder of the festival, was seen in a red Land Rover near to where his daughter officially opened the gates. The festival has had a wet start, as heavy rainfall and showers began at Worthy Farm on Wednesday morning. A torrential downpour lasted for about 15 minutes from 11.30am before easing to slow, consistent rainfall, but forecasters are expecting wet weather at the site in Somerset to ease as the music begins on Friday. Edyta Krzesak, 45, a music photographer from Minehead, Somerset, who is attending her eighth Glastonbury in a row, was caught in the heavy downpour in just a T-shirt. \u201cI would say it\u2019s been the whole week in one day,\u201d Krzesak said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fresh morning, kind of breezy. It was cold when I woke up, then it was extremely hot when I had my breakfast, then it kind of cooled down. Now look at me, I don\u2019t have even my waterproof coat, I left them at my tent thinking I will not need them and I\u2019m soaking wet.\u201d Kathy and Tony Sharp, both in their 50s and from Liverpool, decided to attend the festival on a recommendation from their daughter. \u201cOur daughter came last year for the first time, so she came home and was raving, and it\u2019s on Tony\u2019s bucket list,\u201d Kathy Sharp said. \u201cI think [her] experience made us more eager to try and get the tickets.\u201d There has been speculation regarding whether Arctic Monkeys will be able to headline the Pyramid stage on Friday as scheduled, given that the band cancelled a performance in Dublin on Tuesday due to Alex Turner having acute laryngitis.

Given the frequent tone changes for the series \u2013 this one boasts an obvious Game of Thrones influence and a mature age rating \u2013 it\u2019s an open question, but fans come back for more than just chocobos and moogles. For me, Final Fantasy is more of a mood. Other fans can rest easy \u2013 there is still much of the series\u2019 DNA in Final Fantasy XVI, and that is ultimately what helps the game through its weaker moments. The game radiates a sense of care, in its themes and in the way characters treat one another. Like Final Fantasy VII, it reminds us that we have one planet to live on and that we should treat one another with kindness. Sure there is swearing and violence, but they are genuine expressions of desperation and surprise, and they feel earned. Who wouldn\u2019t swear at seeing a monster the size of a mountain raze everything in its path? FFXVI is also full of gratifying little nods to the series\u2019 history \u2013 the victory fanfare is back and it is glorious, seeing fan-favourite monsters become serious opponents is as exciting as it was in Final Fantasy VII Remake, and this game\u2019s Cid is the best Cid since Final Fantasy VII, if not ever. At 15, protagonist Clive Rosfield is a guard to his brother Joshua. Even though Clive is older, Joshua is set to inherit his family\u2019s throne because he is a Dominant, a person who can control powerful monsters called Eikons, and even transform into one. As the Dominant of Fire, Joshua can use devastating magic; Clive, who can only throw a few puny fireballs, is worse than useless to his scheming mother. People like him, called Bearers, are usually enslaved from birth, all for the crime of being able to use magic without the aid of a crystal. But during a mission gone wrong, Joshua is killed by a mysterious second Dominant of Fire who by all accounts shouldn\u2019t exist and their kingdom is taken over. Thirteen years later, Clive, now enslaved, is on a mission to avenge his brother. Final Fantasy XVI is a story of nations clashing over territory and resources, a recurring theme for the series. The crystals and their magic lead to questions of ecological sustainability and free will, both of which have been at the heart of FF since its inception. However, the tone-change masks that FFXVI is the kind of story the series has told several times before \u2013 and gets told in similar ways in many western games besides. Realistic high fantasy may be new territory for Final Fantasy, but not necessarily for its players. And it\u2019s sad that in the pursuit of \u201crealistic\u201d fantasy, the FF team has erased people of colour from their own history of slavery \u2013 they are absent from the game. Worse, there is a desert region, complete with some stereotypical oriental music, occupied by lightly tanned characters with clearly western features. It feels as if the amount of care taken with other aspects of the game wasn\u2019t extended to people of colour, and that stings. Where it took FFXV a film, a game, several expansions and a few books to piece its world together, here characters constantly put events into context, share anecdotes or react to changes that you bring about. You have a historian, a strategist and something called Active Time Lore at your disposal \u2013 the last one is akin to Amazon Prime Video\u2019s X-ray feature, and lets you look up information about characters, locations and concepts during cutscenes. It\u2019s a dream for fans of in-game lore, but the amount of ground there is to cover also results in uneven pacing. Even short gameplay sequences are regularly bracketed by drawn out cutscenes in which characters pore over a map. These scenes had me itching to pick the controller up again, and they spend a long time telling you how urgent the situation is, which feels ironic. But as a result, Clive, who may come across as taciturn at first, is probably the most well-rounded, loving and emotive character since FFX\u2019s Tidus, with the difference that this time around players may actually like him. Final Fantasy thrives on likable protagonists and their relationships with each other, and Clive, who makes a lot of friends over the course of the game, is the perfect mix of cool and affable. The combat feels like the final form of the free-roaming hack and slash battles Square Enix has experimented with ever since Final Fantasy XIII. You have a ranged magic attack, sword attacks, two special attacks that use the power of an Eikon and commands for your faithful hound, Torgal. Most attacks can be charged for more damage, and eventually Clive acquires a limit break that makes him even more powerful for a short period of time. It\u2019s thanks to combat design veteran Ryota Suzuki, who worked on games such as Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon\u2019s Dogma, that juggling all of these options feels smooth, and well-timed strings of combos turn smaller enemies into defenceless ragdolls. However, unless you are the kind of player that enjoys experimenting with attacks and achieving flawless combos, the novelty inevitably wears off. Devil May Cry is great but it\u2019s also not 40 hours long. While Clive learns some additional skills and attacks to make new combos with, you end up executing the same attacks and patterns a lot, especially since bosses have ridiculously capacious health bars. The stagger system from Final Fantasy VII Remake is vital to make it through \u2013 if you continuously attack enemies so that they can\u2019t retaliate, they end up \u201cstaggered\u201d, taking increased damage while completely unable to fight. Still, you spend a lot of time bashing nonsense numbers out of big monsters and battles feel overly long. This criticism could of course apply to any game above a certain length, but fights in Final Fantasy XVI can easily devolve into an onslaught of magical explosions and heavy, persistent motion blur that is unclear and unpleasant on the eye. Battles are frequently ridiculously bombastic, even for a Final Fantasy. If you don\u2019t believe that there can be too much action, too big an enemy, too many phases to a battle, this game might change your mind. The dichotomy between this excess and the naturalistic Game of Thrones approach to the world and characters is jarring, and it might have benefited the game to rein things in a bit. Level design is not Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s strong point. Impressive-looking castles turn out to be linear tunnels while large, open swathes of field or marsh or desert extend between them. While towns are now higher in number and hold more people than in Final Fantasy XV, they are little more than hubs in which quest givers patiently wait for you to rescue them, and the outside world remains devoid of life. See a tower in the distance? The door is closed. Found treasure? It\u2019s almost always an item for the barebones crafting system. Unlike in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, for instance, there are no secrets that you can organically uncover, and side quests are a simple matter of following an objective marker, taking out whatever monster awaits you at your destination, and then fast-travelling back. As much as Square Enix clearly tried to get me invested in the side quests by offering little narrative arcs, most of these stories aren\u2019t engaging, and where tedious quests meet minor rewards, disappointment is inevitable. Final Fantasy needed surprise encounters and real incentives for players to explore its wider world, but you\u2019re back to swathes of empty land. Side quests that unlock something special, such as upgraded curatives, do exist, but they are marked with their own symbol, another item to tick off the list. Final Fantasy XVI is the series at its most spectacular, for good and bad. However, Square Enix has taken a lot of the criticism aimed at previous games into account, and the battles offer more freedom, the characters are fleshed out, and thanks to detailed world-building, you finally get the sense again that there is a world out there that needs saving. \u2022 Final Fantasy XVI is released on 22 June, \u00a364.99."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fec", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2023/jun/21/the-children-of-windrush-they-told-us-youre-people-of-the-world-thats-what-matters-not-skin-colour", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The children of Windrush: \u2018They told us: you\u2019re people of the world, that\u2019s what matters, not skin colour\u2019", "lead": "On the 75th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush, the children of its passengers tell of an enduring legacy", "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 14:00:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224540", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0592c72018136caab1c5e9a5902d5631de25ea14/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "On the day Empire Windrush arrived in Britain in June 1948, 11 Labour MPs sent a letter to the prime minister, Clement Attlee, proposing that there should be controls on black immigration. The British people were \u201cblest by the absence of a colour racial problem\u201d, they wrote, adding: \u201cAn influx of coloured people domiciled here is likely to impair the harmony, strength and cohesion of our people and social life and cause discord and unhappiness among all concerned.\u201d The arrival of the ship, carrying about 500 people from the Caribbean, had already been the subject of an anxious debate in parliament. The Daily Express described its approach as \u201ca shipload of worry\u201d. But within a few years, for many of the passengers the huge significance of that journey had receded to such an extent that they did not tell even their children they had arrived in Britain on that ship. Mel Gaynor, the musician best known as the drummer for Simple Minds, had no idea his father, George, was a passenger on Empire Windrush until long after his death. \u201cMy father didn\u2019t talk about it, which feels sad now,\u201d he says. Sheine Peart, a university lecturer, only began to appreciate the importance of her father\u2019s journey when a teaching colleague was awestruck when she mentioned it in passing. \u201cShe said: \u2018He came over on Empire Windrush? That\u2019s like touching history.\u2019\u201d During their childhoods, the huge cultural import of their parents\u2019 journey was not in the least obvious to many children of Windrush passengers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t seen as a particularly historic. It would have been like talking about a flight you\u2019ve taken. They didn\u2019t realise it was such a momentous event,\u201d says Deyon Johnston, director of a recruitment company , whose father, Clinton Johnston, was on the ship. It is only in later life that the children of the Windrush passengers have begun to appreciate the enormity of the decision made, usually by their fathers, to emigrate to the UK. \u201cI feel pride that he was one of those pioneers. My father had 10 shillings, a cardboard suitcase and a few bits of clothing to start forging his life here,\u201d Sheine\u2019s brother, Icah Peart, a criminal defence KC, says. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had the money to go back if he hadn\u2019t liked it. They were really brave coming here, entering an unknown world.\u201d \u2018When he broke out into Jamaican patois, I knew it was serious\u2019 \u2013 Mel Gaynor In interviews with 12 children of eight Windrush passengers, it quickly becomes clear the Labour MPs\u2019 doom-mongering warnings of impending \u201cdiscord and unhappiness\u201d were misplaced. The descendants of the Windrush arrivals witnessed their parents experiencing huge challenges in building new lives here, but say there were few regrets. The children have gone on to be barristers, headteachers, carers, civil servants, musicians, social workers, academics, hoteliers, shop workers, bankers, actors, surgeons, parents and grandparents. Conversations about their fathers\u2019 decision to spend \u00a328.10 on a ticket \u2013 the equivalent of six months\u2019 wages in Jamaica, or the proceeds of selling three cows \u2013 are mostly very cheerful appraisals of busy, complicated lives, filled with admiration, gratitude and pride. But despite a determination to celebrate their lives, memories of the deep hostility they encountered remain acute. As young children, most began only gradually to realise their families were different. \u201cMy father was very gentrified, English during the weekdays \u2013 immaculately dressed, suited and booted \u2013 but at the weekends we\u2019d all go to gatherings with his friends and there was more of a Jamaican spirit,\u201d says Gaynor. His father\u2019s Jamaican accent only came out around his friends or when he was angry with his children. \u201cI remember falling in the river in my brand new clothes which got destroyed. He broke out into Jamaican patois. I knew then: OK, this is serious.\u201d Johnston and her brother Errol, a retired Church of England pensions board employee, knew their father was feeling homesick when he took them to Portobello Road in London to buy ackee and plantain. \u201cAvocado pears were very expensive then. He used to buy them and hide them on the top shelf in the pantry. We weren\u2019t allowed to touch them. He might give us a little slice, but he was desperate for a taste of home,\u201d Errol says. They noticed how their father would talk to other black people on the tube and on buses when they rode around London with him. \u201cWe assumed he knew them but he was just glad to see a fellow stranger in this country,\u201d says Errol. Clinton was very outgoing. \u201cHe was always making friends. It was embarrassing \u2013 he\u2019d always be starting conversations. He was always the loudest in the room,\u201d says Deyon. \u201cHe was quite confident, but as I get older I wonder if it was false bravado because he was in a foreign country,\u201d Errol says. \u201cAs if he wanted his personality to come out first before you saw the colour.\u201d Gloria Brothwood says when her father, Andrew Mowlah-Baksh, was missing home he would complain about his chilblains and talk longingly about the heat in Trinidad; he would put on swing music and calypso, or take the children out to the park to fly kites he had made from the newspaper. \u201cYou could tell from his demeanour. He used to type airmail letters to his sisters, he said you could fit more in that way than with handwriting. They were always sending photos to each other, they never lost touch. We didn\u2019t have a phone at the time so there was always a letter in the pipeline.\u201d Howard Gardner remembers his grandmother sending rum cake in a parcel for her son Alford, who like many Windrush passengers had served in the RAF during the war and had travelled back to England after a brief return to the Caribbean. \u201cHe would have a slice of it. You couldn\u2019t eat much of it \u2013 it was very strong.\u201d \u2018Her mother was completely racist. She didn\u2019t accept our dad\u2019 \u2013 Errol Johnson As they grew older, the children of the Windrush arrivals who had married white women noticed that some of their English relatives had initially not entirely welcomed their fathers into their families. Clinton, Errol and Deyon Johnston\u2019s father, met their mother, a white typist from west London, at the Paramount in Tottenham Court Road, a dancehall decorated with palm trees. \u201cHer mother was completely racist. She didn\u2019t accept our dad. I never saw the two of them together,\u201d Errol says. \u201cNone of our mother\u2019s relatives attended her wedding,\u201d Sheine Peart remembers. \u201cThey were worried about what it would mean for her, being with a black man, because it was a complete break in the way things had happened. They would have been more comfortable if she\u2019d married someone from the local printing works in Bath, not someone who had come thousands of miles and was unknown and unquantifiable. There was fear and trepidation. It took them a while to realise he wasn\u2019t a bad bloke.\u201d Jean Thompson\u2019s grandfather on her mother\u2019s side was an Indonesian Muslim foundry owner in Liverpool. He and her grandmother were at first opposed to her mother\u2019s marriage to Wayne Armstrong, a double bass player from Jamaica. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t accepted by my nan\u2019s family whatsoever, so Mum cut herself off. But the minute the first daughter was born, her mum was straight up the hospital and it was all mended. We lived next door to each other and were in and out of each other\u2019s houses.\u201d He went on to have seven daughters with his wife, children who have grown up to work for the NHS, become social workers and run their own businesses. \u201cHe taught us: if there are barriers in the way, leap over them,\u201d says Thompson, who was the first black civil servant in the Liverpool unemployment office. \u201cHe taught us ambition, that if there was an opportunity, you must take it. We always thought, if Dad could have travelled 2,000 miles from Jamaica, why should we be scared of a challenge?\u201d The family grew up in a white area of Liverpool, where it was common to see the words \u201cblacks go home\u201d scrawled on the walls. Thompson remembers her schoolfriends trying to shield her from it. \u201cWhen I saw the N-word on the wall near my home, my friends put chalk over it to hide the word.\u201d Sheine Peart says they were the first family of colour in Reading. Her father had found landlords were reluctant to rent to him, so he saved and bought a family house in a very white area. \u201cGrowing up there were some bizarre assumptions made about us as a family. I remember the people across the road had some difficulties with the police, but the police would assume it was something to do with us. There was an assumption from the neighbours that we would go to the less academically able schools. When my mum said I\u2019d be going to the grammar school, the neighbours asked: how did that happen?\u201d Icah Peart remembers the day when someone spat at Sheine in her pushchair. \u201cI think my dad would have killed the person who did it if my mum hadn\u2019t stopped him. He was an extremely protective dad. He wasn\u2019t prepared to let anyone slight him.\u201d Mowlah-Baksh met his Dublin-born wife, Theresa, at a dance in Birmingham when he was serving in the RAF during the second world war. He returned to England on Empire Windrush and they married in 1949. He worked for Rover as a clerk, and they had five children. \u201cBeing a mixed couple in the 1950s, it must have been a lot, there must have been racism, but they didn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Brothwood, a carer in Birmingham, says. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that we grew up in a happy home so they worked really hard to protect us from it, so we never saw the harsh side of things.\u201d She remembers being vaguely aware of uncomfortable moments at school. \u201cThe home economics teacher made me feel one inch tall once,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to do woodwork, but she told me: \u2018You have to do cooking and sewing.\u2019 I told her: I can already cook and I can sew. She said: \u2018Is there anything the natives can\u2019t do?\u2019\u201d She says she didn\u2019t have the language to classify it mentally it as racism, and only realised years later why it had upset her. Her brother, also called Andrew Mowlah-Baksh, says: \u201cI remember Enoch Powell\u2019s speech when I was 13 or 14, inciting people to have a bad attitude towards race. I remember wishing I could run faster, to get away from lads with an attitude.\u201d But the family was happy, the children were popular and their parents taught them to shrug off the occasional bits of malice. \u201cThey told us it was a good thing: you\u2019re people of the world, you\u2019ve got relations from every country, that\u2019s what matters, not the colour of skin,\u201d Brothwood says. Gaynor remembers the sudden proliferation of National Front posters when he was a teenager in the 1970s. \u201cI was attacked by sixth-formers when I was about 13. It wasn\u2019t serious enough to leave a scar, but it left a mental scar \u2013 making me less trusting, more aware of my surroundings, aware of the no-go areas.\u201d Thompson realised quite early on that her father faced difficulties that her friends\u2019 parents did not encounter. \u201cI can remember we had a TV that broke; he was good at fixing things, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. He had a friend who was an electrician so he put it in the pram and wheeled it around to him. Later he came home all flustered. He had been stopped by the police. To see my dad flustered was very sad.\u201d There was a generational shift between how she and her father viewed being targeted by the police. \u201cI can remember when I started to drive, the numbers of times I got pulled over by a policeman. My dad would say: \u2018Don\u2019t get angry, this will change in time.\u2019 For him, it was a minor inconvenience and his reasoning was: changes will come. But when you are a young angry black person who was born here, you just want the same as what your friends have and not to be harassed by the people who you thought were there to help you.\u201d But she notes that her father was right \u2013 changes have come. \u201cA few days ago someone asked me: \u2018Where were you born?\u2019 I said: \u2018Liverpool\u201d. They said: \u2018No, I mean where were you before that?\u2019 But it doesn\u2019t happen very often now, and it\u2019s usually the older generation,\u201d she says. \u2018He came over to ensure we would have a better chance than he did\u2019 \u2013 Icah Peart As they grew older they became more aware of the sacrifices their fathers had made in the hope of building better lives for their children, even if this was a subject they never spoke about. Many of them took jobs below the level they might have had in the Caribbean. Armstrong, Thompson\u2019s father, was a qualified engineer and also a talented musician but was unable to work in either of those fields. \u201cHe went to a good school in Jamaica, he could speak Latin. I think he wasn\u2019t expecting to do the work that he ended up doing, but he was a modest man. He worked as a dock labourer in the Liverpool docks for 27 years,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just sweeping to begin with but later they realised he had a brain.\u201d In the evenings he played double bass in bands at local clubs. \u201cHis heart was in jazz. He always said there is no racial or social divide in music. He was hugely loved, a big part of the community. There were so many people at my father\u2019s funeral the crematorium didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Clinton Johnston worked as a driver for Findus foods and delivered magazines for Fleet Street publishers in London. \u201cHe was far more educated than the jobs he was doing, but I think there were only so many knocks you could take, so in the end he said: I\u2019ll just be a driver then,\u201d Errol Johnston says. They remember many of their father\u2019s friends being in much worse situations. \u201cWe were in a council flat, so we had heating and hot water, but whenever we went to visit them in Notting Hill Gate and Ladbroke Grove, they were living in squalid bedsits. We\u2019d sometimes keep our coats on it was so cold,\u201d says Deyon Johnston. Errol thinks his father and his friends coped by laughing at the slights they encountered. \u201cThey\u2019d talk about the racism. We were kids, and listening, but not really paying attention. But I remember they would joke about it, they\u2019d be killing themselves with laughter about it. It didn\u2019t seem to faze them.\u201d Somehow their parents\u2019 ambitions \u2013 though thwarted for them \u2013 were nevertheless implanted into their children. Gaynor\u2019s father, George had been a respected trumpeter in Jamaica, but never spoke about it with his children and found a good job as an engineer in London. He taught his son trumpet from the age of about six, until Mel discovered a drum kit at school and switched. \u201cHe played the trumpet at home and we listened to Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald \u2013 nothing Jamaican, mainly jazz \u2013 but at the start he didn\u2019t encourage me to become a musician. \u201cHe said: \u2018It\u2019s not a sensible career. You need to get a career, son.\u2019 But when he saw that I was absolutely adamant about playing drums and wanting to become a musician, then he helped me enormously. I was spending six hours a day rehearsing in the garden shed driving the neighbours mad. He used to take me to a lot of concerts \u2013 that was life-changing.\u201d On the Windrush manifest, Ralph Peart, passenger No 811, is described as a French polisher, but he worked in Britain as an electrician. and when he retired he was working at Heathrow airport. As a child in Jamaica he had to walk to Kingston to sell vegetables. \u201cThat was a challenge he didn\u2019t want for his children. He saw education as the passport out of that. He had huge ambitions for us,\u201d Sheine Peart says. \u201cHe was very keen for me to be a lawyer. Very, very keen,\u201d Icah Peart adds, remembering the copious, unasked-for advice his father would give him about trials he was involved with. \u201cIt was pretty obvious that he would have liked to be a lawyer. He wanted his children to succeed. He came over to ensure that his descendants would have a better chance than he did.\u201d His father took huge pride in his children\u2019s achievements. \u201cHe was protective and supportive, always on your side. I couldn\u2019t have wanted for a better dad.\u201d \u2018They were the first step on the ladder, showing people difference is nothing to be scared of\u2019 \u2013 Gloria Brothwood For some of the children the government\u2019s pointed determination to celebrate the Windrush anniversary this year has left a slightly sour taste. Guilt over the Windrush scandal \u2013 in which thousands of people from the Caribbean were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants \u2013 prompted the announcement by the government of funding for annual Windrush day celebrations. The scandal, which affected people from all over the Commonwealth, most of whom arrived in the 1950s and 60s, and which only acquired the Windrush name as a useful shorthand, complicated the lives of some of the families who arrived on the ship. Until interviewed by the Guardian, Gloria and Andrew\u2019s brother, Joseph Mowlah-Baksh, had struggled for decades to be issued with a passport; the Home Office is now processing his papers. Armstrong travelled abroad only once, when he went with his wife and the two youngest of their seven daughters on a bingo club coach trip to Spain in 1983, travelling on cheaper temporary British passports, which were available for short trips. On his way back he was taken off the coach at Calais and held in custody for several hours because the French border guards refused to accept he was British. \u201cMy father felt anxiety about travelling after that. He never visited Jamaica again because he was worried about being unable to return home to his family. He was a devoted husband, and he wouldn\u2019t have taken the risk,\u201d Thompson says. But, mostly, the Windrush arrivals\u2019 children want to put the anger and disappointments and challenges facing their parents to one side and focus on the positives. Sheine Peart says her father rarely paused to reflect on the immense historical shift to which he contributed. \u201cOf course there were black people in Britain 2,000 years ago, but this was the first big influx of Caribbean immigrants. He was aware that he was part of a significant change, but his direct experience of that change was sometimes quite negative and challenging. His way of managing was not to talk about it; you had to prise things out of him. I\u2019m pleased this is not a forgotten, marginalised piece of history. It\u2019s good it has been pushed to the forefront. The Caribbean people have made such a significant contribution.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to celebrate this moment \u2013 which doesn\u2019t make us blind to the tragedy of people waiting to be acknowledged after being here for 50 years,\u201d says Lesley Ewen, a playwright, actor and tutor at Rada. Her father, Sydney Mowatt, passenger No 791, became a research scientist with the Wellcome Foundation before returning to Jamaica. \u201cIt needs to be celebrated. They had epic courage.\u201d Gloria Brothwood adds: \u201cThey were the first step on the ladder, in terms of changing minds, showing people that everyone has something to offer, that difference is nothing to be scared of.\u201d Design by the Guardian editorial design team: Chris Clarke, Harry Fischer, Ellen Wishart, Alessia Amitrano, Tara Herman"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fed", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/iranian-women-farnaz-damnabis-best-photograph", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Iranian women asleep on a bus \u2026 Farnaz Damnabi\u2019s best photograph", "lead": "\u2018As you can tell by their closed eyes, all the women around me that day were exhausted.

I took this on my way home from work after a tiring day. I work for one of Iran\u2019s news agencies, where my duties include editing other photographers\u2019 reportage and shooting on assignment. On the bus that day, the women around me, as you can tell by their closed eyes, were also exhausted. I took it discreetly with my iPhone, and I knew straight away that it was a powerful image. It speaks to a sense of loneliness \u2013 the isolation that comes with working in the capital, an issue for all workers regardless of gender. The black and white accentuates that feeling. Its formal composition, the sense of movement and strong diagonals also make it striking. Behind is the Chamran Expressway against the Alborz mountain range and the Milad Tower \u2013 one of the city\u2019s most recognisable landmarks. The tallest tower in Iran and the sixth tallest telecommunication tower in the world, it has become a symbol of Tehran. Although initial construction plans began in the mid-70s under the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, it wasn\u2019t built until long after the 1979 revolution, when Iran became an \u201cIslamic republic\u201d. Since the revolution, it has been mandatory for women to wear the hijab in public. Religious women wear the chador, a full body-length veil, but even if you are not religious, all women over the age of nine are required to cover their hair with a veil. The law is enforced by the government and morality police. My photography attempts to give Iranian women visibility. It is likely that many of the women on the bus are civil servants or clerical workers, but also wives and mothers. This shot signifies the central presence, yet alienation, of women in Iranian society. The weight of their situation can be read on their faces. I truly believe women in my country must be superheroes to overcome some of the rules and restrictions they face every day at home and beyond. Unveiled, my first European solo exhibition, brings together photographs of women and girls across Iran, in private and public spaces. It includes works from my series Lost Paradise, taken in the holy Shia city of Mashhad, one of the most conservative religious sites in the country, where most women can only be photographed if their faces aren\u2019t shown. I captured women of that region from behind in patterned chadors standing before intricately designed Persian rugs. They appear to merge into the tapestries behind them \u2013 a metaphor that signifies women\u2019s presence yet invisibility in Iranian society. The show\u2019s title alludes to the wearing \u2013 or not wearing \u2013 of the hijab in public, but also my attempts to expose a different side of life in Iran, at a time when the country is becoming more insular and veiled from the outside world. My primary concern is not to be controversial but rather to represent the varied experiences of women in my country, to pay homage to them. Iran is a beautiful country with a rich and diverse cultural and historical heritage. I am so proud of my roots. But to be a woman and also a street photographer here isn\u2019t easy, and since the civil unrest and protests last year, photographing in public comes with even more difficulties. Even Iranian news agencies must follow government policy \u2013 few photojournalists have permission to photograph in public, let alone the protests. I have some permissions as a photojournalist but, to be discreet in my personal work, I often photograph on my iPhone rather than use a larger camera. Questioning what it means to be a woman in Iran is what first encouraged me to pick up a camera aged 16. It gave me permission to observe the world in a more profound way, and to make sense of my position within it. I had the courage to become a photographer because of the positive feedback and support of my friends, in particular, my female friends who recognised my talent. Women should support and help each other to be heard in the world. My mother, who is also an artist, has always supported my ambitions. I am always struggling with my fears, yet she always has my back. Since last year I have been living alone, which is not commonplace for women before marriage. But she has supported my decision to be independent and to put my work first \u2013 an opportunity she wasn\u2019t afforded by her parents. She understands what I\u2019m trying to achieve, to show that photography is about a deeper sensitivity with the world around you, whether you are capturing cities or the remarkable individuals who shape those places. \u2022 Farnaz Damnabi: Unveiled is at 29 Arts in Progress Gallery, Milan, until 30 September, and also online in a viewing room of the show Farnaz Damnabi\u2019s CV Born: Tehran, 1994.

The setting may be somewhat incongruous for such a bold statement but, ultimately, that does not make it any less justified, for this is very much someone who rolled the dice and won big. England is part of England\u2019s squad for the Women\u2019s World Cup and reflecting on how that came about the 29-year-old is in no doubt of the moment that changed everything, the moment the doors slid in her favour: her move from Chelsea to Tottenham in January. It was not an easy decision, especially for someone who, by her own admission, \u201chas never dealt well with change\u201d, and there was immediate pressure given the \u00a3250,000 fee, a domestic record for a British player in the women\u2019s game. But it simply had to be done given the striker\u2019s lack of game time allied to her desperate desire to travel to Australia and New Zealand with the Lionesses. England needed to be playing and scoring again, and Spurs offered her that opportunity. She well and truly took it. There were 12 goals in 12 Women\u2019s Super League appearances alongside an all-round excellence in leading the line, and the fact England was performing so well in a side struggling so badly spoke to her mental strength as well as technical ability. In the end Sarina Wiegman had little choice but to recall a member of the squad that had triumphed at last year\u2019s European Championship as the national team\u2019s focus shifted to global glory. \u201cThe situation I was in, I wasn\u2019t being used, I was on the bench, and as Sarina rightly said, I wasn\u2019t getting picked [for the national team] because I wasn\u2019t getting the minutes,\u201d says England of her situation at Chelsea. \u201cIt was up to me to make sure I was not only getting the minutes but making the minutes count and I did that at Spurs. I can\u2019t thank them enough for giving me the chance to go out and be happy again.\u201d When England received the call from Wiegman confirming her place in the 23-strong squad for the World Cup, that happiness turned into wild joy. \u201cI tried to play it nice and cool but I hung up the phone and screamed my house down,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first thing I did was ring my mum, ring my partner. Obviously I was elated.\u201d That much can be taken from England\u2019s sunny mood in less\u2011than\u2011sunny conditions at St George\u2019s Park at the start of the Lionesses\u2019 buildup for a tournament that kicks off with a match between New Zealand and Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July. She talks about being \u201cexcited\u201d four times during a six\u2011minute conversation. There is, however, also clear frustration and sadness in regards to losing her place in Wiegman\u2019s squad after Euro 2022 given it meant missing out on further triumphs at international level. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard seeing the team win the Finalissima and the Arnold Clark Cup \u2013 those are moments I wanted to be part of,\u201d says England. \u201cBut equally that\u2019s the decision that was made, that\u2019s life, not everything goes your way, and you can only control what you can control. All I could do was go to Spurs, work hard, train hard and put the performances in. I very much did that. \u201cIt was a big risk, I\u2019d been at Chelsea for seven years, that was a big part of my professional career, and I didn\u2019t like the thought of change. I could\u2019ve stayed in my comfort zone but ultimately I didn\u2019t want to be in a position where I didn\u2019t give everything to going [to the World Cup]. I would\u2019ve regretted that looking back on my career.\u201d Barring any setbacks, England will be on the flight from London to the Lionesses\u2019 training camp on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast on 5 July with her sights firmly set on being in the starting lineup for the opening game against Haiti in Brisbane 17 days later. There is no guarantee of that, however, given the options in attack, with England battling for a place with Lauren James, Alessia Russo and the WSL\u2019s player of the season, Rachel Daly. But having fought her way back into contention, the girl from Barnsley is relishing the challenge and everything that lies ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s an exceptional amount of competition in the striking force, as well as the whole squad really, and we\u2019re all very excited to get out there and show the world what we can do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a different group of players [compared with the Euros] but we want to win.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25fef", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/berkeley-interest-rate-fears-sales-homes-housebuilder-profit", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Berkeley says interest rate fears hitting sales despite buyer interest in its homes", "lead": "Housebuilder reports jump in annual pretax profit but says current trading suggests 20% fall in sales this year", "author": "Julia Kollewe and Joanna Partridge", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:57:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224597", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/26aa44d27eb483f0fe19ce97d9851a085d8fc3fd/0_135_3824_2294/500.jpg", "body": "The boss of Berkeley Group has said the property market will remain \u201cchoppy\u201d until interest rates settle, as the housebuilder forecast a 20% drop in sales this year. Mortgage rates have soared in recent weeks, as the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to reduce stubbornly high inflation have fed through into lending deals, pushing the average interest on a two-year fixed loan above 6%. UK inflation unexpectedly remained at an annual rate of 8.7% in May, adding to the pressure on the Bank to increase the cost of borrowing further at its meeting on Thursday. Another interest rate hike of at least a quarter of a point, to 4.75%, seems all but certain, with the odds of a half-point increase rising. Rob Perrins, Berkeley\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe [housing] outlook is going to be choppy for a while until interest rates settle, which brings confidence back into the market.\u201d He said housebuyers needed certainty on how high rates will go. Financial markets are now betting that the Bank base rate will peak at 6% early next year. Berkeley\u2019s share price fell 2%, as investors were surprised by the inflation figures and sold off shares in housebuilders. Shares in rivals Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey also fell by more than 2%, amid concerns in the housing sector about rising mortgage rates. Data from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday also showed house price rises slowed to an annual rate of 3.5% in April, down from 4.1% in March. It was a different picture in the rental market, where tenants were hit by the fastest increase in rents in at least seven years. Private rental prices increased by 5% in the 12 months to May, the biggest rise since the series began in 2016. Berkeley \u2013 which operates across London, southern England and Birmingham \u2013 reported a 9.5% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3604m in the year to 30 April, but said trading so far suggested sales would be about 20% lower in the current year. The company said it was still seeing \u201cgood levels of inquiry for well-located homes\u201d but added that the housing market was \u201clikely to lack urgency\u201d until consumers had a better idea of how mortgage rates would change over the coming months. Those buying were either existing homeowners who wanted to move, or investors with available funds. Berkeley flagged \u201csigns of some financial distress\u201d in its supply chain, as contractors such as cladding firms and bricklayers continued to grapple with the tail of the impacts from Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine on top of the current economic backdrop. Of the housebuilder\u2019s 150 subcontractors, 20 have gone into receivership, as the market tightened. Berkeley said it had tried to help by paying them weekly. The housebuilder said interested buyers tended to favour housing developments that were closer to being finished, rather than projects two to four years away from completion. It said its forward sales were worth \u00a32.1bn but the value of those reservations was 15% lower than in the previous year. Berkeley \u2013 which specialises in redeveloping brownfield land such as the Oval Village project in Lambeth, bringing together four derelict gasholders and an adjacent supermarket and warehouse in south London \u2013 said it would continue to invest in its existing regeneration sites. However, Perrins cautioned over new investment. The builder said that with a complex and slow planning system, high building costs, increased regulation, higher corporation tax and the proposed new building safety levy, the supply of new homes in London and the south-east would continue to fall."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ff0", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/21/werther-review-royal-opera-house-benoit-jacquot-pappano-massenet-kaufmann", "primaryCategory": "culture", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Werther review \u2013 Kaufmann heads strong cast in stylishly sung and fabulously played revival", "lead": "This revival of Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2004 staging of Massenet\u2019s tragedy sees Antonio Pappano and his orchestra on top form.

In Werther his players are indeed busy, tirelessly painting the scene under the vocal lines in music of golden-age Hollywood lushness: Massenet was not of the opinion that less is more. Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s production is nearly 20 years old, but in its first act you might think you\u2019d gone back 80. Lit in sunset tones by Charles Edwards, it is a comfortable, big-scale, traditional staging that occasionally sparks to life dramatically but exists mainly as a vehicle for a star tenor \u2013 this time, Jonas Kaufmann. Not that the title character is much of a hero: Massenet\u2019s truncated treatment of Goethe\u2019s story sounds gorgeous but doesn\u2019t initially draw sympathy to the title character. In just a few seconds at the very end of Act 1, when Jacquot brings Werther in front of the plain black curtain, we finally see the point of him as a figure: on his own he can be the heroically doomed artist, one man against the world. For the rest of the time, back in the picture-postcard realism of Jacquot\u2019s production, he just seems petulant: an entitled child pounding the floor with his fists at the unfairness of it all. Directed for this revival by Genevi\u00e8ve Dufour, the cast is strong, with Sarah Gilford as a sweet-sounding Sophie and Gordon Bintner a solid Albert, smug in his fancy claret-coloured frock coat. There are two star performances. One is supplied by the orchestra, the other by Aigul Akhmetshina, singing in a rich and mettlesome mezzo-soprano that cuts through whatever the orchestra throws at it. Her Charlotte, contained yet impassioned, emerges as the opera\u2019s most interesting, fully rounded character. That might not have been the case had her Werther been on form. Kaufmann seemed to be suffering with a cold; by the second act he was giving the occasional cough, as if in explanation for the fact that his voice wasn\u2019t opening out as it might. It was still a stylishly sung performance and he kept something in the tank for his Act 3 aria, but otherwise we were left to imagine how affecting his Werther would have been at full strength. \u2022 At Royal Opera House, London, until 4 July."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ff1", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/jp-morgan-report-jeffrey-epstein-apparent-contact-peter-mandelson", "primaryCategory": "politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank report details Peter Mandelson\u2019s apparent contact with Jeffrey Epstein", "lead": "JP Morgan report from 2019 found Epstein seemed to keep \u2018particularly close relationship\u2019 with Labour peer", "author": "Rowena Mason Whitehall editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:51:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224632", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2a865685a8924d9ddc1ed5126da6fd158dcb12/0_19_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Court documents have shed light on the Labour former business secretary Peter Mandelson\u2019s apparent contact with the disgraced businessman Jeffrey Epstein after the financier was convicted of procuring an underage girl for prostitution. The document is a 2019 internal report on Epstein by JP Morgan bank, which had a 15-year relationship with the financier, and was filed to a New York court this week. It found that Epstein appeared to \u201cmaintain a particularly close relationship with Prince Andrew the Duke of York and Lord Peter Mandelson, a senior member of the British government\u201d. In 2008, Epstein was given an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring an underage girl. He served time at the private wing of the Palm Beach county stockade in Florida before being released on probation on 22 July 2009. The JP Morgan report reveals that Epstein wrote to his private banker, Jes Staley, on 17 June 2009 in relation to Mandelson to say: \u201cPeter will be staying at 71st over weekend, do you want to organize either you, or you and Jamie,, quiertly [sic],, up to you.\u201d At the time, Lord Mandelson was business secretary in the government of Gordon Brown. It also refers to an email from Mandelson, when he was still business secretary in March 2010, to Epstein saying: \u201cCan Jes send me email on issues re Dodds/Volcker.\u201d The request appears to relate to US regulations in the wake of the financial crisis. The report also refers to two occasions on which Epstein said he was with \u201cPetie\u201d, which the bank interprets as a reference to Mandelson, in November 2010 and January 2011. Mandelson was out of the government by this point. The Guardian has contacted Mandelson and a lawyer for the Duke of York for comment on the report. A spokesperson for the Labour peer said: \u201cLord Mandelson very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein. This connection has been a matter of public record for some time. He never had any kind of professional or business relationship with Epstein in any form.\u201d It is understood Mandelson has no recollection or record of staying in Epstein\u2019s house in New York in 2009. Mandelson appears to have been introduced to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the tycoon Robert Maxwell. She is serving 20 years in prison in the US for assisting Epstein in sex trafficking underage girls. The report also raises questions about Prince Andrew\u2019s claim to have cut ties with Epstein in December 2010. The royal\u2019s friendship with Epstein has been criticised, particularly after he stayed with Epstein during a December 2010 visit to New York, which the Duke of York has said was to tell him that they could no longer be in contact. However, the JP Morgan report states that in February 2011, two months after the Central Park meeting, Epstein wrote to Staley: \u201cAndrew asked for your London schedule.\u201d Last year, the Duke of York settled a sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, but with no admission of liability. Giuffre was introduced to him through Epstein and Maxwell. In 2019, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking a minor and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. Epstein denied the charges and was refused bail. He died months later in custody in an apparent suicide. The JP Morgan report was commissioned to examine the extent of the bank\u2019s relations with Epstein, which continued until 2013. Mandelson has given informal advice to the current Labour leadership. A spokesperson for the party said: \u201cThere are a whole range of people that Keir Starmer talks to. Obviously he talks to people who were part of the last Labour government, including Peter Mandelson.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ff2", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/21/virgil-quote-found-on-fragment-of-roman-jar-unearthed-in-spain", "primaryCategory": "science", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Virgil quote found on fragment of Roman jar unearthed in Spain", "lead": "Excerpt from the Georgics was carved into vessel used for olive oil 1,800 years ago", "author": "Sam Jones in Madrid", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:48:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224649", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/700f24b22a7d9729e2cc527b466483ea9d3fd91c/0_9_633_380/500.jpg", "body": "A tiny fragment of a Roman jar that once held olive oil, produced in what is now southern Spain, has left archaeologists delighted, puzzled and \u201csaucer-eyed\u201d after they deciphered a quote from the ancient poet Virgil that was cut into its clay by an unknown but erudite hand 1,800 years ago. The highly unusual find, thought to be the first time a literary quotation has been discovered on a Roman amphora, was turned up by researchers from the universities of C\u00f3rdoba, Seville and Montpellier who were excavating a site in the town of Hornachuelos, in Andaluc\u00eda\u2019s C\u00f3rdoba province, seven years ago. While the ceramic vessels were routinely engraved with information relating to producers, quantities and taxes, the 6cm by 8cm shard appeared to contain an unusual amount of text. \u201cWe thought it might be something quite exceptional because you hardly ever get more than a line or two of engravings on an amphora,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar, an archeologist on the project, which was funded by the Labex Archim\u00e8de research institute in Montpellier, France, part of Paul Val\u00e9ry University. \u201cThis one had four or five lines. While we didn\u2019t understand it, we thought it was quite special.\u201d Subsequent examinations by Latin experts determined that the fragment bore a quote from Virgil, best known as the author of the epic Latin poem the Aeneid. \u201cTo be honest, it took a while because there were some spelling mistakes that held us back from seeing what it was straight away,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar, who is now an archaeologist at the University of Barcelona. \u201cBut we did eventually get there.\u201d One of his colleagues, Ant\u00f2nia Soler i Nicolau, thought she recognised the quote \u2013 and indeed she did. It turned out to be from the first section of Virgil\u2019s second major work, the Georgics: \u201c[Earth] once changed the/Chaonian acorn for the plump wheat-ear/And mingled with the grape [your newfound gift].\u201d As far as Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar and his colleagues are aware, the fragment is the first time that a line from literature has turned up on a clay vessel. \u201cThere are quite a lot of bricks that have been found with texts from Virgil on them because we think they\u2019d been used for teaching before being used for building,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar. \u201cBut nothing\u2019s been found on amphorae.\u201d Given the fragment was found in a rural area where much of the olive oil sent to Rome was produced and bottled, the team thinks Virgil\u2019s agriculturally themed Georgics may have struck the engraver as more fitting that the heroics of the Aeneid. The researchers\u2019 key theory, as published in the Journal of Roman Archeology, is that the verses, written on the lower part of the amphora, were never really intended to be seen. They believe the author may have been a skilled labourer or perhaps even a child worker at the factory where the amphora was manufactured. In any case, the lines make it clear that whoever scratched the letters into the clay was more educated than such workers are traditionally supposed to have been. \u201cWe really can\u2019t say for sure why the lines were written, but we do know that they appear on a part of the amphora that wouldn\u2019t have been seen,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar. \u201cMaybe a worker there wanted to show them to a colleague \u2013 they could have been done by an adult or a child. What we do know is that this was done inside an amphora factory, and that the lines were probably written from memory.\u201d According to the journal article \u2013 written by Gonz\u00e1lez Tobar, Soler i Nicolau and Piero Berni Millet \u2013 the small, learned fragment that lay in the Andaluc\u00edan earth for almost two millennia will be \u201cof exceptional interest for archaeologists, epigraphists, and philologists of [colloquial] Latin\u201d."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ff3", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/carrie-mae-weems-review-evil-clowns-race-riots-and-tense-kitchen-table-dramas", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carrie Mae Weems review \u2013 evil clowns, race riots and tense kitchen table dramas", "lead": "In this intriguing show, the photographer, film-maker and dancer explores the Black American experience from a wide range of angles", "author": "Adrian Searle", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:33:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224666", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e347071dc3a9c764af5ae38019fc1b5625f896e5/0_688_3120_1871/500.jpg", "body": "Carrie Mae Weems appears and disappears among the endless rows of concrete slabs that make up Berlin\u2019s Holocaust Memorial. She\u2019s there and then she isn\u2019t in this short film, traversing past and present in the late winter sunshine, wringing her hands, catching her breath. As she moves out of sight, distant traffic glints brightly at the far end of the row. Later, in two series of photographs, we see her \u2013 always from behind in the same long black gown \u2013 in the ruins of ancient Rome and also among Mussolini\u2019s fascist architecture. And here she is again, outside the Louvre in Paris and Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Bilbao, then in Philadelphia, Dresden and Boston. The figure in the long black gown is Weems playing the role of her own alter ego, her personal muse. She\u2019s an African American witness at large in the world. For all that, Weems is hard to pin down \u2013 and the Barbican\u2019s Reflections for Now show traces the complexities of her development. Weems, who trained as a dancer before embarking on photography and art, often appears as a protagonist in her work. Now 70, she takes photographs, constructs installations and makes films. She also writes \u2013 and her words are a constant presence in this, the largest UK show of her work since the 1980s. Her art is rich and full of variety, without wavering from her focus on the Black American experience. In her best-known series of staged photographs, all set at a small table in a kitchen, people congregate under a cone of light, and we\u2019re positioned at the far end of the table. At the other end, a man reads the paper, while Weems sits and smokes to one side, or hovers in the shadows by the wall, and in another shot leans over him, fussing for his attention. There they are again, him sucking on lobster shell, her sitting over her own unpicked dinner. The claws on her plate still wear their rubber bands; in one hand she holds a cigarette, the other strokes his head. She\u2019s not getting his attention. Now she\u2019s with girlfriends, or doing homework with a daughter, or sitting pensive, alone with a bottle of wine. There are scenes of tenderness and complicity here, of raucousness and a palpable loneliness. The staged black and white images in Kitchen Table series 1990, with their calibrated ordinariness and attention to small details, are filled with understated tension and drama, playing out the dynamics of domestic life. The images examine gender and generational divides, intimacy and individuality, togetherness and separation. They are also annotated by lengthy captions that flesh out a woman\u2019s inner life. Although great in their own way, I\u2019m not sure the photographs need these inner monologues beside them. Maybe in a book, the juxtaposition of words and images would work better than on the wall, where we must shuttle back and forth between image and text. Sometimes it is better when things are left to speak for themselves. There is also a lot of sound leakage between the upper and lower floors of the gallery, where two film works are shown. The noise of tap-dancing, and snatches of the recorded, hysterical voice of the white woman who called the cops from Central Park to say she was being attacked by a black man, who was in fact a birdwatcher asking her if she\u2019d mind putting her dog on a lead, drift up from below. Later, we hear Jimmy \u201cThe Schnozzle\u201d Durante, singing the schmaltzy 1960 showtune Make Someone Happy. This all comes from The Shape of Things, a 2021 film projected on a wide, curved screen, like a 19th-century cyclorama. This ambitious work in seven parts splices old footage of circus performers and slapstick hijinks with pro-Trump rallies and the 6 January insurrectionists storming the Washington Capitol; fragments of earlier works by Weems jostle with face-masked crowds on the street during the pandemic. Black Lives Matter protesters, police violence, and lengthy choreographed sections in which not much happens jostle together in this panoramic, complicated 40-minute work. The Shape of Things attempts to get to the heart of a country whose black and brown citizens \u201care always stopped, charged and convicted\u201d, and where we must \u201cimagine the worst of the worst and that it is always happening\u201d. The Shape of Things is many things: angry, eloquent, sorrowful, compelling, didactic and portentous. The long, choreographed sections don\u2019t entirely work. With its stock footage, clowns, a performing elephant, spotlit people posed theatrically in indoor rain and, of course, Jimmy Durante, the tone is constantly shifting. After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, in 2020, Weems returned to Portland, Oregon, the town of her birth and photographed sections of boarded-up buildings, where the layers of graffiti had been repeatedly painted over, in whatever colours were to hand, as if to muzzle the voice of the protesters. Weems\u2019 carefully cropped and lit images of these distressed planes of chipboard and ply resemble nothing so much as painted abstractions. No words remain, but they are redolent reminders of recent violence, of muted voices and censored slogans, and, surprisingly, of the works of the mostly overlooked black American painters who had been associated with the New York school and abstract expressionism during the 1950s. Past and present collide in these large colour photographs and Weems makes us aware of the uncanny double-take. Here, for once, less is more and the rich subtexts are implicit. For all that is staged in her works, they\u2019re a great reminder of the importance of simply paying attention and noticing things. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2023. George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota; not Portland, Oregon as an earlier version said.

The Davis school district, north of Salt Lake City, voted unanimously on Tuesday night to accept a recommendation by a subcommittee of three of its members to reinstate the book to middle and elementary school shelves. \u201cThe appeal committee determined that the Bible has significant, serious value for minors which outweighs the violent or vulgar content it contains,\u201d the district said in a statement seemingly critical of the parent majority that recommended the ban. \u201cThe committee-based process \u2026 allows for appeals to be considered when a committee\u2019s decision seems to be at odds with community values. The process takes time and it isn\u2019t perfect, but it is working.\u201d The district is still considering a separate complaint seeking the removal of the Book of Mormon, the foundational text of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The wrangling over the Bible placed Davis county in the middle of a national debate over removals of books from public schools, a push driven by conservatives targeting material that contains references to gender identity or sexuality. Utah passed a law last year allowing parents to request the removal of books containing \u201cpornographic or indecent material\u201d. In December one parent complained that the King James Bible was \u201cone of the most sex-ridden books around\u201d. The original panel concluded that it did not violate the Utah statute known as the bright line law, but was age inappropriate for all but high school libraries. \u201cWithin days of the announcement of this determination, the district received several appeal requests and immediately began processing appeals,\u201d the Davis school district statement said. \u201cSome in the community have intimated that the initial committee\u2019s decision, or the district\u2019s policy/process, have been intentionally manipulated to undermine Utah\u2019s sensitive materials law. This is wholly untrue. The district has always acted with intent to uphold the law and maintain school libraries free from harmful material.\u201d The district says it has reviewed 60 books to date, with 37 removed from all school libraries due to bright line rule violations and 14 restricted at some grade levels \u201cdue to age appropriateness\u201d. The statement did not address the complaint over the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith, the church founder who published it in 1830, claimed was translated from inscriptions of prophets on golden plates. The request to remove the book, which church members typically study alongside the Bible, referenced violence including battles, beheadings and kidnappings. A backlash against school book-banning efforts is under way in other states. The Lake county school district in Florida, and the state\u2019s board of education, were sued on Tuesday by a group of students and the authors of a children\u2019s book about a penguin family with two fathers, the Orlando Sentinel reported. According to the lawsuit, the decision to remove And Tango Makes Three, based on the true story of two male penguins hatching a chick at New York\u2019s Central Park zoo, is unconstitutional, with Lake county having \u201cno legitimate pedagogical reason for its decision\u201d. The book fell foul of the Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law, that bans classroom discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation in any of the state\u2019s classrooms through 12th grade."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ff5", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/orca-rams-yacht-off-shetland-first-such-incident-northern-waters", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Orca rams into yacht off Shetland in first such incident in northern waters", "lead": "Cetacean exhibits same behaviour towards vessel in North Sea that has been seen in Iberian orca population", "author": "Philip Hoare and Jeroen Hoekendijk", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:27:45", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224703", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/200f4e2bb0b1c109698da48bccd73a273410292a/275_0_4140_2484/500.jpg", "body": "An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal. Dr Wim Rutten, a 72-year-old retired Dutch physicist and experienced yachtsperson, was sailing solo from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway. He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat. \u201cI said: \u2018Shit!\u2019\u201d Rutten, who said he had heard about the \u201cPortuguese accidents\u201d, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating \u201csoft shocks\u201d through the aluminium hull. \u201cWhat I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,\u201d he said. The orca stayed behind the boat \u201clooking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit. \u201cMaybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.\u201d This is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters. Highly social cetaceans, orcas use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. \u201cGrandmothers\u201d in the Iberian population of whales have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels. Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr Alfredo L\u00f3pez, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atl\u00e1ntica in Portugal, said: \u201cWe know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.\u201d But the focus on boats\u2019 rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they \u201chad a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it\u201d. Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods off the Scottish coast, said: \u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to say it cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It\u2019s possible that this \u2018fad\u2019 is leapfrogging through the various pods/communities.\u201d Ryan suggests there may be \u201chighly mobile pods that could transmit this behaviour a long distance\u201d. L\u00f3pez thinks, however, \u201cthat human activities, even in an indirect way, are at the origin of this behaviour\u201d. Increased marine traffic, dwindling food sources, warming seas and noise pollution could all play a part. Rutten added: \u201cMaybe the universe knows. We do not.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ff6", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/body-found-in-river-in-search-for-missing-harrogate-woman-sophie-lambert", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Body found in river in search for missing Harrogate woman", "lead": "Sophie Lambert went missing last Friday and personal possessions were found the next day", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 13:24:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224721", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2431e036c7cc0da4e102769256d7e671c9bd897c/0_939_5483_3290/500.jpg", "body": "Police searching for a missing 22-year-old woman have found a body in a river.

He arrived from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial club record fee of \u00a372m in August 2020 and with the reputation of being one of the most exciting young talents in Europe. There were flashes of his talents at Chelsea but, in general, he underwhelmed, in large part from being deployed as a central striker, which is not his preferred position.

The external adviser will work in the heart of a Labour government, creating an action plan with Angela Rayner in the Cabinet Office to remove barriers, and also with the Electoral Commission. Rayner, who will announce the plans later on Wednesday, is understood to be committed to boosting representation across parties in order to ensure politicians are no longer removed from, or unable to personally understand, the impact of the policies they enact. The deputy Labour leader said: \u201cRepresentation shapes which issues get debated in the first place and what is up for decision. You might learn by asking or listening, but the lived experience adds a different quality \u2013 and gives a different perspective. Lived experience brings its own expertise.\u201d Labour says the tsar\u2019s work will not be focused solely on boosting representation within its own party as insiders say its candidate mentoring schemes such as the Bernie Grant leadership and the Jo Cox women in leadership programmes are already addressing its representation shortcomings. Instead the adviser will launch recommendations based on removing barriers blocking many hoping to stand for office from underrepresented groups. Samuel Kasumu, a former Conservative London mayoral hopeful, said he had been blocked from the longlist because he was \u201can outsider\u201d. He claimed Tory officials who were making the decision had said: \u201cYou don\u2019t sound like a politician,\u201d with others adding: \u201cYou haven\u2019t attended enough dinners.\u201d He told the BBC: \u201cSo all the indication was that the reason why they didn\u2019t want me in the room was because I represented something that perhaps they were slightly uncomfortable with.\u201d Labour members have raised concerns the party has sidelined many voices who have lived experience of dealing with anti-black racism, Islamophobia, misogyny and classism because they are considered to be on the left of the party. The deputy Labour leader has been praised by many within the party as being one of the few, authentic voices campaigning for marginalised voices. Rayner, the first woman to represent the constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne in its 180-year history, will discuss on Wednesday what a general election means for women alongside Australia\u2019s former prime minister Julia Gillard, now chair of the global institute for women\u2019s leadership at King\u2019s College London. They will share their experiences as women at the highest level of politics and discuss why representation matters. Rayner said: \u201cThere\u2019s more than a hint of snobbery in the argument that more authenticity and more diversity in politics is a recipe for disaster. The past decade will tell you that the playing fields of Eton education are no guarantee of good government. \u201cOur politics has never been so out of touch. Tackling the representation gap in gender, but also in class and ethnicity is an important step in building a politics that better reflects today\u2019s Britain. It\u2019s a personal priority for me. \u201cI am no stranger to misogyny but the messages I\u2019ve received from women have brought home how widespread experiences like mine are, not only in Westminster but across the political world, and also in workplaces across the country. It would break my heart if other women like me were put off from aspiring to participate in public life. We need more people with backgrounds like mine in politics.\u201d According to recent figures, Britain ranks 20th out of 38 OECD countries in terms of female representation in parliament. Labour is understood to be open to following the recommendation of legislating a \u201cright to run\u201d that makes sure employers allow people to take time off work to run for office, in a model similar to jury service. Gillard said: \u201cIt is easy in power structures that have been historically run by men, including politics, for an old boys\u2019 network to be the default, and for such networks to unconsciously favour the promotion of men who look and sound like they fit. For women at the forefront of change in politics, like Angela Rayner, all this means there are extra barriers which involve both gender and perceptions of class.

I have long criticised Pakistan\u2019s former prime minister, but now it is becoming difficult to do so. There is a de facto ban on referring to him in the media, meaning we are no longer allowed to mention his name or show his picture. Pakistani TV channels are not allowed to interview him or air his statements. This is the result of a series of directives issued by the media regulator. As prime minister, Imran Khan tried to turn Pakistan from a struggling democracy into an autocracy. His successor, Shehbaz Sharif, appears to be following in his footsteps. Once upon a time I was one of Khan\u2019s favourite journalists (despite the fact that I advised him in 1995 not to go into politics). When I was banned from broadcasting my talkshow in 2007 by the Musharraf regime, Khan stood by me. He used to participate in my roadside shows and aggressively criticised the anti-media policies of a military dictator. When I survived an assassination attempt in 2014, Khan told the media: \u201cHamid Mir is my favourite TV anchor.\u201d Then, in 2018, he became prime minister. The next year, an interview I had conducted with former president Asif Ali Zardari was pulled from the air. The media regulator under Khan\u2019s watch also banned former prime minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s speeches from being aired on Pakistani media. I criticised him when his government allowed the trial of civilians in military courts under the Pakistan Army Act. In 2021, a blanket ban was imposed on me (again) in electronic and print media after I gave a speech against the attacks on our colleagues. There was no written order against me from any court or from the media regulator, but I remained banned in Pakistan from May 2021 to March 2022. I blamed the military establishment for that ban. Khan remained silent on my disappearance from the media. Now Imran Khan is out of the government. I am back on the TV screens, and Khan is missing from the media. I want to speak about his mistakes, but I cannot do so without mentioning his name and using video clips. Owners of some prominent TV channels and newspapers were reportedly told by the military authorities recently that enough is enough. Khan has been declared an \u201cirresponsible\u201d politician and an \u201cenemy\u201d of the army after the 9 May riots that followed his arrest earlier this year. They don\u2019t want to see his name or picture in the media. They don\u2019t want to see any dissenting voices in the media criticising the military courts. The national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution on 12 June demanding speedy action against 9 May rioters under the army act; Shehbaz Sharif had already declared Khan to be the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the violence. Khan says he has no doubt that he will be tried in a military court and jailed. His problem is that he overestimated his popularity, blindly confronting the most powerful institution in the country. He failed to organise peaceful rallies. His violent supporters actually undermined their leader on 9 May. The attitude of an angry, fast bowler was good on the cricket ground but the same attitude in the field of politics pushed him towards a disaster. It is Khan v the army, and it\u2019s clearly the latter that is winning. History repeats itself quickly in Pakistan, with variations, but my principles must stay the same. I cannot support the censorship of Imran Khan because I opposed the same censorship of Nawaz Sharif when Khan was in power. I can never endorse the disappearance of journalists perceived as being pro-Khan, such as Imran Riaz, because I was also banned when Khan was in power. I cannot remain silent on a crackdown by the current regime against the critical voices because I was also a victim of the same crackdown in 2020. Imran Khan may be arrested again soon. The regime wants to remove him from electoral politics but cannot rid his name from Pakistan\u2019s discourse, as if he never existed. I think they are not fighting against Khan, they are actually fighting against the very idea of a democratic Pakistan. It\u2019s time for all Pakistani rulers to quit their censorship habit.

Stokes declares after Root hits form England were 393 for 8 in their first innings, with Joe Root purring on 118 and Ollie Robinson batting with real poise and control at the other end, when Ben Stokes called them in. They could have batted for six more overs that day but instead they chose to bowl four at Australia - Stokes called this their \u201cchance to pounce\u201d. They achieved little in that time, and a few extra runs would have been handy in the end. The fumbles Australia\u2019s first innings in particular was punctuated by missed chances behind the stumps.

The spinner\u2019s finger Moeen Ali replaced the injured Jack Leach in the side, but two years after his last first-class game he was not used to bowling for long periods with the pronounced seam of the Dukes ball. He wore a hole in his spinning finger, affecting his bowling, and in the end Joe Root did most of the spin bowling on the final day. Cummins goes big Pat Cummins was on eight, Nathan Lyon on two, and Australia still 51 runs away from victory. Joe Root had bowled 14 overs for just 29 runs, but the second new ball was due and England had to decide: give Root one more over, or let rip with the seamers? They went with option one, and Cummins creamed two sixes to kick-start the match-winning partnership. The drop Just two balls into the following over Nathan Lyon pulled a Stuart Broad short ball towards Ben Stokes at square leg. Australia still needed 36. The England captain backpedalled, leapt, stretched, caught it - and then uncaught it again. It was the last clear wicket-taking chance, and Lyon and Pat Cummins went on to guide Australia to victory."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ffb", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/21/state-of-origin-2023-game-2-live-score-updates-qld-maroons-vs-nsw-blues-queensland-team-list-what-time-is-kickoff-start-nrl-latest-news-watch-channel-nine-broadcast-brisbane-lang-park-suncorp-stadium", "primaryCategory": "sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "State of Origin 2023 Game 2: Queensland Maroons 32-6 NSW Blues \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "Queensland dominated NSW at Suncorp Stadium to seal a comprehensive State of Origin series victory", "author": "Jonathan Howcroft", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:34:54", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224816", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4672db15c67e6e6da5f5f7a1c4f3514d3baa0a35/0_0_3739_2244/500.jpg", "body": "Thank you for joining me tonight for another demonstration of Queensland\u2019s extraordinary ability to rise to the occasion in State of Origin. Three weeks ago they were underdogs heading to Adelaide to take on a star-studded NSW outfit. Tonight they arrived in Brisbane as favourites and played like champions. Defensively they were extraordinary. Their line defence was near flawless. One-on-one they were rarely beaten, and if they were a covering tackle was close at hand. In broken play they were first to every loose ball. And then in attack they were clinical. Chances were few and far between in South Australia, and again tonight the Maroons didn\u2019t hog the ball or dominate field position. But when they saw an opportunity they went for the jugular and in Munster and Cherry-Evans they had a halfback pairing that controlled the ball masterfully in dangerous situations, and outside them Walsh was the series game-breaker, entering the line, creating space and timing killer passes. After a second series defeat in succession it is hard to see Brad Fittler either wanting to stay on as NSW coach, or being invited to do so. On paper, the Blues should be the stronger of the two units, but over 160 minutes there was a desperate lack of wit and cutting edge in attack, while squad selections lacked the bravery and purpose of Billy Slater. Fittler can point to the injuries to Mitchell, Cleary, and Trbojevic as mitigating factors, but they cannot mask the inability to match Queensland for intensity. In three weeks from now they will at least have a shot at redemption on Sydney soil, a night that, perhaps, will kickstart their Origin 2024 campaign. I will be back here for that, and you\u2019re welcome to join me. Until then, I will leave you with Angus Fontaine\u2019s match report and Queensland\u2019s celebrations. Goodnight! The Queensland players are lapping it all up, some carrying their children, others in the stands with family members. These are the moments they will remember for ever. The big prop gets the nod on the night for a performance that set the tone for the Maroons, in defence and attack. Too quick, too strong, and too hungry for the Blues to handle. This is what dreams are made of. This is what you do in the backyard growing up as a little kid, imagining this moment, and for it to be a reality, it\u2019s very, very special. I think there\u2019ll be a few sickies tomorrow. Reece Walsh, who has cemented his status as the most exciting young fullback in the game, is bubbling with delight. Obviously, the crowd at home, up here winning at Suncorp, this is our back yard. This is our home. We come to represent our people. It was an awesome game. We wouldn\u2019t be here without the fans. A special group, awesome coach and, you know, we really got the job done there tonight. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s a brotherhood. You know, since day one we went into camp, and we all just gelled. The coaching staff are out of this world. Just amazed in this group, with these boys, we\u2019ve got a saying Ubuntu, it\u2019s all stick together and do it for each other, not for yourself. Queensland should be proud tonight. Daly Cherry-Evans, who was outstanding tonight, is first at the mic to share the moment with former Queensland captain Darren Lockyer. It\u2019s our ability to defend our try line this series that got us the results both games. We should be really proud of the way we\u2019ve defended. I think the scoreboard reflected tonight the sort of footy we can play. The final couple of minutes were unsavoury but that does not prevent Queensland celebrating a classic night of Origin footy at Suncorp Stadium. Queensland are State of Origin champions for 2023! 80 mins: In that same melee, Walsh and Luai aimed head-butts at each other, each receiving their marching orders for their troubles. So unnecessary. 80 mins: Tempers have frayed in the final seconds. Addo-Carr has thrown a punch at Walsh, who was head-to-head with Luai in an exchange of words, and he is rightly sent to the bin. Stupid act. 77 mins: Fa\u2019asuamaleaui interrupts Yeo\u2019s run, reverses the momentum, picks up the big Panther, dumps him on his backside, and dislodges the ball in the process. It\u2019s been that kind of night. That kind of series. 76 mins: This has been some series from the Maroons. They have absorbed so much NSW pressure across the two matches, but they have done so with such defensive skill, discipline, and grit. And they\u2019ve scored with practically every serious attack they\u2019ve mounted. Queensland are giving their supporters their money\u2019s worth. Instead of walking down the last ten minutes they\u2019re flinging the ball from right to left, conceding metres in the process to keep the ball alive. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter, because on the last Munster hoists up a Garryowen that Cook is once again exactly the man NSW don\u2019t want to be under the ball. He initially marks but loses the ball mid-air in contact with teammate Addo-Carr. Nanai is first to the loose ball to send the score into the 30s. Holmes kicks another two to rub salt in the NSW wounds. 74 mins: Moses, who began the night promisingly, has seen his performance deteriorate, and it reaches a new low with an awful play-the-ball that only looks more embarrassing during a NSW captain\u2019s challenge. 73 mins: The crowd is 52,433 by the way. Most of them deliriously happy with what they\u2019ve seen. 72 mins: An overcooked Moses kick from range allows Queensland another opportunity to settle things down, milk the clock, and take the sting out of the game. The crowd break out into cries of \u201cQueenslander!\u201d. 71 mins: Queensland utilise their captain\u2019s challenge to see whether Tabuai-Fidow should have been penalised for a knock-on during the kick chase. It was a forlorn effort, but succeeded in allowing the Maroons to catch their breath and slow the game down. The value of that breather is shown immediately with Haas dumped unceremoniously deep in his own half. 68 mins: NSW earn a scrum from the restart, then earn a ruck penalty under the posts. Can the Blues mount a late fightback? No. Young drops the ball on the burst on tackle two. This series has been an attacking disaster for Brad Fittler. The short drop-out is claimed by Tabuai-Fidow. Soon afterwards Yeo concedes a penalty at the ruck but Queensland reject the kick for goal and instead invite their forwards to pound the NSW defensive line. For a while anyway, this is Queensland after all, and eventually they\u2019re going to want to score a try. The halves get the ball under the posts \u2013 and there\u2019s that move again \u2013 the delayed pass to Walsh, the incredible strength and ball skills of the young fulback to release Coates on the outside, and he flys like superman to touch the ball down one-handed in the corner. Simply magnificent. Holmes dots the i\u2019s by crossing the t from the touchline. 63 mins: NSW have the bit between their teeth now. Tedesco finds a step, Moses accepts contact, there\u2019s finally some urgency and invention \u2013 but still Queensland find a miracle! Collins again, showing his alertness to block the attempted grubber, then pounce on the loose ball and run it away from danger. Four tackles later, Munster dabs a perfectly weighted kick to force Cook into conceding a line drop-out. 60 mins: Now the Blues come! First they look to expand early in the set, finding space for To\u2019o on the right, then they hammer Walsh as he collects Moses\u2019 bomb before setting about a series of ball carriers, threatening to drag Coates into touch before he offloads smartly. It takes a barnstorming run from Collins to settle things down for the home side. But the respite doesn\u2019t last long when that man Collins is pinged for going high on Luai early in the NSW set. Well, well, well. After all that\u2019s happened tonight, Damien Cook might be the man to spark a comeback. It arrives following the first penetrating run of the night from a man in blue \u2013 Young bursting on to a slick short pass from Luai. Queensland scramble to bring the forward down, but Cook is on hand for the offload to dash under the posts like he\u2019s sniping from dummy-half \u2013 not playing 75 minutes as a left centre. Crichton kicks the easy two points. 57 mins: NSW spend four tackles doing nothing inside 10m before a pass goes astray to create some unintentional penetration in broken play. Moses finally kicks to the right corner, Crichton does well in the air, but it\u2019s a Queenslander on the spot at ground level. This is up there with the best defensive performances I have ever seen. 55 mins: Luai almost goes by himself, picking up the ball in broken play following a Moses bomb, jinking one way, then the other, before Walsh eventually brings him down. NSW use up their captain\u2019s challenge shortly afterwards, claiming unsuccessfully that Holmes knocked the ball on following the bomb. However, in the process of the review, Walsh\u2019s last ditch challenge on Luai is ruled high, so NSW retain the ball. \u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d bemoans Andrew Johns. It was around the neck mind you \u2026 53 mins: Munster\u2019s marshalling of that Queensland try was brilliant. Repeatedly steering play to the left edge until the space opened up for Taulagi to exploit. His halfback pairing with Cherry-Evans will go down in Origin history. I mean, it\u2019s funny. How on earth do they absorb so much pressure and then score in one hit? A solid set from their own line turns into something miraculous on the last when Taulagi plays on, kicks infield and the bounce sets up perfectly for Tabuai-Fidow to gather and touch down. Incredible. Holmes hits an upright for the second time tonight. Not that it matters much any more. 49 mins: Now the Blues come. From a tackle restart 30m out Yeo, Robson and Martin, all bust the line. Crichton almost gets free on the right. But everywhere they move there\u2019s a Maroon jersey waiting to pounce. Another set restart! The ball moves from right to left, the weight of territory and possession surely has to count \u2013 but no! For the umpteenth time the ball ends up out of sync as it\u2019s throw to the left \u2013 Cook\u2019s centre \u2013 and Addo-Carr watches the ball bobble into touch. Superb defence from Queensland, woeful attack from NSW. 47 mins: A poor DCE kick allows To\u2019o to set up NSW on halfway. But yet again five tackles pass quickly with no imagination or wit. The kick is tidy enough but Holmes does wonderfully in the air to defuse the bomb. The Blues defend well to deny Queensland any cheap metres coming out of defence, but they\u2019re going to need to offer much more with ball in hand to rescue this. 45 mins: New South Wales need a miracle in enemy territory. And it\u2019s hard to see where it\u2019s going to come from. Not that it matters for long. Just as they have all series Queensland only need a glimpse of the line to convert it into a score. The ball moves around at speed until there\u2019s room on the right. The Maroons don\u2019t panic, DCE double pumps, Walsh unloads in contact, and Holmes has the space to dive over in the corner. The prolific points scorer picks himself up, dusts himself down, and spanks over a touchline conversion to extend his side\u2019s commanding lead. 42 mins: Cotter and Fifita set the tone on the opening set for the Maroons. Grant then makes a burst to build the momentum. Munster launches a bomb Tabuai-Fidow plucks it out of the sky but To\u2019o tackles the Hammer almost immediately. Queensland back into their work. And how! NSW turn in s straightforward set that ends with Walsh fielding a bomb, bouncing out of mid-air contact, wriggling through a series of tackles and into open space before Tedesco just hauls him down! The teams are back out for the second half. Can NSW mount a comeback? Here\u2019s the DCE chase on Crichton that turned into a 10 or 12 point play. He saves at least four points with his tackle, one that immediately precedes his line break to set up Queensland\u2019s second try. NSW had more possession, more completions, more passes, more offloads\u2026 and rarely looked threatening. It\u2019s like Origin I all over again. To make matters worse, when the Blues did penetrate the ball followed makeshift centre Damien Cook like a magnet and he was repeatedly the wrong man at the wrong time. In case you\u2019ve joined late, Cook has been pressganged into the backline after Trbojevic was forced off in the opening exchanges with a serious pec injury. Brad Fittler\u2019s decision not to retain Nicho Hynes in his 17 is already beginning to look like a mistake. James Hewer has emailed in, questioning Queensland\u2019s second try. And I have to agree that Fifita\u2019s pass to Tabuai-Fidow looks forward to my poorly trained eyes. Have a look below, make your own call. The Maroons have been on the back foot for much of the half, but they are now just 40 minutes away from an Origin series victory. 39 mins: NSW should have one set in their own half before the break, but they benefit from a dangerous tackle and kick long downfield for one final assault for the half. Five tackles come and go in the shadow of the posts but there is zero penetration. On the last there\u2019s a set restart \u2013 which just means two more ineffective tackles before the hooter. Queensland\u2019s defence is phenomenal. 37 mins: Queensland go through hands on halfway but Walsh grasses the seventh or eighth pass in the move and NSW mop up. Again, it\u2019s a moderate set, and it ends in ignominy with Collins wrapping Luai in a mighty pile-driving bear hug that dislodges the ball and brings Suncorp Stadium alive. 35 mins: What an extraordinary couple of minutes for Daly Cherry-Evans. His tackle save on Crichton will be on Origin highlights reels for decades, then he made the line break to create his side\u2019s second try. Such a big game player. Going the other way, Damien Cook just cannot believe his predicament. After all that pressure from NSW, what do Queensland do? Carrigan makes a bust, DCE powers through the gap, and a tackle later the ball is shifted from right to left for Taulagi to complete the formalities. How do they do it? How do they always do it? Holmes makes the simple conversion. 30 mins: The Maroons get just what they want with a set restart on halfway. Defence is now very much attack with DCE and Munster darting around behind the ruck. On the last the kick is smothered and Crichton is away! Can he make it 90 metres for the try!? Queenslanders are coming from all angles to chase! It\u2019s a thrilling foot-race \u2013 and Cherry-Evans makes the desperate tackle! Wow. But NSW are not finished. They have a full set 20 metres out. There\u2019s so much space on the left against a tired Queensland defence \u2013 but the ball doesn\u2019t get there fast enough and the Maroons recover. They keep coming through \u2013 and now there\u2019s space again on the left, surely this time, no! The pass from Luai hits Cook in the face! Oh no! This is nightmare stuff for NSW. 28 mins: NSW are pushing hard now! Little happened for five tackles, but on the last a poor Moses chip bounced back into Blue hands and drew a knock-on for a repeat set in the red zone. After steering everything down the left NSW look to the right and as Moses feeds Tedesco there\u2019s room for To\u2019o on the outside \u2013 but Taulagi flies out of the line to pressure the NSW skipper and his pass misses its target. That was a long long intense spell of pressure and Queensland emerge unscathed. 27 mins: Finally some respite! After a long long period of unbroken play \u2013 largely dominated by NSW \u2013 there\u2019s a ruck infringement against Queensland after a long kick-chase, and everyone has a second to catch their breath. 26 mins: The Blues continue to probe. Crichton goes close, then there\u2019s an overlap on the left \u2013 can they find it? No! Cook is the wrong man in the left centre and he\u2019s crunched by a gang of Queenslanders when you\u2019d have to think a fit Mitchell would have handed a try on a plate to Addo-Carr. 25 mins: That\u2019s almost the moment of magic NSW need! Moses, on tackle one, spots Walsh out of position and chips and chases his own ball. Munster gets back to concede the drop-out just in time. Moses does not look overawed by the occasion. 24 mins: Wallop! Martin and Young absolutely pummel Coates a split-second after he fields the high ball. Munster\u2019s then dumped in a tackle as the Blues push \u2013 but Nanai breaks the line and can launch a counter\u2026 but he bites off more than he can chew with a flick pass out of contact that\u2019s too hot for Coates and NSW are back in attack. 22 mins: Moses has impressed me so far, looking to attack on the front foot, shaping to run whenever he receives the ball, buying him yards to finesse his kicks. There\u2019s been no magic yet though with the Blues content to grind through the sets and bide their time. 20 mins: NSW continue to enjoy good field position but they have yet to profit from Moses\u2019s boot. His latest effort, high to the right, is won in the air by Crichton, but Fa\u2019asuamaleaui is first to crumb the loose ball at ground level. The pace and flow of this contest is of a much higher intensity than Origin I. Already plenty of players look gassed. 18 mins: Superb defence from the Queensland line! NSW had A1 attacking position but time and again the Maroons not only won the one-on-one challenge but they did so with interest. Eventually, the grubber is secured by Munster who finds 10 metres from a crowded in-goal area to run the ball clear. 16 mins: Another massive DCE boot sets up a terrific chase at the end of a set highlighted by Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and Frizell getting to know each other better. The Blues move the ball incrementally downfield for four tackles, then there\u2019s some pathetic handbags at the ruck involving Flegler \u2013 and he concedes a dreadfully soft un-Origin penalty to invite the Blues onto attack. 14 mins: The Maroons are getting momentum with every set, and the kicking game is on point, looking for long early punts downfield to turn Tedesco and his wingers on their heel, inviting punishing chases. 12 mins: Nightmare start for NSW, losing an early try and Trbojevic. Damien Cook, normally a hooker, will have to play 75 minutes as a left centre. And Queensland are not letting them breathe easy, Munster almost nailing a 40-20. Queensland make ground every tackle of the set following Luai\u2019s poor kick, and by the last Cherry-Evans has time to loft a short iron to the right corner. The ball spills off fingers, hits the deck, and a Maroon jersey lands on the loose pill for an opportunistic try! Or is it? Ashley Klein reckons Coates knocked on in the aerial contest with Addo-Carr, so we\u2019re going to the Bunker. Replay after replay is indeterminate until an angle is found to call the play on. Try time! Or is it? Valentine Holmes\u2019s finish isn\u2019t pretty. Was it a knock-on? No! Another line-ball call goes Queensland\u2019s way and the home side hit the front! Holmes clips the outside of the post with his conversion attempt from the right touchline. 8 mins: The second penalty of the night goes the way of NSW after Munster is pinged for slowing down Crichton at the ruck. That turns a set from their line to a territory-builder from halfway for the Blues. But it\u2019s a set that lacks penetration, especially when Robson is fortunate not to knock on a fumble. Moses has looked bright early on and his dart from dummy half allows Luai to grubber from close range, but he overcooks and the balls dribbles dead. Confirmation Tom Trbojevic is out for the night with a pec injury. 6 mins: Following that early burst both teams exchange midfield sets before To\u2019o hammers into the Maroon line \u2013 and Cotter in particular - to create some go-forward. That sets up Moses to bomb from 40m out. His kick is allowed to bounce, but Queensland mop up. 4 mins: Queensland waste no time going through their repertoire, from left wing to right for a tackle, then back to the left where the Maroons have a glimmer out wide but Taulagi can\u2019t get into the corner. In desperation Trbojevic has done himself a serious mischief! Is it a dislocated shoulder \u2013 or worse? Either way, it looks as though Turbo is done for the night and Damien Cook is on in the centres. 2 mins: Paulo, To\u2019o, Haas, Young and Tedesco all hit the line hard for NSW but Moses is forced to launch his first kick from inside his own half. Queensland make little ground for three tackles but Fifita makes his presence known on tackle four and Trbojevic coughs up a soft penalty at the ruck. The Maroons on the attack early. Origin II is underway. The Blues receive Reece Walsh\u2019s kick-off. Can they keep the series alive at fortress Suncorp? The pre-match formalities have been taken care of. On with the footy \u2026 And now the home side, top to toe in Maroon, like most of the 50-odd thousand Queenslanders inside Suncorp Stadium. First out on to the arena are the Blues, led by James Tedesco, and they are met with a cacophony of boos and catcalls. The Blues are more recognisable tonight in their sky blue uniform after Origin one\u2019s navy affair. Wally Lewis and Darren Lockyer emerge from the gloom to parade the State of Origin shield. We are the Champions gets an airing on the PA system. Queensland relishing the opportunity to showcase their status. Could it be hubris? The lights are down at Suncorp Stadium. The two teams are going through their final drills in the sheds. We\u2019ll be underway in about ten minutes. Just enough time before kick-off for this nice read from Gavin Willacy about the growth of rugby league Stateside. The NRL\u2019s priority in the US seems to be more about cashing in on gambling revenue with no mention yet of developing the local game. Have you ever seen Succession\u2019s Roman Roy and Queensland\u2019s Cameron Munster in the same room at the same time? \u201cCan anything upstage what happened on day five of the Ashes last night?\u201d wonders David Ritchie. I doubt it, but hopefully there\u2019s more action in the 8-10pm region than we saw through the Birmingham rain yesterday! Gideon Suvio is tuning in from PNG and he wants to wish the Blues all the best for tonight\u2019s game. Series referee Ashley Klein had plenty of whistleblowing to do in South Australia. Hopefully tonight the two sets of players allow the game to flow. It\u2019s cool and dry and still in Brisbane this evening. In other words, perfect rugby league playing conditions. You\u2019re not imagining it, Queensland do tend to win when its tight. Queensland have a success rate of 51% in Origin games decided by seven points or more, but that jumps to 59% in games decided by six points or fewer. With nearly half of the 126 Origin games decided by these small margins, the Maroons\u2019 ability to clinch tight games is a key reason for their dominance. Do the Maroons have a game two hoodoo? They haven\u2019t won the second match of an Origin series since 2017. Extended further, it\u2019s nine defeats in the past 12 round two encounters. However, the Blues have only once won game two at Suncorp after losing the series opener, and Queensland have won eight of the past 10 Origin clashes at their HQ. Brad Fittler was forced into a huge decision when Nathan Cleary\u2019s hamstring pinged, and he has overlooked the merits of Dally M medallist Nicho Hynes and Suncorp specialist Adam Reynolds in favour of Eels halfback Mitchell Moses. Hynes misses the squad altogether, making way for Reece Robson to offer more versatility in the pack off the bench. He will dovetail at hooker with the recalled Damien Cook. Cameron Murray and Liam Martin were under injury clouds in the build up but both have been passed fit. Fittler is backing his Blues to rebound from their disappointment in Adelaide, especially skipper James Tedesco who was shown up by Roosters clubmate Lindsay Collins late on. \u201cI think the moment at the end of the game was most probably embarrassing for him and embarrassment is a pretty good motivator,\u201d Fittler said.

It\u2019s been a good week.\u201d Queensland: 1 Reece Walsh, 2 Xavier Coates, 3 Valentine Holmes, 4 Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, 5 Murray Taulagi, 6 Cameron Munster, 7 Daly Cherry-Evans, 15 Tom Flegler, 9 Ben Hunt, 10 Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, 11 David Fifita, 16 Reuben Cotter, 13 Pat Carrigan.

The Blues have started favourites in every one of Fittler\u2019s games since he took over in 2018, yet the coach is 8-8 over that time with two series losses. He has been strongly criticised for some questionable selections decisions \u2013 Josh Addo-Carr\u2019s omission in 2022 was widely disparaged \u2013 and admitted prior to this year\u2019s series opener that he was taking some unnecessary risks. Those risks did not pay off. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of State of Origin Game 2 between Queensland\u2019s Maroons and New South Wales\u2019s Blues. Kick-off at Suncorp Stadium is not before 8.05pm (AEST). Three weeks ago the Maroons did what the Maroons do and demonstrate that Queensland is not a place but a state of mind. Unfancied and outplayed for much of Origin I, Billy Slater\u2019s mob turned it on when it mattered to take a series lead to fortress Suncorp. The narrative since Adelaide has been all about the Blues. NSW selection, strategy, and execution have all been questioned. Why have so many key players underperformed so often? How do they fail repeatedly to get over the line when it matters? Whereto now for Brad Fittler? Changes were demanded of the Blues but Fittler\u2019s plans have been thrown into disarray with two cruel injury blows. Halfback Nathan Cleary has been ruled out of the remainder of the series with a hamstring injury, while Latrell Mitchell, the man expected to provide the spark, has not yet fully recovered from the complaint that ruled him out of the series opener. In their own ways each are impossible to replace and not what Fittler needed heading to a venue where his side has lost twice as much as it has won. Queensland are not without their own issues, but they have not come with the same psychodrama.

Since snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in Game 1 at Adelaide, NSW had been under siege from every cliche in the book and every rugby league pundit on the planet. \u201cIt burns,\u201d seethed Fittler. \u201cBut sometimes embarrassment is a pretty good motivator.\u201d Unfortunately, it motivated Queensland more. Until last night, Fittler had never lost a Game 2, winning all five during his tenure to amass an impressive three series wins since 2018. But the 51-year-old coach had been annoyed all week. His side was missing guns Nathan Cleary, Latrell Mitchell and Api Koroisau, and he had 80 minutes to save his skin \u2013 and his legacy. But it wasn\u2019t to be. Riding the sonic boom of a packed Suncorp Stadium, Queensland were imperious. NSW lost Tom Trbojevic with a pectoral injury in the opening minutes and a backline already shorn of Latrell Mitchell now lost its other turbo engine. Perversely, Fittler sent veteran hooker Damien Cook on as centre. He was targeted from the get-go. Cook may lead the NRL for tackles but in Origin he was a speedboat among tankers at ramming speed. Fittler paid the price for bad selections in Game 1 and here again he fumbled the mix, switching his starting wingers so Josh Addo-Carr could combat Xavier Coates\u2019 aerial skills. They met in a marking contest in the ninth minute and the former Bronco won the jump but an Addo-Carr hand touched first leaving Valentine Holmes to collect the crumbs for first blood. NSW lacked clarity in attack but rallied. Payne Haas\u2019s offloads and Brian To\u2019o\u2019s charges built pressure. Called in to replace Cleary as playmaker, Mitchell Moses was nerveless, taking long strides into the defence and kicking to the corners. But each time Queensland had the answers. And too often, Blues overlaps came to nothing when the last pass went awry. On the half hour mark, with Queensland pressing, Stephen Crichton picked up a loose ball and ran 60 metres only to be tackled by Cherry-Evans. With the field spread and the big men redlining with exhaustion, Patrick Carrigan charged into a Blue wall and split it to slip an inside ball to his captain. Cherry-Evans ran for 50 metres and got quick ball back whereupon Queensland went left with fast hands and flat passes to put Taulagi over for 10-0. Whatever Fittler told his troops at half-time it didn\u2019t stir them from their torpor. Queensland struck within four minutes after Walsh pinballed upfield and passed to Holmes who duly planted it in the corner. A desperate NSW came again but Crichton was held up in the corner and as the Blues kicked stones, Queensland shot downfield where Taulagi shimmied a kick infield for Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow to haul in and score. Somehow, with 57% of possession, NSW were behind 20-0. Finally, Cook converted, the former beach sprint champion slicing through to score under the posts and inject hope. The Blues surged, gang-tackling Coates to the sideline, hitting Walsh in the air and forcing errors and penalties from a tiring Maroons side. But again, with their last gasp, Queensland found a way, Walsh beating Addo-Carr and giving Coates clear air to the corner. The Blues\u2019 Latrell-shaped hole flared open again late when Addo-Carr and Cook collided in the air to allow a final insult and a scoreline reflective of Queensland\u2019s dominance. Tempers flared too as the final minutes exploded into an all-in melee that saw three players sent off for a litany of sins. By then Suncorp was swaying to We Are the Champions. The series was over and with it the Fittler era, but for the men in Maroon the party had just begun."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd25ffd", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/private-schools-labour-britain-fee-paying-vat-exemption", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Private schools are on the offensive because Labour looms \u2013 and their privileges are under threat | Lola Okolosie", "lead": "Britain\u2019s fee-paying schools could soon lose their controversial VAT exemption, and fear their protests are falling on closed ears, says teacher and writer Lola Okolosie", "author": "Lola Okolosie", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:30:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224855", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/635b5e0fda28e6416aeac1c5b03d44cdb2fc5cf9/81_624_4040_2424/500.jpg", "body": "How do you square the circle that is a 20% tax exemption for wealthy people? That is the difficult question the Independent Schools Council (ISC), the lobby group for the UK\u2019s private schools, finds itself trying to answer. Accepting that it is \u201cincreasingly likely\u201d that Labour \u2013 which has a policy of charging VAT on private school fees \u2013 will win the next election, the body representing independent schools has stepped up its tactics. In its fightback against one of the few policies that puts clear daylight between the Tories and Labour, the ISC has written to MPs and contacted private schools \u2013 one letter gives schools \u201ca template that Labour insiders suggest could be shared with parents to try to discredit the party\u2019s policy\u201d. This prompted party figures to warn that they could write to the Charity Commission about private schools expressing political opinions or engaging in political campaigns. Were all this not enough, the lobby group\u2019s own emails reveal that officials described Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, as \u201cchippy\u201d \u2013 someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know diddly\u201d and can not \u201cappreciate the great good our sector does\u201d. That private schools do much \u201cgood\u201d for \u201clocal communities\u201d is an argument their defenders repeat so often, you could be forgiven for thinking this is the real reason why \u201chardworking parents\u201d opt to go private. Little mention is made of the socioeconomic premium that private school attendance awards children over the course of their lives. After all, people who hold the top jobs in Britain \u2013 in politics, the judiciary and the media \u2013 are five times more likely to have gone to private school than the general population. By existing, the ISC argues, private schools enrich the school ecosystem, serving communities and creating opportunities for less fortunate children. They point to their charitable partnerships with their poorer state school cousins, warning these might end, should VAT be applied to their fees. And, were that not enough, they make threats: a smaller independent sector places an even greater burden on the already stretched resources of the state sector. Leaving to one side that extra students could well be considered a boon for the state sector, if private schools do believe that they will haemorrhage numbers, then why don\u2019t they countenance making changes to absorb the VAT fee rise rather than pass it on to parents? In any case, many experts are not sure what the effect VAT on fees will have on student numbers \u2013 after all, the rise in fees over the past two decades hasn\u2019t dented demand; fees are at a record high and so, too, are pupil numbers. The sector has raised its fees at a rate far exceeding inflation \u2013 the average annual fee for a non-boarding school is \u00a316,656 \u2013 reflecting how its market is hardly those \u201chardworking\u201d, middle-class families that it likes to speak of. Instead, as one head at a leading independent school put it in 2014, hiked fees have seen them become \u201cfinishing schools for the children of oligarchs\u201d. The Telegraph has also sounded the alarm, worriedly reporting earlier this year that \u201cprivate school fees cost parents twice as much of their income as they did a generation ago\u201d. Under Theresa May\u2019s premiership, the Tories saw the sense in scrapping the tax exemption on fees. So much so that Michael Gove, in a 2017 column for the Times, asked, given the over-representation of public school alumni in Britain\u2019s top jobs, whether \u201cthe children of the rich\u201d are \u201cintrinsically more talented and worthy, more gifted and more deserving of celebration than the rest?\u201d His answer was, of course, no. That didn\u2019t stop May losing her nerve and ditching the policy. Last November, during prime minister\u2019s questions, Keir Starmer posed his own simple question to Rishi Sunak: why, since the latter\u2019s alma mater, Winchester College, \u201chas a rowing club, a rifle club, an extensive art collection \u2026 did he hand them nearly \u00a36m in taxpayers\u2019 money?\u201d (This was Labour\u2019s estimate of the value of the school\u2019s exemption.) Sunak\u2019s response was to accuse Starmer of \u201cattacking the hardworking aspirations of millions of people\u201d. In casting the small minority of parents who can afford private school fees as aspirational \u201cstrivers\u201d, Sunak revealed more than he perhaps intended. What\u2019s more, to learn that parents who can afford to go private would perhaps reconsider doing so were an extra 20% added to fees will garner little to no sympathy. Many parents, I suspect, would like the \u00a31.7bn the Treasury would raise in applying VAT on fees to be pumped back into an education system that serves the majority of our children. \u201cParents have a right to choose how they educate their children, it is one of our basic human rights,\u201d says Julie Robinson, chief executive of the ISC. \u201cThe parents of children in independent schools just want to do the best for their children and that is not something anyone should stop.\u201d Be that as it may, surely, the question remains, why must the rest of us subsidise their drive to secure their children a lifetime of advantage?

Cox said: \u201cWhat The Great Get Together is about is bringing communities together from different backgrounds, different areas, different races, different religions and just saying actually that the thing that Jo talked about so much, which is that we do have more in common than the things that divide us, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re not always very good at remembering that.\u201d He said that Jo\u2019s sister, Kim Leadbeater, who is the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, is bringing MPs together in parliament on Wednesday as part of the events. Cox became a prominent campaigner in the wake of Jo\u2019s death, setting up two charities in her memory. In 2018, he resigned from his posts at More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation, after being publicly accused of sexual assault. It was claimed in the Mail on Sunday that he had assaulted a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015. Police filed her complaint as assault and battery but action against him was dropped.

He joins the former transport secretary Chris Grayling and Simon Clarke, who was the levelling up secretary, in calling for more ambitious climate policies. They will sit on the new steering committee for the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), a group of 159 Tory MPs who pressure the government to improve its green offering. The group was formed a decade ago. The ministers will be calling for Sunak to adopt ambitious policies to unlock more onshore and offshore renewables, improve home energy efficiency, incentivise sustainable transport options, clean up rivers and seas and reward farmers for using nature-friendly practices. In recent weeks, Sunak and government ministers including the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have criticised the Labour party for its green energy policies and the fact one of its donors also donates to the campaign group Just Stop Oil. There are fears among green Conservatives that despite hosting Cop26 and announcing a range of environmental initiatives, the Tories are in danger of losing credibility on the matter, while Labour commits to policies that include ending the moratorium on onshore wind, and vastly expanding green energy. In addition, the Tories have recently given the green light to a coalmine in Cumbria, which the government\u2019s own net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, said should never have been approved. Their focus appears to be on the more expensive routes such as carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power rather than cheaper, proven solutions such as insulation and onshore wind. Sharma said: \u201cClimate change is the greatest challenge of our time. As the UK showed at Cop26, the leadership of a country with a small share of the world\u2019s emissions can make a big difference, raising global ambitions and creating new jobs and industries at home. \u201cThe Conservative Environment Network has been a critical voice in keeping environmentalism at the heart of successive Conservative governments. I look forward to working with its many members to ensure the government has a bold and positive environmental agenda ahead of the next election.\u201d The new group also includes the 2019 Conservative manifesto co-author Rachel Wolf, the environmental audit committee chair and MP, Philip Dunne and the MPs Katherine Fletcher and Selaine Saxby. While the Labour party attempts to focus on green issues and make them a key part of its manifesto offering, there are debates among Conservatives about whether it is worth reaching climate goals at all. Sam Hall, the director of the CEN, added: \u201cWhile some conservatives remain sceptical, they are in the minority, with almost half of Conservative MPs signing up to CEN\u2019s principles during this parliament. \u201cThe debate has moved to focus on how we deliver on our climate and nature goals in a way that enhances our prosperity and security, not whether we have to act or if humans are responsible for environmental degradation. \u201cAs we head toward the next election and the future of conservatism debate continues, we will work to ensure environmental leadership remains at the core of the centre-right politics and to urge conservatives to set out a positive agenda for further environmental action.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26001", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/les-siecles-review-barbican-francois-xavier-roth-berlioz-boulanger", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Les Si\u00e8cles review \u2013 Raw, radical and revelatory as Roth\u2019s period band thrills", "lead": "Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth led an exhilarating and illuminating programme that moved through 80 years of French music, from Berlioz to Boulanger", "author": "Clive Paget", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:06:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224927", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7439d0c0c409751c8ea30b4749bf4689d7c7f052/0_185_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "There are symphony orchestras and there are period instrument bands, and then there is Les Si\u00e8cles.

What\u2019s more, they do it all in the same concert. As a London Symphony Orchestra principal guest conductor, Roth is no stranger to these shores, but this was the first time he\u2019s brought his Paris-based outfit to the Barbican, an event well worth the waiting for. The programme spanned 80 years of French music: from 1841 and Berlioz\u2019s frothy take on Weber\u2019s Invitation to the Dance to Lili Boulanger\u2019s death-haunted D\u2019un soir triste. The latter was written in 1918, the year she died at the age of 24. Tonal contrasts throughout were revelatory. The diaphanous textures of Debussy\u2019s Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune responded instinctively to the gut strings and mellow early-1900s horns. The sound was warm, though never amorphous, in a performance shot through with airiness and light. By contrast, the Berlioz was rich and hefty, an intoxicating waltz fed by a raw, earthy energy. The change to natural horns here lent the music a brazen theatricality. But Roth is more than a one-trick, period-instrument pony. His vibrant interpretations are radical, crafted by expressive, fluttering hand movements and backed up by eloquent body language. In the Berlioz, he practically pirouetted on the podium to get the feel he was after. If he brought out the brutal, uncompromising side of the Boulanger with its funereal drums and ticking celesta, his reading of Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 was teeming with light and shade. Les Si\u00e8cles offered a superb interpretation, bolstered by the London Symphony Chorus\u2019s wordless vocals. From the eerie strings and deep magic of the invocation to Pan, to the languorous streams and birdsong accompanying Ravel\u2019s ear-ravishing sunrise, this was exceptional music-making. The seething bacchanale, with castanets a-go-go, brought matters to a sensual, full-throated conclusion. The encore, a shimmying mashup of Ravel with Quincy Jones\u2019s Soul Bossa Nova, was the icing on the gateau."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26002", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/21/1-point-4m-uk-households-huge-hit-to-finances-mortgage-timebomb-payments-fifth-disposale-income", "primaryCategory": "money", "subCategories": "test", "title": "1.4m UK mortgage holders face 20% hit to disposable income from rate hikes", "lead": "Expected surge in costs by 2025 likely to hit people in 30s hardest, says Institute for Fiscal Studies report", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:04:41", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224944", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/361b33968c7b905fd088f767c26301f10668d992/0_193_5214_3130/500.jpg", "body": "More than 1 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs expected before the next election, the UK\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned. Sounding the alarm as mortgage costs reach the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that almost 1.4m mortgage holders would see at least a fifth of their disposable income erased. It said the heaviest blow would be reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, with the biggest financial hit for households in London and the south-east of England, where property prices are typically higher than the national average. The biggest rise is for those in their 30s, for whom payments will jump by \u00a3360 a month, or 11% of disposable income. The prospect comes as the government faces growing pressure to intervene amid what some MPs have termed a \u201cmortgage timebomb\u201d waiting to explode for millions of households as they reach the end of fixed-rate deals on their home loans. More than a quarter of mortgage holders are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals before the next election, which must be held by 28 January 2025. Households are facing a sharp rise in costs as high street banks drive up new home loan costs above 6%, the highest levels since Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget last autumn. It comes as the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for a 13th consecutive time on Thursday in response to stubbornly high inflation which has left the UK with the highest rate in the G7. Figures on Wednesday showed inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged at 8.7% in May, adding to pressure on the Bank for further increases. According to the analysis by the IFS, more than 14 million adults over the age of 20 have a mortgage. Many have fixed-rate mortgages and so in the short-term are shielded from rate rises. But eventually those fixed terms will come to an end, leaving households exposed to soaring costs. In March 2022, households with a mortgage were spending an average of \u00a3670 a month on payments. On average, individuals in mortgage-holding households will pay almost \u00a3280 on top of this amount each month, with those in their 30s paying almost \u00a3360 more. Adults over the age of 60, typically with smaller mortgages \u2013 often having bought their homes when property prices were lower, or after years of repaying their loans \u2013 would face the smallest hit, at just over \u00a3150 a month. The IFS said households in London and the south-east of England would see the biggest increases: more than \u00a3500 on average, which is worth about 12% of disposable income. The impact would be least in Northern Ireland, where average monthly payments are expected to rise by just over \u00a3150, or less than 6% of disposable income. Thomas Wernham, a research Economist at IFS, said: \u201cMany families bought homes \u2013 often with sizeable mortgages \u2013 when interest rates were very low. As people\u2019s fixed-term offers come to an end, they are going to be exposed to much higher interest rates. For many, the increase in monthly repayments is going to come as a serious shock. \u201cGiven the cost of living pressures people are already facing due to high food and energy price inflation, these significant increases in mortgage costs could not come at a worse time.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26003", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/21/no-hard-feelings-review-jennifer-lawrence-comedy-plays-sex-work-for-laughs", "primaryCategory": "film", "subCategories": "test", "title": "No Hard Feelings review \u2013 Jennifer Lawrence comedy plays sex work for laughs", "lead": "This age-gap story \u2013 Lawrence has to seduce a teenage virgin boy to get a free car \u2013 refuses to make bought sex anything resembling an issue", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224961", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f99e4a92af0751cb4d8d59502d3e63a1ad23d281/0_115_2550_1530/500.jpg", "body": "Comedy, like sex work, is real work and both can have a tough time gaining acceptance in the respectable world, so it\u2019s a pleasure to find a comedy about bought sex that\u2019s pretty funny \u2013 and funnier than the pun in the title might suggest. Gene Stupnitsky co-wrote and directed the amusing bad-taste romp Good Boys, and now he gives us another age-gap comedy about a very unsentimental education. The scene is Montauk in New York state, famously the location for TV series The Affair. Jennifer Lawrence plays Maddie, a woman in her early 30s who has been unlucky in love, who still lives in her childhood home, all alone since the death of her mother and not much idea about what to do with her life. She scratches a living as an Uber driver, but her car gets repossessed for non-payment of Montauk\u2019s exorbitant property taxes on a house which she stubbornly won\u2019t rent or sell to the arrogant tourist incomers who are pricing locals like her out of the neighbourhood. Maddie\u2019s best friends, surfer-dude Jim (Scott MacArthur) and his pregnant partner Sara (Natalie Morales), point out an interesting opening advertised on Craigslist. A wealthy, painfully liberal couple, Laird (Matthew Broderick) and Allison (Laura Benanti) are offering a free car to a woman who can \u201cdate\u201d their intensely shy and virginal 19-year-old son, a brilliant musician who is going to Princeton in the fall; they are scared that without experience, college is going to be just too traumatic for him. With her usual robust frankness, Maddie interviews for the job and brusquely sets out to seduce tremulous young Percy, played by Andrew Barth Feldman. She impatiently wants to get this whiny kid\u2019s cherry popped and then get the car. But of course it isn\u2019t as simple as that. This screenplay may well have been conceived before Craigslist banned dodgy hook-up ads a few years ago, but the film\u2019s reluctance to make bought sex anything resembling an issue is very contemporary. It means that there is no comic or dramatic traction from the arrangement itself being supposedly wrong, other than the parents\u2019 sneakiness in not telling Percy that they were behind it. It is not aiming for transgressive or outrageous bad taste \u2013 as in, say, the Stifler-mom scenes from American Pie a generation ago \u2013 nor any final emotional reckoning for Maddie who is never called upon to regret her Faustian bargain. The movie cheerfully gets on with its high-concept premise, but this just gives a slight sheen or glaze of unreality to the proceedings. Maddie and Percy\u2019s relationship is not as plausible as that of Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Licorice Pizza, however studiedly bizarre that was. And for pure age-gap craziness, we can always look up Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s legendary encounter with Jack Nicholson on Oscar night in 2013. But there are some great scenes, chiefly one in which Maddie, stark naked, comes up to some bullies on the beach who have stolen her clothes while she and Percy were skinny dipping and proceeds to beat them up. There is also Maddie\u2019s generational dismay in crashing a high-school party to confront Percy after an argument. It shows what a comedy turn Lawrence can still be. \u2022 No Hard Feelings is released on 21 June in the UK, 22 June in Australia and 23 June in the US."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26004", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/carnegie-medal-childrens-books-translation-manon-steffan-ros-blue-book-of-nebo", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carnegie medal for children\u2019s books goes to a translation for the first time", "lead": "Manon Steffan Ros\u2019s young adult novel The Blue Book of Nebo, set in a post-apocalyptic Wales, was praised by judges as \u2018expertly realised\u2019 and heartbreaking", "author": "Ella Creamer", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 12:00:39", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224979", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec70f24905b2196e981a228b629e2a096984f40/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "Welsh writer Manon Steffan Ros has won the 2023 Yoto Carnegie medal, the UK\u2019s most prestigious children\u2019s books award, the first time a translated book has won in its 87-year history. Judges described Ros\u2019s young adult novel The Blue Book of Nebo, set in a post-apocalyptic Wales, as both \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and \u201crich with Welsh heritage\u201d. The work, originally published in Welsh, was translated by Ros herself. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted,\u201d Ros said. \u201cI used to see the word Carnegie on the cover of my favourite books when I was a child, so this means a great deal to me.\u201d The medal for illustration went to Jeet Zdung for Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear, by Vietnamese wildlife conservationist Trang Nguyen. The book, which features manga-inspired illustrations and watercolour scenes, is based on a true story about a young woman working on her own to save a bear. It is the second year in a row that a graphic novel has won the illustration prize, formerly known as the Kate Greenaway medal. The winners of the medals were announced at a London ceremony on Wednesday hosted by Lauren Child, who won the illustration award in 2000 for her first Charlie and Lola book. Ros\u2019s novel charts the relationship between a mother and son who struggle to survive in their isolated hilltop home after a nearby nuclear disaster leaves them without electricity or running water. \u201cAs this is the first book in translation to win the Carnegie, my hopes are that readers, and particularly publishers, are more open to books in translation,\u201d Ros said. The chair of judges, librarian Janet Noble, said of Ros\u2019s novel: \u201cThe world-building and distinct voices of the two main characters, the son and his mother, are expertly realised and the reader is compelled to question their own relationship with the modern world\u201d. Ros lives in Tywyn, north Wales, and has written more than 20 books for adults and children. The original Welsh version of The Blue Book of Nebo, Llyfr Glas Nebo, won the 2019 Wales book of the year. Ros and Zdung both receive a \u00a35,000 cash prize and \u00a3500 worth of books to donate to a library of their choice. Ros is planning to donate to Tywyn library, where she wrote some of her books when she didn\u2019t have internet access at home, while Zdung will support libraries that Nguyen has set up near Vietnamese national parks. Zdung said he hopes Saving Sorya \u201cwill offer a deep knowledge of wildlife while impressing upon young people the importance of its conservation\u201d. In preparation to illustrate the book, he conducted field research in Vietnam and Cambodia. \u201cRoaming through the jungle and volunteering in a bear rescue centre provided me with firsthand experiences that I used to enrich the characters\u2019 lives and make them authentic,\u201d he added. Noble said that Saving Sorya \u201cis a beautiful story, elegantly told, which brings together a global view of conservation and an empowering true story of an inspiring female environmentalist, told through dazzling manga art and watercolours. Jeet has crafted every illustration to immerse the reader, just as Manon draws the reader in completely with her vivid, deliberate prose.\u201d The prizes were judged by a panel of 12 librarians, who selected winners from a shortlist of seven for the writing medal and six for the illustration award. In a separate prize, children from reading groups in schools and libraries also voted for their preferred winners, who each received a medal. This year\u2019s \u201cshadowers\u2019 choice\u201d award for writing went to I Must Betray You by Ruta Sepetys, who previously won the headline Carnegie medal in 2017 for Salt to the Sea. Joe Todd-Stanton won the shadowers\u2019 illustration medal for The Comet. The Carnegie medals were established in 1936 for writing and 1955 for illustration, open to books in the English language. This means that in theory translations into English have always been eligible. Previous winners of the writing award include Arthur Ransome, CS Lewis, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett and Phillip Pullman; earlier illustration winners include Raymond Briggs, Shirley Hughes and Quentin Blake."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26005", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/transpennine-express-services-worse-under-state-owned-olr", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TransPennine Express services \u2018worse\u2019 under state-owned OLR", "lead": "Operator, which covers trains across north of England and southern Scotland, cancelled more than 90 trains in a day this month", "author": "Gwyn Topham Transport correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:48:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.224996", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29c6d6992b214c3f14ca5663220f59b6c79af862/0_91_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "The TransPennine Express train service has got \u201cworse rather than better\u201d since transferring to the state-owned operator of last resort (OLR), according to the rail minister, Huw Merriman. The government announced last month that the service, which covers trains across the north of England and into southern Scotland, would be run by the state after the expiration of a contract with the FirstGroup-owned private operator TransPennine Express on 28 May. The operator failed to run more than a quarter of trains at the start of the year as passengers experienced disruption, cancellations and a decline in the extent and reliability of the service. Its performance had improved since then but has dipped again, with more than 90 trains cancelled in a day at the start of June. Merriman said it was \u201cno reflection on that team\u201d from OLR who had taken over, and who had previously stepped in to rescue the neighbouring Northern franchise. Most staff, bar the managing director, were transferred over, but scarce drivers with route knowledge who were not required to work their notice were lost. Speaking to the Commons transport select committee, the minister said the decision to bring in OLR was taken because he did not believe FirstGroup\u2019s operator could work with the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef to restore services. While the service, which is still branded TransPennine Express, had started to show improvement, he said: \u201cI took the view that the plan couldn\u2019t be deliverable unless a rest day working agreement was in place.\u201d Merriman said: \u201cOnly 50% of drivers have full route knowledge \u2026 It takes 18 months to train a driver, and because they are all driving rather than training up others, we were only going to be able to train all the drivers up if we got back to the position in December 2021 where we had an agreement that unions could work overtime.\u201d The new management team and Aslef have now agreed to restart rest day working, he said, although it will be delayed due to a week of industrial action in July as part of the national pay dispute. Merriman said: \u201cI\u2019ve got great faith in their ability to turn this around, but we always said the issue was not necessarily with the management but with third parties \u2026 It appears Aslef have had a reset moment themselves and I welcome that and believe that will make things better.\u201d On the wider rail dispute, Merriman admitted that the government was \u201ccurrently stuck\u201d and said an offer to unions was \u201con the table\u201d. Earlier, speaking to LBC radio, the RMT leader, Mick Lynch, said they were not any closer to a resolution. Lynch said: \u201cThe government have locked down this dispute \u2026 It\u2019s very likely there will be more strike action by the RMT. There\u2019s no resolution at the moment, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Meanwhile, Merriman said proposals for a new station in Bradford would be announced next week, when the Department for Transport responds to select committee criticisms of its integrated rail plan. The plan, announced in 2021, outraged northern leaders by missing out the city in downgraded high-speed connections."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26006", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/bank-of-england-interest-rates-inflation-unchanged", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Bank poised to hike interest rates as inflation remains unchanged at 8.7%", "lead": "OONS figures show stabilising energy prices were offset by rises in cost of air fares, holidays and secondhand cars", "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:41:40", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225013", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6558a3d89c257ccccaf6a2537cdb0c57ac6e41b0/0_118_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Borrowers have been put on notice for further Bank of England interest rate rises after inflation in the UK unexpectedly remained stuck at 8.7% in May, adding to the pressure on households suffering a surge in mortgage costs. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index was unchanged last month from the rate in April. City economists had forecast a figure of 8.4%. In a shock report that underscored the challenge facing the central bank to curb the highest rates of inflation in decades, energy prices stabilising at record levels were offset by a sharp rise in the cost of air fares and package holidays as consumers rushed to book overseas summer travel. Rising prices for secondhand cars, live music events and video games also contributed to inflation remaining high. Financial markets reacted to the figures by betting that the Bank would increase rates on Thursday by at least a quarter-point from the current level of 4.5%, with a 50/50 chance of a tougher hike of half a percentage point to 5%. The central bank has already pushed through 12 consecutive rate hikes since December 2021, when borrowing costs had been set at a record low of 0.1% to support the economy through the Covid pandemic. Core inflation \u2013 a measure that excludes volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, and which is closely watched by the Bank \u2013 rose from 6.8% in April to 7.1% in May, the highest level since 1992. The government is under growing pressure to intervene to help millions of households facing a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d of higher mortgage payments before the general election. Figures from the data provider Moneyfacts showed that the average interest rate on a two-year fixed residential mortgage rose to 6.15% on Wednesday, the highest level since Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget last autumn. Underscoring the financial pain for millions of housheolds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank warned that almost 1.4m mortgage holders would see 20% of their disposable income erased by the surge in borrowing costs. It said the heaviest blow would be reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, and that households in London and the south-east of England, where property prices are typically higher than the national average, would be worst hit. The latest inflation reading is likely to embarrass Rishi Sunak, who promised to halve inflation to about 5% before the end of this year. Concerns are growing about the persistence of the cost of living crisis as prices continue to rise at rates that are among the fastest in three decades. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he recognised that inflation was hurting families and businesses across the country, but he dismissed calls for government intervention. \u201cOur plan to halve the rate this year is the best way we can keep costs and interest rates down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy, while also providing targeted support with the cost of living.\u201d Hunt said he had spoken to the consumer champion Martin Lewis ahead of a meeting with banks this Friday \u201cto ensure banks are living up to the commitments\u201d agreed in December to help mortgage borrowers struggling with payments and to discuss \u201cwhat more they can do to help\u201d. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government was failing to tackle inflation despite Sunak\u2019s promise to halve it. \u201cThis Tory government can\u2019t get a grip of this problem because they are the problem \u2013 13 years of the Tories and their disastrous mini-budget are damaging our economic security and leaving families worse off,\u201d she said. According to the latest snapshot from the ONS, certain bigger musical acts playing at concert venues last month contributed to a sharp rise in the price of buying a gig ticket, drawing parallels with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Stockholm concert last month being blamed for high Swedish inflation. Economists said it was unlikely that the singer had caused the increase in Britain, because her tour came to London in late May, after the cut-off point for the ONS to gather price information. The statistics body declined to identify which acts had contributed to the rise in particular. Falling petrol and diesel prices for motorists led to the largest downward contribution to inflation, while pressure from food and drink prices eased after they increased by less in May than in the same month a year earlier. Prices remain high and are still rising fast, adding to pressure on struggling households. Although food and drink inflation slowed from 19% in April, it only dropped to 18.3%, still among the fastest rates in decades. The figures highlighted the UK\u2019s position as an international outlier with the highest inflation in the G7. The rate is more than three times the figure in the US and significantly higher than in several EU countries. There are growing speculation that high interest rates could tip the UK economy into recession as households suffering from a sharp rise in borrowing costs pull back on spending. Karen Ward, the chief market strategist at the US bank JP Morgan, who is also an adviser to Hunt, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the Bank of England could be forced to engineer the conditions for a recession. \u201cThe difficulty for the Bank of England \u2013 I mean, no one envies them their job at the moment \u2013 is, they have to therefore create a recession,\u201d she said."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26007", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-483-of-the-invasion", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 483 of the invasion", "lead": "Zelenskiy urges help to rebuild country as UK and EU unveil reconstruction packages at London conference", "author": "Alexandra Topping and agencies", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:37:22", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225030", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5957c90e662a4dd69c5d0ec2c6c0f06697c918ef/0_125_5770_3461/500.jpg", "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom.

In a blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s plans to cut taxes before the general election, which is expected next year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said net debt reached \u00a32.6tn as of the end of May, estimated at 100.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). It is the first time the ratio of debt to GDP has risen above 100% since March 1961, apart from a brief spike at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic that was later revised down because of stronger GDP figures. The increase in total debt came after government borrowing soared to \u00a320bn in May, pushed higher by the cost of energy support schemes, inflation-linked benefit payments and interest payments on debt. The borrowing figure was \u00a33bn lower than in April but \u00a310.7bn higher than a year ago and the second highest May borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. A rise in tax receipts offset the increase in debt payments. Economists said the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s drive to cut spending across Whitehall appeared to be having an effect. But the combination of higher income and cuts in day-to-day spending was unable to prevent a steep rise in the monthly deficit. Hunt said the government had been taking \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to balance the books after the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe rightly spent billions to protect families and businesses from the worst impacts of the pandemic and [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s energy crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be manifestly unfair to leave future generations with a tab they cannot repay. That\u2019s why we have taken difficult but necessary decisions to balance the books in order to halve inflation this year, grow the economy and reduce debt.\u201d Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said that while there were only two months of figures for the current financial year, borrowing was already running \u00a32.1bn above the most recent estimates by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster. Beck said: \u201cWe expect this gap to widen as we move through 2023-24. The likelihood that GDP and inflation will be stronger than the OBR expects is positive for tax revenues. However, this will be more than offset by the upward pressures on spending. \u201cHigher inflation combined with higher short- and long-term interest rates will significantly increase the level of debt interest payments, and borrowing could overshoot the OBR\u2019s forecast by as much as \u00a320bn by the end of the fiscal year.\u201d TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, a right-of-centre pressure group, said Hunt should respond with even deeper cuts to public spending to free up funds for tax cuts. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said financial markets would only tolerate the government reviving tax cuts after the debacle of last autumn\u2019s mini-budget if inflation had fallen sharply and interest rates had \u201crisen to a lesser extent\u201d than the markets currently envisaged. He said figures for May that showed the consumer prices index remained at 8.7% cast doubt on whether inflation would have \u201cfallen sufficiently far by the autumn statement for the chancellor to consider any loosening of the fiscal plans\u201d. Inflation has already cost the government billions of pounds in extra spending. The ONS estimates that the Treasury spent about \u00a31.5bn on energy support schemes in May. These include the energy price guarantee (EPG) that caps average bills at \u00a32,500 a year and the energy bills discount scheme (EBDS). The schemes are estimated to have cost the UK \u00a329.7bn in the first six months alone. The EPG was initially set to run from October to March but was extended until July. It will be replaced by Ofgem\u2019s price cap for average annual energy bills on 1 July, which has been set at \u00a32,074. The figures also revealed that the interest payable on central government debt was \u00a37.7bn in May, which was \u00a3200m less than a year ago but \u00a3700m more than was forecast by the OBR. Borrowing in the first two months of this financial year has reached \u00a342.9bn \u2013 \u00a319.6bn more than in the same two-month period a year ago."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2600a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/manchester-city-begin-talks-over-25m-deal-for-mateo-kovacic-from-chelsea", "primaryCategory": "football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Manchester City agree \u00a325m deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea", "lead": "Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for a fee of \u00a325m plus \u00a35m in add-ons", "author": "Fabrizio Romano and Sachin Nakrani", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:23:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225084", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/962101f1cdf06004074e6e8806971cafea1f1c4b/0_101_3025_1815/500.jpg", "body": "Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea for a fee of \u00a325m plus \u00a35m in add-ons.

That bill will only be getting higher, but as a conference in London on the reconstruction and recovery of the country begins, humanitarians and political leaders have warned that bricks and mortar are not all that is needed. What has been pledged so far? The EU pumped \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) into Ukraine in the last year, diverting cash from energy and cohesion funds to respond to the crisis. On Tuesday it pledged a further \u20ac50bn in loans and grants, with the UK and the US following suit with a promise of $3bn and $1.3bn respectively in financial supports. Is it enough? No. The World Bank\u2019s estimate represents three times Ukraine\u2019s GDP and the money pledged by the EU, UK and the US will be disbursed over a number of years. The \u20ac50bn in EU money is spread out over four years. The goal is to help stabilise the country\u2019s finances not build back blown up towns and cities. But it will go a long way to meet Ukraine\u2019s request for up to $40bn for the first part of a programme being dubbed a \u201cGreen Marshall plan\u201d. Can physical reconstruction begin? How can you rebuild a country when it is still at war? \u201cYou don\u2019t know how long the war will be there, whether what you invest in will be destroyed the week after. So it\u2019s very challenging,\u201d Odile Renaud-Basso, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), told reporters in Brussels recently. How has the country been functioning up to now? Contributions to Ukraine\u2019s defence resources have dominated the headlines in terms of international support for the fight against Russia. Day to day needs have been put at \u20ac3bn a month \u2013 half of which has been paid by the EU. Financing from the EBRD, set up in 1991 to help secure financial stability in post-cold-war central and eastern Europe, has enabled salaries of teachers, civil servants, doctors and nurses to continue to be paid. The bank expects to invest \u20ac3bn this year and is hoping to put together guarantees that can leverage about \u20ac12-13bn in additional funding from the public and private sector. What about the bereaved and the bombed? Financial systems are already in place for state compensation for those whose homes have been bombed with a government app, DIAA, allowing rapid applications. But long-term human capital is the key to recovery, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, said this week in Brussels, with investment not just in factories, agriculture and IT but in mental health. A director of the Danish Red Cross, Peter Klanso, told a conference that there were an estimated 9 million people directly impacted by the war, both soldiers and civilians. He said the poor and the marginalised would be \u201cfurther marginalised\u201d if their voices were not heard. And those on the recovery leadership planning must find a way of reaching them too. The leaders of the EU will meet next week and are expected to reiterate this point, restating the need for \u201cpsychological and psychosocial rehabilitation\u201d alongside bricks and mortar."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2600c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/china-is-state-most-dangerous-to-its-own-citizens-civil-rights-report-finds", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": "test", "title": "China is state most dangerous to its own citizens\u2019 civil rights, report finds", "lead": "China scores better on food, health and housing, while crackdowns have worsened Hong Kong\u2019s ratings", "author": "Amy Hawkins senior China correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225118", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/37cbe630b3fb84f6d46b6b153b3db7cfb70b5341/0_0_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "China has been ranked as the worst country in the world for safety from the state and the right to assembly, in a human rights report that tracks social, economic and political freedoms. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI), a New Zealand-based project, has been monitoring various countries\u2019 human rights performance since 2017. In 2022, HRMI started tracking freedom of religion and belief for the first time. China also scored worst on this indicator, although the pilot study only covered nine countries. HRMI concluded that on several measures China was the country in the world with the worst human rights record. On freedom from arbitrary arrest, only Kazakhstan scored worse. However, on certain economic indicators, such as the right to food, health and housing, China scored relatively highly, coming near the top of more than 100 surveyed countries. For the economic indicators HRMI uses publicly available statistics published by national and international institutions, rather than surveys. The index does point out that people in certain groups in China, such as critics of the government and ethnic minorities, often miss out on basic economic rights. The index tracks civil and political rights via a survey that is distributed to human rights experts such as journalists, NGO workers and lawyers in various countries. These areas are tightly controlled in China, making accurate data collection extremely difficult. Thalia Kehoe Rowden, a spokesperson for HRMI, said: \u201cWe take survey respondents\u2019 safety and security extremely seriously, and have been operating in countries where human rights defenders are in danger for several years now. \u201cOne of the keys to our security is that the survey is taken anonymously in an encrypted online form, so no one can find out exactly who has participated or what they have said.\u201d Hong Kong has dropped down HRMI\u2019s index in recent years. Although it does not score as badly as China, it has seen a rapid decrease in many rights since the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in 2019 and 2020. Between those years its ranking on the freedom of assembly index declined by nearly 40%, and on the freedom of expression index by 33%, according to HRMI. HRMI also concluded Hong Kong\u2019s score on the freedom from arbitrary arrest index had improved, increasing by 85%. But this was because the index was based on instances of actual rights violations, said Kehoe Rowden. \u201cIn this repressive context, the rise in scores for freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is not good news. It just means that the repression is working. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s scores for democratic rights and freedoms plummeted over 2019-21 and have remained appallingly low.\u201d Between 2019 and 2020, the last year for which HRMI has data on health indicators, most countries\u2019 health score declined, reflecting the high numbers of deaths from Covid-19. However, the score for China, which experienced a relatively low number of deaths before the zero-Covid policy was abandoned in 2022, remained steady."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2600d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/lead-emissions-racetracks-portland-international-raceway", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Revealed: a toxic metal is in a US city\u2019s air \u2013 and may be harming children\u2019s brains", "lead": "The Guardian finds children in Portland, Oregon, could have lower test scores due to lead emissions from nearby racetrack, one of dozens across the US to use toxic leaded gasoline", "author": "Emma Pattee and Stuart Henigson  in Portland, Oregon", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225136", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/10573e440fa4714af168b659225d1e1a62f5d672/0_170_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "When a neighbor mentioned to Kristy Lanciotti, a mother of two and pediatric nurse who works in environmental health, that toxic leaded gasoline was being used at a racetrack just down the road from her house in Portland, Oregon, she was taken aback. She was well aware of Portland International Raceway \u2013 most summer weekends were punctuated by the roar of engines \u2013 but Lanciotti, like most of her neighbors, was surprised to learn that the cars in many of those events were powered by a fuel that could damage her children\u2019s brains. Lead is so toxic that its use in gasoline has been phased out worldwide. Yet, unbeknownst to many, it is still in widespread use at dozens of racetracks around the US identified by the Guardian. Concern about the Portland racetrack, for one, is now growing, because new research has revealed the extent to which lead emissions from automobile racing impairs the cognitive development of children living nearby. Based on the research, the Guardian calculated that third graders \u2013 students aged eight or nine \u2013 who have grown up within two miles of Portland International Raceway could experience more than a six-percentage point decline in their standardized test scores. \u201cThat is pretty startling,\u201d said Vivek Shandas, a professor of urban studies at Portland State University, who reviewed the Guardian\u2019s findings. He described lead exposure at Portland International Raceway as \u201cone of the more serious concerns that would affect the environmental health of Portlanders\u201d. Part of what makes Portland International Raceway a serious concern is simply the location. Unlike most other tracks in the country, the raceway abuts a dense urban neighborhood in North Portland. The researchers who developed the methodology \u2013 Alex Hollingsworth, an associate professor in the school of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University, and Ivan Rudik, an assistant professor in the school of applied economics and management at Cornell University \u2013 say that students living as much as 25 miles from a given racetrack can be affected by its lead emissions. When Hollingsworth was asked what he would do if he lived in one of the many houses bordering the Portland raceway, his answer was simple: \u201cI would move.\u201d The city of Portland \u2013 which owns and operates the track \u2013 does not share this conclusion. It has rebuffed years of calls by residents to address the lead emissions. In response to the Guardian\u2019s findings, it said: \u201cPortland Parks &amp; Recreation\u2019s highest priority is public safety by following the guidance of public health and environmental protection agencies.\u201d Residents say the decision to allow leaded gas at the racetrack is especially confounding given Portland\u2019s reputation as one of the greenest enclaves in the country. Portland recently announced a goal to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. \u201cPhilosophically, it just doesn\u2019t seem right that this is something that\u2019s owned and operated by the city for recreational purposes,\u201d said Lanciotti. Lead began to be used in gasoline in the 1920s as a means of improving engine performance. However, in the 1950s, researchers discovered that when a child is exposed to lead \u2013 even in small amounts which would be safe for an adult \u2013 it can have devastating consequences. It travels from their blood into their brain and other organs. It can lower their IQ and cause other neurological problems. Later in life, lead exposure is linked to early death from stroke and certain heart diseases. In 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency banned the sale of leaded fuel for passenger cars as part of the Clean Air Act. However, an exemption was made for \u201coff-road\u201d vehicles, such as farm machinery, marine engines and race cars. Because of the risk of lead exposure, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continued to pressure the racing industry to stop using leaded fuel. In response, Nascar, one of the top motorsports organizations in the world, stopped using leaded fuel in 2007. But leaded racing fuel has continued to be used in vintage automobile races and to enhance performance in certain race cars. Sunoco, one of the largest distributors of racing fuels, sells at least ten leaded racing fuels with names like Surge and Cyclone 17, which retail for more than $20 a gallon. There are more than a dozen major race tracks around the US where leaded gasoline is in use in certain races. One of these tracks, Sebring International Raceway, outside of a small community in central Florida, says that its track is active nearly 300 days a year. In response to the Guardian\u2019s inquiry about the amount of leaded gasoline used at their races, Sebring said it \u201cwould not have any information that would be helpful\u201d. Laguna Seca, a renowned track in central California, reported that the track sold 11,000 gallons of leaded fuel from April 2021 through April 2022, which is over four times the amount sold at the Portland track annually. It is in a relatively remote area, though there are several schools within a distance of 3 miles. The remaining tracks did not respond or declined to comment. It\u2019s not just the urban proximity that sets Portland International Raceway apart from these other tracks. Even more striking is that the racetrack is technically a city park, a fact that neighborhood advocates say makes the lead exposure even more egregious. \u201cIt\u2019s a city park run by the City of Portland, that has all these initiatives to ban diesel and lower emissions while also saying we\u2019re fine with using leaded gas in one of our parks and exposing our citizens to it.\u201d says Ryan Pittel, a longtime resident of North Portland and a board member of the Kenton Neighborhood Association. At Portland International Raceway, about 40% of the events use leaded gasoline. Over the past five years, the racetrack has sold anywhere from 1,300 gallons to 3,000 gallons of leaded gasoline annually. Although the CDC, EPA and WHO \u2013 along with the city of Portland \u2013 state that there is no safe level of lead for children, Portland\u2019s bureau of parks and recreation maintains that lead emissions from the track do not pose a health risk. This stance is based on a 2017 study that tested levels of lead during a race event. The Oregon department of environmental quality (DEQ) used those numbers to estimate emissions in nearby areas and said, in a memo to the neighborhood association, that \u201clevels of lead emissions modeled did not pose immediate health risks to residential areas around the track\u201d. At the heart of the issue is the tension between what would cause \u201cimmediate health risks\u201d, judged by the DEQ to be a lead exposure level of 0.15 micrograms averaged over 24 hours, and the less-immediate but lifelong impacts to children from chronic exposure to lower levels of lead. \u201cI get the frustration,\u201d said Perry Cabot, a public health officer for Multnomah county, which includes the city of Portland. \u201cPeople living in these neighborhoods, they see that we\u2019re saying there is no safe level [for children], but that we are allowing this release of lead and they are asking, \u2018How do we make sense of that?\u2019\u201d Lanciotti, the nurse living near the raceway, dismissed the idea that low levels of lead emissions wouldn\u2019t be harmful to children living nearby. \u201cWe know enough about lead to know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d And pollution experts such as Shandas, of Portland State University, argue that in any event the national and local regulators are underestimating how much lead is in the air. \u201cThe ways in which DEQ and OHA [Oregon health authority] and even the EPA go about addressing air quality has been so well recognized as woefully inadequate,\u201d he said. Now, with this new research showing that the levels at the Portland racetrack may be significant enough to cause developmental issues in children, local residents are asking why the city isn\u2019t taking their concerns more seriously. Ella Newell, a mother of a third grader who has lived near the racetrack for the past eight years, said the 6 percentage points outcome was even worse than she feared. \u201cIt\u2019s like we don\u2019t matter enough. Our homes, our taxes, our kids, don\u2019t matter enough to address this.\u201d Residents of North Portland have been fighting with the city to ban the use of lead at the raceway for over seven years. While Portland has the title \u201cWhitest City in America\u201d, the neighborhoods closest to the raceway \u2013 Portsmouth, Kenton and Piedmont \u2013 are historically diverse neighborhoods. As of 2020, 30%-50% of the population of these areas identified as a race other than white. Terrance Moses, the chairman of the neighborhood association, argued that low-income and marginalized communities aren\u2019t prioritized by the city of Portland. \u201cWe aren\u2019t [heard], we never have been, and it\u2019s still an ongoing process,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThe low-income white folks that are living here feel the same way because they\u2019re just being ignored also.\u201d In October 2022, residents of North Portland appeared before the Portland city council, asking them to ban the use of leaded gasoline at Portland International Raceway. In January, the Kenton Neighborhood Association met with Dan Ryan, the new commissioner in charge of the parks bureau. When the Guardian reached out to Ryan for comment, his office said: \u201cThe city takes public safety very seriously and works diligently to comply with all public health and environmental protection regulations, and we will continue to do so.\u201d In March 2023, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation indicated to the Guardian that it would continue to allow racers to use leaded fuel at the racetrack, but the city itself would no longer sell it at the track. For Ryan Pittel, who was one of the residents who spoke in front of the city council last October, this is a frustrating development, since the city of Portland will no longer be required to report the gallons sold. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we asked for. We\u2019re gonna keep fighting until it\u2019s gone.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2600e", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/behind-bars-how-rap-lyrics-are-being-used-to-convict-black-british-men", "primaryCategory": "music", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Behind bars: how rap lyrics are being used to convict Black British men", "lead": "<strong>Exclusive</strong>: Crown Prosecution Service claims no one is convicted solely via lyrics, but shocking new research finds juries being shown music and dance as evidence of guilt", "author": "Will Pritchard", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225153", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f0045be536a4c6094238d7390a3214482613730d/0_437_5050_3030/500.jpg", "body": "On 6 February 2020, around 11.15am, a 16-year-old boy stepped out of Brighton\u2019s Regent Hotel and walked towards the terraced green of Regency Square. He had with him a handful of small, pebble-sized packages, some bound in blue plastic, the others in white. The different colours let him know which contained heroin, and which cocaine. Plain clothes police officers watching the boy soon discovered another 115 similar wraps in the hotel room he had been staying in. Just over a year later, at the crown court in Lewes, a jury convicted the boy, who had been sent to Brighton by a north London gang known as the Mali Boys, of two counts of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs. James (not his real name) had been placed into care early in his teens, the court had heard, and subjected to abuse in the years before that. He\u2019d been arrested in the past, and had moved and sold drugs for other gangs from north London, venturing as far as Norfolk with their packages. James is also autistic. His lawyers suggested this would have made him more susceptible to being drawn into criminality by these gangs. He and two other young men admitted to selling drugs in Brighton, but claimed in their defence that they were victims of modern slavery \u2013 exploited by the Mali Boys to distribute its drugs and collect the proceeds. The two other teenagers were acquitted, but James\u2019s defence was rejected by the prosecution. The court had been shown a rap video in which James could be seen dancing while alleged Mali Boys members traded verses over a brooding drill beat. This proved, the prosecuting barrister argued, that the boy was a willing associate of the gang. The boy said this wasn\u2019t the case. He said he\u2019d joined in with the filming because he thought it would be fun. He didn\u2019t know what the song was about. He was just dancing. James is just one of more than 240 people in the UK \u2013 almost all young, black men \u2013 whose fate in court over the past three years has been decided in part by their taste in rap music. Rap materials making their way into UK courtrooms can be professionally recorded tracks, but often consist of little more than throwaway lyrics in iPhone notes or derivative scribbles in teenagers\u2019 notebooks \u2013 still enough for prosecutors to win convictions. When contacted by the Guardian, the Crown Prosecution Service says that it \u201chas never prosecuted anybody solely on the basis of their involvement with drill/rap music\u201d but that \u201cdrill/rap music may be of specific relevance to the case against a suspect, in which case it may be used as evidence.\u201d New research, conducted in partnership with the University of Manchester\u2019s Prosecuting Rap project, has identified more than 70 trials from 2020-2023 in which rap evidence including lyrics, music videos and audio recordings has been used by police and prosecutors to build their cases. Previous research spanning a period five times as long, between 2005 and 2020, uncovered 67 cases. This increased appearance of rap in courtrooms suggests authorities have latched on to the approach as one that can secure convictions with juries \u2013 seemingly without concern for the possibly prejudicial nature of such evidence. For UK police and prosecutors today, \u201cmusic helps open a pathway to conviction\u201d, says Eithne Quinn, professor of cultural studies at the University of Manchester and lead on the Prosecuting Rap project. She\u2019s particularly worried by \u201cthe young age and high average number of defendants in cases in which rap is sought to be used. Children and young adults are being drawn into rap-fuelled group charges in which there is often one principal offence committed by one individual.\u201d In drill rap, performers taunting others and referring in verses, often callously, to specific instances of real-world violence is not unheard of. But even in these cases, it remains a stretch to prove that such wordplay directly results in violence. Those who oppose the use of the practice say that, more often, rap is introduced as a sprinkle of prejudice across proceedings. In James\u2019s case, his mere presence in a video was seemingly enough to colour his character for the court. Following a successful appeal based on the original judge\u2019s mishandling of the modern slavery defence, James\u2019s convictions were quashed. But in a 2020 analysis of earlier use of rap evidence in UK courts, Dr Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, an associate professor of law at the London School of Economics, found just one instance in which the use of such evidence was successfully appealed. High-profile trials like the one currently involving US chart-topping rapper Young Thug draw attention to this issue; Jay-Z is among the artists behind a prominent campaign for rap lyrics not to be admissible as evidence in the US. But in the UK, most instances go unreported, and there could be many more than those uncovered here. Save for the testimony of witnesses, the grousing of barristers and solicitors, or police officers posting about their exploits on social media, researchers are left to rely on the publication of appeal judgments and reports from local media \u2013 neither of which are guaranteed to include mention of rap evidence. James\u2019s case is emblematic of how rap evidence has been used in UK courts over the past three years. Firstly, in that it involves young men (almost half of the cases recorded in the research featured defendants yet to turn 18). Secondly, in that prosecutors relied on a gang narrative to shape their case, an approach often involving controversial joint enterprise laws. And thirdly, in the use of what is known as a \u201cbad character application\u201d to have the Mali Boys music video included in the evidence shown to the jury. These applications are used when prosecutors (or occasionally defence teams) want to introduce evidence of previous offences or, more vaguely, of a \u201cdisposition towards misconduct\u201d. Typically, this would include things such as previous, similar convictions \u2013 but it has also become one of the most common routes by which rap evidence ends up in front of juries. James was alleged to be a gang associate based on his presence in the Mali Boys music video. Definitions of \u201cassociate\u201d, \u201caffiliate\u201d and \u201cmember\u201d \u2013 and the difference between them in relation to gangs \u2013 remain slippery in the justice system, where there is still no consensus on defining what a gang is. This, defence teams say, makes it easier for prosecutors to apply the term in broad strokes, and to benefit from the prejudice it invites. \u201cFew words provoke as much bias among a jury as \u2018gang\u2019,\u201d wrote criminal barrister Oliver Mosley in 2021 (Mosley has prosecuted drill artists himself in the past). The word \u201cdrill\u201d can have a similarly provocative effect: during the 2020 trial of Daniel Lena, the popular rapper Unknown T who had been accused (and was later acquitted) of murder, concerns were raised in court about specific references being made to drill music, owing to the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d that mentions of the genre attract. Drawing clear conclusions on the motives of drill rappers \u2013 particularly ones that could form solid evidence \u2013 is made almost impossible by the way in which bold claims, aggressive boasts, local gossip, and provocation are woven into the fabric of the genre. Fans living vicariously through the outlaw tales portrayed in drill songs flock to reaction videos and street gossip channels on YouTube and other social media platforms, further boosting artists\u2019 online clout and notoriety \u2013 and muddying the already grey waters of what might be true and what is not. Documents reviewed by the Guardian show how the comment sections under these channels, as well as discussions on Reddit, are in turn mined for evidence by police officers, in spite of the flimsy, unreliable nature of these sources. James\u2019s case was heard in Lewes, a town in Sussex better known for its vigorous Bonfire Night celebrations than hardcore rap offshoots. This too is indicative of a shift revealed by the Prosecuting Rap research. While the bulk of rap evidence still crops up in London and its network of crown courts, the research uncovers hearings involving rap in locations as widespread as Leicester, Warwick, St Albans and Derby. \u201cWhen we think of the use of rap in court cases, we tend to think first of London and the Met police,\u201d says Quinn, \u201cbut what also emerges is that rap music is actually a courtroom soundtrack across the country.\u201d Trials were also identified in Sheffield, Winchester, Bradford, and Nottingham, as well as major cities including Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham. \u201cDisturbingly,\u201d says Quinn, \u201cevidence suggests there is even less oversight and scrutiny of this practice outside of the capital.\u201d Quinn\u2019s highlighting of the Met\u2019s role in the uptake of rap evidence is pertinent. The Prosecuting Rap research reveals a pattern in which police officers are put forward by prosecutors to act as rap experts in court. Typically, these police witnesses will draw links between lyrics and real life crimes, and between music and gang membership. They offer translations of slang and provide their own interpretations of the meaning behind songs and music videos. (Examples of translations seen by the Guardian included inaccuracies, such as the word \u201cting\u201d, despite its breadth of possible meanings in different contexts, being singularly interpreted as \u201cgun\u201d.) The provision of some of these experts can be linked with the Met\u2019s Project Alpha unit, an online surveillance initiative established in 2019 and funded by the Home Office. One of Project Alpha\u2019s core activities involves referring rap videos it deems dangerous to be taken down by YouTube. Last year, according to figures released in response to a Freedom of Information request, 1,825 requests from Project Alpha resulted in 1,636 rap videos being removed. Until late 2022, Project Alpha\u2019s efforts targeting drill music \u2013 under the banner of \u201cOnline Harm Referrals\u201d \u2013 were led by an officer named Michael Railton. Under Railton, the scope of this work was expanded to include other social media platforms beyond YouTube, and to lobby national radio stations and record labels. This would culminate, in 2022, with Meta\u2019s Oversight Board \u2013 the group of academics, legal professionals, journalists and former politicians to whom the tech giant has devolved responsibility for its most contentious content moderation decisions \u2013 being tasked with considering whether Instagram should have cowed to pressure from the Met in removing 164 separate posts featuring a clip of a song by London drill rapper Chinx (OS). The board ruled against Instagram\u2019s decision, stating in its judgment that \u201cwhile law enforcement can sometimes provide context and expertise, not every piece of content that law enforcement would prefer to have taken down should be taken down.\u201d Noting that Project Alpha\u2019s requests had focused solely on drill music, the Board suggested that the Met\u2019s \u201cintensive focus on one music genre among many that include reference to violence raises serious concerns of potential over-policing of certain communities\u201d. A spokesperson for the Met did not address the board\u2019s comments directly, instead telling the Guardian:\u201cProject Alpha aims to develop intelligence from social media platforms linked to offline gang violence and serious and organised crime, as we want to use all opportunities to prevent Londoners being victims of violent crime. The Met works only to identify and remove content which incites or encourages violence; it does not seek to suppress freedom of expression through any kind of music.\u201d Since February 2023, age and ethnicity data has been recorded \u201cwhere identifiable\u201d by Project Alpha officers. Railton, for his part, says that over-policing of any community was \u201cnever the intention\u201d and that he never set out to demonise any one genre of music or group of people. \u201cAll I want them to do is to be able to put out music which is socially responsible and that doesn\u2019t play into the further perpetuation of the downward spiral of their community and themselves,\u201d he says. In 2021, PC Railton helped lead an initiative called Project Insight, which prepares police to act as expert witnesses, providing courts with commentary on \u201curban street gangs\u201d and the use of slang (including when it appears in music). Railton\u2019s initial cohort of police-trained expert witnesses numbered 18 individuals. According to the UK\u2019s Criminal Procedure Rules, the overriding duty of expert witnesses is to provide the court with testimony that is objective and unbiased. Academics and defence lawyers have questioned whether police officers can act as truly independent experts, given their proximity to prosecutions. Beyond issues of independence, others have questioned the degree to which police officers \u2013 who are trained to view events through a criminological lens \u2013 are able to interpret rap materials in a manner that gets anywhere near to the heart of what an author may have intended or, indeed, how songs and videos are consumed by fans of the music, their intended audience. Railton says he holds himself to the \u201cgold standard\u201d of independence when acting as an expert witness, and that he welcomes the scrutiny that the role entails. He also argues that police officers are often the best placed to offer expertise to the court when it comes to decoding rap lyrics. Professor Quinn disagrees. \u201cPolice officers themselves typically act as rap experts in these cases. But their interpretations are too often shaped by what legal scholars call \u2018flawed inferences\u2019 rooted in pre-existing beliefs about young black men and criminality, as well as a pro-prosecution stance,\u201d she says. \u201cWith the Casey Review\u2019s finding of institutional racism in the Met, the danger of fielding police officers as \u2018neutral\u2019 experts is stark. The interpretations of rap lyrics presented to jurors, who tend to know nothing (and certainly nothing positive) about this provocative music, can be crucial to court case verdicts.\u201d The Met did not offer the Guardian any comment on its provision of police officers as rap experts. Increasingly, the format in which rap lyrics are presented in UK courts follows templates designed by PC Railton, which he describes on his LinkedIn profile as \u201cjury friendly evidential products\u201d (he left the Met at the end of last year, and now runs a private consultancy offering expert witness training). These templates present lyrics, the officer\u2019s direct translations, and their interpretations of those translations in adjacent columns, and strip the materials of all context of how they might otherwise be presented (recorded or performed over a beat, for instance), and the fact that, ultimately, these are artistic expressions. Railton says that how experts present their evidence is a matter of individual choice, but expresses some pride in the way that his templates \u201cstep the jury through\u201d the evidence and \u201cdissolve the hyperlocal context out of the music\u201d. In January last year, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would be reviewing how rap evidence can be used in court. However, a later announcement in June, about a new \u201cpioneering \u2018gangs\u2019 unit\u201d based in Birmingham, appeared to double down on the admissibility of drill evidence, noting a number of new cases in which lyrics had been successfully put before juries. The full results of the review are yet to be published. Updated guidance, \u201cwhich sets out the issues for prosecutors to consider regarding the use of drill music as evidence\u201d, is due to be published later this year. The CPS declined to name any of the organisations it had approached to take part in its public consultation on the matter. In the face of this, barristers, youth workers, and music industry representatives in the UK are beginning to rally efforts for legislative and legal advisory changes, similar to those recently enacted in the US, which have curbed the use of creative expressions in courtrooms and seen unfair convictions overturned. In a social media post of his own last December, in response to a story published by the Guardian, former PC Railton noted his pride in the role police officers have played in the history of UK drill music. \u201cThere is no show without the stand we have taken. I am massively proud to have generated such vital discussion,\u201d he wrote. James would perhaps disagree with him on that count. At the Crown Prosecution Service, meanwhile, the jury remains out."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2600f", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/21/how-to-make-the-perfect-pissaladiere-recipe-felicity-cloake", "primaryCategory": "food", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to make the perfect pissaladi\u00e8re \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake's How to make the perfect\u2026", "lead": "The definitive guide to making this salty-sweet, deliciously oily yet crisp and fluffy Italian-French repast \u2013 think onion, olive and anchovy pizza", "author": "Felicity Cloake", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 11:00:38", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225172", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b72c138c428ea785d91e607367b6df578390b1/0_1693_3761_2257/500.jpg", "body": "Visitors to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur don\u2019t need to set foot in a museum to clock that the region was for a long time under Italian control. In fact, it became part of France only as recently as 1860, which explains why the traditional dialect, architecture and, most obviously, cooking all have a distinctly Ligurian feel (and why there\u2019s a statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi in Nice, his birthplace). It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that pissaladi\u00e8re, \u201ca typically Ni\u00e7oise hors d\u2019oeuvre\u201d, according to the city\u2019s disgraced former mayor Jacques M\u00e9decin, bears more than a passing resemblance to pizza. (Indeed, food writer Caroline Craig, whose family hails from farther west, fancifully dates the Proven\u00e7al fondness for the stuff to the Roman occupation, while Jonathan Meades believes that Marseille does better pizza than Naples). But, as Noble Rot Soho\u2019s chef Alex Jackson observes, whatever you liken it to, pissaladi\u00e8re is \u201cmuch more than the sum of its parts. To call it \u2018onion tart [or pizza] with anchovies and olives\u2019 somehow underplays it\u201d. Salty-sweet and deliciously oily, it\u2019s ideal cut into small squares and paired with a well-chilled aperitif or, served in more generous wedges, with a green salad. Sunshine optional. The base Craig explains in Provence: The Cookbook that, \u201clike pizza, truly authentic pissaladi\u00e8re is made with bread dough\u201d, something confirmed by M\u00e9decin (who, when he wasn\u2019t peddling far-right views, managed to pen a more palatable cookbook, published in English as Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise). In agreement are chef Paul Bocuse and the Ma\u00eetres Cuisiniers de France\u2019s 1984 collection, Cuisine du Terroir. A recipe from Alex Benvenuto\u2019s Carnets de Cuisine du Comt\u00e9 de Nice, written in collaboration with the committee responsible for ensuring the preservation of local gastronomy \u2013 which in 2019 was declared part of France\u2019s cultural heritage, because the French take such serious things seriously \u2013 also uses bread dough. But not everyone agrees with these authorities: Jackson, whose previous restaurant Sardine lives on through his cookbook of the same name, writes that: \u201cI have heard many arguments for the use of puff pastry for a pissaladi\u00e8re, and I have even tasted a few pizza-like numbers made with semolina flour, but for me a shortcrust does the job perfectly. I make mine very buttery.\u201d Marseille-based Meades, meanwhile, who uses puff pastry, describes pissaladi\u00e8re in his book The Plagiarist in the Kitchen as \u201coften closer to tarte fine than to a \u2018real\u2019 pizza\u201d, adding: \u201cBetter always trumps real. This is better.\u201d Vexed questions of \u201cauthenticity\u201d aside, just about any base would be improved by the oniony topping, but, much as I love Jackson\u2019s very buttery pastry (in fact, when I go back to the samples, I find one tester, who shall remain anonymous, has removed most of the crust), the meeting of oily onion and fluffy dough is so especially pleasing that I\u2019m going to stick with the traditional choice of bread. Craig\u2019s richer recipe is particularly good (interestingly, the late Alastair Little deploys a focaccia dough in his 1999 book Soho Cooking on the basis that, \u201coriginating in Liguria just across the border from Nice, [it] seemed apposite\u201d). The onions Here\u2019s where British readers might need to compromise with authenticity. Jackson notes that \u201cthe best onions for a pissaladi\u00e8re are expensive, small white onions from Italy and France \u2013 not a spring onion, but sweet and delicate nonetheless. When cooked very slowly in olive oil, they are remarkably mild, even sweeter and strangely delicious for something so simple.\u201d Like Meades, Bocuse simply specifies sweet onions in his Regional French Cooking, cook Lulu Peyraud favoured \u201clarge, white summer onions, very sweet with a high water content\u201d, according to Richard Olney in their co-authored collection, Lulu\u2019s Proven\u00e7al Table, and Benvenuto \u201coignons paille\u201d, which Craig\u2019s mother Fran\u00e7oise informs me are big, juicy and flatter than the usual yellow sort, but which prove elusive in London. I don\u2019t have any luck with Jackson\u2019s expensive, small white onions, either, but I do try Peyraud\u2019s larger white ones, which I find a bit bland, and, on a whim, red onions, which prove rather too jammy, bringing back memories of the red-onion marmalade craze of the 1990s. A certain level of sweetness is desirable as a contrast with the salty layer above, but it shouldn\u2019t be the predominant flavour. Though heretical, if the stern instruction of many that they \u201cshould remain absolutely uncoloured\u201d, as Peyraud puts it, is anything to go by, the very lightly browned onions on top of Craig\u2019s pissaladi\u00e8re prove the most popular with my testers; ignore the warnings \u2013 they won\u2019t burn in the oven, as long as you keep an eye on them. (If the thought fills you with purist disgust, take the onions off the heat once the water has evaporated.) Benvenuto\u2019s recipe cooks the onions for an hour, Jackson\u2019s for 90 minutes, Craig\u2019s for a minimum of hour and 45 minutes and Meades two hours, so you\u2019ll be relieved to know that, as long as you lubricate them liberally with oil (Benvenuto recommends 100ml for 2kg onions; Craig uses the same amount of lovely butter*) and cover the pan so they steam in their own juices, they don\u2019t require much of your attention at this stage. As onions, pans and hobs all differ, however, you\u2019ll need to judge for yourself when they\u2019re soft enough to form \u201ca semi puree\u201d, as Peyraud (or Olney) puts it, and be more present in the next step, when the water is boiled off and the sugars caramelised. Bocuse, Benvenuto and the French masterchefs add a bouquet garni to the pan (Jackson and Craig stick with thyme alone), while the latter two add garlic as well. Like the butter, these seasonings are enhancements rather than essentials, but who doesn\u2019t benefit from a little enhancement? I\u2019m afraid this recipe does involve a lot of peeling and slicing (a mandoline \u2013 with a safety guard! \u2013 is advisable), and there\u2019s no getting around that: M\u00e9decin cautions readers to be wary of \u201cthe mass-produced versions of pissaladi\u00e8re that are sold on street stalls or \u2018drugstores\u2019 in the south of France \u2013 the layer of onions is usually paper -thin. A proper pissaladi\u00e8re of the kind still found in Ni\u00e7oise food markets will boast a layer of onion at least half as thick as the base, if it is made of bread dough, and equally thick, if it is made of shortcrust pastry.\u201d So don\u2019t be dismayed by the amount of onion in the recipe below \u2013 I can\u2019t promise that slicing onions will be a mindful activity, but I do believe the results are well worth the tears. * Up here in the frozen north, it\u2019s easy to assume that Mediterranean regions cook purely with olive oil, but, as Craig explains, somewhat crossly: \u201cthere is no imaginary wall below Lyon that prevents cows from entering Provence, and butter continues to be extensively used in dishes well beyond the usual cakes and bakes\u201d. The topping There\u2019s almost no dissent here: just olives, preferably the salted black sort sold as \u201c\u00e0 la Grecque\u201d for maximum flavour punch, and anchovies. Jackson, Peyraud and Benvenuto all specify the salted variety, which have become strangely hard to procure, in London at least. Plumper, with a firmer, more fishy texture, if you can\u2019t find them, I can assure you that their oil-packed cousins will shine here, too (I suspect their oily bath actually helps keep them softer in the heat of the oven). As well as using the anchovies on top, Meades stirs a generous helping into the onions as they cook, which gives them a pleasant, savoury edge, but spoils the sweet and salty contrast between the different elements of the topping. One for real anchovy fiends only. More controversially, Bocuse adds a layer of tomato sauce, which is the kind of thing you can only get away with if you have more Michelin stars than you can shake a spoon at \u2013 because tomatoes belong in Ligurian pissadella, not Ni\u00e7oise pissaladi\u00e8re. (That said, don\u2019t tell the French, but it is quite nice.) Traditionally, instead of anchovies, pissaladi\u00e8re was smeared with a cloth dipped in pissala, or fish puree, before going into the oven, but pissala is pretty thin on the ground these days. M\u00e9decin helpfully explains that, authentically, it is made with \u201cpalaia [small fry] of sardines and anchovies\u201d, but, \u201cbecause of the difficulty in obtaining palaia, there is an increasing tendency to make pissala with fully-grown anchovies \u2026 though no self-respecting connoisseur would touch [it]\u201d. His recipe takes a month, and requires 2kg of baby fish. Note that, of course, this dish is easily made vegan by simply leaving out the butter and fish; I\u2019d substitute strips of roast pepper on top for a different, but equally good result. Also, it\u2019s very hard to give exact timings for either the dough or the onions, because both depend on the conditions, so leave this for a day when you have enough time that you don\u2019t have to rush, either. Perfect pissaladi\u00e8re Prep 45 min Cook 2\u00bd hr Serves 4-6 For the base (or use 300g shortcrust or puff pastry) 250g strong white bread flour \u00bd tsp salt 3g fast-action yeast 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing For the topping 1kg onions 1 garlic clove 3 tbsp olive oil A knob of butter (optional) 1 sprig each fresh rosemary and thyme, plus 1 bay leaf (all optional) Salt About 10 anchovy fillets About 14 dry black olives Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve Peel, trim, halve and finely slice the onions using a mandoline, sharp knife or the slicing attachment on a food processor. Peel the garlic and roughly crush it with the flat of a large knife. Put a large, heavy-bottomed pan or pot for which you have a tight-fitting lid on a low heat, add the oil and butter, immediately followed by the onions, herbs (if using), garlic and a pinch of salt. Stir to coat the onions with the oil, then clap on the lid and leave to cook, stirring occasionally, for about an hour, or until they\u2019re very soft. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re making a bread dough base, stir the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl, then add the oil and just enough water (probably a little under 150ml) to bring it together into a coherent, but not sticky or floury dough. Tip out on to a lightly oiled surface, oil your hands, and knead the dough until it\u2019s springy, smooth and elastic. Lightly oil the bowl, put the dough back in, cover and leave in a draught-free place until it\u2019s roughly doubled in size \u2013 this should take about 90 minutes, but judge by eye rather than time. Take the lid off the onions, turn up the heat very slightly and cook, stirring frequently to ensure they don\u2019t catch, until the liquid has evaporated and the onions have turned a light golden brown. Take off the heat and leave to cool. Lightly oil a baking tray and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Knock the air out of the dough, then, on a greased surface, roll it out into a roughly \u00bdcm-thick rectangle. Spread the onions in a thick layer on top, leaving a border all around the edge. Cut the anchovies in half lengthways, to make thin strips, use these to create a diamond pattern all over the top of the onions, then pop an olive in the centre of each diamond. Bake the pissaladi\u00e8re for about 20-25 minutes, until the crust is golden. Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil and leave to cool slightly, or entirely, before slicing and serving.

Many expect it to further crystallise ties between two countries and boost a relationship that has been on an upwards trajectory for two decades \u2013 even as they remain fundamentally opposed on several key issues. Defence, technology, security, AI, telecoms, visas, manufacturing and space are all said to be on the table. Meanwhile, the issues of the erosion of democracy in India and the shrinking space for dissent and civil society under Modi are unlikely to be discussed in depth. Now the world\u2019s most populous country \u2013 with 1.4 billion people and rising \u2013 and the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, India\u2019s growing prominence, both economically and geopolitically, makes it a country that the Biden administration \u2013 like those of Trump, Obama and Bush before it \u2013 could not ignore. Yet most experts say that it is China that has been the fundamental driver of this growing alliance; and as Modi touches down in DC, mutual concerns over Beijing\u2019s aggressive, expansionist agenda have never been more acute. Since Modi last visited the US in 2019, when Donald Trump was in the White House, China\u2019s actions along its 2,100-mile (3,500km) border with India have become increasingly antagonistic. In 2020, the two sides came the closest they had been to war in 70 years when troops clashed along the Himalayan border in Ladakh, killing dozens of soldiers, after Chinese troops encroached on land typically patrolled by India. Since then, China has built up vast amounts of infrastructure along disputed territory and shown little desire to disengage in key areas of contention. This has coincided with a shift in Washington\u2019s relationship with China, from that of strategic competitor to rival or outright threat that must be deterred and contained. The bipartisan consensus is that India is a crucial geopolitical, and even economic, counterweight to China\u2019s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. \u201cIn Washington, the hope is to build out an extended framework of deterrence to try and keep China in check,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, director of the south Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cBoth geographically as well as strategically and economically, India has become a linchpin in this framework.\u201d This geopolitical alignment over China \u2013 which also drove the formation of the Quad, a security grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan \u2013 has led to an unprecedented flourishing of security and defence cooperation between the US and India. There has been increased intelligence sharing and joint military exercises in the Himalayas close to the China border, and Modi\u2019s US visit is expected to yield several defence deals for surveillance technology and drones. India has embraced Washington\u2019s new willingness to share its advanced technology and cyber resources, given that its own technological advancements have lagged far behind China\u2019s. Modi will be hoping to close a landmark deal allowing US giant General Electric to produce jet engines in India, to power Indian military aircraft. It will be the first time such a collaboration on military technology has taken place, sending a clear message to China. While there is little expectation of trade deals between the two countries, trade between India and the US reached a record $191bn in 2022, making the US India\u2019s largest trading partner. There is an interest on both sides in building up India as an economic and manufacturing alternative for big western companies to wean it off its dependency on China \u2013 95% of iPhones are currently made in China, for example, but Apple is slowly shifting manufacturing to India, which is expected to produce 25% of iPhones by 2025. The limits of a US-India relationship Yet for all the gushing rhetoric about being \u201cpartners of first resort\u201d, experts have also been quick to point out the limitations of the US-India relationship. Writing in Foreign Affairs, Ashley Tellis, one of the key negotiators for the US nuclear deal with India, warned that even as the Biden administration continued to invest heavily in India, it should not have any \u201cdelusions of New Delhi becoming a comrade-in-arms during some future crisis with Beijing\u201d, particularly in terms of India actively taking the US side if China invades Taiwan. \u201cIndia will never be the kind of ally that the Americans have found in the Anglosphere: this is not going to be Australia, Canada or the United Kingdom,\u201d said Avinash Paliwal, an associate professor in international relations at Soas University of London. \u201cIndia thinks of itself as a power on its own merit and it has its own geographical compulsions, its own kind of power and its own aspirations on a regional and global scale. There is a meeting of minds and interests at the moment but that\u2019s not something that will last for ever.\u201d Another issue that looms large over Modi\u2019s visit is that of human rights, in particular the democratic backsliding and the attacks on minorities in India since his populist, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. They are allegations that have haunted Modi even before he was prime minister, when his alleged role in the Gujarat riots led to him being banned from the US for a decade. They have been well documented by the Biden administration. Last year, the state department\u2019s report on international religious freedom documented the challenges to freedom of expression, extrajudicial killings and discrimination against minority groups in Modi\u2019s India, prompting India to call the report \u201cflawed and biased\u201d. More recently, the Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan agency appointed by Congress, recommended in May that the state department designate India a country of concern for \u201congoing and egregious religious freedom violations\u201d. Before Modi\u2019s visit, Amnesty International called on the US to confront India on the deterioration of human rights and Human Rights Watch organised a screening for US policymakers of a BBC documentary that was critical of Modi, and which was banned in India earlier, as a deliberate reminder of the attacks on freedom of speech under his government. Yet no US president since Bill Clinton has been forthright on human rights in India, and though the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, did make a rare reference to a rise in \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d last year, the Biden administration is expected to continue to keep quiet on any discomfort it may have over Modi\u2019s populist, religious nationalist politics in the name of building strategic security ties. Already several White House officials have made recent references to India\u2019s \u201cvibrant democracy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to come up, at least in this round of conversations,\u201d said Paliwal. \u201cThe Americans are OK doing business with quasi- or undemocratic countries and so I don\u2019t see the democratic decline in India dislocating the glue that is binding the top levels of the two governments or preventing them coming together to deal with the China question.\u201d Russia, which was briefly a source of contention between India and the US, is also unlikely to be brought up by Biden. India\u2019s historic ties to Russia, which provides almost 80% of its defence and weapons, have ensured that Modi has refused to condemn Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, instead taking a neutral stance, and in the meantime India has become the biggest buyer of cheap Russian oil. While there was initial pushback from Washington, the consensus among analysts is that the Biden administration has now accepted India\u2019s deep-rooted relationship Russia; some believe it has even hastened US cooperation with India on defence to help the country become less dependent on Russia. But for Modi, this visit can also serve a more personal political purpose. In the US, the Indian diaspora is now one of the largest immigrant groups \u2013 second only to Mexicans \u2013 and its members occupy influential positions in tech, business, banking and law, and some have even become well-known faces in Hollywood. Emphasising these people-to-people ties, and the vital contributions Indians have made in the US, is also likely to be a prominent part of Modi\u2019s trip. With India\u2019s next general election less than a year away, the optics of Modi being given full honours by the US president are also likely to play well to the electorate back home. Modi is expected to win a third term in office and his popularity is credited in part to an image among voters that he has made India into a respected player on the world stage and is now courted by powerful western leaders. \u201cSince independence, India has seen itself as an international power but felt it did not get the recognition or role it deserved,\u201d said Tanvi Madan, director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC. \u201cBut Modi seems to believe that endorsements from the US, far from generating a backlash, generate a sense of optimism that this is India\u2019s moment.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26011", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/21/your-body-is-miraculous-enjoy-it-10-ways-to-be-much-more-body-confident", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "\u2018Your body is miraculous \u2013 enjoy it!\u2019 10 ways to be much more body-confident", "lead": "Forget your inhibitions this summer.

If you have a pulse, you already have a bikini body. Or indeed a mankini body. We all know this in theory. Yet these sensible thoughts are easily spouted but not so easily, um, embodied. Many of us find it relatively straightforward to be kind (and relatively less judgmental) towards other people. Because all you have to do is remember not to be a cruel git. But when it comes to our view of ourselves, we can be over harsh and critical, submitting ourselves to a level of scrutiny that we wouldn\u2019t dream of applying to others. But the 1980s idea that we must all prepare ourselves for the Great Unveiling of the Socially Acceptable Flesh and improve our aesthetic qualities before we venture near a beach or swimming pool \u2026 Well, that has kind of had its day. How often do we have the chance to get the sun on the bits of us that rarely make contact with the outside world? Why would you squander that chance? Here\u2019s how to feel confident with your body this summer and all year round. 1. Remind yourself how pointless fad diets are The concept of the \u201cbeach body\u201d is predicated on the ill-advised idea that you must suddenly embark on a short-term seasonally motivated plan of action that is alien to you. \u201cWe need to get away from the boom or bust mentality that often comes with weight loss,\u201d says nutritionist Emma Bardwell. \u201cI see a lot of women embarking on faddy, restrictive diets and extended fasts, declaring they will \u2018cut out sugar completely\u2019 and \u2018only eat after midday\u2019. This is difficult and unsustainable.\u201d 2. Dress and shop for your body the way it is today The body you see in the mirror on this very day will never be quite the same again. Chlo\u00e9 Dall\u2019Olio, video director at the beauty company Trinny London and the host of the online series The Body Talks, says: \u201cIt\u2019s all about highlighting the person who you are today. Yes, be inspired by other people. But it\u2019s about what assets you have and celebrating them. The bigger and the smaller bits. The bits that have been shamed and the bits that have been praised.\u201d Long live all our bits. 3. Rest is the cornerstone of confidence Heed the motto of the yoga teacher Paula Hines, author of Rest + Calm: Gentle Yoga and Mindful Practices to Nurture and Restore Yourself: \u201cImagine how different the world would be if we were all well rested.\u201d She says: \u201cYou can\u2019t be confident if you\u2019re tired and wired or burnt out. It might not be about taking a nap, but finding something that works for you \u2013 and is good for your nervous system \u2013 is essential. I saw a video recently on social media of a young boy asking his wailing little brother if he\u2019d had a nap. He hadn\u2019t. So his response to his younger sibling was: \u2018Well, you need one!\u2019 It was funny and relatable but I do think this applies to grownups too. Rest gives you perspective and clarity.\u201d 4. Do not dress apologetically It\u2019s a cliche, but wearing \u201cloud\u201d clothes \u2013 or anything that doesn\u2019t feel like \u201chiding\u201d \u2013 lifts your mood. Nickie Reynolds, the owner of Gold Dust Vintage, explains: \u201cDress in colours that make you feel good about yourself. This will instantly boost your confidence. If you\u2019re not sure what these are, just start with the colours you love. And experiment. You can begin with introducing \u2018pops\u2019 of colour.\u201d Ignore clothes sizes, especially if you\u2019re shopping vintage. \u201cGet to know your measurements and the styles and cuts of clothes that you enjoy wearing.\u201d 5. Link your body confidence to sustainable fashion One of the main reasons we buy too much is when we shop from a place of insecurity. Hands up anyone who has ever shopped for a body they wish they had or a body they used to have? (All my hands are up. Or they would be if only I could lift them in the air while wearing this teeny tiny blouse.) In 2014, a UK survey by a lingerie company found that 48% of women have bought clothes that are too small for them. We can only hope this has improved over the past decade but it seems unlikely. Ask: \u201cDoes this fit me right here, right now? Do I want to wear it right here, right now?\u201d If not, maybe let the shop or the website store the item \u201cfor safekeeping\u201d until the craving passes. Buy fewer things and let them fit better. 6. Park your insecurity when it comes to fitness Exercising \u2013 especially in class, or anywhere in public \u2013 can seem daunting. This is a chicken and egg thing. By which I mean that when you are lacking in confidence in your body, you are less likely to exercise. And the less you move, the less confidence you have in your body. Hines says: \u201cIf you\u2019re attending a class for the first time and you\u2019re feeling nervous or insecure, then I\u2019d suggest having a word with the teacher beforehand. I\u2019m so used to people letting me know that they\u2019re new or it\u2019s their first yoga class and they\u2019re feeling a bit anxious.\u201d Admitting your vulnerability makes it less of a big deal. 7. If you do want changes, make them small and easy If change of some kind really is your goal, aim for small, consistent habits that you can maintain. Seek out sensible health advice that resonates with you as an individual. We are not all the same. We do not all want to look the same. And we are not all motivated by the same aims. That is OK. And if change is not your goal, that is also OK. 8. Dress for your character not your physical shape Marleen Beevers is a fashion psychologist and the author of the forthcoming Satisfashion, a book about using your attitude towards style to cement the idea that you are \u201cenough\u201d. Our style should be about expressing what we think of ourselves, she says. \u201cWho are you? And what do you want in life? Focus on your personality strengths. Challenge your negative thoughts with positive affirmations. Limit your exposures to negative triggers and social media campaigns.\u201d 9. Buy amazing exercise clothes This is a corrective to the previous advice about sustainable fashion. If an outfit will make you move your body, then buy it with reckless abandon. Take a look at the meticulously coordinated gym wardrobe of musical theatre goddess Marisha Wallace (currently appearing as Miss Adelaide in Guys and Dolls) who mostly wears Sofina Active. Hines recommends jumpsuits from Thought, and stretchy jersey trousers and vests from Asquith and Sweaty Betty: \u201cI don\u2019t do leggings or formal yogawear. Some of my most faithful long-wearing items have come from M&amp;S. Sometimes just wearing something comfortable can make you feel relaxed.\u201d 10. It\u2019s OK not to be \u201cbody positive\u201d all the time No one loves themselves constantly. So it\u2019s OK to feel unconfident occasionally. Just not all the time. Hines says: \u201cWe all have negative body days. I\u2019m not sure I believe anyone who says they never do. But one thing I suggest is to focus on what your body does for you \u2013 whether it\u2019s getting you through the day or achieving a personal best at the gym.\u201d One of the greatest moments of my own life was having a \u201cpersonal best\u201d in a 1.5km swim because I beat my own record by 50 seconds. (Count. Them.) This achievement mattered more to me than the fact that I had taken well over an hour to cover this distance, whereas the fastest swimmer could cover it in under 20 minutes. We all need our own PBs. Hines sums it up: \u201cWhen I started focusing on what my body could do, it shifted my mindset over to a place of gratitude, away from constant negative self-talk. Our bodies really are miraculous, and you only get one, so you may as well enjoy it.\u201d Happy High Status: How to Be Effortlessly Confident by Viv Groskop is out on 29 June (Torva, \u00a316.99).

In 1985, British boys and girls ranked 69 out of 200 countries for average height aged five. At the time they were on average 111.4cm and 111cm tall respectively. Now, British boys are 102nd and girls 96th, with the average five-year-old boy measuring 112.5cm and the average girl, 111.7cm. In Bulgaria, the average height for a five-year-old boy is 121cm and a girl, 118cm. Experts have said a poor national diet and cuts to the NHS are to blame. But they have also pointed out that height is a strong indicator of general living conditions, including illness and infection, stress, poverty and sleep quality. \u201cThey have fallen by 30 places, which is pretty startling,\u201d said Prof Tim Cole, an expert in child growth rates at the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London. \u201cThe question is, why?\u201d GPs in poorer areas of the country have reported a resurgence of Victorian diseases such as rickets and scurvy caused largely, they say, by nutritional deficiencies. NHS data shows that about 700 children a year are admitted to hospital with malnutrition, rickets or scurvy in England. Separate research suggests that dietary inequalities in children from poorer backgrounds are driving higher rates of problems including obesity, type 2 diabetes and dental decay. Cole, who was not involved in the study, said the data suggests that growing up in the 2010s \u201cwhich happens to coincide with the period of austerity \u2026 tells me that austerity has clobbered the height of children in the UK\u201d. Food experts point out that a diet of cheap junk food makes people simultaneously overweight and undernourished. \u201cChildren in the poorest areas of England are both fatter and significantly shorter than those in the richest areas at age 10 to 11,\u201d said Henry Dimbleby, the former government food adviser.\u201cThis is a big enough problem to have an impact at an international level.\u201d In the Netherlands, the average five-year-old boy is 119.6cm and the average girl is 118.4cm tall. In France, the figures are 114.7cm and 113.6cm respectively. In Germany they are 114.8 and 113.3. Danish boys are on average 117.4cm tall, and Danish girls 118.1cm. Dimbleby said that in modern Britain the way we eat is one of the clearest markers of inequality: annual surveys show children from the poorest fifth of families consume about a third less fruit and vegetables, 75% less oily fish, and a fifth less fibre than children from the most well-off families. The data is taken from national measurement programmes, collated by the Non-communicable diseases risk factor collaboration, a global network of health scientists. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThere are a range of factors that can impact children\u2019s growth, which are not just limited to diet, and we are taking steps to support families by providing record financial support to families who need it most.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26013", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/21/australia-politics-live-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-anthony-albanese-greens-labor-standoff-rent-freezes-china-military-threat", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Politicians dress up for Canberra\u2019s night of nights \u2013 as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Elias Visontay, Jordyn Beazley (earlier) and Amy Remeikis (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:41:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225245", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8a16ac7ce9dc9c0697e41af79229980bb8896ee2/0_221_6624_3974/500.jpg", "body": "Thanks for following today\u2019s action, but with that, we\u2019ll wrap up our live coverage.

For the evening\u2019s other big event, you can check out our State of Origin live blog here. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main news: Pressure is mounting on the Greens to support Labor\u2019s housing fund after the party\u2019s calls for state governments to impose rent freezes and increase caps were roundly rejected by east coast leaders. Consulting firm PwC engaged in a \u201ccalculated\u201d breach of trust by using confidential information to help its clients avoid tax and engaged in a \u201cdeliberate cover-up\u201d over many years, a Senate committee has found. Linda Burney says the Indigenous voice will not bother itself with \u201cculture wars\u201d like abolishing Australia Day as she launched an impassioned plea for voters to support the referendum. The Greens may support the Coalition\u2019s bill to limit gambling advertisements, potentially teaming up again after blocking Labor\u2019s housing bill earlier this week. The New South Wales corruption watchdog will hand down its much-anticipated and long-delayed report into former premier Gladys Berejiklian next week. Suggestions of a \u201ccover-up\u201d over the tasering of a 95-year-old grandmother have been rejected by the NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, after the premier was forced to defend his minister\u2019s handling of the situation.

WWF calls for further action with nature repair market bill Australia\u2019s World Wide Fund for Nature has urged senators to \u201cwork together\u201d to pass the nature repair market bill after it passed the lower house, but urged the government to pair it with strengthened nature protection laws. WWF Australia\u2019s conservation economist, Joshua Bishop, said: WWF encourages rapid passage of the nature repair market bill, and asks our government to double down on strengthening nature protection laws. Australia has waited far too long for critical nature policy reforms to be enacted. We need stronger nature protection laws, together with new ways of mobilising investment in nature, because business as usual is failing our wildlife and wild places. Nature repair market bill passes lower house without Greens\u2019 support The bill passed with the support of independent MPs Helen Haines, Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink, Zali Steggall, Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney and Monique Ryan. It was opposed by the Coalition, the Greens and independent MP Zoe Daniel. It comes after Paul Karp reported earlier today the teal independent MPs had accused the Greens of \u201cincredibly short-sighted\u201d opposition to Labor\u2019s proposed nature repair market, and urged them to improve rather than stall or block the bill. The proposed legislation establishes a scheme to incentivise investment in nature restoration by creating tradable certificates for projects that protect and restore biodiversity. Federal Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says education minister Jason Clare\u2019s comments that making university free would result in fewer people going to university and poorer people missing out as \u201cfrankly bizarre and the opposite of what would happen\u201d. It comes after the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Duncan Maskell, joined the Greens and student unions in calling for tertiary education to be free. Faruqi said: \u201cAcademics, experts, students, the NTEU, and now a vice-chancellor at one of Australia\u2019s top universities have joined the Greens\u2019 call to back free university. It\u2019s time for the prime minister, who went to university for free, to get on board. We have universal primary and secondary education. Free public higher education is the missing piece of the puzzle. Making university free will be life changing for many, especially for people who want to change careers and re-skill later in life. By removing the crushing debts, people will be able to adapt to new and emerging careers without being penalised.\u201d Our Caitlin Cassidy has the full story on Maskell backing calls for free tertiary education here: Rolfe police complaint referred to corruption watchdog A complaint against a detective involved in the investigation of ex-constable Zachary Rolfe over the shooting death of an Indigenous teenager has been referred to the Northern Territory\u2019s corruption watchdog. AAP reports Rolfe\u2019s solicitor has written to NT police detailing a number of matters of concern. They included accusations that evidence from an independent expert witness was amended and edited and that evidence favourable to Rolfe was withheld, the NT News reported. Acting NT Police Deputy Commissioner Michael White confirmed receipt of the letter and that it had been referred to the NT Independent Commission Against Corruption. He said: We have received a letter from the lawyer representing Mr Rolfe and we\u2019re investigating the contents of that letter and assessing the information that\u2019s been provided. We\u2019ll determine where the investigation goes. I\u2019m not going to talk about specifics but again, we\u2019ll review the information that\u2019s been provided and we\u2019ll thoroughly investigate any allegation that\u2019s been made. I have referred it to the ICAC. White declined to comment on whether the detective concerned had been spoken to. \u2018Gambling ads must be banned, full stop\u2019: independent MP Zoe Daniel The parliament is gearing up for another significant fight on gambling ads, with the Greens considering backing a Coalition bill to limit advertising, but other crossbenchers saying they should take much bolder action. As we\u2019ve reported, Sarah Hanson-Young says the Greens are sympathetic to \u201cany bill\u201d that would limit gambling - and are considering backing the Coalition in the Senate, which could roll the government again in the upper house - even though the Greens want such moves to go much further than the Coalition proposal to block ads for an hour either side of sporting games on TV. But lower house independent MP Zoe Daniel, whose own private bill would look to a complete ban on gambling ads, says the Senate should go much further. David Pocock is putting up amendments to the Coalition bill, which would see it mirror Daniel\u2019s bill. Daniel said: The Senate should not duck the issue. It should reject the coalition\u2019s meagre proposal and pass Senator Pocock\u2019s version of my Private Members Bill for a complete ban. I hope the Coalition\u2019s squib of a bill does not pass. The evidence is that trying to ring fence gambling advertising won\u2019t work. Daniel said past evidence of restricting gambling ads in this way just saw such ads shift into other programming, and actually an increase in overall ads: Only a complete ban on gambling advertising on our screens will stop the gambling giants from grooming impressionable young people to believe they are not part of the gang if they don\u2019t bet as they watch sport. Gambling ads must be banned, full stop. Pocock calls for debate on Middle Arm development After Guardian Australia\u2019s investigation of the expansion of gas projects in the Northern Territory, independent senator David Pocock has called for a debate about the government\u2019s plans to back the Middle Arm industrial precinct on Darwin Harbour with $1.5b in taxpayer funds. Read the investigation from our Anne Davies and Lisa Cox here: Anthony Albanese reckons he might have broken the record today for most people in the prime minister\u2019s office thanks to visiting students from Haberfield public school. The Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill has criticised PwC in the Senate for \u201cattempting to walk away from this profound ethical failure\u201d after the committee expressed concern PwC had failed to take responsibility for the actions of its staff. O\u2019Neill says: It shocks me that the obfuscation by PwC Australia continues and that PwC Global appears to be attempting to walk away from this profound ethical failure and calculated breach of trust. I am concerned by reports of threats and intimidation by leaders inside PwC as they continue in their efforts of coercion and spin. Parliament\u2019s interim report on PwC scandal makes two recommendations The unanimous report of the finance and public administration committee has two recommendations: The committee recommends that PwC cooperate fully and openly with all investigations and inquiries into this matter, including the investigations by the Australian Federal Police and the Tax Practitioners Board. The committee recommends that PwC be open and honest with the Australian Parliament and people, and with the international community, by promptly publishing accurate and detailed information about the involvement of PwC partners and personnel (including names and positions) in the matters canvassed in this report. The Greens want to go further. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock says: We now have cross-party agreement about what happened. PwC engaged in a calculated breach of trust and an intentional cover-up. The committee unanimously agrees that PwC should come clean and fully cooperate with independent inquiries into their wrongdoing. PwC must move beyond a simple \u201cfall guy\u201d strategy. It is untenable for the government to keep doing business with an entity that conducts itself like this. The Greens are calling on the government to cancel PwC\u2019s registration as a tax agent and will be introducing an amendment to do exactly this. The government must also enact an immediate ban on contracts with PwC. We need Luke Sayers, who was CEO of PwC Australia throughout this debacle, and the head of taxation at the time, Tom Seymour, along with others in senior leadership to answer questions and be held to account. The evidence in this report points to a go-slow and weak response from regulators that calls into question how far PwC\u2019s tentacles reach into the heart of our public institutions. It has never been more clear, we need a NACC investigation of this matter. The Green\u2019s will make this referral to the NACC on the day it opens. The evidence cited in this report shows an internal culture at PwC so poor that it has lost the capacity to act honestly. In fact, it is clear now that its senior leadership does not recognise basic ethical and legal principles. The evidence also creates a strong argument for breaking the link between political donations and big consultancies. The chair of the finance and public administration committee, Richard Colbeck, is tabling the interim report into consultants and the PwC scandal. In the Senate, Colbeck described PwC\u2019s actions as a \u201ccalculated\u201d and an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of trust. Colbeck says: The report is titled: PwC a calculated breach of trust. Because that\u2019s how the committee sees the actions that were undertaken by Mr Peter Collins, when he was given the privilege of being part of a consultation process on new legislation being proposed to deal with multinational tax avoidance. Colbeck cites efforts by PwC to put obstacles in the way of the Australian Taxation Office investigating the breach. Colbeck says the committee had to take \u201csome care\u201d in its inquiry, given the Treasury\u2019s referral of the matter to the Australian federal police. The committee had to be careful not to \u201ccreate a pool of evidence that would inhibit potential legal proceedings\u201d or call witnesses \u201cwho may be subject to legal proceedings, who may want to come before the committee to put on record things that may not be able to be used in proceedings\u201d. At last year\u2019s Midwinter Ball, we saw the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Adam Bandt\u2019s partner, Claudia Perkins, also emblazon their gowns with political messages. Hanson-Young wore a dress bearing the phrase \u201cend gas and coal\u201d, while Perkins arrived in a gown emblazoned with the slogans \u201ccoal kills\u201d and \u201cgas kills\u201d. The fashion statements came after criticisms raised by Senator David Pocock and climate groups about fossil fuel companies Woodside and Shell sponsoring the annual press gallery ball. Labor\u2019s Jana Stewart offers sneak peek of yes dress Our Mike Bowers has snapped our first sneak peek of the opulent fits that will be on display at the press gallery\u2019s Midwinter Ball tonight, where politicians and journalists rub shoulders with business leaders and celebrities. The Labor senator Jana Stewart has continued the trend of politicians making their fashion statements at the ball political, with a dress that says yes. The white dress, designed by Laura Thompson \u2013 the co-founder of social enterprise Clothing the Gaps \u2013 is embroidered with words from the Uluru statement of the heart and the word \u201cyes\u201d in a nod to the upcoming referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has said the government should be reminded the point of the Senate is to hold it to account after the Greens decision to defer the debate on the Housing Australia Future Fund until October granted the first half of a trigger towards a full Senate election. Asked on ABC whether she was concerned about the Greens decision leading to a double dissolution, Hanson-Young said: Breaking news; the Senate is not at the whim of the government. It has not been for a long time and it should not be. It is how the Australian people vote, election after election. They want the Senate to hold the government to account. We have been trying for months to negotiate with the government. We were very clear about what is needed for it to happen. We know the expert opinion is that this housing future fund bill is a bit of a sham. It is not spending any money for another two years, it is not building houses, it is gambling it on the stock market. Burke warns MPs that parliament may have to sit on Friday Tony Burke has just warned the house the parliament may have to sit on Friday because the Senate isn\u2019t getting through its business because the Coalition keep adding speakers to things. It\u2019s a filibuster tactic designed to make it look like the government isn\u2019t getting through its work. So Burke has come back with a WE WILL SIT LONGER DON\u2019T PUSH ME move. Let\u2019s see if that moves them along in the Senate. Premier pressured over Hobart stadium advice An independent MP responsible for plunging the Tasmanian government into minority has threatened to send the state to an early election if his concerns about plans for a Hobart stadium are not addressed, AAP reports. John Tucker and Lara Alexander quit the Liberal party in May to sit on the crossbench, citing concerns around the government\u2019s planning for a $715m waterfront stadium at Macquarie Point. The stadium project was a condition of the AFL granting Tasmania a licence for a team. The premier, Jeremy Rockliff, said he had tabled all relevant advice on the stadium plan, though some documents could not be released because they were covered by cabinet confidentiality, a longstanding convention under which government deliberations about policy were kept under wraps. In a speech to parliament, Tucker said the government\u2019s reference to cabinet in confidence amounted to an \u201cobvious cover-up\u201d. Here\u2019s Tucker: At the end of the day, if they don\u2019t provide the information there\u2019s going to be a confidence problem in the government and we will be off to an election. Thanks Amy for leading us through the latest developments today. I\u2019ll be with you for the rest of the day! I am going to pass you to Jordyn Beazley for the rest of the afternoon while I go stare at a wall. Stay tuned for more updates \u2013 I will be back with Politics Live early tomorrow morning and will let you know how the parliament and press gallery pulls up after the Midwinter Ball tonight. As always, take care of you Ax Liberal Democrat says Victorian government has committed to act on Denyer bail The Liberal Democrats MP David Limbrick, who\u2019s partner Natalie Russell was 17 when she was murdered by Denyer, says despite the bill failing they\u2019ve secured a commitment from the government to act: Although the bill didn\u2019t pass today, I regard it as a win \u2013 the efforts of the people behind me who bravely stood up and been making noise about this since 2021 have finally pushed the government into action. I\u2019m very disappointed that it\u2019s taken this long for the government to act. When we first started this in 2021, we thought that it would be something that would happen really quickly. That would be sort of a no-brainer for the government to come up with some sort of legislation to deal with this. For whatever reason they chose not to act. But they have said now, the attorney general said herself they\u2019ve made a public commitment to some sort of parole reform \u2026 I\u2019m willing to contribute to that and work with the government on how that might work. Albanese put on hold in FM radio bit The prime minister is on hold in his latest FM radio bit to give the hosts an \u201cimportant clue\u201d to get out of the escape room they are in because we are a very serious country. When Americans joke Australia is not real. It does give Paul Karp and I a chance to annoy our colleagues to sing Miley Cyrus\u2019s Flowers out loud while we await this very important piece of national security information delivered to FM radio hosts doing a bit by the leader of this country. \u2018We\u2019ll work with you. No politics\u2019: Liberals appeal to Labor on Denyer parole The Liberal MP Brad Battin is holding a press conference after his bid to change Victoria\u2019s law to restrict any future parole applications by the serial killer Paul Denyer failed to pass the upper house. Labor MPs, the Greens and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs voted to block the bill, which proposed the serial killer should only be able to apply for parole if seriously incapacitated or at risk of death. The government has instead proposed changing the law to restrict serial killers from applying for parole for several years. The attorney general has said a law dealing specifically with Denyer would be subject to a high court challenge. Battin \u2013 the opposition\u2019s corrections spokesperson \u2013 says he is happy to work with \u201cwhoever it takes\u201d to ensure the families are given closure: Daniel Andrews our cry to you now is work with us. We\u2019ll work with you. No politics. Let\u2019s make sure to pass that legislation to ensure that Victorians are safe. Vikki Petraitis, a crime author, has followed the case since the 1990s, and has become close to Denyer\u2019s victims\u2019 families. She says today is a \u201cdistressing day\u201d. We sat in the gallery and we watched 19 people vote no, and the stark reality is that even though they expressed that they wanted to help the families, they could have finished this today. And they voted no. And that\u2019s really distressing. And just for fun and because we have missed him, here is a Mike Bowers series on facial expressions. Please enjoy this series from Mike Bowers: politicians discover hands. Anthony Albanese is bookending his day with FM radio interviews \u2013 he\u2019ll be on KIIS FM Sydney this afternoon (he spoke to Triple M this morning, which feels like 20 years and at least 100 will the voice \u2026 questions ago). At the end of QT, Anthony Albanese and Max Chandler-Mather appeared to have words \u2013 as caught by Mike Bowers: The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has commented on the government\u2019s announcement of real-time reporting on deaths in custody. Staff at the University of Melbourne are on strike for the second time this year demanding pay rises at least in line with the consumer price index and lower workloads. The National Union of Students education officer, Xavier Dup\u00e9, is rallying alongside academics. He says \u201ca win for staff means better conditions for students\u201d. \u201cMelbourne University is far from unique. Students across the country are faced with management that ... charge huge fees to students. A win for University of Melbourne staff and students would be an example for other unions fighting the cost-of-living crisis and education cuts.\u201d Arts students have been sent an email reminding them of their rights to attend classes and exams, while a fundraiser has been launched with a $20,000 goal to help staff losing pay due to the strike. Bid to restrict future parole applications by serial killer Paul Denyer fails A bid by the Victorian opposition to change the state\u2019s law to restrict any future parole applications by the serial killer Paul Denyer has failed to pass the upper house. Labor MPs, the Greens and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs voted to block the bill, which proposed the serial killer should only be able to apply for parole if seriously incapacitated or at risk of death. The government has instead proposed changing the law to restrict serial killers from applying for parole for several years. Debate on the bill was emotional, with the loved ones of victims in the chamber. The Liberal Democrats MP David Limbrick, who\u2019s partner Natalie Russell was 17 when she was murdered by Denyer, spoke in support of the bill. Limbrick said he had felt closure after Denyer was sentenced in 1993 to three life sentences but this was ripped from him when on appeal he was granted a 30-year sentence: No one who\u2019s been talking about this publicly, none of us want to be going over and over it. But we just want to have some sort of solution or closure that we felt that we had back in 1993. Because, even today, despite our will, no one here can actually stand up and say for certain that he\u2019s never going to harm another girl, the way that he harmed Nat. So we have to act. Question time ends And that is pretty much it for QT. One. More. To. Go. Will the voice be able to declare its a scallop and not a potato cake for all of Australia? Will the voice be able to move Parliament House? Will the voice change Valentine\u2019s Day to Captain Cook was killed day? Given where this week has gone so far, it is hard to rule anything out. \u2018Do not tell me what I do or do not know about Aboriginal Australia,\u2019 Burney tells Liberal MP Tony Pasin is next up with the non-government questions: Minister, where in the wording proposed to create a new chapter in the constitution is the voice restricted from offering advice to the government and the executive on any issue it chooses? Linda Burney: I am sorry that it appears you are unable to read the very simple instructions for what this is about. Clause three makes it very clear. Pasin makes a point of order asking Burney to withdraw: While I did grow up in a household where English was not my first language, I can read. Burney withdraws. I have said on at least five or six occasions, this week, what the voice is responsible for and what the second reading speech of the attorney general said, especially in relation to matters that affect Indigenous people differently. I think it is patently clear. Let me say this to the member for Barker. I have been to communities that are crying out for a different way of doing things. I have been to communities where there are 30 people living in two-bedroom homes. I have been to communities where babies are drinking sweet cordial instead of water because it is cheaper. I have been to communities where you cannot get in and out because of the road conditions. I have taken a friend, who died at 43, of end-of-life renal failure, to visit his son in jail. I have seen friends die, in hospitals, because they are very young, and their conditions in their life when they were younger terrible. So do not tell me what I do or do not know about Aboriginal Australia. Do not tell me the proposition the prime minister has outlined is not needed in this country. I am not interested in culture wars. I am interested in closing the gap. Katter inquires about \u2018housing packages in paradise\u2019 Bob Katter then takes the next non-government question. PM, could you confirm that house prices in Brisbane and Sydney exceed 800,000. And since only one million people live outside the 70km east coast, Perth and Victoria, who would miss Victoria, minister, if migration is halved in your housing authority buys or designates 14,000 one hectare housing blocks, at Mareeba and Atherton for example, if the authority overrides what the Reserve Bank describes as insurmountable building, building, zoning and planning impositions, won\u2019t we get housing packages in paradise for under $280,000. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Why is housing so expensive and what are you doing about it? That\u2019s what I think he was asking there. The prime minister gives his housing speech in response. \u2018I am not sure what the opposition is missing\u2019: Burney fields more opposition questions on scope of voice Michelle Landry asks Linda Burney: Will the voice have the power to provide advice to the government on any program in the budget? That sound you hear is Burney\u2019s internal scream at this line of questioning. Burney: I have made the point repeatedly this week, that the voice has no power of veto. So the answer to the question is obvious. I am not sure what the opposition is missing. This is a practical and simple proposition. This is about making practical change the lives of First Nations people in this country and it is also about this country and recognising 65,000 years of history. There are 10 design principles and that is the end of my answer. Jason Clare says making university free would mean \u2018just a lucky few\u2019 would be able to attend Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown asks Jason Clare: You and I and many others in this place benefited from free university before fees were introduced by the Hawke Labor Government. Last night, the University of Melbourne vice-chancellor called for first degrees to be free, something the Greens have also been calling for. Prime minister, will you commit to making university free, or is Labor content with students continuing to accumulate massive rising debt to the minister for education? Jason Clare: Now we don\u2019t support that because what that would mean is that fewer people go to university not more. In fact, that would mean that just a lucky few would end up going to university. And the sort of people that would miss out would be people from poor backgrounds. People from the bush and more Indigenous Australians. You know, Mr. Speaker, Kermit the Frog was wrong. It is easy being green because you can promise the world and you don\u2019t have to deliver anything. He then includes a sledge about housing. Question time is almost over but I am still catching up because of the transcription issue, so apologies for dragging this out. The Nationals\u2019 Pat Conaghan then asks Linda Burney: The voice referendum working group and Yes23 director Thomas Mayo has stated: \u201cWe keep going. We maintain this momentum until we change the system, until we tear down the institutions\u201d. On what basis did the minister appoint Mr Mayo to the referendum Working Group? Burney says: I have a responsibility and that responsibility is what I say. Liberal MP asks Burney to name issue affecting non-Indigenous Australians, but not Indigenous Australians OK. We have hit a new low with questions. The member for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie, asks (the questions are handed to backbenchers by the tactics team which is made up of the leadership) Can the minister name an issue that affects non Indigenous Australians, that does not affect Indigenous Australians? There is a very long back-and-forth over whether the question is in order. Milton Dick rules it is, but is broad (meaning Linda Burney can answer it however she would like). Burney: The voice will not be required to make a representation on every law, policy and program. The attorney general made clear that matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need measures specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \u2013 or matters which affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently. Just look at the bottom score of every social round, of every social ladder in this country and you might figure that out. The New South Wales corruption watchdog will hand down its much-anticipated and highly delayed report into former premier Gladys Berejiklian next week. The Independent Commission Against Corruption announced the report would be released on 29 June at 9am. In a statement, Icac said: The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption will furnish its Operation Keppel investigation report, concerning the then member of Parliament for Wagga Wagga, the then premier, and others, to the Presiding Officers at the NSW Parliament on Thursday 29 June 2023 at 9.00 am. If the presiding officers make the report public, it will be made available for download from the Icac website at www.icac.nsw.gov.au with notification also provided to media and via the commission\u2019s Twitter account. Berejiklian has denied any wrongdoing Sussan Ley (with the delivery of a high school debating captain): Would the voice have the power to advise the government to abolish Australia Day? Linda Burney: The voice will not be bothered by cultural wars. It will focus on the practical and on the [matter of] policy [which affects Indigenous people] differently in terms of closing the gap. As the \u2026 speech of the attorney general made clear, it will focus on matters specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or matters that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differently. And the key word is \u201cdifferently\u201d. The word \u201cdifferently\u201d talks about things like the 10-year gap in life expectancy. It talks about the higher chance that Indigenous people have of being incarcerated than of them possibly going to university. It talks about infant and maternal mortality. It talks about children born at lower birth weights, higher rates of family violence, lower rates of finishes school and higher rates of unemployment, overcrowding in houses. It will not be involved in cultural wars. Sussan Ley has the next non-government question. Guess. GUESS what it\u2019s on. Chalmers: Greens \u2018not prepare to vote for\u2019 social housing \u2018when it really matters\u2019 Jim Chalmers is up next on the housing slam. The Greens \u2026 say they believe in social housing, they\u2019re just not prepared to vote for it when it really matters. They say they want more social housing, and they go into the Senate and they vote against more social housing. \u2026 Our budgets, they aren\u2019t just defined by our Labor values. They\u2019re defined by Australian values, working together to get things done for each other, putting pragmatism and problem solving ahead of posturing and product differentiation, not just issuing pithy press releases, but running this country and our economy in the interests of the people and communities who sent us here to work for them. Andrew Wilkie asks if Labor is trying cover up \u2018obvious crime\u2019 of coal quality fraud Andrew Wilkie breaks the housing fund questions with: These documents contain additional evidence of coal quality fraud by three companies regarding Australian exports to South Korea. Now when I first raised this issue with you last year, the ACCC initially told me it would investigate. But since then, no agency has contacted me, the whistleblower involved struggled to even get a meeting with the ACCC and only Terracom is being investigated. Minister, is your government trying to cover up this obvious crime? Madeleine King: I thank the member for Clark for his question, and I can assure you this government is not interested in covering up anything at all at, least of all accusations such as this. I also want to thank the member for Clark for his advocacy for whistleblowers across Australia. And I admire him for his strong sense of social justice, and I thank him for his tireless work of protecting our nation against corruption and misinformation. My office has engaged with the member on \u2013 not, perhaps, the matter you are raising today, but on other matters in relation to alleged misconduct and coal quality testing. I can assure the member I do take these allegations very seriously. I will have to look in to the new matters you mentioned in relation that you\u2019ve raised and your involvement or otherwise or lack of involvement as you have said in relation to the ACCC and of course I will do that and my office will undertake to do that straight away. King says the government takes the allegations seriously and she will be on it. Wilkie asks to table the documents but leave is denied. Tony Burke says he is unaware of the legal issues if the documents were tabled. The next dixer is to Julie Collins who continues the reading of the Labor Burn Book entries about the Greens. Dutton and Albanese spar over One Nation, Clive Palmer preferences at election Peter Dutton then asks if the Australian Labor party will accept Greens preferences at the next election. The chamber explodes in a cacophony of faux-rage and Milton Dick has to use his best headteacher\u2019s voice to bring the house to order. Anthony Albanese: I do really thank the leader of the opposition for this question. From the party that relies on preferences from One Nation and Clive Palmer. Peter Dutton has a point of order \u2013 the Labor party also accepts preferences from Clive Palmer and One Nation, he says. Albanese: They are often a part of a Coalition of the cookers over there in Queensland. He has to withdraw it after complaints. I note they find it offensive that I mention Clive Palmer and One Nation with the Queensland LNP. Albanese then points out that the Liberal federal conference this weekend had a seven-minute video on \u201cthe Peter Dutton I know\u201d. \u201cIt was seven minutes, but it seems like longer,\u201d he says. I hope I don\u2019t need to say this, but political parties don\u2019t get to choose who they accept preferences from \u2013 voters vote how they vote. Political parties can put out how to vote cards for their supporters which have a guide on how they would like people to vote, but they cannot decide not to take someone\u2019s preferences. PM: Greens \u2018want people to stay in poverty so they can have a rally against it\u2019 The next question is a dixer on how terrible the Greens are for holding up the housing Australia future fund with its demand for action for renters. Anthony Albanese is VERY exercised as he delivers his answer which includes the mention of an article written by one of the Greens (I think it is Max Chandler-Mather, in Jacobin: This is what he had to say. He wrote, \u2018This parliamentary conflict helped create the space for a broader campaign in civil society\u2019. He went on to say this: \u2018We\u2019re opposing 30,000 social and affordable homes because\u2019 \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u2018allowing the Haff to pass today would demobilise the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry about the degree of poverty and financial stress that exists in such a wealthy country\u2019. Because it would demobilise people from campaigning against poverty. They want people to stay in poverty so they can have a rally against it. It goes on and the chamber is in absolute outrage \u2013 on all sides. Paul Karp sees Chandler-Mather say \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d when Albanese says the Greens want a fight on the issue, and he and the independent MP Dr Monique Ryan are waving Labor MPs on in the universal \u201cbring it on\u201d signal. Or as we said at my Gold Coast school: earrings off, rings on. After learning that Anthony Albanese went downstairs to watch the cricket so as not to disturb his partner, and Peter Dutton watched it on his phone with the volume down so as not to wake his wife, we move on to the questions. Melissa Price kicks it off asking if Linda Burney misled parliament with some of her statements yesterday. (The one in question is about Australia Day not being moved \u2013 the question seems to be based on an article in the Australian (one of many questions which have been based on articles in the Oz over the last couple of weeks) Burney does the verbal equivalent of an annoyed eye roll and says no and what she won\u2019t do is engage in \u201ctokenism\u201d adding that this is \u201cnot about culture wars\u201d. It is not the policy of this government to change the date of Australia Day, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have strong views about Australia Day but it is the parliament that makes those decisions. \u201cThis is not about culture wars, this is about closing the gap. This isn\u2019t about division, this is about bringing people together.\u201d Alas, even the Tveeder transcription service has given up today and I can\u2019t say I blame it. Universities contributing to housing crisis \u2018by charging huge prices\u2019, Randwick councillor says The Randwick Greens councillor Philipa Veitch has called for an immediate increase in public and affordable housing and a rent freeze, as students struggle under the weight of rising rents. Speaking at the UNSW protest, she said: Universities have \u2026 been contributing to the problem by charging huge prices for student accommodation, and selling off and leasing land to private accommodation operators. A UNSW spokesperson said its Sydney campus was seeing higher demand for student accommodation compared to recent years, aligned to rental market demands and had established a new \u201cconcierge service\u201d to help students find housing on and off campus. This has been undertaken to support the needs of our students who have been increasingly experiencing difficulties in finding appropriate accommodation. The University is aware that some students may be facing financial challenges at this time. UNSW endeavours to provide the support students need to succeed at university, ranging from financial assistance to academic skills support. UNSW students rally to call for rent caps on campus housing UNSW students are holding a rally this afternoon calling for urgent affordable campus housing as the rental crisis continues to bite. Students are demanding UNSW caps rents on student housing to one-third of youth allowance \u2013 equating to roughly $100 a week \u2013 and commit more finances to providing affordable campus housing. Organiser Cherish Kuehlmann said the cheapest accommodation on campus was currently $653 per fortnight, $100 more than Youth Allowance. Students would have to earn a full-time salary of over $56,000 a year to not experience rental stress. What student can afford that? Every thing I have learnt about Bazball has been against my will. This includes the four minutes of my life listening to both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton talk about the Australian team underdog win in the first test. There are four more tests to go. Calm down. Meanwhile, QT will end with a Go the Blues, Up the Maroons moment ahead of origin. And then we will continue to hear about how politics and sport should be seperate. President of Tibet\u2019s government-in-exile compares China\u2019s treatment of Tibetan children to Stolen Generations \u201cWe are dying a slow death culturally, day by day,\u201d the president of Tibet\u2019s government-in-exile said today, as he called on Australia to do more to stop China\u2019s human rights abuses in his country. Penpa Tsering is the democratically elected head of the exiled government, living in India (the Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of the east Asian nation). Tsering has described China\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule in China to be \u201ccultural genocide\u201d, and in his National Press Club Speech he said if the federal government\u2019s foreign policy was to impose sanctions on governments that commit crimes against humanity \u201cjust like China does in Tibet\u201d, it should apply equally to everybody. He said: We know for a fact Australia has sanctioned Iran, Burma, Russia, but when it comes to China, then everyone calms down a little bit. He said he understood the sensitivities and the national interest that were involved, with China as Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner, but that the bigger countries could \u201cget away with everything\u201d. Tsering also likened the situation in Tibet to Australia\u2019s Stolen Generations, saying Tibetan children were being taken from their families and put in boarding schools. China was also trialling schools with no Tibetan classes, he said. China is trying to block Tibet and \u201cmake it like a huge prison where nobody can go in, nobody can go out\u201d and then it tells the world it is a \u201csocialist paradise\u201d, he said. He also said the international community seemed to pay attention to violent conflicts and ignore the peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people, and that suited China. \u201cWe are dying a slow death culturally, day by day,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] we have never lost hope.\u201d Greens accused of engineering rental crisis The Greens are now being accused of engineering a rental crisis for their own ends in the house, as the airing of the grievances (90-second statements) comes to an end. The last 90-second statement is usually the main message the government wants to get out because it is the time when everyone is switching over to pay attention before question time. Anyway, here is another view: Question time approaches There is now less than half an hour until question time \u2013 the second last one of the sitting, which means it is also the second last one for almost six weeks. We know that the Coalition will be asking more questions about what the voice can or can\u2019t do and there will be more \u201cwhen will the prime minister come clean about the damage his government is causing our country?\u201d Will the voice be able to save Fantales? Stay tuned. Robodebt statement from Shorten still pending We were waiting for Bill Shorten to deliver a ministerial statement (by leave) on robodebt which was down on the house notice paper for noon \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t seem to have eventuated. It is not surprising that Shorten would be delivering a statement \u2013 the final report is being handed down on 7 July and it\u2019s the last parliament sitting before the Fadden byelection, which is happening because Stuart Robert, one of the Coalition ministers that had carriage of robodebt, has quit the parliament. We\u2019ll endeavour to find out what happened there. \u2018We are not asking for independence\u2019: Tibet\u2019s Penpa Tsering What is the difference between statehood (which Penpa Tsering wants) and independence? Penpa Tsering The middle way approach as proposed by his Holiness is a Buddhist concept avoiding extreme polarity. So one polarity is the status of Tibet, historical status as an independent state and the other polarity is the present state of Tibet under the government of the PRC. We are trying to seek a solution of an autonomous arrangement whereby Tibetans would have the freedom to practise its language, protect its environment, you know, and preserve its culture and religion and language. So these are basic fundamental rights which are taken for granted in the free world that does not exist in Tibet. So this is what we are asking for. We are not asking for independence. Even here at the Press Club, we know that Chinese government \u2013 the Ambassador here \u2013 ask the Press Club to disinvite me, and I always thank the Chinese government for being our best publicity agent. President of the Tibetan government-in-exile delivers press club address Penpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, is giving his press club address. His government-in-exile is headquartered in northern India. Freedom House, the international watchdog, has designated Tibet as one of the least free countries alongside South Sudan and Syria. That itself explains it is not the Tibetans who are saying we are the least free country in the world, it is the international watchdog who is looking into all the parameters of freedom. That it is what are the least free countries in the world where you have no access, no access to diplomats, no access to journalists, no access to even ordinary travellers. That is what China tries to do, lock away Tibet, make it like a huge prison where nobody can go in, nobody can go out and then tell the international community that Tibet is a socialist paradise. If Tibet is a socialist paradise, then why does Chinese government [not] allow [people] to see the paradise for themselves? Tibet does not have any political or civil rights. If anyone of you have read George Orwell\u2019s 1984, that has come into reality in China and more so in the Tibetan region, Mongolian region and in Hong Kong. Tibetans inside Tibet have no political space to express themselves. Government sets up national registry to help combat workplace respiratory diseases A national registry has been established to detect and combat deadly workplace respiratory diseases as the federal government seeks to tackle the prevalence of silicosis, AAP reports. If passed, the law will require mandatory reporting of the disease which affects nearly one-in-four engineered stone workers in the industry prior to 2018. But the peak union representing workers wants a ban on engineered stone to eradicate disease. Products with high silica levels \u2013 commonly used in kitchen and bathroom benches \u2013 have been linked to the incurable lung disease silicosis and cancer. Assistant health minister Ged Kearney said every case of silicosis was unacceptable. Introducing the proposal to parliament, she told the story of Joanna, a 34-year-old mother of two who worked at a quarry run by a large multinational company. During a fit-for-work test after returning from maternity leave, Joanna was diagnosed with silicosis. Kearney said: She\u2019s not who many people would first picture when they think of a worker diagnosed with silicosis. She\u2019s a young woman and she worked largely in a reception role at the front office of the quarry. (Joanna) should never have been diagnosed with this disease.\u201d The proposed national occupational respiratory disease registry will capture information on respiratory disease believed to have been caused by or exacerbated in the workplace. Respiratory, sleep, occupational and environmental medicine specialists will be required to notify the registry of every diagnosis of occupationally caused silicosis. They may also notify the registry of other occupational respiratory diseases, with the patient\u2019s consent. Protest mounted to save Kosciuszko brumbies Ahhh \u2013 the mounted protest on the lawns of Parliament House is seeking to draw attention to the push to save the feral horses/brumbies in Kosciuszko national park. The horses are being culled because their population is too large and they are causing damage to the ecosystem of the national park, including critically endangered frogs. But the group is urging for other solutions to allow the horses to live. Victorian Coalition urged to drop vote on Paul Denyer parole bill Victoria\u2019s attorney general Jaclyn Symes is urging the Coalition not to put its bill to restrict any future parole applications by serial killer Paul Denyer to a vote in parliament today. The bill, which proposes the serial killer should only be able to apply for parole if seriously incapacitated or at risk of death, is currently being debated in the upper house and will be put to a vote, but is doomed to fail without the support of Labor, the Greens and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs. The government has ruled out creating a single law dealing specifically with Denyer\u2019s case and is instead considering restricting serial killers from applying for parole for several years. Symes said she had met with the family of one of Denyer\u2019s victims and gave them a \u201cpersonal commitment\u201d that she would craft laws that \u201cgive them comfort that Paul Denyer is not getting out of prison\u201d. But she confirmed Labor would vote against the Coalition\u2019s bill, which she says would lead to a legal challenge: A one-man piece of legislation in relation to denying them parole forever will be challenged in the high court. We\u2019ve had successes in the high court before but there\u2019s no guarantee that we will have a success again, particularly when I\u2019ve been able to articulate that there are other options on the table in relation to dealing with this matter. Symes urged the Coalition to delay a vote on their bill and instead arrange a meeting with her and the family I have expressed my preference to not debate this bill today. I know that family members are coming in today. We should use the opportunity to sit down and have further conversations with them. It\u2019s a very unknown world \u2013 politics \u2013 for a lot of people. So taking the time to explain the process, explain the options, I think is a better use of today\u2019s time than politicians standing up talking about these victims when you can actually talk to them. The neighs have it There is some sort of mounted protest on the lawns in front of Parliament House. As in horses. The Senate has passed a government taxation bill, including a Greens amendment supported by Labor setting up a proactive disclosure regime for the future fund. The Greens amendment would require the minister to make regulations specifying that the future fund is to publicly report every six months on details of its investments including where funds are invested and how much. Greens treasury spokesperson Nick McKim said: Australians have a right to know exactly how the future fund is investing $250bn of their money. For too long the future fund has been operating behind closed doors and making investments that have had calamitous environmental and human rights impacts. Mandatory disclosure will reveal whether the future fund is still investing in weapons manufacturers or fossil fuel corporations, as it has regularly done in the past. It took [freedom of information] requests to reveal the fund had invested in arms companies with links to the Myanmar military. And it took questions through Senate estimates to find out that the future fund has $3.4bn in the 50 biggest fossil fuel companies in the world. Public pressure following these revelations forced the future fund to divest, but it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to hold the future fund to account. We hope that the disinfectant of sunlight will bring about a change in the future fund\u2019s investments and ultimately force them to invest ethically. Proactive disclosure will increase pressure on the future fund to make investment decisions in line with the values that Australians expect. Defence stopped sharing VIP flight details with watchdog, FOI documents show We reported earlier this year that the defence department had suddenly stopped publishing details about the use of its VIP jet fleet by politicians, preventing the public from scrutinising their potential misuse. Now, freedom of information documents show that the department has also stopped providing details of the flights to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, the watchdog designed to prevent travel rorts. Ipea has a role in recovering funds from the offices of MPs who should be using their own travel budget to pay for the costly flights \u2013 thought to be worth $4,600 an hour. It recovered about $38,000 in 2019-20 and 2020-21 alone. But the department ceased handing over the data to Ipea in December 2021, preventing it from recovering any further funds. An Ipea spokesperson said: Ipea undertakes budget allocation and recovery action based on information provided by Defence. The most recent information related to 2021. Discussions with Defence relating to the SPA [special purpose aircraft] are ongoing. Defence did not respond to a request for comment but has previously raised security concerns around the sharing of the VIP fleet data. The AEC commissioner Tom Rogers has a general message for anyone campaigning for either side of the referendum \u2013 if in doubt, authorise the message. Politically active entities are familiar with the requirement to authorise their messages but others who will campaign in this referendum may not be. If your communication is designed to encourage people to vote a certain way and you are expending money to create or distribute that communication, or if you\u2019re likely to be a referendum entity, then you have to authorise that communication. Authorisation laws are all about people knowing who is communicating with them about their vote \u2013 my advice to all campaigners is to make that as clear as possible and, if in doubt, authorise. Public debate is important. The AEC isn\u2019t here to stifle or prevent debate but we do want to make sure referendum communication is transparent and complies with the law. Jane Hume makes her speaking slot \u2013 just Liberal senator Jane Hume, the shadow minister for finance, is a little out of breath as she delivers a speech in the Senate \u2013 it looks like she has had to run into the chamber to make her speaking slot. She pulls on her blazer as she speaks and pushes through catching her breath at the same time. Someone hands her a glass of water, which she gratefully accepts. Chris Bowen has announced funding to sustainable aviation fuel. Bowen, the climate change and energy minister, and Andrew Leigh went out to the Canberra airport this morning to make the announcement. Bowen: Today we\u2019re announcing that Arena, the federal government\u2019s renewable investment agency, will invest $30m to work with companies to make sustainable aviation fuel a reality \u2013 not interested at this point in early-stage research; that work has been done. This is about late-stage research taking work that\u2019s already been done and turning it into commercial reality, making it available for Australia\u2019s airlines and, indeed, for international airlines to refuel in Australia. Qantas calls Australia home; we want to make Australia a home for sustainable aviation fuel. So these grant applications will open in the coming weeks and will be open until November. So I invite people who are interested in developing Australia\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel industry to apply for $30m of funding. It will make a difference to taking good research that\u2019s already occurred and taking it to the next step to make that a reality. Tibetan leader to speak at the National Press Club At the National Press Club today is Sikyong Penpa Tsering, the democratically elected political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile. He is visiting Australia until 25 June. Penpa Tsering wants the Australian government to take a stronger stance at China\u2019s increasing human rights violations in Tibet and wants help ending what he is calling a \u201ccultural genocide\u201d. Perfect exchange, no notes. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has arrived at parliament and is taking questions from journalists. First up, he\u2019s asked if he deserves to be the highest-paid premier in the country \u2013 with his salary set to increase by 3.5% to about $480,000. His reply: An independent body determines all of our pay, terms and conditions. It\u2019s an independent body. There was a time when politicians set their own pay and we took steps to change that. We stand by those decisions. Andrews says Victoria won\u2019t follow NSW in freezing MPs pay during the cost-of-living crisis. He says the government is currently negotiating pay deals with the public sector \u201cin good faith\u201d: We will negotiate in good faith with all of our workforce and we hope that all employers negotiate in good faith with all employees regardless of industry, regardless of circumstance, that\u2019s our approach. It\u2019s an independent model. We do not set our own pay \u2013 it\u2019s set by an independent, arm\u2019s length tribunal, and that is far preferable in my mind to MPs setting their own pay rises. Andrews has rebuffed questions about his \u201chalfwit grub\u201d comment directed at a female Liberal MP: The comments were withdrawn in accordance with the rules of the house. I\u2019ve got nothing further to say. I\u2019ve addressed these issues in question. I\u2019ve got nothing further to add. This sort of debate is going to continue today: Greens\u2019 Barbara Pocock wants to see PwC held accountable The Greens senator Barbara Pocock is using the Australia Institute polling that found 80% of respondents wanted to see PwC banned from holding new government contracts to continue her push to see the consulting and accounting firm held accountable: I share the shock and disgust that Australians feel when they hear about the rich and powerful ripping off Australian taxpayers in the most cynical and self-interested way. This survey result certainly ramps up the pressure on the government to take more decisive action against PwC, who have clearly lost the trust of the Australian people. There has been a moral and ethical failure within this firm, which has its tentacles in just about every facet of public life in Australia. Pesutto says Victorian MPs\u2019 3.5% pay rise \u2018overshoots the runway\u2019 Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto has called for a review into the state\u2019s remuneration tribunal, which awarded MPs a 3.5% pay rise yesterday, saying the decision doesn\u2019t meet community expectations. He told reporters: This was a system that the Andrews government established some years ago. It\u2019s designed to be an independent tribunal. But clearly, it\u2019s landing decisions that don\u2019t sit well with the expectations of the Victorian community. The government having set up this system really needs to look at ways to make sure that the criteria that the remuneration tribunal takes into account as an independent wage setting body will lead to decisions that better reflect the expectations of the Victorian people. I don\u2019t think Victorians believe that politicians should never get pay increases. I think Victorians, like everyone else around the country, believe in fair and reasonable increases, but not ones that overshoot the runway like this. Pesutto also reiterated his call for Daniel Andrews to apologise to Cindy McLeish: This parliament must lead in terms of lifting standards of political discourse and debate in this state. And if the premier can\u2019t do it, if the minister for women won\u2019t defend women, and if Danny Pearson is prepared to come out and say that he too supports the premier\u2019s comments, it shows that we have a government that is not committed to those high standards. Telstra-TPG bid to expand regional networks knocked back Telstra and TPG have suffered another blow in their bid to expand their networks in regional parts of Australia, with the Australian Competition Tribunal backing a previous Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ruling against the two companies sharing network infrastructure. The deal would have resulted in TPG decommissioning about 700 Vodafone mobile sites in order to use 3,700 Telstra mobile sites in a network sharing agreement across 4G and 5G. It would have increased the reach of Vodafone\u2019s mobile network in regional and remote parts of Australia \u2013 increasing coverage from 96% to 98.8% of the Australian population. Telstra would have also gained access to 169 TPG sites. It was struck down by the ACCC in December, and in an appeal judgment on Thursday, competition tribunal president Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan said while the agreement would not materially affect TPG\u2019s position in the market, it would further increase Telstra\u2019s competitive position in the market. He said it would also undermine Optus\u2019s willingness to invest in expanding its network coverage. O\u2019Bryan said the tribunal was concerned with maintaining competition in the mobile retail and wholesale markets as a whole, and not Optus specifically, but said that the market is highly concentrated and unlikely to expand to more operators. He indicated the ruling was limited to this agreement and other network sharing arrangements might not be knocked back in a similar fashion. AAP has reported on the latest climate protests at the country\u2019s coal ports: Newcastle and Melbourne ports have again been targeted by climate protesters, just hours after a teenager scaled a coal loader and glued herself to a railing. It\u2019s the third day of action by climate activists targeting major east coast coal ports. A young woman abseiled off Shepherd Bridge on Footscray Road on Wednesday morning, blocking six lanes of traffic with a safety line stretched across the road. Earlier, a 22-year-old man perched himself on top of a nine-metre pole on a rail bridge at Branxton, forcing the closure of the NSW Hunter railway line, with no trains running between Scone and Maitland. The man anchored the pole to rail infrastructure to cause maximum disruption to operations. By mid Monday morning both protesters had yet to be removed by police. The action comes after an 18-year-old Canberra woman was charged on Tuesday night after scaling a coal loader at Newcastle and gluing herself to a railing. On Monday another woman was charged after suspending herself above the railway leading to Newcastle\u2019s coal loader. NSW police minister Yasmin Catley labelled the protesters \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cblockheads\u201d, describing the action as \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. \u201cTheir actions do absolutely nothing for the environment or climate change,\u201d she told Sydney radio 2GB. Midwinter Ball \u2013 the Aldi version of the White House press corps dinner I\u2019ve had a few people ask about the Midwinter Ball \u2013 what is it, what goes on and why it happens. Hosted by the press gallery, it\u2019s like the Aldi version of the White House press corps dinner. Unlike the White House gala, it is off the record \u2013 which is why you don\u2019t see the speeches like you do when DC hosts its annual affair. People have to register their interest in buying tickets \u2013 attendance is not guaranteed. Politicians have to be invited to attend on one of the tables \u2013 again, attendance is not guaranteed. It\u2019s all run by the press gallery committee and a special Midwinter Ball committee. Everyone has to pay for their ticket. There is usually a comedian as host and live entertainment. The press gallery journalist of the year is announced at the ball. And the leaders of the political parties give speeches, usually self-deprecating. There has been an ongoing battle over whether they should be off the record. You may remember that Malcolm Turnbull wasn\u2019t happy when his Donald Trump impression was reported quite a few years ago. There is a good cause underpinning it all \u2013 it has raised millions for charity over the years. Which means there are raffles and auctions \u2013 this year you can go to the cricket with Peter Dutton, or play a game of tennis or pool with Anthony Albanese at the Lodge. I am not attending (it is not my scene) so I will let you know if I hear of anything happening on the night. In the meantime, a few happy snaps from last year\u2019s do: Daniel Andrews was defending female MP, says former minister for women Victoria\u2019s former minister for women Gabrielle Williams is also out this morning defending the premier\u2019s \u201chalfwit grub\u201d comment directed at a female Liberal MP yesterday. Williams \u2013 who served as minister for women between 2018 and 2022 \u2013 also said he was defending Northcote Labor MP Kat Theophanous: I know that the premier like a great many others on our side of the chamber took umbrage at what was without doubt a very low blow directed at the member for Northcote. He was obviously defending the member for Northcote. These are attacks from the opposition that are not unusual in that place. And you know, we have much to point to in their treatment of women and in their approach on these issues. She accused Liberal MPs of shouting over female ministers during recent budget estimates hearings: We disproportionately saw women members screamed at, talked over and generally treated very poorly in in contrast to our male counterparts. After about five minutes of questioning, Williams eventually conceded the premier\u2019s comments were inappropriate and noted he withdrew them: The premier himself acknowledged they were not appropriate hence his withdrawal. It is no surprise that it gets icier the closer you get to Parliament House. Zoe Daniel not impressed with Coalition gambling bill Independent Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel introduced her private member\u2019s bill to ban gambling ads earlier in the sitting \u2013 she has just seen the opposition\u2019s bill, which was introduced in the Senate and she is not impressed: The Labor legislation to expand income management is in the Senate today for its second reading debate \u2013 and will be passed, given the Coalition is also in support of it. Labor said it had abolished mandatory cashless debit cards \u2013 but it always remained, it just became voluntary and the BasicsCard (which is mandatory in some areas, including the NT) remained. So income management never went away. And now, it is about to be expanded. As the bill\u2019s explanatory notes say: Firstly, the bill extends the enhanced IM regime to include all of the measures that are in place for the IM regime in part 3B of the Administration Act. This will allow eligible welfare recipients to enter an enhanced IM regime that offers improved technology and access to over one million outlets across Australia as well as \u2018Tap and Go\u2019 transactions, online shopping and Bpay Secondly, the Bill gives people subject to the IM regime under part 3B the choice to move to enhanced IM from the commencement date, thereby allowing them to access the BasicsCard bank account and superior SmartCard. Thirdly, the bill directs all new entrants to the enhanced IM regime while further consultation is undertaken on the long-term future of IM. The Greens and the crossbench cannot stop this as the Coalition is in support of the bill, which means the government does not have to negotiate. Greens leader: Victorian MPs\u2019 pay rises should match public sector workers\u2019 Victorian Greens leader Samantha Ratnam says MPs\u2019 pay rises shouldn\u2019t be higher than that of public servants. MPs were awarded a 3.5% pay rise \u2013 0.5% more than what has been offered to public sector workers. Ratnam told reporters outside parliament: The Greens have consistently argued that politicians\u2019 pay rises shouldn\u2019t exceed the public sector wage cap. We\u2019ve also consistently argued that politicians\u2019 pay should be set by an independent body like the remuneration tribunal. We acknowledge that people are doing it really tough at the moment and our public sector wages especially have been suppressed for years. We\u2019ve been pushing for that public sector wage cap to be increased. Our nurses and teachers should be paid fairly and we will continue to advocate for the fair pay for all workers. The sitting has begun and the house has opened with a moment\u2019s silence for WA police officer Anthony Woods. Victorian frontbencher backs Andrews over \u2018halfwit\u2019 comment Danny Pearson also backed in the premier, who on Tuesday refused to apologise to Liberal MP Cindy McLeish for calling her a \u201chalfwit grub\u201d in state parliament. Andrews argued he was defending Northcote Labor MP Kat Theophanous, after McLeish said she should vote on a bill related to anti-corruption report into her father, Theo. Pearson said Andrews was justified in his comments: I absolutely support the comments made by the premier because of the premier was standing up to support the integrity of the member Northcote, which was under attack. Victorian minister Danny Pearson has defended a 3.5% pay rise awarded to MPs, saying he would be contributing some of his salary to local charities. The Victorian Independent Remuneration Tribunal on Tuesday released its annual determination that will see the base salary for all Victorian MPs increase by 3.5%. The increase will see a backbencher\u2019s salary reach $199,000 a year, while the premier\u2019s will rise to $480,000. Pearson said the decision was independent, noting the Andrews government in 2017 set up the tribunal to ensure politicians could no longer set their own salaries: One of the decisions we made as a government early on was to take out these decisions from the hands of politicians into the hands of any independent tribunal. That tribunal has done its work; it\u2019s made those findings. He said he would donate some of his salary to charities in his Essendon electorate: I work very closely with my community and identify where there\u2019s needs and make a donation. I\u2019ve always done that. And I\u2019ll continue to do that. Deputy RBA governor says unemployment needs to increase for inflation control The deputy RBA governor, Michele Bullock gave a speech in Newcastle yesterday where she made clear the central bank believes unemployment needs to increase in order for inflation to get under control. Bullock was speaking about Nairu \u2013 the non-accelerating rate of unemployment, which is a fancy term that essentially describes the theoretical level of unemployment where wages and employment are under control. When orthodox economists talk about \u2018full employment\u2019 this is what they mean. Not everyone having a job and the hours they want to work (which is what full unemployment meant postwar at least for white men of working age) but a set unemployment rate (at the moment they think 4.5%). So hundreds of thousands of people being unemployed in order for the economy to keep inflation under control. Bullock: Our goal is to return the labour market (and the market for goods and services) back to a level consistent with full employment \u2013 something like the endpoint in our forecasts. We think this can be achieved if employment and the economy more generally grow at below trend pace for a while. This would help to bring demand and supply into better balance and give us the greatest chance of securing sustainable full employment into the future.\u201d The unemployment rate is currently 3.6%. So what the RBA is saying is unemployment needs to INCREASE for the good of the economy as a whole. You\u2019ll probably see a lot of neoliberal economists and market defenders talk about how alternative is a much higher unemployment rate and inflation sticking around for longer and that it\u2019s a hard reality, but a reality nonetheless. Which, OK, fine. But are they going to volunteer for unemployment to help the economy? Will they be OK with losing their job in order to help lower inflation as a whole? Of course not. Because it won\u2019t be them. Or the people they know. It will be the people who benefited the most from the tight labour market \u2013 people in minimum wage jobs and those with low education/skill levels. And at the same time, those same people defending calls for higher unemployment don\u2019t want to see the unemployment rate raised because that could be inflationary. Sussan Ley: Linda Burney has questions to answer on voice to parliament Sussan Ley has held a quick doorstop to deliver her daily \u2018XX has questions to answer\u2019 spiel. This time it is Linda Burney. Linda Burney has real questions to answer regarding the portfolio that she\u2019s responsible for, Indigenous Australians. Yesterday in the parliament, we asked straightforward questions, and we didn\u2019t get straightforward answers. Which is the way this government treats the question of the voice in the parliament, they are politicising it*. They\u2019re not answering in genuine terms the questions that we\u2019re asking. It is simply not good enough for Linda Burney to say in the parliament the voice will not make representations on Australia Day and she ruled out other matters that we questioned her on as well. She\u2019s now being contradicted by experts, including those on the Yes campaign and her own referendum working group. They\u2019ve taken a completely different position. They\u2019re right, Linda Burney is wrong. She needs to come into the parliament, and she needs to correct the record. *little bit of projection there ** the questions included; Which policy area, portfolio or government department would the voice not deal with? Would the voice be able to make representatives to the chief of the defence force on military acquisitions or the location or operation of military bases? How many people will make up the voice body, who will appoint them and how long will they be appointed for? Which have been answered over and over again. Just on that post from Josh independent senator and former Wallaby captain David Pocock plays for Queensland in the politician state of origin and it\u2019s like watching a benevolent uncle play with the kids at the family barbecue. State of Origin match clashes with the press gallery Midwinter Ball Tonight is the annual gladiatorial contest of mate against mate, state against state \u2013 as top competitors, who are usually staunch allies, face off in bitter rivalry to be crowned champion. The competition is fierce and tense. And in addition to the press gallery Midwinter Ball naming the journalist of the year this evening, there\u2019s also the second match of the State of Origin series. For any footy tragics, you\u2019ll know that one of the best parts of Origin was always Nine commentator Phil Gould giving his dramatic monologue right on the cusp of kickoff, with sweeping cinematic camerawork as the former NSW coach talked about heart and spirit and Origin; and guts and bravery, and Origin; and mateship, and putting your body on the line, and of course, Origin. Gould has sadly long since retired that pregame monologue, but sports minister Anika Wells has resurrected a version of her own, filmed on the Parliament House front lawn. It\u2019s very on-point and startlingly true to Gould\u2019s tradition (now we\u2019re just waiting for the minister to announce some long-awaited progress and federal funding for NRL Island). We\u2019re hoping her Queenslanders don\u2019t wrap up the series tonight. PM Anthony Albanese has already ribbed the gallery for scheduling the Midwinter Ball on the same night as the decisive footy clash, so we\u2019re expecting a lot of phones quietly playing the game under tables tonight. The Albanese government has announced it will start real-time reporting of all deaths in custody. Thirty-two years after the royal commission into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody, 540 Indigenous people have died while incarcerated. The attorney general Mark Dreyfus said real-time reporting of deaths will bring additional transparency and accountability. The government has launched a \u201cdashboard\u201d to provide up-to-date information on all deaths occurring in police and prison custody as well as in youth detention. The dashboard will be monitored by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC). From the statement: The new real-time deaths in custody dashboard provides aggregate information on all deaths in custody at the national level. Information is provided on custody type (police or prison), Indigenous status (including unknown), and sex and age group of the deceased. The dashboard provides preliminary data. The AIC will continue to provide verified information on deaths in custody on a quarterly and annual basis. Information included on the dashboard is supplied to the AIC by state and territory police and prison authorities through death notification forms and the dashboard is updated as the information is received. The real-time deaths in custody dashboard will be available on the AIC Website at 9am, Wednesday 21 June 2023 (AEST). Lambie says Greens need to start \u2018putting a roof over people\u2019s heads\u2019 Labor has said that the Housing Australia future fund is one part of its plan to address housing, but not the only one, so no, I don\u2019t think Jacqui Lambie is breaking any confidences there. Lambie finished the interview with a message to the Greens (this is also not a new message from Lambie but it is a little more refined) Just get this money and start spending and get those houses built. Goodness. We need those houses started now. It really floored me with the Greens that sit there and put their credentials down to you know \u2018that they\u2019re the best social people out there. They help the most vulnerable\u2019. Well if this is helping the most vulnerable, well, blow me blimey bloody over this morning. You are not helping anyone but yourselves. This has got nothing to do with politics. This has got to do with putting a roof over people\u2019s heads. Get on with it. The interview moves to housing and Jacqui Lambie says she doesn\u2019t think there will be a double dissolution election over it (the government made it clear after the Senate decision to delay the bill to 16 October it considered the bill to have failed for the first time \u2013 the first step in a double dissolution trigger) but she is also very uncomfortable with the delay itself. Every day you delay this is every day that we have more kids sleeping out in the cars with their parents. And I can tell you I\u2019m sitting in Canberra now. It\u2019s bloody freezing, and Tasmania is just as bad. This is a starting point. And if there are hiccups along the way, you know, I\u2019m sure the government will work alongside that. They\u2019ve just put another $2bn into it. They will \u2013 I honestly believe the prime minister and I hope this is not breaking confidentiality with my meetings with him \u2013 there\u2019s things to be worked out along the way or we need to add more we can see that there\u2019s, you know, see that we can plug gaps along the way Lambie agrees with calls to have Iraq invasion decision referred to ICC Jacqui Lambie says she also agrees with calls to have the leaders of the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2013 the leaders of the UK, the US and Australia when the decision was made to invade Iraq \u2013 also referred to the international criminal court. Beyond that, she says Australia has never really examined its role in that decision. I absolutely agree with and when you go in to Iraq, and you say you have a reason to do that \u2026 when you work out three years later that the reason that they were using was not there at all, then we have a massive problem here and you continue to stay in a war that you probably should never have been involved in the first place because you didn\u2019t have that information correct. Then you have a problem. And quite frankly, politicians when they send us into war, they should be accountable as well. What really bothers me more than anything \u2026 We still have not got a committee up and running, to look at what happened in the last 20 years to fully investigate this and come up with their own conclusions in this country, because we\u2019re too bloody scared. Jacqui Lambie speaks about referring Australia\u2019s ADF command to ICC on RN breakfast Independent senator Jacqui Lambie is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on ABC RN Breakfast about her referral of Australia\u2019s senior ADF command to the international criminal court that she announced yesterday. If Australia \u2013 and both governments we\u2019ve seen it from the Liberal party and now from the Labor party \u2013 if they\u2019re not prepared to go in and look at senior command \u2026 I\u2019m going to force them to. Because you are not going to chuck all these diggers under the bus and not [front] up. Lambie says she expects the ICC to make inquiries to Australia about whether it has included senior command in its investigations. The ICC has to decide to investigate \u2013 a referral does not mean an investigation. What was not covered in that interview is one of the biggest news stories of the year \u2013 Fantales are to be discontinued. We may never know the PM\u2019s thoughts on the matter now. History will forever be bereft of these details. Albanese promises footy and beers with Triple M Sydney hosts Anthony Albanese gets a Taylor Swift \u201cshake it off\u201d intro and launches straight in to telling how he is a bit tired because \u201cI got up early and watched the last hour of that amazing cricket\u201d. \u201cI was sitting there in the dark, in the jammies at the Lodge.\u201d He\u2019d like to give himself a holiday he says, because he is tired. We move on to the State of Origin. Not enough Rabbitohs in the team apparently. He says that Annastacia Palaszczuk is not confident because Queensland does better when they\u2019re the underdog. True. But he neglects to mention that is just because Queensland has more heart. It\u2019s just a fact. But he won\u2019t be watching the game because of the press gallery Midwinter Ball. They say sometimes that politicians are out of touch and I understand why they sometimes say that \u2013 but the media, the media guys, the press gallery ball is on tonight. It\u2019s for charity but they put it on tonight. \u2026 Could have been last week, could have been next week. Could have been any time. They then play a clip of Albanese promising to take the hosts on a pub crawl around Balmain. That\u2019s another in a growing list of promises the prime minister has made (and kept) for FM radio hosts \u2013 he went to Kyle Sandilands\u2019 wedding and had Perth FM breakfast hosts over to the Lodge for dinner. Now it\u2019s footy and beers with Triple M Sydney hosts. The interview ends and we hear Roam by the B-52s Albanese to speak on Triple M Sydney soon Anthony Albanese is continuing his FM radio strategy \u2013 he\u2019ll be on FM radio Triple M Sydney very soon. It\u2019s a strategy Bill Shorten started as opposition leader and Albanese has perfected. He\u2019ll be speaking to Mick and MG this morning because it is Origin tonight. We\u2019ve just heard White Wedding and Pearl Jam\u2019s Last Kiss so it\u2019s not as bad as it could be. Tomorrow is the last sitting day in parliament For a moment I was excited and thought it was the winter solstice (the shortest day of the year) but alas that is tomorrow. Which is also the last sitting day ahead of the winter break. If you were wondering why the parliament seems more unhinged than usual lately, this is why \u2013 it\u2019s the last chance to get things on the agenda until the end of next month. Thank you to Martin for getting us started on what is another below-freezing start to a Canberra sitting day. This little Queenslander is not impressed. The MPs are up and about ahead of the second-last sitting day for about six weeks. It\u2019s also the Midwinter Ball tonight, so there will be a lot more people hanging around than usual. As Martin said, the main issue inside the parliament is the ongoing housing fight between Labor and the Greens. It\u2019s between Labor and the Greens because once again, the Coalition dealt themselves out very early. Paul Karp and Josh Butler will keep you informed on the Canberra happenings and you\u2019ve got Amy Remeikis on the blog. Ready? It\u2019s at least a four-coffee day. And a few hot-water bottles. And maybe cake for breakfast. Warmed. Let\u2019s get into it. As rents rise across the country, Labor\u2019s signature policy to ease the rental crisis \u2013 the $10bn Housing Australia future fund \u2013 has stalled in the Senate as the Greens demand more concessions. To pass the bill, they are calling for up to $2.5bn of direct spending on housing and extra funds to incentivise the states to freeze rents. Amid the worsening standoff between Labor and the Greens, chief political correspondent Paul Karp looks at the fight over renters\u2019 rights and whether it could spell the end of the government\u2019s housing bill. Listen here: Looks like the PM was up early this morning, judging by this 4am tweet \u2026 Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the news day. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ve got a few overnight headlines for you on what promises to be another fast-moving day in Canberra. Amy Remiekis will then be along to guide you through the day. The Albanese government has asked the solicitor general for advice about having another attempt to pass the Housing Australia future fund bill amid a continued standoff with the Greens about the legislation. The move could lead to a double dissolution election if the Greens reject the bill again. They want to see more progress on help for renters while the government accused them playing \u201cjuvenile\u201d games. More on this coming up, including our Full Story podcast today. The defence department has stopped providing details about the use of taxpayer-funded VIP jets to the nation\u2019s independent expenses watchdog, leaving it unable to recover funds from the offices of MPs who use it to ferry electorate staff and family across the country. The lack of transparency means we can\u2019t scrutinise how politicians are using the expensive planes, our freedom of information expert, Christopher Knaus, reports. Three-quarters of Australians believe it is likely China will become a military threat to Australia in the next two decades but a majority say Australia should remain neutral in the event of a conflict between China and the United States. The 2023 Lowy Institute poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 Australians in March on a range of issues, also found that 82% of Australians see an alliance with the US as \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cfairly important\u201d, down five points from a record high last year."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26014", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/21/roman-holiday-review-theatre-royal-bath", "primaryCategory": "stage", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Roman Holiday review \u2013 movie magic gets lost in translation", "lead": "Despite charismatic performances and real chemistry, the classic Audrey Hepburn romcom falters in its transition into a Cole Porter jukebox musical", "author": "Emma John", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:38:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225263", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f21aeff820c92307dbd6caa2827d3261b4777808/0_240_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "Jeremy Sams\u2019 production of Roman Holiday opens in Bath the same week that Prince Harry\u2019s phone hacking trial is being heard in the high court, and some material could come straight from a witness statement. \u201cShe\u2019s fair game,\u201d photographer Irving tells his journalist partner Joe: \u201cIt\u2019s always open season on princesses\u201d. It\u2019s one of the lines that has travelled best from the screen to the stage \u2013 and across the 70 years since Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck established their memorable chemistry in the original film. Paul Blake\u2019s version \u2013 first seen in 2001, reworked in 2017 and receiving its UK premiere here \u2013 fashions the script into a jukebox musical with Cole Porter songs, the best known of which are aggressively telegraphed in the overture to reassure audiences they\u2019ll recognise them. Rebecca Collingwood plays Anne, a royal heiress trapped by duty and protocol on her visit to Italy. (When she longs to taste authentic spaghetti and meatballs, her countess aunt tells her the chef will make some when they get home to the palace.) She escapes her gilded cage into the arms of Joe, who grudgingly takes her back to his apartment only to discover that the scoop of his career is now in his bed, wearing his pyjamas.

The famous Vespa ride around the city fares particularly poorly on stage, although Francis O\u2019Connor\u2019s design provides much-needed continental vibes to a show whose American songbook feel leaves it short on Italian flavouring. There are charismatic performances, including Adrian Der Gregorian\u2019s wonderfully comic Irving and Tania Mathurin\u2019s flamboyant Francesca. Alongside a talented ensemble, Michael D Xavier\u2019s voice soars in the role of Joe. His chemistry with Collingwood blossoms in the second half and their climactic kiss is the moment that the story makes the most sense as a musical. But the need to crowbar in Porter\u2019s bigger hits slows the story into a parade of lovelorn wistfulness, one that ultimately undercuts the movie\u2019s celebrated ending.

I was with a friend who had never heard of it, and so a couple of hours later we were playing it on the Switch in a pub, honking and flapping and making life difficult for any human unfortunate enough to cross our path. The sheer physical comedy of the game \u2013 the goose\u2019s waddling gait, the appalled reactions of the villagers, the mischievous glee of running away from a gardener with a trowel in my beak and throwing it into the pond \u2013 is delightful. If anything, it\u2019s even funnier now, because you can play with two geese (one of you can run interference while the other steals sandwiches). When people talk about funny video games, they often mention Monkey Island or Sam and Max \u2013 games with quippy writing and witty characters, wordplay, and self-referential puzzle design. But those games have only rarely made me laugh; an appreciative smile, sure, but never an involuntary hoot of amusement like those Untitled Goose Game embarrassingly elicits. Perhaps my comedy tastes lean more slapstick, but it\u2019s always the games with dumb physics or amusing controls or absurd set-ups that crack me up \u2013 games where the experience of play itself is what\u2019s funny. Octodad is a game I recommend to everyone, because it\u2019s one of only a few that have reduced me to a helpless, breathless puddle of mirth. It\u2019s about an octopus trying to masquerade as a human father, and you have to stuff yourself into a suit and use your wibbly tentacles to try and do normal things like navigate the supermarket with your kids, sending groceries flying everywhere. I ended up crying with laughter, forced to pass the pad over to my equally helpless friend until I regained enough composure to try again. Often it is the presence of other people that tips a game from amusing to hilarious. The Nintendo series WarioWare barrages you with 10-second mini-games, and the element of the unexpected makes it extremely funny \u2013 one second you\u2019re plucking someone\u2019s nose hair, the next you\u2019re trying to get two fish to smooch. But I was taken by surprise when I played the Switch version with friends in multiplayer mode and we were all swiftly incapacitated by uncontrollable laughter. The beloved multiplayer game Overcooked has the same effect: your own incompetence, and that of your fellow players, amps up the amusement. Comedy often results from the unexpected interplay between yourself and a game. For all its other strengths, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also a work of comic genius, because it gives you all the tools you could possibly need to entertainingly humiliate yourself. The first time I played it at Nintendo\u2019s Frankfurt headquarters a few months ago, I spent 15 minutes painstakingly constructing a flamethrowing car and then immediately set it (and myself) on fire as soon as I started to drive it, which made both me and my poor demonstrator instantly collapse in giggles. \u201cThe comedic timing in this game is unmatched. Every clip I see is like Wile E Coyote Simulator 2023,\u201d observed the Verge\u2019s Tristan Cooper, commenting on a clip of someone accidentally smashing their own wagon\u2019s chassis instead of turning on the fan to power it, its four wheels tumbling sadly one by one to the ground. I\u2019m not one for torturing Koroks intentionally, but I did once accidentally send one yeeting off a mountain by attaching it to a rocket-powered sled and giving it a good whack. Link fell off immediately, but the Korok went soaring into the distance and then off a cliff with a forlorn \u201coof\u201d. The guilt only slightly tempered my amusement. All this is to say that. despite the exquisite brain-pleasing comic writing of something like Portal, or the clever self-referential humour of stick-man western comedy West of Loathing, or indeed the surreal postmodern gags of Jazzpunk, I have probably laughed more at the parping noises of Trombone Champ. Maybe I am simple. What to play Despite a lifelong affection for Japanese games, Final Fantasy remains one of my embarrassing blind spots \u2013 I have only ever played the boyband road trip adventure that was XV, when I was massively pregnant and wanted to do nothing but eat ice cream and play video games on the couch. I can\u2019t say too much here for fear of breaching embargo agreements, but Final Fantasy XVI is out this week, and veers into more Game of Thrones-style semi-realistic fantasy. If you\u2019re a devotee of the series you\u2019ll already have made up your mind, but if you\u2019re wavering, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that our reviewer doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a stinker.

Why it\u2019s worth rediscovering the joy of joysticks Cormac McCarthy gave post-apocalyptic video games their flavour Question Block This week\u2019s question comes from reader Emma: \u201cHow can I tell which genre a game is? What\u2019s the difference between a first-person shooter and a first-person RPG? What about roguelikes, roguelites and soulslikes?\u201d Gamers love to argue over genres. We also love coming up with absolutely terrible names for them. (Metroidvania, anyone?) Loads of first-person games have guns in them, but are not first-person shooters. Soulslike is bad enough \u2013 I would call \u2019em try-and-dies \u2013 but the very worst game genre term, in my opinion, is immersive sims. This refers to games such as Deus Ex and Dishonored, where you inhabit a character and have the freedom to approach the game however you like \u2013 but to me it sounds as if it ought to apply to a cockpit flight simulator. Anyway! It\u2019s often hard to tell what genre a game is from a trailer, and sometimes even if you\u2019re told what it is, it doesn\u2019t make much sense. (I still, if pressed, couldn\u2019t tell you definitively what the difference is between a roguelike and a roguelite.) My advice is: a) don\u2019t worry about it too much; b) to check a game\u2019s Steam page to see what genre the developer thinks it is; and c) read this guide that Keith wrote to esoteric genre classifications, from looter-shooter to masocore.

Videos of chefs making stir-fried rocks are the latest trend on Chinese social media. Some show chefs frying up pebbles with garlic and chilli at busy night markets, while others depict bucolic scenes of villagers cooking freshly fished stones on a riverbank. However it is made, the dish, known as suodiu (suck and discard) is having a resurgence, at least in videos of people pranking unsuspecting friends. While some online chefs insist that it\u2019s a delicious dish, other videos show unsuspecting diners spitting out the stones in horror. One video with nearly 800,000 views shows a chef offering up a portion of suodiu for 16 yuan (\u00a31.74), which some said was expensive considering that the ingredients can be reused. The dish is said to date back hundreds of years, when boatmen in the landlocked province of Hubei would run out of animals and vegetables while travelling along the Yangtze River, and so turned to minerals. Unsurprisingly, according to one history of the dish, it faded in popularity after economic development and motorised vessels came to Hubei, reducing the chances of boatmen being stranded without supplies. The dish is also linked to the Tujia people, an ethnic minority who originate from the Wuling mountain range that straddles the borders of Hubei, Hunan and Guizhou.

The searches by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) came up empty-handed but would continue, the coastguard said. Search crews have heard banging sounds at 30-minute intervals, according to US media. The coastguard did not state the nature or extent of the sounds, or how they were picked up. Authorities are scrambling to find the Titan, which went missing on Sunday during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. Officials estimated the five people onboard had about 24 hours of breathable air left. What do we know about the search operation? The US Coast Guard, US Navy and Canadian Coast Guard are coordinating the search with input from OceanGate, the submersible\u2019s operator. Deep Energy, a pipe-laying vessel with underwater capabilities, and Polar Prince, the vessel the Titan launched from, are on the scene. Other craft, including a Canadian vessel with a mobile decompression chamber and the French research ship Atalante, which has an underwater robot that can descend to 4,000 metres, are en route. Biden calls Chinese president Xi a \u2018dictator\u2019 a day after Blinken visit aimed at easing tensions The US president, Joe Biden, has called the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, a dictator and said Xi was very embarrassed when a Chinese balloon was blown off course over the US earlier this year. Biden made the remarks one day after the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, met Xi on a trip to China that was aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. \u201cThe reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two box cars full of spy equipment in it was he didn\u2019t know it was there,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser in California yesterday. \u201cThat\u2019s a great embarrassment for dictators. When they didn\u2019t know what happened. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be going where it was. It was blown off course,\u201d Biden added. A suspected Chinese spy balloon flew over US airspace in February. That incident and exchanges of visits by US and Taiwanese officials have recently magnified US-China tensions. What has been agreed between the two countries? Blinken and Xi agreed in their Monday meeting to stabilize the intense rivalry between Washington and Beijing so it did not veer into conflict but failed to produce any breakthrough during a rare visit to China by the secretary of state. They did agree to continue diplomatic engagement with more visits by US officials in the coming weeks and months. Biden said later on Tuesday that the US climate envoy, John Kerry, may go to China soon. Drones intercepted en route to Moscow, Russia says Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said. \u201cDebris was found, no damage or casualties,\u201d Vorobyov said, adding that the drones fell near the village of Kalininets. Russia\u2019s channels on the Telegram messaging app, including one with links to the security services, said at least one more drone was intercepted near the village of Lukino. The country\u2019s Tass news agency has reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, that another drone was shot down near Lukino village in Moscow region, according to Reuters. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. It was not immediately known who launched the drones. In May, drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow, in what Russia said was a Ukrainian attack and one politician called the most dangerous attack on the capital since the second world war. What has Ukraine said about the drone attacks? Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. What else is happening? The UK has backed $3bn of World Bank loan guarantees to shore up Ukraine\u2019s economic stability, the government announced today. The government is calling the support \u201cthe first bilateral package of multi-year fiscal assistance to be set out by a G7 country\u201d.

Stat of the day: gas stoves emit benzene levels 10 to 25 times higher than that from electric coil stoves, US study finds Using a gas stove can raise indoor concentrations of benzene, a cancer-linked chemical, to above what is found in secondhand smoking or even beyond levels found next to oil and gas facilities, a study has found. The research, which measured benzene levels in 87 homes in California and Colorado, found that gas and propane stoves frequently emitted benzene at rates well above healthy benchmarks set by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Leaving a single gas hob on for 45 minutes raised benzene levels to above that found in secondhand tobacco smoking, or at the boundary of oil and gas plants, with emissions 10 to 25 times higher than those from electric coil stoves. Don\u2019t miss this: how I found joy in life without children of my own Some people know they do not want to have children, writes Lucy Handley, but I always did. During my 30s, I was ashamed not to have met someone I wanted to have a family with and felt embarrassed when colleagues asked if I had kids. For a long time, I carried this feeling of shame around with me like a ball and chain. When the UK, where I live, went into lockdown in March 2020, that hope was fading. I sought help from David Edmonds, a life coach who encouraged me to ask myself different questions from those I was stuck on. The first one he suggested was deceivingly simple: \u201cHow might I have a great life beyond having kids?\u201d At first I resisted, because asking this meant accepting that it might not happen. But eventually, I started to engage: who would I be if I didn\u2019t become a mother, and how could I feel fulfilled? The future finally held some possibilities, and slowly I decided to start opening up to them. Climate check: groundbreaking youth-led climate trial comes to an end in Montana A groundbreaking climate trial came to an early close yesterday as lawyers on each side presented a very different picture of who could be held responsible for the climate crisis. Attorneys representing the lawsuit\u2019s young challengers said Montana officials and agencies must be held accountable for exacerbating the crisis, and thereby violating the plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional rights. But the defense argued that the climate crisis was a global problem, and that if Montana was contributing to it, plaintiffs should work to change that through the legislature. The trial for Held v Montana began in the state\u2019s first judicial district court in the capital city of Helena last week, marking the first constitutional climate trial in US history. A ruling will now follow from Judge Kathy Seeley, who has been hearing the case, expected in the next few weeks. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

As might be expected for a musician, producer and entrepreneur with more than 14 million followers on Instagram, the A-list count in the audience was high. Guests included Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna and her partner, A$AP Rocky, Zendaya, Lewis Hamilton, Kelly Rowland, Tyler, the Creator and Kim Kardashian. Some stayed after the show for the performance by Jay-Z. Williams joined him on stage for the 2003 song Frontin\u2019. Williams was announced as creative director of Louis Vuitton menswear in February. It was a surprise to the industry after the British designers Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose had been tipped to take the role. Tuesday\u2019s show, however, explained why Williams works. This went beyond a fashion show \u2013 it was a celebrity showcase, a gig and a party, with clothes thrown in for good measure. \u201cIt\u2019s the convergence between entertainment and fashion, and mass appeal and luxury,\u201d says Osman Ahmed, the fashion features director at i-D magazine, who was at the show. \u201cI think it is going to be one of those moments when we look back and [see it] as a turning point.\u201d The catwalk show was a mixture of maximalist logo-fuelled design \u2013 a fuzzy, full-length coat with LV logos (the collections used both real and faux fur) or a football-style shirt with Louis Vuitton crest \u2013 smart tailoring and lots of bags. A high point \u2013 and possibly a first for fashion \u2013 was a Jeep convertible driven down the catwalk stacked with luggage. The \u201cLV is for Lovers\u201d slogan referred to Williams\u2019s home state Virginia and its tagline \u201cVirginia is for lovers\u201d. The creative director took a bow wearing a suit in a pixelated camouflage print, which matched that worn by his four children in the front row. Williams\u2019 appointment \u2013 over a trained designer \u2013 has been a talking point since it was announced. But, says Chris Black, the co-host of the style and pop culture podcast How Long Gone, Williams has cultural capital. \u201cIn today\u2019s age, the creative director job is more about vibe and vision,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate to say it, but I think that the product is almost the least important, or it\u2019s at least the third or fourth most important [thing].\u201d Crucially, Williams has experience working with fashion brands. He has collaborated with Adidas since 2014, his own brand Billionaire Boys Club began in 2005, and Humanrace, a skincare brand, was launched in 2020. He has previously worked with Louis Vuitton. In 2008, he collaborated with the then-creative director Marc Jacobs on a pair of bestselling sunglasses called Millionaires. The appointment follows the death of the previous creative director in 2021. Abloh, a friend of Williams, showed a new interpretation of luxury, drawing on references including pop culture, hip-hop and anti-racist activism. Williams has said he will continue his predecessor\u2019s work, bringing Black experience to a house with its roots in what has traditionally been a very white elite. The release of the first ad campaign \u2013 starring a pregnant Rihanna \u2013 was part of that. Speaking to the New York Times, he said \u201cWhat I love about this is, it\u2019s the biggest fashion house in the world, and that is a Black woman with child.\u201d The fact that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, along with a host of Black American stars, also attended his debut show demonstrated Williams\u2019s clout, and the influence that Black culture has on the world. Writing in the New York Times, Jon Caramanica speculated that Williams at Louis Vuitton could be \u201ca full-throated acknowledgment of the power of Black cultural capital on a global stage\u201d. \u201cThis was not just a catwalk show,\u201d agrees Ahmed. \u201cIt was the entire centre of Paris closing for a fashion show. It was Beyonc\u00e9 in the middle of a world tour showing up, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky arriving halfway through. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal, because you realise how much power is involved in that. Cultural power, financial power, fashion power, artistic power. I think that we\u2019re going to see aftershocks in the industry for years to come.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2601a", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/pwc-tax-scandal-firm-engaged-in-a-calculated-breach-of-trust-senate-committee-finds", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "PwC tax scandal: firm engaged in a \u2018calculated\u2019 breach of trust, Senate committee finds", "lead": "Consulting firm used confidential government information to help private clients avoid tax, interim report tabled in parliament finds", "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:06:23", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225370", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fb7e44b509deb828d230cd782013695730825cbe/0_105_5987_3594/500.jpg", "body": "Consulting firm PwC engaged in a \u201ccalculated\u201d breach of trust by using confidential information to help its clients avoid tax and engaged in a \u201cdeliberate cover-up\u201d over many years, a Senate committee has found. PwC should be \u201copen and honest\u201d by promptly publishing the names and details of its partners and staff involved, the finance and public administration committee has recommended. In a unanimous report, tabled on Wednesday, the committee also recommended that PwC cooperate with investigations by the Australian federal police and Tax Practitioner Board, which deregistered its former head of international tax, Peter Collins. The Greens will continue to push for harsher punishments, including calling on the Albanese government to cancel all PwC\u2019s contracts and for the cancellation of PwC\u2019s registration as a tax agent for two years. The committee chair, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, told the Senate PwC had engaged in an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of trust after Collins \u201cwas given the privilege of being part of a consultation process on new legislation being proposed to deal with multinational tax avoidance\u201d. The report found that Collins \u201cintentionally shared confidential information obtained through Treasury consultations with PwC partners and personnel in Australia and overseas\u201d, seeking to assist clients avoid new tax laws and putting at risk $180m of revenue.

The report found that the Tax Agent Services Act required PwC to report Collins\u2019 breach of confidentiality to the Tax Practitioner Board. \u201cHowever, PwC chose not to do so, in breach of its legal obligations.\u201d \u201cTaken together, the committee concludes that PwC engaged in a deliberate strategy over many years to cover up the breach of confidentiality and the plan by PwC personnel to monetise it.\u201d The report noted so far PwC has stood down nine unnamed partners, and has publicly named four former partners as having received confidential information: Peter Collins, Michael Bersten, Neil Fuller and Paul McNab. The report said PwC had given the committee a list of 63 names of staff without \u201cany indication of the extent to which each of the 63 named individuals were involved in the breach of confidentiality and the plan to monetise that information\u201d. However, the committee decided not to reveal these names to avoid creating a \u201cpool of evidence inadmissible in court by dint of it being covered by parliamentary privilege\u201d, and out of \u201cprocedural fairness in relation to naming everyone who appears on an email distribution list\u201d although they may not have been involved. The Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill told the Senate that prior to the report she had received reports from whistleblowers in PwC \u201cfrightened to speak up because they\u2019re being intimidated\u201d. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock said PwC \u201cmust move beyond a simple \u2018fall guy\u2019 strategy\u201d. \u201cIt is untenable for the government to keep doing business with an entity that conducts itself like this,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe Greens are calling on the government to cancel PwC\u2019s registration as a tax agent [for two years] and will be introducing an amendment to do exactly this. The government must also enact an immediate ban on contracts with PwC.\u201d Pocock said the evidence to the committee \u201cshows an internal culture at PwC so poor that it has lost the capacity to act honestly\u201d. \u201cThe evidence also creates a strong argument for breaking the link between political donations and big consultancies.\u201d PwC said in a statement: \u201cWe thank the Senate for its important work and we acknowledge today\u2019s interim report. We will carefully consider its contents and await the government\u2019s response. \u201cWe have taken swift steps to improve the governance, culture and accountability within the firm, and we will not hesitate to take all appropriate actions necessary to re-earn the trust of our stakeholders.\u201d In May, PwC Australia\u2019s acting chief executive, Kristin Stubbins, apologised to the community, the Australian government, its clients and its 10,000 staff for \u201cbetraying the trust placed in us\u201d. Stubbins acknowledged the firm \u201cdid not have adequate processes and governance in place\u201d, and had a culture in its tax business that \u201cboth allowed inappropriate behaviour and has not, until now, always properly held our leaders and those involved to account\u201d."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd2601b", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/donald-trump-conservatives-fbi-jail-biden", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The right believes the FBI is obsessed with jailing Trump.

Conservatives accused Joe Biden of using the justice system to prosecute his main political rival and attempting to \u201csteal\u201d the 2024 election. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, promised to \u201chold this brazen weaponization of power accountable\u201d. In short, the right wants us to believe that Biden and his administration will stop at nothing to put Trump in jail as quickly as possible. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Worried about just this type of accusation, the justice department under Merrick Garland and the FBI have approached their investigations of Trump much too cautiously. Far from being persecuted because of who he is, Trump\u2019s status as a former president and as the unofficial leader of the Republican party have led to him being handled with vastly more deference than anyone else would be. The result has been a series of delays and missteps which may allow Trump to escape accountability once again. It is now nearly 18 months since the government first recovered classified material from Mar-a-Lago in early 2022. Although the justice department concluded shortly afterwards that Trump likely possessed further sensitive material, it took seven months for Mar-a-Lago to be searched, in part because the FBI feared that the move would open the agency to accusations of partisanship. Trump was then only indicted nearly a year later. After his initial arraignment he remains a free man, released without having to post bail \u2013 despite credible concerns he may still have additional classified material in his possession. Compare that timeline to the events surrounding the arrest of intelligence contractor Reality Winner, who in 2017 received a five-year prison sentence for leaking one document to the news website the Intercept. The document Winner leaked was written on 5 May 2017 and she was arrested on 3 June, days before the Intercept even had a chance to publish its article about her leak. She was indicted on 8 June and jailed pending her trial. Winner later pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act \u2013 precisely the law that it seemed clear Trump had flouted for over a year before he was indicted. Trump has likewise been slow to face consequences in the federal investigation into his actions leading up to the insurrection at the US Capitol. According to a new report by the Washington Post, the justice department and FBI delayed launching a probe into Trump\u2019s push to overturn the 2020 election for 15 months, again because of fears that they would be criticized for partisanship. The agencies instead pursued cases against rank-and-file insurrectionists, ignoring the existence of evidence implicating Trump and his inner circle until media and political pressure forced them to begin taking it seriously. These delays matter because they make it possible \u2013 even likely \u2013 that Trump will never truly face accountability for his actions. Trump\u2019s trial in the documents case is unlikely to be held before the 2024 presidential election and the same is true for any possible charges in the January 6 case. If Trump wins the election and becomes president again \u2013 as current polls suggest he will \u2013 then he will have multiple tools at his disposal to derail the trials or even pardon himself. Justice delayed will be justice denied. Efforts by the justice department and other agencies to appear non-partisan have been well-intended but outdated. The modern conservative movement will give the Biden administration and the law enforcement agencies little credit for proceeding so slowly and deliberately. Instead, the justice system\u2019s extreme deference to conservative complaints will only encourage the Maga movement to double down. If federal law enforcement can be so easily scared away from enforcing the law without fear or favor, we can expect more hysteria and finger-pointing \u2013 even threats of violence \u2013 to follow in the future. These events also set a catastrophic precedent. The sitting president\u2019s immunity from prosecution and the political barriers to impeachment leave criminal proceedings after a president leaves office as the last available means of imposing accountability. If law enforcement agencies are too scared to investigate prominent politicians promptly and effectively, even that opportunity will vanish and presidents will be left with virtually no checks on their behavior. But worst of all is the fact that if Trump gets off the hook and re-enters office, the independence and integrity of the justice department and FBI are likely to be destroyed anyway. He has made it clear that he would seek to weaponize law enforcement agencies against his political opponents, including by forcing the justice department to follow his personal and political vendettas. Trump himself represents a unique threat to the rule of law and the independence of American law enforcement, one which must be confronted with appropriate but aggressive tools. Sadly, thanks to years of misplaced appeasement, it might already be too late. Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University.

You may notice that the election is still 17 months away. This was the earliest endorsement in the AFL-CIO\u2019s history, amounting to an all-in bet by organized labor that the interests of the Democratic president are identical to its own. The problem with this is not so much that labor might have decided to endorse a Republican \u2013 whoever that party\u2019s candidate is, they are sure to despise the concept of working-class empowerment \u2013 but rather the fact that the endorsement is an implicit acceptance of the status quo. These union leaders believe that the Biden White House as currently constituted is the best they can hope to get. Indeed, they are overjoyed by what they have gotten already. It is this lack of ambition that is the labor movement\u2019s biggest flaw. They have been beaten down for so long that they have lost their ability to believe that the world they deserve will ever be real. This is a sort of trauma, induced by a decades-long decline in union power. By settling for what they have, unfortunately, they have forsaken their leverage to ask for more. At his speech accepting the endorsement, Biden declared himself \u201cthe most pro-union president in American history\u201d. That may be a bit much \u2013 a few generations ago, even Republican presidents supported unions, so the standards were much higher \u2013 but it is certainly true that Biden is the most pro-union president of the past half century. He signed a $36bn bill to save union pensions; his Covid relief and infrastructure bills were boons to union workers; his nominee for NLRB general counsel has been tirelessly pushing invaluable labor law reforms; and he has, to a degree not seen before in my lifetime, used his bully pulpit to speak out in favor of union drives, in ways that Clinton or Obama never would have. The AFL-CIO feels that its voice is being listened to in the White House more than they can ever recall. On the other hand, the single biggest labor issue of Biden\u2019s first term was the potential national rail strike, which he dealt with by crushing the workers\u2019 right to strike and imposing a contract on them that they didn\u2019t want. But hey, what\u2019s the occasional knife in the back between friends? Seventy-one percent of Americans say they approve of labor unions. Only 40% of Americans say they approve of Joe Biden. Unions are more popular than the president, by a long mile. In fact, the popularity of organized labor is at a 60-year high. This is due not to the AFL-CIO, nor to the White House, but to a realization that swept working people across the nation as the Covid pandemic paralyzed society: your job does not care if you live or die. Your boss will not save you from disaster. There is no safety net, except for unions. That\u2019s it. The wave of interest in labor organizing that has swept through coffee shops, warehouses and college campuses is fueled by a widening, bone-deep understanding that solidarity is the only shield against capitalism\u2019s scorching rays. I can attest, from years spent traveling America as a labor reporter, that this grassroots enthusiasm is real. It is the job of the labor movement\u2019s institutions to turn that enthusiasm into the maximum possible gain. That\u2019s where the malfunction is. We have an army ready to fight the class war led by generals who have been trained to assume that it is unwinnable. Unions do not have to endorse the Biden agenda. Unions can set the agenda. Now is not the time to settle. Now is the time to demand. The labor market is strong, the appetite for unions is high and the discontent with inequality is everywhere. This is a time to push the president, not bow and scrape and thank him for what he has done. Working people are begging to become a part of a strong labor movement. If the AFL-CIO and its unions could find within themselves the ambition to take advantage of current conditions to organize 10 or 20 million new union members, they could quite literally reverse the post-Reagan inequality crisis. Labor\u2019s early endorsement of Biden is meant to enable unions to start mobilizing their political operation now \u2013 but that mobilization is also their leverage. They could demand that Biden commit to federal funding for union organizing and to abolishing the filibuster so that the labor law reforms of the PRO Act might actually have a chance to pass, rather than just serving as a campaign slogan. In short, they could make the building of the labor movement itself their central political demand. Biden will be out of power in a few years, but a labor movement with 10 million new union members would transform the entire American political landscape for decades to come. Instead of taking this tack, the AFL-CIO has committed to organize only a paltry 100,000 new union members a year (which would ensure the continuing decline of union density) and handed its support to Biden in exchange for the gifts he has already given. It is not a strategy that will ever be mistaken for a master class in boldly seizing the initiative. History\u2019s greatest labor leaders have not been conservative pragmatists in search of marginal gain. They have been people whose outrage over the injustices of the present fueled them to accomplish things that others dismissed as unrealistic. Too much time spent inside of existing institutions seems to extinguish this spirit. The next generation of working-class heroes is out in the world right now \u2013 working. It will be up to them to force the labor movement to thrive in spite of itself, long after the \u201cmost pro-union president in history\u201d is gone.

In an appearance on Fox, the television and radio host Sean Hannity gave his viewers a similar warning: \u201cThis would be a direct hit politically on conservative talk radio in particular, which is what most people go to AM radio to listen to.\u201d Mark Levin, another longtime radio host, agreed: \u201cThey finally figured out how to attack conservative talk radio,\u201d he told his listeners in April. What are they all so worried about? It turns out, a minor manufacturing change announced by car companies including Volkswagen and Mazda: they will be removing AM radios from their forthcoming fleets of electric vehicles, citing technical issues. Tesla, BMW, Audi and Volvo have already dispensed with AM in their electric cars, because AM\u2019s already unpolished reception is subject to even more buzz, crackling and interference when installed near an electric motor. While some manufacturers have found workarounds for the interference, others appear to have decided that it\u2019s not worth the engineering expense. Many on the right have been quick to declare the move political sabotage. The Texas senator Ted Cruz, while promoting a federal bill that would require automakers to install AM radios in new cars, claimed he smelled something fishy: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason big car companies were open to taking down AM radio \u2026 let\u2019s be clear: big business doesn\u2019t like things that are overwhelmingly conservative.\u201d AM is the oldest commercial radio technology in the US. In the 1920s, when AM was all there was, listeners would gather around neighborhood and living room radio sets to hear everything from music to boxing matches, soap operas and presidential speeches. They would listen through AM\u2019s constant (if now somewhat nostalgic) hum. By mid-century, music was king on the radio as many dramatic programs shifted over to the new medium of television. And in the 1960s, the comparatively crystal clear FM band overtook AM as the band of choice. Many music stations deserted AM, leaving it floundering in lo-fi isolation and struggling to secure advertising dollars, until it found its salvation in talk radio. Initially there was a wide variety of political perspectives on AM but the deregulation of content and consolidation of ownership of radio during the 1980s edged many minority voices and local owners off the air. Following the model of the nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show, conservative talk became the cost-effective default for the risk-averse corporations that now dominated the radio dial. The humble AM band played a starring role in the rise of social conservatism in the US and was a precursor to outlets like Fox News. These days, AM radio is somewhat synonymous in the public imagination with conservative blowhards, a place where false claims about the 2020 election, racist notions of a \u201cgreat replacement\u201d and other conspiracy theories fester and escape into the atmosphere without accountability. Far-right programming is not only ubiquitous, it\u2019s monotonous \u2013 with a few national radio chains syndicating the same handful of shows to \u201clocal\u201d stations, many of which have almost no local content. In cities and towns across the country, listeners hear much of the same one-sided, syndicated programming. But the idea that AM radio is made up of nothing more than conservative talk is a myth that has dangerous implications for the medium. It is true that conservatives and far-right pundits have claimed near dominion on talk radio \u2013 a medium that still ranks nearly neck-and-neck with social media for how Americans get their news. Seventeen of the top 20 most-listened-to US talk radio hosts are conservative, while only one is liberal. But that\u2019s not the whole story: while syndicated rightwing voices are the best platformed on AM radio, what is less known is that the band is home to many of the country\u2019s increasingly rare local stations and non-English-language radio shows. And ownership of AM radio stations is more diverse than that of FM stations: according to a 2021 FCC report, 13% of commercial AM stations were majority-owned by a Black, Hispanic or Asian American broadcaster; on the FM band, that figure was only 7%. Often lacking the financial and political resources available to chain-owned conservative talk stations, it is these local and diverse voices \u2013 not nationally syndicated conservative talkers like Sean Hannity and Mark Levin \u2013 that are likely to be the hardest hit by any changes to the band. \u201cAM is, generally, the least expensive route to a broadcast station ownership,\u201d says Jim Winston, president and CEO of the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (Nabob), a trade organization serving Black- and minority-owned radio stations. And though the 1980s and 1990s saw a decrease in local and minority ownership, Winston says a disproportionate number of the stations he works with today are on the AM dial. \u201cThere are many communities where the only Black-owned station is an AM station,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Black owners, for the most part, are local owners.\u201d In cities across the country, AM stations remain a crucial resource for those who are rarely served by other media. Detroit\u2019s WNZK, known as the \u201cstation of nations\u201d, runs a variety of non-English and English language programming for the area\u2019s immigrant communities. In Chicago, WNVR broadcasts in Polish, and many AM stations in California and New York run talk and music programs in Vietnamese and Chinese. The time-tested technology of AM radio has also given the medium a particularly important role in small towns and rural areas. \u201cOut here, it does serve a very distinct purpose, because AM frequency travels very differently from FM,\u201d says Austin Roof, general manager at KSDP in Sand Point, Alaska, on the Aleutian Islands. AM is better than FM at getting through mountains and other barriers. Plus, Roof says, \u201conce AM hits water, it just carries really well\u201d. For a radio station serving island residents and those who work on the area\u2019s fishing boats, that value can\u2019t be overstated. \u201cOne kilowatt of AM can outperform thousands of kilowatts of FM in our environment.\u201d Satellite internet has only recently become available in much of KSDP\u2019s coverage area, and the region\u2019s geography means that even the few local newspapers have limited distribution. So radio stations like KSDP \u2013 which serves an area nearly twice the size of Massachusetts \u2013 can be a lifeline. In recent years, as the islands have experienced some of their largest earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis, the radio has played a crucial role in spreading emergency alerts and instructions. (Between emergency updates after a 2021 earthquake, station staff played songs like AC/DC\u2019s You Shook Me All Night Long and the Surfaris\u2019 Wipe Out.) \u201cYour cellphone can lose its charge,\u201d says Winston of Nabob, \u201cYou could be \u2026 out someplace where your cellphone signal is not being picked up.\u201d But radio, he says, is ubiquitous, and it\u2019s very important \u201cthat people be able to receive radio when they can\u2019t receive anything else\u201d. AM stations are not just of value during emergencies: in small towns and rural areas across the country, AM stations are a rare tool for civic engagement, especially with the decline in local newspapers. Roof says KSDP\u2019s most popular broadcasts are those that listeners can\u2019t find anywhere else: \u201cLocal, state news, local meetings, sports,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s the hyper-local content that matters.\u201d The story is similar on the Yakama Reservation in Washington state, where the program director Reggie George says the hyperlocal AM station KYNR broadcasts public service announcements and coverage of local events such as government meetings and powwows, in addition to a steady playlist of both oldies and Native American music. When a technical snag or bad weather temporarily silences the station, residents react. \u201cWe get calls right away when we go off the air,\u201d says George, one of two paid staff at KYNR. Many AM stations have tried to prepare for an uncertain future by meeting their listeners on other platforms, such as FM simulcasts, podcasts and web streams. Alaska\u2019s KSDP has managed to get its content simulcast on one full-power and three low-power FM signals that serve nearby towns, and on a well-utilized online audio stream. But finding the money to stay afloat while supporting those other platforms hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cWe\u2019ve begged, borrowed and stolen for hardware,\u201d Roof says. Roof personally climbs the radio tower to replace equipment and touch up paint, has taken pay cuts, and has opted out of company healthcare to keep more money in the station. But other hyperlocal AM stations haven\u2019t had the budget to make the expansion. To some in the radio industry, the removal of AM radios from electric vehicles feels like a death sentence for their already struggling medium. Others are less worried. \u201cI think a lot of these places that are really benefiting from AM \u2026 are not where electric cars are really going to serve up the most benefits,\u201d says Roof. In his part of the country, there\u2019s no infrastructure to support EVs yet, and not many people can afford a Tesla or a BMW. \u201cIf you think someone in Sand Point, Alaska, is getting an electric car any time in the near future, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cIs getting rid of [AM radio] in electric vehicles going to do away with it? Absolutely not.\u201d There remains a lurking sense, however, that the removal of AM from EVs is a symptom of a larger shift away from the AM band. And if other changes come to pass, it will probably be the local, diverse stations \u2013 the unlauded heroes of AM \u2013 that are at greatest risk, not the well-resourced nationally syndicated conservative talk hosts who dominate talk radio. \u201cThose voices are not going to be shut down, no matter what happens with AM radio,\u201d says Winston. If AM radio does become harder to access, he says, \u201cthere are serious casualties.\u201d Katie Thornton is a freelance print and audio journalist.

The 2013 \u201c#RISE for the Ashes\u201d campaign featured Alastair Cook and Charlotte Edwards, admittedly on separate posters, with the same squiggly orange flames as the backdrop. The following summer, with Waitrose on board as the new \u00a33m sponsor of men\u2019s and women\u2019s Test cricket, a TV advert showed Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson and Katherine Brunt shopping in what purported to be their local supermarket, while Jonathan Agnew commentated on their choice of groceries. What did both campaigns have in common? Women\u2019s cricket was present, but only as an afterthought. Sky promoted the 2013 Women\u2019s Ashes using the tagline: \u201cOne Down, One to go: See if the women\u2019s team can secure our second Ashes victory of the summer.\u201d The Waitrose ad was an unmitigated disaster, with Anderson and Broad failing to acknowledge Brunt while Agnew\u2019s voiceover ignored her presence completely. For all the recognition she got, she might as well have been a random extra who had wandered in off the streets to do her shopping wearing an England shirt. Fortunately for the ECB, the advert was swiftly pulled from the airwaves because of controversy over Agnew\u2019s involvement. Ten years later, the marketing looks a little different. The award-winning \u201cAshes, Two Ashes\u201d campaign centres on a 30-second TV advert with split-screen images, flitting between footage and commentary from the women\u2019s and men\u2019s games, and concludes with the slogan: \u201cThe only thing better than an Ashes series? Two.\u201d Two weeks ago, images of the England captains \u2013 Heather Knight and Ben Stokes \u2013 were projected side by side on Tower Bridge. It\u2019s worlds away from Brunt playing Supermarket Sweep by herself and it\u2019s working. Almost 75,000 tickets have been sold for the Women\u2019s Ashes; the ODI at Taunton is sold out, 16,000 tickets have been sold for the Edgbaston T20I and another 13,000 for the five days of the Trent Bridge Test. It appears someone at the ECB has finally woken up and realised that if you want people to show up to watch the England Women\u2019s team play, it helps to act like they may be some people\u2019s first choice. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge mindset shift internally,\u201d says Beth Barrett-Wild, director of the women\u2019s professional game at the ECB. \u201cIt\u2019s about demonstrating the value we are placing on these fixtures, recognising that we think people would want to come and shifting perceptions about England Women\u2019s cricket in the process.\u201d The ECB\u2019s planning for the dual-Ashes summer, she says, started early, with a meeting in March 2022. \u201cIt was after the first season of the Hundred. There had been this swell of engagement and we all said the same: \u20182023 is our big year.\u2019 It was a case of sitting down and going: \u2018How do we make the most of this?\u2019\u201d \u201cHistorically, England Women\u2019s internationals haven\u2019t been at the top of the list of matches we\u2019ve scheduled and it\u2019s usually been left fairly late. Doing it early and alongside the men was a very conscious decision, to make sure that this Ashes summer was very much seen as a men\u2019s and women\u2019s Ashes season combined.\u201d The result of that early conversation was twofold: for the first time, the dates and venues for the 2023 women\u2019s and men\u2019s fixtures were announced concurrently (in September 2022). Meanwhile, the venues and schedule for the Women\u2019s Ashes reflected a new ambition for women\u2019s cricket \u2013 evening matches at Lord\u2019s, the Oval, and Edgbaston, a Sunday ODI at the Rose Bowl and a five-day Test at Trent Bridge. \u201cThe key part was starting with the fan,\u201d Barrett-Wild says. \u201cI was looking back at the 2019 women\u2019s Ashes schedule and we started on a Tuesday with an ODI at Leicester, followed by another ODI at Leicester on the Thursday. That is not a fan-centric schedule. With all the marketing in the world, that\u2019s never going to generate massive attendances. It\u2019s recognising how much the women\u2019s game has shifted since that moment and making sure we\u2019re doing a proper service to it this summer.\u201d Barrett-Wild doesn\u2019t say so, but it is clear she\u2019s been one of the driving forces behind this culture shift at the ECB. Since October 2018, she has headed up the women\u2019s Hundred, which she says \u201cblew the lid off everything that we thought about where the women\u2019s game was\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve always known women\u2019s cricket has got this potential, if you just invest in it then it will work, but this is a massive proof of concept. It shows people will watch women\u2019s cricket if you present it at scale, market it and give it that visibility. It would have taken many, many years to get to that stage if we\u2019d carried on as we were.\u201d Barrett-Wild is ensuring the ideas she and her team incubated in the Hundred \u2013 equal marketing budgets; playing women\u2019s matches at the biggest grounds \u2013 permeate out into the rest of the ECB. Last week, the ECB released the major match venues for 2025-31: England Women will play at Lord\u2019s in each of the seven years during this period, with the Oval, Edgbaston, Headingley, Old Trafford, Trent Bridge and the Rose Bowl hosting the team at least four times. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested heavily into the professionalisation of the women\u2019s game on the field. Now it\u2019s a case of: \u2018Right, we need to catch up in terms of what we are doing to support this team off the field,\u2019\u201d she says. Are there concerns this may be a one-off, given the scale and visibility of the Ashes compared with other women\u2019s bilateral series? \u201cOur objective is to create a blueprint which will enable exponential growth in attendances in future years. Sales for the Sri Lanka series [in September] aren\u2019t as high as the Ashes sales but they are significantly up on where they normally would be.\u201d As someone who understands the recent growth of women\u2019s sport \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want cricket to be left behind, I\u2019m a very competitive person\u201d \u2013 Barrett-Wild already has her sights firmly set on 2026 when England host the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. \u201cThat will be our Women\u2019s Euros moment,\u201d she says. Before then, though, there\u2019s an Ashes series to focus on, one that will be enjoyed live by a record number of fans. and follow the instructions. \u2022 This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

Councils from Sunderland to Norfolk, Cardiff to Hounslow want their residents to do it. Many primary schools have been asking students to do it for ages. And now a growing number of high street outlets, including Greggs, Costa Coffee and Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies, want to make it easy to do it, wherever you are. Happily, lots of people in Britain are way ahead of them and are doing it already \u2013 carrying a refillable water bottle, that is. Whether for reasons of economy, hygiene, an urge to keep hydrated or a concern for the environment, for many people filling up a water bottle before they step out the door is now as habitual as picking up their keys or wallet. In 2015, just 20% of people in the UK used a refillable water bottle, according to the anti-disposables campaign Refill. That figure is now almost 60%, they say. Topping up a bottle from a tap, once seen as the preserve of the stingy or abstemious, is also big business, with the refillable bottle market in Europe worth \u00a31.5bn a year, a figure expected to grow by almost 40% by 2028. The challenge, say activists, is to encourage people to do so, and cut down on the 10m single use water bottles bought every day in the UK, 700,000 of which are discarded as litter. Working alongside more than 80 councils, and with a growing network of high street chains onboard, the Refill app showcases a network of 32,000 places across the UK \u2013 from municipal fountains to big chains to pubs to independent shops or businesses \u2013 where people can top up their bottles for free, no questions asked. \u201cWe did some initial consumer research to understand why we were buying so much bottled water in Britain, especially given that we have some of the best-quality tap water in the world,\u201d says Jo Morley, the head of campaigns at environmental group City to Sea, which runs the Refill campaign. \u201cAnd we found out that back then [in 2015], it just was not possible to fill a bottle. \u201cI remember commuting to London and filling up my bottle in pub toilets. It just wasn\u2019t the done thing to ask. And actually, that\u2019s what came out in our research, that we Brits were just too polite. We didn\u2019t like to ask for something for free.\u201d Their push to destigmatise and raise awareness is being embraced by a growing number of local authorities. Last Friday, Manchester city council and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority pledged to become \u201crefill destinations\u201d, opening up their buildings to provide more places where people can fill up water bottles for free. Sunderland, Southend, Norfolk, Waltham Forest, Hounslow and Cardiff have also signed up, says the organisation. It is not just about litter, although Bournemouth city council has said its introduction of 150 free refill taps last year reduced waste on its beach by 19,000 bottles in July alone. In a warming British climate, easy access to clean, free water is also an issue of social justice and public health. The mayor of London, too, has installed 110 new water fountains across the City and an additional 28 at ZSL London zoo. Some find the habit of carrying water easier than others, according to Jo Travers, a nutritionist based in London, who says younger generations are more attuned to the need to keep hydrated, and potentially attracted by the wide variety of designs now available. \u201cA water bottle is as an accessory, you can customise them and have whatever colour you like \u2013 these things do make a big difference to whether people want to carry a bottle of water around. But I definitely think that more of my younger clients understand about hydration \u2013 elderly people are often chronically dehydrated. There is definitely a bit of a generational divide.\u201d While the advice to drink two litres a day has been somewhat debunked, she acknowledges \u2013 it depends on body type and what else you are eating, for example \u2013 not drinking enough water can lead to sluggishness, constipation and difficulty regulating temperature. \u201cSo my general advice is to keep drinking. It\u2019s very, very rare, almost nonexistent, to feel worse after having a drink of water.\u201d For the manufacturer of Chilly\u2019s insulated bottles, however, the popularity of its collaborations with Liberty and Emma Bridgewater \u2013 not brands conspicuously targeted at Gen Z \u2013 shows that refillable bottles are not only for younger people, according to co-founder Tim Bouscarle. The brand, founded in 2010, was at one point the fastest-growing private company in Britain, with sales tripling over the three years to 2018; Bouscarle says it now sells \u201cmillions\u201d every year. \u201cOur company mission is to accelerate the adoption and everyday use of reusable products \u2013 and I do think that we have encouraged millions of people over the years in the UK to make a change to their daily habits.\u201d For Morley, the scale of behaviour change in Britain has been \u201creally phenomenal\u201d, though there is much further to go. \u201cIt used to be totally normal to carry a plastic water bottle around. Now there\u2019s a bit of a social stigma. For us, that was what we set out to do, to create that cultural shift.\u201d"}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26021", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/caribbean-british-millennials-windrush-generation", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "A bit Caribbean, a bit British.

With their passing, I lost my direct links to the Windrush generation, and the unrecorded stories and family histories they carried with them. As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first arrivals from the Caribbean in 1948, I am conscious of the scale of potential loss as more of the pioneers of this generation reach the end of their lives, and the void that creates for descendants like me. Where does all this loss leave us? The generations that came after Windrush, those of us with a foot in both camps, born in Britain but brought up with fading memories of sun-drenched islands, half-told stories from our elders and a sense of dual identity hanging somewhere between the two. For my generation \u2013 millennials \u2013 our parents, now in their 50s and 60s, were born here, too, or brought over when they were very young. Many of them have never been back. And now their parents are dying. Without them, the ones who made the brave journey towards a promised better life, there is a sense of something becoming untethered. It\u2019s a link that we cannot afford to lose. For me, the most pertinent question is one of responsibility. Is it on us to ensure that the legacies of the Windrush generation endure and move forward? And how can we do this with authenticity and honesty, even as those direct connections to the past diminish? There are times when I feel this individual responsibility keenly. I worry about a lack of tangible knowledge to pass on to future generations. So, I have learned to cook Jamaican food, dug through my dad\u2019s record collection in search of clues, visited Jamaica for the first time in my 30s, and made contact with more distant relatives on that side of my family. I have found so much joy in these unearthed cultural connections and shared stories, but I still wonder if they are enough. This quest feels particularly challenging because of the deep fractures in my dad\u2019s family. It was never an option for me to sit at my grandmother\u2019s feet and ask her for stories of home while she braided my hair. My dad was put into the care system when he was just a baby, and his parents never brought him home. They existed only in the peripheries of his life, and subsequently had minimal involvement in the lives of their grandchildren. My grandparents were both in their 80s by the time they passed, and they were practically strangers to me. I have maybe two or three hazy memories of them. I only know their faces from photos. I am not alone in grappling with a disjointed family history. So many families of Caribbean descent have been splintered due to the deep, intergenerational impacts of the hostile environment that made life unduly difficult for the migrants who arrived in the 50s, and still affects the prospects and quality of life of their descendants. There was also the prevalence of children being left behind while their parents settled in the UK, the \u201cbarrel children\u201d who were sent for at a later date, or never sent for at all. And there is the ongoing Windrush scandal, which tore families apart with threats of deportation and the harrowing experiences of people being barred from returning home after a holiday abroad. Some were even deported to countries they had not visited since early childhood. While I relish the opportunity for celebration that comes with Windrush Day, it is not lost on me that the very people being celebrated are still suffering at the hands of the state. The British government has recently been accused of \u201cfailing its citizens\u201d due to the \u201cbelittling and horrible\u201d process of the Windrush compensation scheme, set up in 2018 by the Home Office. The scheme has been marred by delays and controversies \u2013 in June last year, three in four claimants were still waiting for compensation. With so much of our present and immediate history mired in unresolved hurt, and the fact that there has been precious little accountability, it can feel hard to look forward. There is still so much injustice to be reckoned with and rectified. Perhaps then, the responsibility to the Windrush generation and their legacy should be collective, rather than individual. It was a shock to me to realise that, despite there being approximately 2,500 museums in Britain, there is no permanent building base that exclusively presents the stories of Windrush pioneers or their descendants. This is a crucial place to start. Dr Les Johnson is the founder and chair of a campaign to build a National Windrush Museum, and his work \u2013 alongside the newly formed Next Gen development council \u2013 is pushing back against the historical erasure of Windrush from Britain\u2019s collective memory. The immense contributions of the Windrush generation \u2013 including my grandparents \u2013 have not only shaped the fabric of British society but will have a radical impact on Britain\u2019s future, with the legacies of their revolutionary spirit. It is crucial that these stories aren\u2019t lost. On an individual level, I feel it is my responsibility to create a life for myself and future generations that celebrates this spirit, embedding their histories into a new identity of Black Britishness. This feels like the most authentic way to keep these narratives from disappearing.

Americans have $1.635tn in federal student loan debt, held by 43.8 million borrowers. Some 26 million people applied or were automatically accepted for student debt relief under Biden\u2019s plan before applications were suspended because of lawsuits launched by Republicans. That plan would provide student debt relief of up to $20,000 for eligible borrowers and up to $10,000 for borrowers with less than $125,000 in annual individual income. But Republicans pushed to prevent any further extensions of student loan payments and want to overturn Biden\u2019s plan that has now been tied up in the US courts since last year, with a US supreme court ruling on the issue expected very soon. Michael Chaney, a 56-year-old truck driver in Ohio, has student debt from a retraining program through the Ohio Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation that he went into after getting injured on the job while working in a foundry in the late 1990s. \u201cI had to take out student loans to help pay for the schooling, or else they wouldn\u2019t help me,\u201d said Chaney. He said his student debt increased due to having to repeat some math classes. Even after Chaney filed for bankruptcy in 2009 after getting divorced, his student debt wasn\u2019t able to be discharged. He worked in IT after finishing schooling but switched to truck driving to be able to work more hours. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can pay it. They\u2019ve got it set up so you can never pay it off,\u201d said Chaney, who still owes around $60,000 in student loans. \u201cI keep making $400 or $500 a month payments and none of the principal goes down. I worked all my life and I don\u2019t have nothing. I\u2019ve worked six days a week, 12-hour days in the steel mill before I got hurt. We\u2019re barely staying alive. I can\u2019t keep up. I can\u2019t pay it.\u201d The debt ceiling package negotiated between Biden and the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and signed into law in June 2023 ends the pause on federal student loan payments and interest. A spokesperson for the US Department of Education told the Guardian the department will be in contact with borrowers before repayments begin. Interest accrual on student debt is set to begin occurring again in September 2023 and the first payments are due in early October. For millions of Americans, restarting payments or even being able to keep up with payments, won\u2019t be financially possible. \u201cAdding another expense to my budget would put me beyond a financial hardship,\u201d said Anne Marie Mosley, a teacher in Massachusetts who is still waiting to see if her public loan service forgiveness application is approved. \u201cWhen payments restart, I will not pay. I\u2019m an underpaid teacher and I just won\u2019t have the funds,\u201d said Jacque Abron of Texas. Janelle Gallardo, a mother of three in California, started paying her student loans in 2016 when she completed her master\u2019s degree, with payments ranging from $200 to $500 a month. Under the student loan payment pause, she has struggled to keep up with the rising cost of living and currently works two jobs to make ends meet. \u201cI went from paying about $1,000 a month to now over $2,000 in groceries, I cannot even imagine paying another large bill like this,\u201d said Gallardo. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how we would make it work with resuming payments based on how much everything has gone up in my state. I have not been paying during the pause because all our money either goes to bills or taxes, we haven\u2019t even been able to afford health insurance right now.\u201d But Republicans have also pushed to add retroactive interest to student loans that did not accrue during the pause and revoke forgiven debt for over 250,000 borrowers who applied and were approved for public service loan forgiveness. Christina Winton of Phoenix, Arizona, has struggled with paying her student loans since graduating with her bachelor\u2019s degree and completing her master\u2019s degree program. She has filed for public service loan forgiveness, after having to obtain years of her bank statements because her loan service provider did not have records to prove she made the required 10 years of payments to be eligible. She explained student debt has affected her considerably over the years and despite keeping up with payments, through loan service providers changing rules and ballooning interest, she still owes more than she originally borrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying student loans for over 30 years. I\u2019m a first generation graduate, first in my family and maybe the last one. I have a 17-year-old and an 11-year-old. Neither of them will be able to attend school, I can\u2019t afford to pay for it, I\u2019m too busy trying to work, pay the bills, and pay these loans,\u201d said Winton. She added: \u201cOnce loans restart with interest starting again, the artificially high balance bill will have interest added again, causing a huge crisis.\u201d Debt relief advocates have pushed for broader student loan forgiveness and to expand borrower rights, such as making it easier to discharge student debt through bankruptcies. The NAACP has pushed for a minimum of $50,000 in student loan forgiveness and has warned about the negative impacts starting student loan repayments will have without any forgiveness plan enacted. A recent report by the Jain Family Institute found the student debt pause benefitted borrowers who were already going to pay their student loans back, while structural problems with student debt have created a system where the majority of borrowers have not and cannot pay back their student debt. Jim Mazey, 54, who lives in Ohio, said he had paid over $27,000 on an original student debt of $44,00, but over $18,000 of that went toward interest and he currently had 140 more monthly payments left. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree and certification to work as a purchasing manager, where he has worked for 29 years. When the pause ends, he fears being stuck with payments into retirement or the debt delaying his ability to retire. \u201cI will be 65 years of age before the loan is paid,\u201d said Mazey. \u201cLike most people we have, and always will be, living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d Even before the pause on federal student loan payments, the majority of borrowers were not making any payments, with just over 50% of borrowers not making any payments toward direct and FFEL loans in late 2019, according to Department of Education data. More than 4 million borrowers were paying zero payments while enrolled in income driven repayment plans. Audrey Fiscus of Arizona has struggled with student debt since graduating nursing school in 2006 as a single mother, who divorced her ex-husband at the time and went back to school while he struggled with a drug addiction. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying my student loans monthly for over 10 years, ranging from $450 to $510 a month,\u201d she said. Despite making regular payments for ten years, her $35,000 in student debt has ballooned to $82,000 since 2006. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll die with this debt,\u201d she added."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26023", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/what-do-women-really-want-a-mild-mannered-squishy-centred-man", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What do women really want?

According to a recent piece in Publishers Weekly, the male leads of romance novels aren\u2019t quite as hard as they used to be. The hot new industry trend is books featuring \u201csquishy-centred men\u201d AKA \u201csweet cinnamon roll heroes\u201d and \u201cgolden retrievers\u201d. Perhaps you\u2019re thinking that sounds \u2026 sticky? And sort of slobbery? Look, I don\u2019t know all the sordid details but I can assure you that in romance novel lingo a \u201ccinnamon roll\u201d means a sweet, supportive hero: a gentleman in the streets, who irons your sheets. That sort of thing. And a \u201cgolden retriever\u201d is an upbeat love interest with a floppy, friendly energy. The opposite, in other words, of an aggressive, domineering alpha such as Christian Grey from Fifty Shades of Grey. So does this represent some sort of monumental social shift? Are nice guys finally finishing first? I wouldn\u2019t read too much into one trend piece, but it does look as if there is a sizeable market out there for mild-mannered men. While that sounds like great character development to me, not everyone agrees. There is, you may have noticed, a cohort of rightwing culture warriors perpetually looking for an excuse to get offended, and it appears some of them read Publishers Weekly. The New York Post just put out a disgusted article about how woke women are flocking to novels featuring \u201csquishy-centred men\u201d. I\u2019ll give them their due: they didn\u2019t just type \u201cwoke\u201d a million times; they reached out to Fabio, the model who graced the cover of 1,300 romance novels in the 90s and who appeared in I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter! adverts, for comment. His comment? \u201cHogwash!\u201d The people who Publishers Weekly asked to comment were rather more nuanced in their feedback. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing changing views on identity and masculinity and consent in the larger population, and readers are looking for romance novels to reflect what they\u2019re seeing in the culture,\u201d one book editor told the trade publication. In other words, it\u2019s capitalism and free-market dynamics at work. I thought conservatives found that very sexy?

She\u2019d already done this once before, in 2001, at the age of 11, and had faced down all the uncertain feelings that arise when you\u2019re so young and walking into something so large. But this time, she first had to compete against her city co-champion and \u2026 Regis Philbin on Live With Regis &amp; Kelly. Regis! \u201cAre you ready to beat the boys?\u201d Philbin\u2019s co-host and Sur\u2019s on-air partner, Kelly Ripa, asked her on live television. The studio audience was looking on. Sur, all of 14 years old, said yes. \u201cAs if there was any question,\u201d Sur recalled. \u201cI\u2019m always ready for whatever the challenge is. I\u2019m not afraid of hard things.\u201d That feisty spirit comes through in Sur\u2019s subscription-based website the Juggernaut \u2013 which she founded in 2019 and publishes heady pieces that dust off a long-forgotten piece of history, or try to give nuance to a current topic. Did romantic kissing originate in India? How did cruises become south Asian getaways? These are the kinds of stories Sur\u2019s readers can count on. It\u2019s refreshing for a time when, according to a Pew Research study, 76% of US journalists are white. \u201cI think about that number all the time,\u201d Sur said. \u201cThose stats are so heart-wrenching and they\u2019re also why [the big publications] can\u2019t beat me. That kind of newsroom will never be able to tell the community\u2019s story as well as the Juggernaut can.\u201d Having grown up in the Bronx and Queens after immigrating with her parents to the US from India in 1990, Sur said she found no media outlets meant for south Asians of her generation. She rose through the stages of a supposedly traditionally successful life \u2013 first pursuing undergraduate studies at Yale, then two different consulting stints at McKinsey &amp; Company with an MBA at Harvard Business School thrown in between. The need for what the Juggernaut would become certainly was there all along. As she once told potential investors of the south Asian demographic: \u201cWe\u2019re half a trillion dollars in spending power in the US. We\u2019re 1.8 billion people in the world.\u201d A visitor to the Juggernaut today will find stories ranging from a look back at Steve Jobs\u2019s 1974 visit to India to badminton\u2019s history and comeback in the US. There\u2019s a review of season three of Indian Matchmaking and a profile of Gaurav Gupta \u2013 the favorite fashion designer of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion who made his long-awaited debut at the Paris haute couture week in 2023. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be south Asian to write for the Juggernaut, but you have to be able to dive deep and be curious,\u201d Sur said. It took Sur a while to scare up the courage to quit her job and secure proper backing. She made the Juggernaut her full-time job in 2019. Today she employs four full-time employees and has plans to expand the staff later this year \u2013 including a much-needed full-time engineer and several staff writers. According to Sur, if she stopped ramping up staff and spending on marketing, she would find herself in the black. But cutting down on investment would curtail the growth she\u2019s seen. While unwilling to share overall numbers, Sur said the Juggernaut counts the likes of Padma Lakshmi, comedian Hari Kondabolu and actors Freida Pinto and Poorna Jagannathan as subscribers. Back in 2020, funds were running low \u2013 $50,000 in the bank low. At the start of Covid-19 outbreak, Sur readily admits that the US government\u2019s paycheck protection program and subscription revenue helped keep the lights on before she could secure $1.2m in funding from Precursor Ventures and a syndicate of angel investors in October 2020 that keeps the business chugging along. \u201cWe had these ambitions to do TikTok more,\u201d Sur said. \u201cWe had ambitions to do more podcasts. I think in 2021 we had ambitions to do way more regular events.\u201d Instead of splurging on the extras that might have driven her out of business, Sur refocused her attention to the stories. She wanted to see what drew readers in \u2013 and more important, what didn\u2019t. While things like book reviews were nice to include, they simply didn\u2019t have the pull that true crime did. They had to go. The Juggernaut wasn\u2019t a vanity project. This was Sur\u2019s business. And it needed to deliver the content people wanted if it was going to work. \u201cI was like, pardon my French, \u2018Fuck this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna just go back to the core business. Yeah, we\u2019re gonna do less, but we\u2019re gonna make it awesome.\u201d Your initial infusion of $2m got a lot of press back in 2020. But how far did that really go? To the outside world, $2m seems like a lot because it\u2019s $2m, right? But one thing to remind people is I never got that $2m at one time. I got $800,000 in the summer of 2019. And then I got $1.2m in October 2020. You know, four plus four hours of sleep doesn\u2019t equal eight hours of sleep? What are your thoughts about your role with south Asian writers and representation \u2013 I actually don\u2019t like that word. I hate that word, too. I hate, hate, hate whenever I read an article where the angle is \u201crepresentation\u201d. Kill me now. Please stop. That should never be the angle. That\u2019s one of the reasons I started the Juggernaut, which is to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the second level?\u201d Representation isn\u2019t the end-all be-all. The end goal isn\u2019t representation. I think the end goal is showing how we are living our lives and noticing our histories and noticing stories in such a way that is respectful of each and all of our individual trajectories. When someone pitches me a story on south Asian musicians at Coachella, that story is not just about representation. It opens up 10 more questions: Why now? Why those artists? Do south Asians even attend Coachella? Who are the artists for? Does it even matter? The story is never just about representation. We always want to get to the second level at the Juggernaut. What was the most annoying thing about starting a small business? The paperwork! What\u2019s something that you found useful that other entrepreneurs might use? I did once hire a Vedic astrologist to look at the birth chart of my company. That was something? But seriously, something I\u2019m trying to get better at is firing myself from more functions and delegating more. So I\u2019m trying to move away from a digital to-do list \u2013 where your tasks can be endless \u2013 and bought a daily planner Moleskine where I limit myself to only the biggest, most important things. You can\u2019t go beyond the page, so limits are good! I\u2019m trying to get better at it. What is your ultimate goal for the Juggernaut? I\u2019d really love for stories that are important to our community not to be a footnote. I want the Juggernaut to be a household name. When there\u2019s a show happening, or when there\u2019s a story happening, I want people to say, \u201cWait, we should call those folks up and ask them to help us with the story or consult with us.\u201d I don\u2019t want to see just one show like Indian Matchmaking. I want to see 10 versions of what dating or arranged marriage looks like in our communities. I would love to start a studio like what the New York Times did and take [the weekly column] Modern Love and make it into a show. I really do look up to the New York Times a lot in terms of showing what is possible \u2013 through super-serving your audience. And I also look up to the Athletic a lot.

What do you think you would be doing if you weren\u2019t doing this? There are alternate universes, right?

Folk horror, like film noir, is a term that seems to have been first used by critics before film-makers themselves, but The Wicker Man is so much better and more distinctive than any film that comes under the folk-horror heading that it\u2019s virtually a one-movie genre in itself. It now appears billed as a \u201cfinal cut\u201d: a restoration complete with the footage that was excised when it was released as a B-picture support to Don\u2019t Look Now in 1973. It is a brilliant conspiracy-chiller set on May Day on a remote fictional island off the Scottish coast, ruled over by the haughty laird Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), whose inhabitants are devoted to sinister pagan observances to preserve the annual fruit harvest on which their economy depends. The Summerislanders are variously polite and insolent towards a thin-lipped young copper from the mainland who has been alerted to the disappearance of a teenage girl by an anonymous letter. This is the fiercely respectable Sgt Neil Howie, wonderfully played by Edward Woodward, a stickler for the Christian religion, saving himself for marriage to his demure fiancee, and outraged and yet also faintly excited by the sensual abandonment he sees around him. The film is a genuinely scary adventure in group psychopathology, carried off by director Robin Hardy with an inspired seriousness and density of imagined folkloric detail. It is all clearly inspired by Ira Levin at some level, but adapted by Anthony Shaffer from the 1967 novel Ritual by David Pinner, an actor-turned-writer who originally developed the story for Michael Winner and whose cop protagonist may owe something to a part that Pinner played in the West End: Sgt Trotter, from Agatha Christie\u2019s The Mousetrap. (Like TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land, incidentally, The Wicker Man is indebted to the images of death and rebirth from James Frazer\u2019s The Golden Bough.) Apart from everything else, The Wicker Man has the greatest pub-going-silent-when-a-stranger-comes-in scene in cinema history. The local hostelry The Green Man subsides into mutinous, hostile quiet at Sgt Howie\u2019s appearance and then, when the sneering landlord MacGregor (played by dancer and choreographer Lindsay Kemp) sends Sgt Howie up to his room accompanied by his comely daughter Willow (Britt Ekland), the drinkers erupt into an extraordinary smutty song accompanied by a gaggle of musicians. Every shot from this amazing sequence could be a prog album cover. The image of the local postmistress May Morrison (Irene Sunter) putting a frog into her daughter\u2019s mouth to cure her sore throat will never leave anyone who sees this film, and the same goes for the maypole song and the young woman Howie sees in the ruined churchyard, smiling blankly at him, breastfeeding a child while enigmatically holding an egg. The Wicker Man is often compared to movies that emerged at around the same time, such as Piers Haggard\u2019s The Blood on Satan\u2019s Claw in 1971 and Michael Reeves\u2019s Witchfinder General in 1968, although for me the element of pure folk ritual and mystery that is paramount in The Wicker Man isn\u2019t there, quite, in the others. The closer comparison is with Peter Watkins, particularly his docu-realist nightmare Punishment Park from 1971. In the end Sgt Howie meets his terrible destiny without quite appreciating the ironic parallel with the service of communion in which he solemnly partakes at the beginning: the blood and body of Christ. And it was only having watched this film again that a new thought struck me. The anonymous letter\u2019s author or authors addressed the missive to Howie by name: how exactly did they know about him and his situation in the first place? An informant in Howie\u2019s congregation? His fiancee perhaps? \u2022 The Wicker Man is screened as a one-night-only event on 21 June in cinemas."}, {"_id": "649409de51ac334b7fd26027", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/reproduction-by-louisa-hall-review-pregnancy-pain-and-frankenstein", "primaryCategory": "books", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Reproduction by Louisa Hall review \u2013 pregnancy, pain and Frankenstein ", "lead": "A visceral novel about Mary Shelley, the violence of procreation and our overheating planet", "author": "Lara Feigel", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 10:00:36", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:44:14.225605", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ea576f379343573080b7891651aa6f4e9514dcb7/0_192_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "Are pregnancy and childbirth the most or least natural things we do? At the heart of Louisa Hall\u2019s brainily visceral new novel is a reading of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein as a book whose uncanny energy is forged in the crucible of reproduction. Pregnant, nauseous, fearful of miscarriage, Hall\u2019s narrator fails in her attempt to write a novel about Shelley, in part because her insights about Shelley\u2019s masterpiece have become too turbulent and revelatory. \u201cHow could she,\u201d the narrator asks, \u201ca creature who never had a mother, have observed such physical changes with anything other than terror? What am I? she must have wondered. What kind of creature is this?\u201d Hall is best known for her ambitious AI novel Speak (2015), which intertwines letters, diaries and court transcripts across several centuries to tell the tragic story of the rise and fall of a generation of intelligent, human-seeming dolls. She has now turned her attention inward, in this short, intricate work of autofiction about pregnancy and childbirth. But the preoccupations of Speak are still here: a thread about IVF introduces questions about the relationship between scientific overreaching and \u201cnatural\u201d biology, darkened by an increasingly unnatural climate. Hall\u2019s narrator journeys through snowstorms from a happy, childless second marriage in New York to a new life in Montana dominated by pregnancy. There are three: the first results in an empty sac that has to be surgically removed; the second leads nauseously to an excruciatingly long live birth that the narrator experiences more as an act of destruction than creation, and results in haemorrhaging so severe that organs seem to be falling out of her body; the third is a molar pregnancy in which her body creates cancerous matter that kills the embryo \u2013 \u201cmy body, I realised, had eaten my child alive\u201d. In the midst of this bloody chaos, a beloved daughter is born, managing to suckle even while her mother bleeds away her insides. The whole process has been so alien that the baby seems to come from the moon: \u201cHer brow was a burrow. And when she opened her mouth to cry: the darkness within it was an estuary, and behind it a river that tunnelled deep into her planet\u2019s centre.\u201d Joyfully, the narrator joins her there, looking down from her new happiness on a faraway, troubled Earth. As the baby becomes a more earthly toddler, brave in the playground, the particular combinations of separateness and togetherness of this phase of motherhood are caught with moving understatement. Meanwhile, the narrator thinks about Shelley and avoids seeing her former friend Anna, whose efforts to have a baby alone by IVF provide an unnerving parallel with her own supposedly natural attempts at reproduction. Anna, a scientist genetically modifying mice embryos to make them Covid-resistant, goes through several punishing IVF cycles, until she has no more viable eggs and only a handful of substandard embryos. She has to decide whether to use her scientific skills on her own child. Increasingly desperate, she lectures the narrator on how inferior miscarriage is as a selection method. Doesn\u2019t she owe it to herself and her baby to select the best embryos before implanting them? The two women come apart in their separate pain. It\u2019s Shelley who shows the narrator how closely related these experiences are. The book\u2019s triumph is to reveal, brilliantly and with feeling, the uncanny peculiarity of pregnancy and childbirth, and to connect this to all that is unnatural and peculiar about our overheating planet, with pollution and global warming throwing hormones awry and overheating pregnant bodies. It\u2019s the tussle with Frankenstein that reveals how high the stakes are. The narrator\u2019s gradual revelation is that if Shelley created a brilliant novel about the tragedy and unnaturalness of creaturely reproduction out of the heat of her own reproductive experience, we need such a novel for our times. This must be a novel that is itself a creature \u2013 \u201cmade of disparate parts, flesh and bone, blood lost in a haemorrhage, stitched-together old skin\u201d \u2013 because the novel is in some sense always an act of reproductive technology. It is just this novel that Hall creates, out of the disparate parts of bodily experience and medical disaster, seen in the larger context of a world becoming too polluted for \u201cnatural\u201d life processes to flourish, which turns pregnancy into a political issue (the narrator is aware that the life-saving terminations she requires wouldn\u2019t be available in some states). Through all this, as Shelley did, she writes the body with poetic clarity and beauty. \u201cOur water,\u201d the narrator says as her waters break. \u201cNo. Our body, our blood. Everything inside us might break, blow, burn against the bounds of us, flood over our shores.\u201d This is life born of pain; life that may make us all into monsters of the kind Shelley incandescently brought into being. Hall\u2019s achievement is to make these bleak revelations triumphantly on the side of life. \u2022 Reproduction by Louisa Hall is published by Scribner (\u00a314.99).
