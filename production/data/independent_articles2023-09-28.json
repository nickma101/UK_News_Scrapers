It was by Guardiola\u2019s choice as his side exited the Carabao Cup at St James\u2019 Park. Haaland was held in reserve, a substitute in a sizeable Manchester City coat, not summoned when Newcastle scored or as the quadruple Guardiola has long insisted City could not win was rendered impossible before October arrives. Haaland, it transpired, was not the insurance policy if City needed him but, like Kyle Walker and Ruben Dias, he was just making up the numbers on the bench."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Guardiola never considered bringing him on. \u201cErling had a lot of minutes [in other games],\u201d he explained.

Haaland has changed City \u2013 without him, they might not be Champions League winners \u2013 but City have changed because of Haaland. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Because he scores so many goals, the profile of the supporting cast has changed: there are fewer alternative scorers. When Haaland had a watching brief at Newcastle, Julian Alvarez, who doubles up as his sidekick and his deputy, led the line. The Argentinian has proved prolific this season. Yet \u2013 and with the substantial caveats that these are early days and that several of a much-changed starting 11 have had bit-part roles \u2013 the only other man with a goal to his name this season was Nathan Ake. And, Alvarez apart, the Dutch defender may looked the second likeliest scorer on the teamsheet."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Oscar Bobb showcased his talent but has never scored a senior goal.

Take the top scorer out and someone else might leapfrog him on the leaderboard."}, {"type": "text", "text": "They were shared out differently last season. Haaland\u2019s 52 accounted for more than a third, even if that still left 99 other goals and five players with at least 10. But two of them \u2013 Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez \u2013 are now gone and a third, Kevin De Bruyne, is a long-term absentee. A fourth, Phil Foden, began on the bench. It left only Alvarez; in that context, Nick Pope\u2019s first-half save from the Argentinian may have been still more important."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And the goalscoring attacking midfielders and wingers are in shorter supply at City now. One summer signing, Matheus Nunes, came off the bench, but he scored once in 40 games for Wolves; it was scarcely a Gundogan-esque return. The August buy Jeremy Doku was another substitute Guardiola used, and he has a fine goal for City to his name already, but he struck fewer times in three seasons for Rennes than Mahrez did in his last year at the Etihad Stadium alone. In hindsight, there was a shift in tactics and responsibilities when Grealish arrived and, a year later, Raheem Sterling departed. The latter was Guardiola\u2019s most potent winger. City entered two Cup finals last season with Grealish and Bernardo Silva starting on the flanks and the more prolific Mahrez and Foden on the bench. In its own way, that was the Haaland effect."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now the team trying to win the title with a more equitable distribution of goals are Arsenal, under Guardiola\u2019s old assistant Mikel Arteta, and with the criticism they lack their version of Haaland. City can plot a path to 150 or so goals in all competitions but with the marked difference that one player makes a disproportionate contribution. If Haaland cannot play every game, perhaps it was not him they missed at Newcastle but De Bruyne. Yet if only one footballer has ever scored more in a season for Guardiola, the subsequent reliance on him coined a word, Messidependencia.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "A peculiar strokes gained picture developed throughout 2023 as Scheffler routinely separated himself from fellow elite players with his ball-striking: registering 2.615 strokes gained tee-to-green, 0.677 more than McIlroy and 1.051 more than Patrick Cantlay in third. His impressive play even drew comparisons to Tiger Woods\u2019 prime, with that particular statistic the second best since tracking began 20 years ago, behind Wood\u2019s 2006 season (2.98), according to Twenty First Group's Justin Ray."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And yet, despite an undeniably successful season that others can only dream of, Scheffler\u2019s putter has regularly betrayed him to somewhat dim his stardom. The world\u2019s best player was not outstanding with the short stick in 2023, neither was he just average. In fact at times Scheffler was dead last in the field. Scheffler would finish 151st out of 184 players for strokes gained putting (-0.301). It makes a major, five regular PGA Tour victories and $21m (\u00a317.3m) earned on the course last season alone somewhat disappointing given the advantage Scheffler has built over his rivals from tee to green."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Desperate to rectify the issue on this maddening journey, Scheffler has turned to English putting guru Phil Kenyon. Tommy Fleetwood, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Matt Fitzpatrick and Scheffler\u2019s compatriots Max Homa, who ranks sixth on the PGA Tour in strokes gained putting, and Brooks Koepka, are among those to have worked with Kenyon. The desired destination for Scheffler, should his ball striking remain consistent, poses a frightening prospect for his rivals and, more urgently, Team Europe."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Quite how quickly Scheffler find the promised land on the greens is still a mystery, though he is evidently in a hurry having already spent many hours at the practice area at Marco Simone this week. Tee pegs could be seen scattered around him, forming various gates to carve out a path from his backstroke to the hole. Together with Kenyon, the pair forensically analysed each putt\u2019s line, weight and contact."}, {"type": "text", "text": "\"We changed aspects of his set up to help him release the putter better,\" Kenyon remarked, having linked up with Scheffler following the Tour Championship."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Texan admits he is \u201cexcited\u201d by the changes and how Kenyon has validated his prior concerns: \u201cMy suspicions were answered, but I was trying to fix it in the complete wrong way. It's very simple."}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u201cThe way I move the putter through the ball, I was fighting the toe rising in the putter, so I would miss contact a bit in the heel. To try keep my putter head low, I would feel everything in my hands and lower my hands, but it would cause the toe of the putter to go higher and higher. The problem was getting worse and worse."}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u201cI couldn't figure it out. It was preventing me as many putts on line as I should. Now I feel I'm much more consistent hitting my start line. It's exciting. It's good to have a bit of direction, the second set of eyes from Phil was really helpful. Phil's been really helpful."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While former PGA Tour player and NBC Sports commentator Smylie Kaufman explained on X, formerly Twitter, was buoyed by Scheffler sharpening the fundamentals to his game.

Have a station to work on your fundamentals. Remove yourself from the station and reconfirm that the fundamentals are transferring on breaking putts.

The mercurial nature of Jordan Spieth and the furious debate surrounding Justin Thomas\u2019 inclusion as a wildcard pick, despite an alarming decline, underlines Zach Johnson\u2019s need for a pillar, despite the enviable depth to Team USA.

Doing nothing became a choice in itself."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Yet a game of two halves revolved around two of Howe\u2019s decisions: the first, to make 10 changes, left Newcastle needlessly weakened, silenced their crowd and produced a first-half display so anaemic they were fortunate to go in level as City dominated possession. The second was the right type of catalytic impact, injecting urgency and ambition, bringing St James\u2019 Park to life. Even if the decisive goal came from a combination of his starters, Joelinton setting up Alexander Isak, it would have felt impossible without the introductions of Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes. They created a shift in mood."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whether, in the longer term, it helps bring a shift in the balance of power between these clubs, between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabian projects, remains to be seen. But sooner or later, Newcastle required a statement result against City, even a depleted City. Isak, a statement signing, delivered one.

Their first-half performance had echoes of the approach Steve Bruce and Rafa Benitez would deploy against City, devoid of ambition, lacking the ball, seemingly waiting for defeat. Newcastle had no shot of any description for 40 minutes until, out of nothing, they had a golden chance, Isak releasing Murphy on the counterattack and Stefan Ortega making a fine save. Otherwise, City had looked the more dangerous, the full debutant Oscar Bobb twice releasing Julian Alvarez to shoot. Nick Pope made an excellent save: banned for last season\u2019s final against Manchester United, the goalkeeper was the one man to keep his place from Bramall Lane, and Newcastle could be relieved he did."}, {"type": "text", "text": "They had looked outclassed albeit that, without Haaland, City lacked a finisher and, with the left-back Sergio Gomez crowbarred into the team on the right wing, they did not have a full complement of creators."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But the warning signs were there and Howe acted. The callow pair of Hall and Lewis Miley departed, two full debuts curtailed after a chastening first half. Each may represent the future for Newcastle, but neither looked the present.

Miley had struggled to get on the ball, but it is rarely a problem for Guimaraes."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Newcastle seized the initiative. They had purpose and, soon, a goal. Joelinton powered into the penalty area and centred. Rico Lewis, perhaps unsure of his bearings, stepped over the ball, and Isak had the time to take a touch before finishing."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Thereafter, Isak later walked off gingerly; having lost Harvey Barnes for the much of the season, Newcastle could do without further injuries in attack.

So could Joelinton."}, {"type": "text", "text": "With Dummett and Lascelles becoming the first centre-back partnership to stop City from scoring this season, one verdict may be that Newcastle demonstrated their strength in depth.

And it makes for an ideal companion to the director\u2019s previous two films, Asteroid City and The French Dispatch. Written by Dahl in 1977, it concerns a wealthy, ineffectual man by the name of Henry (Benedict Cumberbatch). He discovers a notebook, written by a Dr Chatterjee (Dev Patel), that details his encounter with Imdad Khan (Ben Kingsley), otherwise known as \u201cThe Man Who Could See Without Using His Eyes\u201d. Many believe that Dahl wrote the story as a gentle rebuke to the critics who would chastise his macabre and cynical inclinations \u2013 Henry, at first, covets Khan\u2019s powers in order to improve his hand at cards. Yet, his greed isn\u2019t punished but absolved by a greater purpose."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Anderson\u2019s adaptation seems to conceal its own (conscious or subconscious) rebuke. For every sincere admirer of his work, now there is an Instagram filter or viral AI prompt ready to denigrate his craft.

Then, he introduces us to Henry, who introduces us to Dr Chatterjee, who, in turn, introduces us to Imdad."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Each of them tells their story, in the galloping clip of an explorer presenting their discovery.

He takes a short breath, and immediately continues on."}, {"type": "text", "text": "There\u2019s no illusion of reality here, no detachment from the storyteller and the story. In every single moment of The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, we are reminded that this is a product of human imagination, brought into being by human hands.

His actors (the short also features Richard Ayoade, as Dr Chatterjee\u2019s assistant) play multiple roles, working like a theatre troupe."}, {"type": "text", "text": "When Imdad\u2019s eyes are covered up in order to test his powers of sight, the bandage arrives pre-wrapped, popped on like a helmet. When he levitates, he simply rotates a small box, painted to blend into the scene\u2019s jungle backdrop, and sits on it. At other times, well-dressed stagehands silently emerge from the wings, as they rearrange props, pop open windows, and drag actors across the stage. Anderson even allows his shots to occasionally extend beyond the edges of his backdrops, so that his frames become littered with stage lights and wires. He wants us to see the artifice, so that when Dahl\u2019s simple but effective tale of seeing the world in unexpected ways concludes, we\u2019re reminded that fiction can often feel more true to us than life."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Dir: Wes Anderson.
