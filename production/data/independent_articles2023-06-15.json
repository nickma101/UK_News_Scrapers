Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA judge has said a stepfather who has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a nine-year-old boy is a \u201cbully\u201d who gained \u201cpleasure from inflicting pain and discomfort\u201d.Alfie Steele died in his home in Droitwich, Worcestershire in February 2021 after he was subjected to a cold bath as punishment, a jury heard. Dirk Howell was sentenced to life for murdering the young boy with a minimum term of 32 years, while Alfie\u2019s mother Carla Scott was sentenced to 27 years after being convicted of manslaughter and child cruelty. Mr Justice Wall said neither Scott nor Howell have \u201cshown any remorse\u201d for their actions. Addressing Scott, he said she is \u201ca woman who puts her need for male companionship above her duty to protect her children.\u201cIt is revealing that you have maintained your relationship with Howell after he killed your son. It is a sure sign that you approved his actions.\u201dRecommendedMother and stepfather guilty of killing boy, 9, \u2018dunked\u2019 in cold bath as punishmentNeighbours raised concerns months before killing of Alfie Steele, nineHow is the King connected to the farm schools where children suffered abuse?Howell slumped forward in the dock, with his right hand cupping his chin, as Mr Justice Wall told the 41-year-old: \u201cI am sure that you got pleasure from inflicting pain and discomfort.\u201cIn my judgment some of your actions can properly be described as sadistic.\u201cThe risks of killing him by your conduct were real and obvious.\u201dOn the day of his death, Alfie was found lifeless with a body temperature of 23C and may have been put back in a warm bath as the couple tried to pass off the murder as an accidental drowning, jurors at Coventry Crown Court heard. Scott rang 999 at 2.24pm and told the call handler that \u201cAlfie had fallen asleep in the bath\u201d.Howell was not at the house when officers arrived, with Scott later claiming to have found the boy \u201csubmerged\u201d and that he had previously \u201chit his head\u201d.Jurors also heard that Alfie had 50 injuries all over his body, with only a handful likely to be attributed to normal childhood bumps and scrapes.Alfie was found fatally collapsed at home in Droitwich, Worcestershire, in February 2021 (PA Media)Scott, 35, denied murdering her son and told her trial that she had not \u201cbelted\u201d Alfie, while her partner claimed to have attempted CPR to revive the schoolboy. Mr Justice Hall said: \u201cAlfie did not have the quiet death that you tried to portay: a death in which he had an epileptic fit and gently fell asleep in the bath. His death was violent and brutal.\u201dThe court heard that Alfie had \u201crefused\u201d to get in to the cold bath and \u201ccalled in vain for his grandfather to help him\u201d. The judge said that the child\u2019s refusal \u201csealed his fate\u201d and was \u201cstruck repeatedly\u201d and \u201cdunked\u201d in the water, In a victim impact statement read out in the court, his grandfather, Paul Scott, said: \u201cWhen I was told Alfie had passed away, I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. Since then, it has felt like a nightmare.\u201cWhen I close my eyes, I have thoughts of him screaming for me to save him. My life has been changed forever for the worst.\u201d Mother Carla Scott and stepfather Dirk Howell have both been convicted (West Mercia Police)Neighbours had raised concerns for months before Alfie was killed, with a safeguarding review now underway.In a 999 call made six months before he was killed, a neighbour told police: \u201cIt sounds like my neighbours are doing something bad to their kid in the bath.\u201cLike they are really hurting them. It sounds like someone thrashing around in the bathtub.\u201cIt sounds like you can hear he\u2019s being hit and held under the water or something ... and like loads of thrashing around.\u201dThe call was played to jurors, along with further audio of an emergency call in 2020 in which a concerned resident told the operator \u201csomething strange is going on\u201d.In another call, it was reported that a family known to police had \u201cgot a young lad outside\u201d and \u201chad him in the garden standing like a statue\u201d.Another piece of evidence put before the jury was a video filmed by a neighbour in August 2019, recording Alfie\u2019s voice as he pleaded to be allowed back into his home for around 25 minutes.Despite a social services plan barring Howell from staying overnight at her home to protect Alfie, Scott frequently flouted this rule and allowed Howell to stay over regularly, the CPS said.An NSPCC spokesperson said: \u201cThe suffering that Alfie Steele endured in the months before he died is heart-breaking; a cruel \u2018punishment\u2019 regime inflicted by Dirk Howell and Alfie\u2019s mother Carla Scott which culminated in his tragic death.\u201cIt\u2019s vital that a thorough review into the circumstances around Alfie\u2019s death establishes whether more could have been done by professionals to protect this little boy.\u201cThis is so important because such findings can help prevent future tragedies.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23a551ac33150be92903", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-report-privileges-committee-partygate-latest-b2358239.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boris Johnson report \u2013 latest: Ex-PM\u2019s honours list won\u2019t be axed despite finding that he \u2018misled\u2019 MPs", "lead": "<p>Despite scathing Privileges Committee report into Partygate, Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial honours list won\u2019t be axed Downing Street has said </p>", "author": "Alisha Rahaman Sarkar,Matt Mathers and Joe Middleton", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 14:34:48 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:43:49.791611", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T14:34:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/17/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715ClosePrivileges Committee finds Boris Johnson misled Parliament\nSign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

They concluded he should be barred from holding a pass to parliament.But Downing Street said it had no plans to scrap Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation list, in which he gave honours to allies embroiled in Partygate.\u201cWhen it comes to honours, that\u2019s a long-standing convention, the prime minister has abided by convention, that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesman said.Mr Johnson hit out at what he called a \u201cderanged conclusion\u201d, accusing the Tory-majority group of MPs, who he has repeatedly sought to disparage, of lying.

Rishi Sunak said there is \"lots of work to do\" to reduce asylum claim numbers as he joined immigration enforcement officers on a raid.Mr Sunak wore heavy boots and a stab vest as he joined officers on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning.It comes after he promised to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023.However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the \"current pace\".Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman\u2019s comments, Mr Sunak said: \"It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working.\"That\u2019s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration.\"And that\u2019s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work.\"It\u2019s not right, which is why we\u2019ve increased resources for immigration enforcement.\"We\u2019ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we\u2019ve doubled the number of arrests.\"He added: \"But we\u2019re not complacent.\"There\u2019s lots of work to do, which is why it\u2019s so important that we pass our Bill through Parliament, our Stop The Boats Bill, which will mean that if you come here illegally,

Read our\u00a0privacy notice A U.K. parliamentary committee on Thursday issued a damning report concluding that former Prime Minister Boris Johnson deliberately misled lawmakers over what he knew about multiple lockdown-flouting parties at his office and government buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic.Lawmakers voted in April 2022 for the seven-member panel to investigate Johnson's conduct over \u201cpartygate,\" a series of boozy gatherings attended by Johnson and his staff that broke rules and eventually contributed to his downfall. Here are the key points of the report:WHAT WAS THE COMMITTEE TASKED TO DO?The seven lawmakers \u2014 including four from Johnson's Conservatives and three from opposition parties \u2014 examined what Johnson told the House of Commons about gatherings in Downing Street in 2020 and 2021. RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from TrussIf a statement was misleading, the committee said it considered whether it was a \u201cgenuine error or was intentional or reckless,\" and whether the record was corrected in good time.The committee said the investigation \u201cgoes to the very heart of our democracy.\u201d \u201cMisleading the House is not a technical issue, but a matter of great importance,\u201d it said. WHAT GATHERINGS WERE THERE? The report detailed evidence of six gatherings that took place in government buildings at a time when Johnson frequently appeared on television urging people to stick to strict social distancing rules.The events included send-off parties for staff and a Christmas \u201cdrinks event with cheese and wine.\u201d Johnson attended some of them, including:\u2014 May 20, 2020: A gathering in the garden of Downing Street where alcohol was provided and staff were encouraged to \u201cbring your own booze!\u201d Johnson\u2019s private secretary had invited more than 200 people. \u2014 June 19, 2020: A gathering in the Cabinet Room to celebrate Johnson's birthday. A cake and alcohol were provided. Photos showed at least 17 other people were there. Johnson and others were later fined by police. WHAT DID JOHNSON SAY ABOUT THE EVENTS? Johnson told Parliament that COVID rules and guidance had been followed at all times at Downing Steet. He claimed he relied on \u201crepeated assurances\u201d from advisors that rules had not been broken. He also told lawmakers and the committee that he believed the events were \u201cessential\u201d for work purposes, namely to boost staff morale. WHAT DID THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDE?The committee concluded that as the \u201cmost prominent public promoter\u201d of the government's COVID rules and guidance, Johnson knew what wasn't allowed at the time, and knew about breaches of such rules at Downing Street. It was highly unlikely that he could have genuinely believed that rules were being followed, it said.It added he misled Parliament, and failed to tell lawmakers about his own knowledge of the rule-breaking gatherings. Johnson was \u201cdeliberately disingenuous when he tried to reinterpret his statements to the House to avoid their plain meaning,\" it said. \u201cWe came to the view that some of Mr Johnson\u2019s denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee and the House, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe conclude that Mr Johnson\u2019s conduct was deliberate and that he has committed a serious contempt of the House.\"The panel said Johnson committed a further serious contempt of Parliament for breaching confidentiality requirements in his resignation statement and attacking the panel with abusive language including \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and \u201cwitch hunts.\" It said his behavior amounted to \u201can attack on our democratic institutions.\u201d WHAT WERE THE RECOMMENDED SANCTIONS? The committee said Johnson should be suspended from the House of Commons for 90 days for repeated contempts and for seeking to undermine the parliamentary process. But Johnson avoided suspension when he quit last Friday as lawmaker, pre-empting the report\u2019s publication.RecommendedBoris Johnson\u2019s honours list won\u2019t be axed despite Partygate report findings \u2013\u00a0liveBoris Johnson has done what dog does against lamppost, says his former bossThe five lies that doomed Boris JohnsonThe panel also said he should be stripped of a former member\u2019s pass to Parliament's grounds.Lawmakers will vote Monday on whether they will uphold the committee's recommendations. Johnson's allies could yet propose amendments to lighten the proposed sanctions. And even if the sanctions are upheld, they would not bar Johnson from seeking to run again as a lawmaker in the future.

Repeating his earlier claim, in response to a question from Labour MP Catherine West, Mr Johnson said \u201cthe guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\u201d.Ms West asked whether there was another party in Downing Street, on November 13 2020, to which the then prime minister replied, \u201cno\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe European Union's ambition to lead the way on ecological issues avoided a major setback Thursday when the environment committee of the European Parliament voted by the thinnest margin to reject a proposal that would have killed a draft law on restoring nature and lost species across the continent.The 88-member committee cast 44 votes against the motion submitted by the conservative European People\u2019s Party and 44 in favor, leading to its defeat. Cheers and loud applause greeted the result announced by Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee chair Pascal Canfin in Strasbourg, France, but the future of the bill remains uncertain.The committee did not have time to finish voting on a long list of amendments or the text as a whole. Members plan to resume work on the legislation at the end of the month in Brussels, before the text can be adopted, or not, by the whole legislative assembly in July. \u201cThe conservatives are waging a crusade against the European Green Deal, the heart of European climate action,\u201d Michael Bloss, the climate policy spokesperson for the Greens in the EU Parliament, referring to a package of climate and environmental policies for getting the EU on track to a green transition. \u201cToday, we were able to prevent the conservatives from kicking the climate protection law into the bin.

Two other committees rejected it in May, but Thursday's vote was more crucial since it involved the lead committee for the legislation. \u201cVery happy of the defeat of the right and extreme right today,\u201d environment committee chair Canfin said. \u201cThey wanted to kill the nature restoration law, they failed!\u201dAs part of its plan to become climate neutral by 2050, the European Union has adopted a wide range of measures, from reducing energy consumption to sharply cutting transportation emissions and reforming the EU\u2019s trading system for greenhouse gases.But with the next European Parliament elections set for 2024, some leaders and lawmakers are concerned about antagonizing workers with binding legislation and restrictive requirements. The main opposition to the nature restoration law was led by the European People\u2019s Party, the Parliament's largest group. It asked the European Commission to withdraw the proposal, then withdrew from the negotiations, arguing the law would threaten agriculture and undermine food security in Europe.EPP lawmakers claim that abandoning farmland would lead to an increase in food prices, more imports and drive farmers out of businesses.Environmental organizations and a coalition of big companies insist the legislation is crucial to tackle both climate change and nature loss.RecommendedHow Europe is leading the world in the push to regulate AISilvio Berlusconi, Italy's tarnished 3-time premier, dies at 86European leaders hope to restore stability in Tunisia, a major source of migrationAccording to the European Commission, 81% of habitats are in poor condition in Europe. Its proposal would set legally binding targets to reduce pesticide use by half by 2030 and ban the use of pesticides in public parks, playgrounds and schools.

Here are the seven most damning sections:Boris Johnson misled the house on an unprecedented scaleThe prime minister misled parliament repeatedly  (UK Parliament/AFP/Getty)RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from TrussThe report did not just conclude that the prime minister had misled parliament, but that he had done so on an unprecedented scale from the highest office in the land.\u201cThere is no precedent for a Prime Minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House,\" the MPs wrote. \u201cHe misled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public, and did so repeatedly.\u2022\u00a0Read our live coverage of reaction to the Partygate report here:\u00a0Ex-PM\u2019s final disgrace as lies finally laid bare\u201cHe declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the House was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the Committee in the presentation of his evidence.\u201dThe committee lists five different ways in which MPs were misled by the prime minister. Firstly, when he said that guidance was followed completely in No. 10; secondly, when he failed to tell the house about his own knowledge of the gatherings.The third way the committee felt parliament had been mislead was that Mr Johnson claimed he had relied on \"repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken\" \u2013\u00a0in fact, these supposed assurances \"were not accurately represented\", the MPs found.He was also found to have misled the house by giving the impression he would have to wait for an investigation to conclude before he could answer questions \u2013 when in fact \"he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal\". The final occasion was when he \"purported to correct the record but instead continued to mislead the House and, by his continuing denials\".An attack on our democratic institutions Boris Johnson ahead of his evidence to the Privileges Committee (House of Commons/PA) (PA Wire)One of the areas the report focused on was the ex-prime minister's 1,000-word resignation statement in which he blasted the committee's investigation as a witch-hunt.It would be an understatement to say that this broadside made things worse for the prime minister, at least as far as the investigation was concerned. The committee has characterised it as \"an attack on our democratic institutions\".The statement did not \"merely criticise the fairness of the Committee\u2019s procedures\", the MPs said \u2013 \"he also attacks in very strong, indeed vitriolic, terms the integrity, honesty and honour of its members\".It concluded: \"This attack on a committee carrying out its remit from the democratically elected House itself amounts to an attack on our democratic institutions. \"We consider that these statements are completely unacceptable. In our view this conduct, together with the egregious breach of confidentiality, is a serious further contempt.\"Johnson previously dismissed 'kangaroo court' claimsThe prime minister accused the committee of being a kangaroo court in his resignation statement  (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)The prime minister's characterisation of the committee investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"kangaroo court\" was at odds with his earlier statements dismissing exactly those terms, the MPs noted.While speaking to the committee the ex prime minister told MPs the he respected their work, and \"when pressed to do so, that he deprecated terms such as 'witch hunt' and 'kangaroo court',\" the report says.\"Notwithstanding his protestations of respect for the Committee, and his earlier deprecation of language such as 'kangaroo courts' and 'witch hunts', we note that in his statement of 9 June Mr Johnson himself used precisely those abusive terms to describe the Committee,\" the report said.\"This leaves us in no doubt that he was insincere in his attempts to distance himself from the campaign of abuse and intimidation of committee members. This in our view constitutes a further significant contempt.\"A cynical attempt to manipulate public opinion Boris Johnson giving evidence to the Privileges Committee in March (House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA) (PA Wire)The committee was angry at the former prime minister's conduct even before his incendiary resignation statement \u2013 describing some of his comments in front of the cameras as a \"cynical attempt to manipulate member [MP] and public opinion\".The MPs zero in on one episode during a committee hearing where Mr Johnson \"accused the Committee of suppressing evidence which would be helpful to him\". \"We invited him to identify any such evidence. The Committee obtained that evidence from the witnesses he had indicated, supported by statements of truth. In the event he placed no reliance on it,\" they said.\"The clear implication is that there was nothing in the evidence and his criticism in public was a cynical attempt to manipulate member and public opinion.\"Presence of interior designer and Carrie at work meeting unexplainedThe prime minister\u2019s wife Carrie Johnson attended one of the essential work meetings  (Getty Images)The committee goes into detail about what happened at each Downing Street gathering under Covid rules \u2013 but one passage stands out.It is about his interior designer, and his wife Carrie Johnson, who attended a birthday gathering for the then prime minister in the Cabinet room in June 2020 while rules were in place prohibiting such parties.The prime minister's defence of this was that the gathering was a work meeting that was absolutely necessary and so within the rules at the time \u2013 but the committee disagreed. (As did the police, who give him a fixed penalty notice).\"Mr Johnson was also unable to explain why he considered his wife and interior designer 'absolutely necessary participants' in a work-related meeting,\" it says of their presence.\"His assertion that the Prime Minister\u2019s family are entitled to use every part of the building does not constitute an explanation.\"There's no way Johnson could not have knownThe ex prime minster explained the rules to the public on television regularly  (PA Archive)After going through the detail of the events, what Mr Johnson knew about them, and what he told parliament, the committee said there was simply no way the prime minister could not have known he was misleading MPs.As the \"most prominent public promoter\" of the Covid-19 rules in daily press conference it was also simply not credible to believe that he was not aware of what was and was not allowed, they said.\"We think it highly unlikely on the balance of probabilities that Mr Johnson, in the light of his cumulative direct personal experience of these events, and his familiarity with the Rules and Guidance as their most prominent public promoter, could have genuinely believed at the time of his statements to the House that the Rules or Guidance were being complied with,\" they concluded.\"We think it just as unlikely he could have continued to believe this at the time of his evidence to our Committee. We conclude that when he told the House and this Committee that the Rules and Guidance were being complied with, his own knowledge was such that he deliberately misled the House and this Committee.\"Five different contempts of parliamentThe MPs want Mr Johnson banned from having a parliamentary pass  (PA Archive)In total the committee says Boris Johnson is guilty of \"repeated contempts\" of parliament across five different thematic areas, which it bullet-pointed for clarity.Firstly, the prime minister \"deliberately mislead the house\" (also in five different ways of). Secondly, was \"deliberately misleading the committee\" during the course of its inquiry.The prime minister was also accused of \"breaching confidence\" of the committee by sharing details of its investigation when he shout not have, and additionally of \"impugning the committee and thereby undermining the democratic process of the House\" with his resignation statement.

The survivors look forward to seeing him there.\u201dA spokesperson for Mr Tate highlighted that three of the women had filed criminal complaints that the UK authorities chose not to pursue, and questioned: \u201cWhat new evidence could have appeared nine years later that would overturn the court\u2019s decision?\u201dThe representative added: \u201cConsidering the collective approach of the four women, and the channels chosen for communications, the opportunistic character of this endeavour becomes obvious, as justice is sought in the court, not in the press.\u201dRecommendedAndrew Tate trial: Why Romania wants to remind the world the toxic influencer is BritishExperts warn of \u2018copycat Andrew Tates\u2019 as influence continues to grow from behind barsCourses for teachers on how to tackle Andrew Tate\u2019s views sell outThe spokesperson noted that \u201cdespite these alleged events taking place in 2014, no legal action has been taken to cover the alleged damages suffered and no proof of such damages has been brought forward until after Andrew became an international public figure.\u201dThe claimants involved in the proposed UK civil legal action, who are aged in their late twenties and early thirties, claim the offences occurred between 2013 and 2016 while the controversial influencer was based in Britain.McCue Jury & Partners have so far raised \u00a318,500 to fund court proceedings via crowdfunding. The victims hope police in the UK will reopen their investigation into Mr Tate.Mr Tate, who has been banned from a number of social media platforms for hate speech and voicing misogynistic views, was arrested in Romania in late December alongside his brother, Tristan Tate, and two other suspects. They are accused of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.The influencer was released from jail with his younger brother at the beginning of April after they won an appeal to be held under house arrest.

They told me that it was a kangaroo court. They told me that it was being driven relentlessly by the political agenda of Harriet Harman, and supplied with skewed legal advice \u2013 with the sole political objective of finding me guilty and expelling me from parliament.They also warned me that most members had already expressed prejudicial views \u2013 especially Harriet Harman \u2013 in a way that would not be tolerated in a normal legal process.\u00a0Some alarmists even pointed out that the majority of the committee voted remain and they stressed that Bernard Jenkin\u2019s personal antipathy to me was historic and well-known.To be frank, when I first heard these warnings, I was incredulous. When it was first proposed that there should be such an inquiry by this committee, I thought it was just some time-wasting procedural stunt by the Labour party.I didn\u2019t think for one minute that a committee of MPs could find against me on the facts, and I didn\u2019t see how any reasonable person could fail to understand what had happened.I knew exactly what events I had attended in Number 10. I knew what I had seen, with my own eyes, and like the current PM, I believed that these events were lawful. I believed that my participation was lawful, and required by my job; and that is indeed the implication of the exhaustive police inquiry.The only exception is the June 19 2020 event, the so-called birthday party, when I and the then Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined in circumstances that I still find puzzling (I had lunch at my desk with people I worked with every day).So when on Dec 1 2021 I told the House of Commons that \u201cthe guidance was followed completely\u201d (in Number 10) I meant it. It wasn\u2019t just what I thought: it\u2019s what we all thought \u2013 that we were following the rules and following the guidance completely \u2013 notwithstanding the difficulties of maintaining social distancing at all times.The committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events.This is rubbish. It is a lie. In order to reach this deranged conclusion, the committee is obliged to say a series of things that are patently absurd, or contradicted by the facts.First, they say that I must have known that the farewell events I attended were not authorised workplace events because \u2013 wait for it \u2013 NO SUCH EVENT could lawfully have taken place, anywhere in this country, under the committee\u2019s interpretation of covid rules.This is transparently wrong.\u00a0I believed, correctly, that these events were reasonably necessary for work purposes. We were managing a pandemic. We had hundreds of staff engaged in what was sometimes a round-the-clock struggle against Covid. Their morale mattered for that fight. It was important for me to thank them.But don\u2019t just listen to me. Take it from the Metropolitan Police. The police investigated my role at all of those events. In no case did they find that what I had done was unlawful. Above all it did not cross my mind \u2013 as I spoke in the House of Commons \u2013 that the events were unlawful.I believed that we were working, and we were: talking for the main about nothing except work, mainly Covid. Why would I have set out, in the Chamber, to conceal my knowledge of something illicit, if that account could be so readily contradicted by others? Why would we have had an official photographer if we believed we were breaking the law?We didn\u2019t believe that what we were doing was wrong, and after a year of work the Privileges Committee has found not a shred of evidence that we did.Their argument can be boiled down to: \u201cLook at this picture \u2013 that\u2019s Boris Johnson with a glass in his hand. He must have known that the event was illegal. Therefore he lied.\u201dThat is a load of complete tripe. That picture was me, in my place of work, trying to encourage and thank my officials in a way that I believed was crucial for the Government and for the country as a whole, and in a way which I believed to be wholly within the rules.For the Committee now to say that all such events \u2013 \u201cthank-yous\u201d and birthdays \u2013 were intrinsically illegal is ludicrous, contrary to the intentions of those who made the rules (including me), and contrary to the findings of the Met; and above all I did not for one moment think they were illicit \u2013 at the time or when I spoke in the Commons.The committee cannot possibly believe the conclusions of their own report \u2013 because it has now emerged that Sir Bernard Jenkin attended at least one \u201cbirthday event\u201d, on Dec 8 2020 \u2013 the birthday of his wife Anne \u2013 when it is alleged that alcohol and food were served and the numbers exceeded six indoors.Why was it illegal for me to thank staff and legal for Sir Bernard to\u00a0attend his wife\u2019s birthday party?The hypocrisy is rank. Like Harriet Harman, he should have recused himself from the inquiry, since he is plainly conflicted.The rest of the committee\u2019s report is mainly a rehash of their previous non-points. They have nothing new of substance to say. They concede that they have found no evidence that I was warned, before or after an event, that it was illegal. That is surely very telling. If we had genuinely believed these events to be unauthorised \u2013 with all the political sensitivities entailed \u2013 then there would be some trace in all the thousands of messages sent to me, and to which the committee has had access.It is preposterous to say, as the committee does, that people were just too scared to mention concerns to their superiors. Really? Was Simon Case too scared to draw his concerns to my attention? Was Sue Gray or Rishi Sunak?The committee concedes that the guidance permitted social distancing of less than one metre where there was no alternative \u2013 though they refuse to take account of all the other mitigations \u2013 including regular testing \u2013 that we put in place.They keep wilfully missing the point. The question is not whether perfect social distancing was maintained at all times in Number 10 \u2013 clearly that wasn\u2019t possible, as I have said very often. The question is whether I believed, given the limitations of the building, we were doing enough, with mitigations, to follow the guidance \u2013 and I did, and so did everyone else.They grudgingly accept that I was right to tell the Commons that I was repeatedly assured that the rules were followed in respect of the Dec 18 event in the media room, but they try, absurdly and incoherently, to say that the assurances of Jack Doyle and James Slack were not enough to constitute \u201crepeated\u201d assurances \u2013 completely and deliberately ignoring the sworn testimony of two MPs, Andrew Griffiths and Sarah Dines, who have also said that they heard me being given such assurances.Perhaps the craziest assertion of all is the committee\u2019s Mystic Meg claim that I saw the Dec 18 event with my own eyes. They say, without any evidence whatever, that at 21.58pm, on that date, my eyes for one crucial second glanced over to the media room as I went up to the flat \u2013 and that I saw what I recognised as an unauthorised event in progress.First, the committee has totally ignored the general testimony about that evening, which is that people were working throughout, even if some had been drinking at their desks. How on earth do these clairvoyants know exactly what was going on at 21.58?How do they know what I saw? What retinal impressions have they somehow discovered, that are completely unavailable to me? I saw no goings on at all in the press room, or none that I can remember, certainly nothing illegal.As the committee has heard, officials were heavily engaged in preparing difficult messaging about the prospect of a No-deal Brexit and a Christmas lockdown.It is a measure of the committee\u2019s desperation that they are trying incompetently and absurdly to tie me to an illicit event \u2013 with an argument so threadbare that it belongs in one of Bernard Jenkin\u2019s nudist colonies.Their argument is that I saw this event, believed it to be illegal, and had it in my head when I spoke to the House. On all three counts they are talking out of the backs of their necks. If I did see an illegal event, and register it as illegal, then why was I on my own in this? Why not the Cabinet Secretary, or Sue Gray, or the then Chancellor, who was patrolling the same corridors at the time?The committee is imputing to me and me alone a secret knowledge of illegal events that was somehow not shared by any other official or minister in Number 10. That is utterly incredible. That is the artifice.This report is a charade. I was wrong to believe in the committee or its good faith. The terrible truth is that it is not I who has twisted the truth to suit my purposes. It is Harriet Harman and her committee.This is a dreadful day for MPs and for democracy.

on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning.It comes after he promised to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023.However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the \"current pace\".Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman\u2019s comments, Mr Sunak said: \"It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working.\"That\u2019s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration.\"And that\u2019s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work.\"It\u2019s not right, which is why we\u2019ve increased resources for immigration enforcement.\"We\u2019ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we\u2019ve doubled the number of arrests.\"He added: \"But we\u2019re not

Bill Support Scheme at the end of March (an initiative that handed out \u00a3400 in monthly instalments of \u00a366 and \u00a367), millions of households on low incomes will receive further cost of living support from the government this year worth up to \u00a31,350 in total.Eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including people on universal credit, pension credit and tax credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "648b23ad51ac33150be92926", "url":

credits, will receive \u00a3900 in instalments from this spring, with the money going directly to bank accounts in three tranches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said.There will also be a separate \u00a3150 payment for more than six million people with disabilities and an extra \u00a3300 for over eight million pensioners.Here are the payment windows that have been announced so far, with more precise dates expected later in the year:\u00a3301 \u2013 First cost of living payment \u2013 already issued between 25 April and 17 May (or 2 to 9 May for people on tax credits but no other low-income benefits)\u00a3150 \u2013 Disability payment \u2013 during summer 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Second cost of living payment \u2013 during autumn 2023\u00a3300 \u2013 Pensioner payment \u2013 during winter 2023/4\u00a3299 \u2013 Third cost of living payment \u2013 during spring 2024Benefits going out as usualThe usual state support in the shape of benefits and pensions payments will also be going out as normal in July, with no bank holidays scheduled to confuse delivery dates.Anyone expecting to receive any of the following from the DWP can expect their money on the usual date this month.Universal creditState pensionPension creditDisability living allowancePersonal independence paymentAttendance allowanceCarer\u2019s allowanceEmployment support allowanceIncome

can expect in July \u2013 if last year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave is anything to go by \u2013 might not be comfortable for everyone but it will at least greatly reduce the need for having the central heating switched on, which proved such an expense over the course of the winter just gone.The government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) \u2013 introduced by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before supplying it to households \u2013and, although it is a significant drop from the eye-watering rates of the last two years, the figure remains more than \u00a31,000 a year above pre-pandemic levels.As for what might happen next, consultancy firm Cornwall Insight predicts that July\u2019s fall will be followed by another drop in October, when it expects the typical annual bill to be \u00a31,976.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payersUnfortunately, it believes the typical bill will then rise again in January 2024 to \u00a32,045 and Cornwall does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.It has also warned customers that prices remain subject to wholesale market volatility, with the UK\u2019s reliance on energy imports meaning that geopolitical incidents like the war in Ukraine could continue to have a detrimental impact."}, {"_id": "648b23ae51ac33150be92927", "url":

It will be offered as part of their marquee modern and contemporary evening.The painting was created when Klimt was in his artistic prime, and at a moment when the \u201cformality\u201d of his earlier commissioned work gave way to a new expressivity. The artist died unexpectedly in 1918 at the age of 55.Klimt started work on Lady With A Fan in 1917, by which time he was among the most celebrated portrait artists in Europe, receiving commissions at prices far higher than his contemporaries.However, this was a rare work painted entirely in the pursuit of his own interests and demonstrates a \u201cfreedom and spontaneity\u201d that reflects Klimt\u2019s joy in painting, experts said.RecommendedJurassic Park fans feel ancient as child star recreates green jelly scene aged 43Phillip Schofield\u2019s lover denied affair 12 times, ITV boss Carolyn McCall tells MPsThe Idol viewers horrified by The Weeknd\u2019s dialogue during Lily-Rose Depp sex scene: \u2018Nasty\u2019Unlike traditional vertical \u201cportrait\u201d paintings, Lady With A Fan returns to the square format that Klimt used for his avant-garde landscapes earlier in the century, giving this painting a uniquely \u201cmodern\u201d edge.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe King\u2019s connection to the Fairbridge farm schools where British children suffered physical and sexual abuse is in the spotlight again after administrators for his charity informed survivors they would receive a tiny portion of the compensation pay-out they were promised.Here, the PA news agency looks at the connection of Charles and his charity, the Prince\u2019s Trust, to the organisation which sent hundreds of thousands of British children to its colonies where they experienced physical and sexual abuse:What is the King\u2019s connection to Fairbridge?The Prince\u2019s Trust became legally liable for Fairbridge after it took over the charity and absorbed all of its assets in 2012. Also inherited were what the trust\u2019s chief executive described as \u201cliterally millions and millions and millions of documents\u201d held in the archive at Liverpool University which detailed the mistreatment and abuse of children at the Fairbridge farm schools.In 2013, the trust dissolved Fairbridge as an independent entity, but it continued to have a Fairbridge representative on its board.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAt the second London hearing of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in 2017, the trust\u2019s chief executive Dame Martina Milburn said they had not known about abuse at the farm schools.Former child migrant David Hill, author of two books about Fairbridge, responded to Dame Martina\u2019s comments by accusing the Prince\u2019s Trust of trying to cover \u201cits backside\u201d by denying knowledge of serious abuse at the Fairbridge institutions when it had been in possession of the files for the past six years.When and why did the Prince\u2019s Trust pledge to pay compensation to Fairbridge survivors?When the Australian government completed its own inquiry into child sexual abuse at institutions (the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse), it listed Fairbridge as an offending body that should pay redress to victims.The Prince\u2019s Trust, as the successor institution to Fairbridge, announced in May 2020 it would provide funds to Fairbridge to pay victims. It then created a separate legal entity called Fairbridge Restored to do so \u2013 but put the company into administration and tasked lawyers from Grant Thornton UK LLP with the job of paying compensation.That compensation has not been paid and Fairbridge Restored/the Prince\u2019s Trust has failed to sign up to Australia\u2019s National Redress Scheme.How much compensation were survivors told they will get?In November 2022, the High Court of Justice determined a reasonable amount to each claimant was \u00a3204,000 (380,000 Australian dollars).In May 2023, administrators wrote to 277 claimants to say they will only receive about 1% of that figure \u2013 which would work out about \u00a31,000-\u00a32,000 each \u2013 due to \u201cinsufficient monies\u201d.The letter said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, I would like to highlight that the amount that will be paid will be a small proportion of each admitted claim. This is because there are insufficient monies to pay all admitted claims in full, so every creditor with an admitted claim will receive the same small percentage of their claim.\u201cOur current estimate is that it may be in the order of around 1%. For illustrative purposes, if the dividend were to be 1% and for example, your admitted claim was 100,000 Australian dollars, you would receive a distribution of 1,000 Australian dollars (paid in British pounds sterling).\u201dWhat was Fairbridge?Fairbridge was the brainchild of Kingsley Fairbridge, a \u201cchild of Empire\u201d who as early as the 1900s was advocating sending children from England\u2019s \u201corphan and waif class\u201d to the colonies to take up land as white settlers.Between 1912 and 1980, Fairbridge sent around 130,000 British children to farm schools in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia). Ten thousand children were sent to Australia alone.Few of the children were actually orphans and most parents did not understand they were giving up their children forever when they joined the scheme due to financial desperation.In 1912 the first Fairbridge Farm School opened in Australia \u2013 in Pinjarra, 50 miles south of Western Australia\u2019s capital Perth \u2013 and many more would follow throughout Britain\u2019s colonies and former colonies. The plan was to turn boys into farmers and girls into farmers\u2019 wives.By 1934 the plan had the backing of the future King Edward VIII (then the Prince of Wales) who donated \u00a31,000 to Fairbridge, declaring: \u201cThis is not charity. It is an imperial investment.\u201dWhen and why did the Home Office blacklist the farm schools?By the 1950s the number of children being signed up to the scheme was declining due to opposition from social workers.A number of damaging reports also surfaced, the most scathing of which saw Fairbridge\u2019s farm schools in both Molong, 180 miles west of Sydney, and Western Australia backlisted by the Home Office.The report was suppressed by Fairbridge, which was made to reform in order to keep receiving funding from the British Government \u2013 which it did with the One Parent Scheme, which allowed one parent to follow their children to Australia.For the previous 50 years, Fairbridge went to great lengths to permanently separate British child migrants from their parents in the UK.Why did Britain export its children?The idea of the child migrant scheme was to solve the problem of the number of children who were born into poverty in the UK while populating the Empire with \u201cgood, white stock\u201d.The belief among Britain\u2019s ruling classes at the time was that children from poor or broken families needed to be \u201crescued\u201d.It was thought taking children away from financially disadvantaged families was the only way to ensure they did not become destitute themselves.In the 1930s, promotional publicity in newspapers declared children from the lower classes were a \u201cburden and a menace to society that could be converted (in)to valuable assets in Australia\u201d.How old were the children deported by Britain to its colonies?Children were as young as four but the typical number was eight or nine.What percentage of the children were sexually abused?RecommendedFarm school victim was threatened after accusing war hero of child sexual abuseJunior doctors to resume strike as row over pay continuesWhat the papers say \u2013 June 15At Fairbridge Farm School in Molong, more than 60% of survivors were found to have suffered sexual abuse as children.In 2015, survivors won landmark compensation of 24 million Australian dollars (\u00a312.8 million) in the New South Wales Supreme Court for the abuse they suffered as children by the state and federal governments."}, {"_id": "648b23af51ac33150be9292d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brixton-academy-crush-rebecca-ikumelo-b2357872.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Children of woman crushed to death outside Brixton Academy \u2018are realising their mother isn\u2019t coming home\u2019", "lead": "<p>\u2018With the seven-year-old, you can see the sadness in him\u2019  </p>", "author": "Maroosha Muzaffar", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 05:35:30 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:43:59.145781", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T05:35:30+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/12/17/19/Rebecca%20Ikumelo.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA survivor of a farm school in rural Australia owed compensation by the Prince\u2019s Trust said he received threats and abuse after becoming the first person to publicly accuse Australian governor general Sir William Slim of child sexual abuse.After decades of silence, Robert Stephens told an Australian newspaper in 2007 the celebrated British war hero had molested him in the 1950s \u2013 prompting other men to come forward.\u201cI was pretty nervous about (going public about the alleged abuse) and, in fact, I was getting threats. People were ringing up and threatening me,\u201d Mr Stephens told the PA news agency.\u201cThere were abusive phone calls and things like that.\u201dMr Stephens is among the 277 claimants seeking compensation for the abuse and mistreatment he suffered at the farm school which was run by the Fairbridge Society.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveFor 70 years the organisation exported tens of thousands of working class children from Britain to its former colonies in a bid to convert a \u201cburden and a menace\u201d to society into \u201cassets\u201d for the Empire.In 2012 the King\u2019s charity, the Prince\u2019s Trust, became legally liable for the Fairbridge farm schools when it took over the organisation and absorbed its assets.Then, in response to child sexual abuse inquiries in both the UK and Australia, the Prince\u2019s Trust pledged to pay compensation to Fairbridge survivors and in 2020 it set up a separate legal entity for this purpose \u2013 putting it into receivership and tasking joint administrators Chris Laverty and Alistair Wardell of Grant Thornton UK LLP with paying compensation.In November 2022, the High Court of Justice determined a reasonable amount to each claimant was \u00a3204,000 (380,000 Australian dollars) but last month Mr Stephens and other former \u201cFairbridge kids\u201d were informed they will only receive about 1% of that figure due to the Prince\u2019s Trust having \u201cinsufficient monies\u201d.Each claimant will now receive about \u00a31,000-\u00a32,000 each.Born in St Albans, north of London, Mr Stephens had only known the inside of orphanages when he was sent to Australia at the age of eight as a child migrant.Like 60% of survivors of the Molong school in rural New South Wales (NSW) state, 180 miles from Sydney, Mr Stephens was subjected to sexual abuse during his nine years at the institution.It was not until the 1980s, when he was in his 40s, that the toll of that trauma truly hit Mr Stephens.He had been visiting London with his wife when he had a nervous breakdown inside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral after coming face-to-face with his abuser \u2013 or rather a marble replica of him.\u201cIt was a bust sitting in an alcove. I can still see it clear as day\u2026 and I still remember the card with this red flower on it which said \u2018From a thankful child in Singapore\u2019. It\u2019s never left me,\u201d he said.Mr Stephens told PA that in that moment \u201csomething exploded\u201d inside him and he could not speak or move.\u201cI was in a highly emotional state, shaking\u2026 everything came back,\u201d the 80-year-old said.\u201cIt\u2019s still quite emotional\u2026 prior to that incident in London, (my wife) had no idea what I\u2019d been through\u2026 (She still) has great difficulty coping with it.\u201cHere\u2019s this guy standing there in this bloody cathedral who couldn\u2019t move. She had no idea what was going on.\u201dFrom then on, the trauma compounded for Mr Stephens but due to the high stature of his alleged abuser, he did not think he would be believed.\u201cI tried to deal with it the best I could, but in the end I needed help to deal with it because it had a chain effect on everything,\u201d he recalled.\u201cIt was a terrible time. I try and put it behind me but it\u2019s there.\u201dThe Molong farm school to which Mr Stephens and around a thousand other British child migrants were sent between 1938 and 1974 had been blacklisted by the UK Home Office in 1956 after a fact-finding mission found the Fairbridge institutions were \u201cunfit for children\u201d \u2013 yet it had continued to operate for the next two decades.In the early 2000s, David Hill \u2013 a former resident of the school who went on to become chairman of Australia\u2019s national broadcaster \u2013 began researching the farm schools and learned the extent to which both the UK and Australian governments were aware of mistreatment of children but had covered it up.Mr Hill\u2019s dogged interviewing of survivors uncovered the shocking scale of sexual abuse at the school with Mr Stephens the first to confide in him.\n\nThey could not believe that Slim did what he did. The Star of Burma people still have that issue because, to them, he was a godRobert StephensIt set off an avalanche of testimony and one by one, survivors revealed to Mr Hill the true horror of the Molong farm school. In just about every instance it was the first time in their lives they had disclosed the sexual abuse to anyone.\u201c(David Hill) was a catalyst for a lot of people,\u201d Mr Stephens said, explaining being able to speak out about the abuse after decades of silence had been helpful to his healing.\u201cIt was part of that business of me getting over what I\u2019d been through. I\u2019d been pretty crook. I couldn\u2019t work, the family was broke. And I think I was angry.\u201dSir William had been so celebrated as a military commander of the British Army during the Second World War that when a statue was unveiled in commemoration of him outside the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence in Whitehall in 1990, Queen Elizabeth II did the honours.While Mr Stephens had not mentioned him by name to Mr Hill, another \u201cFairbridge kid\u201d had. But due to him not wishing to speak on the record, it was not included in Mr Hill\u2019s book The Forgotten Children when it was published in 2007.In the subsequent promotional interviews for the book, Mr Hill mentioned to a journalist off the record the allegation he had heard against the 13th governor general.The next day The Sydney Morning Herald ran the story about Sir William \u201cattempting to sexually interfere with a young, impoverished British boy sent to an institution in western NSW\u201d.The article prompted Mr Stephens to become the first to allege publicly he had been abused by the revered military commander.\u201cNo adult would believe these things happened so you didn\u2019t talk about it. You think you are the only one,\u201d he told the paper.\u201cLike so many things that happened at Fairbridge, they don\u2019t go away. They live with you all your life.\u201dHis claims were met with threats and abuse from supporters of the late governor general.\u201cThat was difficult. It was mainly people who had served with Slim. They could not believe that Slim did what he did. The Star of Burma people still have that issue because, to them, he was a god,\u201d he said.\u201cBut to other people, he was not quite the person that they knew.\u201dShortly after Mr Stephens made the allegation, another two former Fairbridge kids came forward to say they had also been abused by the former governor general as children.They said that during the governor general\u2019s official visits to the farm school in the 1950s, Sir William would offer the \u201cpretty boys\u201d a ride in his black viceregal Rolls-Royce and make them sit on his lap.From there, he would slide his hands up the boys\u2019 shorts and assault them.The three men\u2019s accounts were supported by a fourth man who wrote into The Australian newspaper in 2007 to say he had been a child in Gosford, NSW, during the Queen\u2019s official visit to Australia in 1954 when he had witnessed Sir William touch the crotch of another young boy.The 1st Viscount Slim died in 1970 but his son, who inherited his father\u2019s title and his seat in the House of Lords, rubbished the accusations against his late father.A lieutenant who had served under him during the Burma campaign also dismissed the accusations, saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t believe that of our great leader. I think it will all waft over and everyone will forget about (the allegations).\u201dMr Stephens refused to remain silent and in 2021 he was successful in getting a major road in Canberra which had been named after the former governor general renamed.For nearly two decades, Mr Stephens had driven down Lord Slim Drive to get to and from the art gallery he owned. That changed when it became Gundaroo Drive.The sense of recognition from that simple name change was huge for Mr Stephens after suffering in silence for so long, with him describing it as \u201ccathartic\u201d.\u201cI think, for me, it was a release of what I had been through in terms of all the problems I had had mentally and physically (that) kept coming back to me,\u201d Mr Stephens explained.\u201cI thought talking about it sort of (helped) me to deal with it better and better as I got along.\u201dWhile Mr Stephens admits his family finds the subject of Fairbridge deeply upsetting after learning the extent to his suffering as a child at the farm school, they understand his need to try to stop what happened to him from happening to any other vulnerable children.\u201cI generally try to be positive and I try to look beyond what\u2019s happened,\u201d Mr Stephens said.\u201cThere was also a determination that I was never, ever going to allow my children to go through what I went through, and I think that underpinned a lot of what I was doing in speaking out about it.\u201cIt still haunts (my wife). The fact that I\u2019m talking to you (the media), she gets upset by. And I can understand that, but I\u2019ve always believed that what happened should never happen again.\u201cIt\u2019s part of our social history whether we want to admit it or not. We\u2019ve got to do what we can.\u201dThe 80-year-old grandfather said the saga of seeking compensation from the Prince\u2019s Trust for himself and the other elderly survivors was an \u201cinsult\u201d.\u201cAfter years and years of not only being at Fairbridge, but then the suffering that a lot of Fairbridge kids have had to go through economically, it\u2019s a pittance, an absolute pittance for what a lot of them would have been through in their lives,\u201d he said.Despite leaving Fairbridge at the age of 15 having never known a loving family, Mr Stephens went on to have seven children after meeting the love of his life when he was 18.Like many Fairbridge kids, Mr Stephens could barely read or write when he left the farm school, but he went on to become a successful businessman with his own art gallery in Canberra and farm where he breeds Angus cattle.He admits trying to be happy in life has been difficult after the trauma of Fairbridge, but ultimately believes his life has been a successful one due to his wife of 56 years and the seven children they raised, all of whom are high-achievers.\u201cThis is where I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky. I\u2019ve had someone who\u2019s stood there behind me\u2026 and as a mother, she\u2019s been absolutely amazing. No question about that,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think the children would be where they are today without (her)\u2026 I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201cTrying to be happy in life has been difficult for me but my success is we\u2019ve brought seven children into the world who have been very successful and are contributing in their own way to life and society.\u201dRecommendedHow is the King connected to the farm schools where children suffered abuse?Junior doctors to resume strike as row over pay continuesWhat the papers say \u2013 June 15The Prince\u2019s Trust and Buckingham Palace did not respond to PA\u2019s request for comment.The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) is a UK-based charity that offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331The National Male Survivor Helpline is a dedicated service for men and boys in England and Wales affected by sexual violence and abuse and those who support them on 0808 800 5005In Australia, survivors of complex trauma, including violence, neglect and child sexual abuse, can receive help and support through the Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380"}, {"_id": "648b23b051ac33150be92936", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nottingham-daily-mail-bernard-jenkin-jeremy-hunt-boris-johnson-b2357824.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What the papers say \u2013 June 15", "lead": "Many of the papers focus on the families of those killed in Nottingham this week.", "author": "PA Reporter", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:02:03 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:00.884157", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T00:02:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/01/c0582268470a64b742ac148735c37c69Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODczNjg0-2.33243399.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

We have children who were taken away prematurely from us, that should never happen to any parent.\u201dTributes to the 19-year-olds, both talented athletes, have poured in since they were stabbed to death as they walked home from a night out in Nottingham just after 4am on Tuesday, as well as the third victim of the violence, primary school caretaker Ian Coates, who was also remembered at the event on Wednesday.In a moving speech, student union community officer Daisy Forster told the families \u201cwe will always be here when you need us\u201d, saying that there are 38,000 students to support them.Grant Walton, from the university chaplaincy, described the deaths as \u201cone of those moments which we hoped we\u2019d never encounter\u201d while the university\u2019s vice-chancellor, Professor Shearer West, said the lives of the victims had been \u201ccurtailed\u201d by a \u201cseemingly random\u201d act of violence.The vigil followed a series of tributes paid to the three victims of Tuesday\u2019s attacks who were all fatally stabbed, while another three people were hurt, one critically, when they were run over by a van.Mr Coates\u2019 sons left tributes at the scene of his death on Wednesday, telling reporters he was \u201ca die-hard Forest fan\u201d and a keen fisherman who took young people from deprived backgrounds fishing to try to divert them from crime.Lee Coates said the death of his father, who was four months from retirement, had \u201crocked everyone\u2019s world\u201d, adding: \u201cIf we had to think about it, he\u2019d be lying in a bed with us holding his hand, him dying naturally in 20 to 30 years\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cNot dying on a street because some guy decided it\u2019s not his day today,\u201d Lee\u2019s brother James added.He went on: \u201cHe was everyone\u2019s friend, always willing to help.\u201cNobody deserves this but he definitely didn\u2019t.

Moreover, they are used more for some courses than others.\u201cShining a spotlight on the use of personal statements was always going to be useful to applicants and those who advise them, but doing it now helps inform the important reforms that Ucas are currently planning.\u201dGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said personal statements in their current form are \u201cflawed\u201d as they favour advantaged students.He said: \u201cBreaking down the personal statement into specific questions, as Ucas has committed to doing, feels like a step in the right direction. Careful consideration must be given to the number and type of questions to ensure they are fair to all students.\u201cIt\u2019s also important that these questions are of more use and interest to admissions tutors than current personal statements, which this survey suggests are often barely read.\u201dClare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: \u201cThe personal statement is an important component of the application process; students tell us it helps their decision-making while admissions teams say it supports comparability for them when making offers.RecommendedCampaigners call on Government to extend paid paternity leave to six weeksSpecial stamps issued to mark 75th anniversary of arrival of MV WindrushBritish Sign Language GCSE one step closer as Government launches consultation\u201cOur reform work will ensure personal statements add more value, retaining the space for students to advocate for their achievements in their own words while helping universities and colleges to differentiate between applications amid growing demand for places, with up to one million applicants forecast by the end of the decade.\u201cWe continue to consult extensively with all stakeholders to help us refine the theme for the new personal statement questions and we will announce our proposals later this year.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23b151ac33150be9293a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/department-for-education-british-gcse-government-british-sign-language-b2357804.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "British Sign Language GCSE one step closer as Government launches consultation", "lead": "The Department for Education is aiming for the new qualification to be taught in schools from September 2025.", "author": "Eleanor Busby", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 23:01:00 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:01.548459", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/00/ba82b58a35b1346a4e0421842aa7b313Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODQyMjcz-2.70838857.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A fourth defendant, Callum Charles-Quebella, 18, had previously admitted manslaughter.They were all acquitted of murder by a jury at Bristol Crown Court.Four other defendants, Dean Smith, 20, and three 17-year-olds were all found not guilty of murder and manslaughter.A ninth defendant, Keishaleigh Margrett-Whitter, 20, was acquitted of two charges of assisting an offender.As the verdicts were returned, members of the public sat in court were visibly upset, while some of the defendants burst into tears.\n\nThe background to the stabbing was an ongoing rivalry between two Gloucester groups.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere has been further gloom for homeowners this week as banks reacted to signs of stubborn inflation by pulling mortgage deals and raising rates, while polling suggested nearly half of borrowers fear they will struggle with their housing re-payments within 12 months.HSBC was expected to take the extraordinary step of raising its mortgage prices for the second time in a week, as speculation mounted over whether Rishi Sunak\u2019s government could be forced to intervene to help homeowners feeling the pain of rising rates.With markets betting on interest rates hitting nearly 6 per cent within months and government borrowing costs surpassing even the peak seen during Liz Truss\u2019s mini-Budget meltdown, ministers urged banks this week to act to protect mortgage-holders struggling with repayments.One expert told The Independent on Wednesday that the chaos was \u201cgoing to sting a lot of people\u201d and warned that renters will ultimately feel the greatest impact, despite predicting that banks \u201cwill fall over themselves to come up with ways not to repossess\u201d people\u2019s homes.How much have mortgage rates risen by?RecommendedEconomic growth is back \u2013 but the battle with inflation means it may prove fleetingThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationHomeowners have already faced stark rises in their bills, with recent Labour analysis claiming that typical interest repayments have risen by \u00a3150 per week \u2013 or \u00a37,000 a year \u2013 since last September\u2019s mini-Budget spooked markets.With the Bank of England now expected to hike rates even more steeply than anticipated after inflation failed to fall as predicted last month, the Centre for Economics and Business Research think-tank (CEBR) now expects the the two-year 75 per cent loan-to-value mortgage rate to hit an average of 5.1 per cent in 2023.Rates for fixed-rate home loans have surged by 0.5 per cent in the past few weeks alone, according to the analytics firm MoneyFacts. Those with a typical \u00a3200,000 mortgage on a 25-year term will now pay an average of \u00a3977 a month in interest, broker L&C Mortgages suggests.HSBC believes rates \u2018will probably increase\u2019 further  (Chris Ison/PA)According to Neal Hudson, an analyst at Built Place, today\u2019s rates of nearly 6 per cent will cause the equivalent \u201cstress\u201d to homeowners as the double-digit interest rates of the 1980s, given that the amount borrowed is now far higher relative to people\u2019s income.Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today show, HSBC boss Ian Stuart said his bank believes \u201crates will probably increase a little bit more and will probably stay a little bit higher for longer\u201d \u2013 and will not start to fall significantly \u201cuntil inflation is much lower than it is today\u201d.What does it mean for people whose fixed-term deals are due to end?Forecasting that around 2.6 million people are soon due to move from cheaper fixed-term deals, the CEBR believes those looking to renegotiate their deals over the next two years as a result will face an \u00a38.7bn increase in their payments, with the worst rises in southeast England.Mr Hudson told The Independent that \u201cthe big increase in interest rates will be concerning for those coming to the end of their fixed rate periods, of which there will be a large number given it\u2019s two years after the SDLT holiday.\u201cIf rates stay this high then borrowers will undoubtedly struggle, especially given the cost of living crisis. Hopefully inflation will ease quickly and [Bank of England base rate] won\u2019t have to go as high as the market is currently suggesting.\u201dAccording to broker London Money, mortgage repayments for borrowers whose existing deals have come to an end are about 26 per cent a month higher on average, The Times reported.Mr Stuart of HSBC said there was \u201cno doubt that people are really having to rethink their personal finances\u201d, adding: \u201cIf you've got an old rate as many will have of say 1.5 per cent and you're going to come off that rate and go onto something like 5 per cent, that is a big impact on your monthly budget.\u201dHow could lenders react to rising rates?With many homeowners confronting \u201cthe ice-cold reality of 2023 rates\u201d, how banks react will be crucial. Buying agent and property expert Henry Pryor told The Independent that he believes lenders \u201cwant to be seen to be helping\u201d their customers to avoid being seen as \u201cvillians\u201d following the financial crisis.The Bank of Engand is expected to raise interest rates even further next week  (PA)Mr Pryor said: \u201cClearly existing mortgage holders \u2013 in particular those on fixed rate products \u2013 will experience a Wim Hof moment when the ice-cold reality of 2023 rates lands on their door mat or inbox. \u201cWhen they took out their two or five-year fixed mortgage they will have been stress-tested to check that they could afford rates up to 7 per cent even if they didn\u2019t expect it to ever happen.\u201cI think most will cut back and economise to ensure that they continue to meet the higher payments, very few will want to experience repossession. For those who can\u2019t lenders will fall over themselves to come up with ways not to repossess. \u201cThey will extend 25 year mortgages to 30 or 35 years. They will move borrowers over to interest only payments for say 5 years \u2013 anything to avoid once again becoming the villains of the piece as they were in 2009 after the global financial crash. \u201cBanks have only just been welcomed back into polite society having been bailed out of their mess. This time they want to be seen to be helping where necessary even if they will still make a profit on their assistance.\u201dHow will this affect renters?Renters are also expected to bear the brunt of rising rates, with concerns that dwindling profits could see a mass departure of landlords and properties from the market \u2013 many of whom have already pushed up rents to cover their costs.\u201cTenants will find their landlords looking pale if they have a mortgage as many buy-to-let investors do,\u201d Mr Pryor said. \u201cMost will try and charge more rent but it seems unlikely that tenants will be able to afford much more. Some will then sell up giving their tenant notice. \u201cThis will add to the current demand for rental properties and push rents up further. Tenants can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t borrow to pay their rent and some are going to find it harder than mortgage borrowers who can at least sell up and downsize.\u201dWarning that \u201cthis is going to sting a lot of people\u201d, Mr Pryor predicted that many of those with a mortgage \u2013 amounting to around a third of households \u2013 \u201cwill see a drop back in their standard of living as they cut back to afford\u201d it.However, \u201cwe will doubtless see the biggest impact\u201d in the private rental sector, including homelessness for some of the roughly four million people who rent their homes, Mr Pryor warned.Will the government intervene?With concerns having grown in recent days, speculation has increased over whether the government could step in to help homeowners.New Statesman senior editor George Eaton said he \u201cwould not be surprised if the government ends up subsidising mortgages\u201d, while the Daily Telegraph\u2019s money advice editor Sam Brodbeck suggested it \u201cfeels like the [government] will be intervening sooner rather than later\u201d.While the strongest remarks from Downing Street were merely to say that it expected mortgage lenders to protect homeowners struggling with rate rises, housing minister Rachel Maclean appeared to claim on a BBC panel show that \u201ca mortgage support scheme\u201d is in the pipeline \u2013 but failed to provide any details.What can people do to stay on top of payments?RecommendedMore mortgage pain for homeowners as rates rise to highest since Truss mini-Budget disasterSNP: Tories and Labour \u2018in denial\u2019 over Brexit link to cost-of-living crisisPolling by YouGov for The Times this week found that 30 per cent of borrowers already find it \u201cdifficult\u201d to pay their mortgage, with 46 per cent expecting that to be the case in 12 months\u2019 time.There are a number of steps that people may be able to take to ease their mortgage repayments, such as: switching to interest-only deals, which means your capital balance will remain unpaid; seeking to extend their mortgage term if possible; seeking a \u2018consent to let\u2019 agreement from their lender to rent out their property; or seeking to use an offset mortgage to reduce interest payments.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe sister of a beautician shot outside a pub on Christmas Eve told her not to return home late when she last saw her, just hours before she died, a court has heard.Elle Edwards, 26, was killed when a gunman with a Skorpion sub-machine gun opened fire outside the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village, Wirral, Merseyside shortly before midnight on December 24 last year.On Wednesday, the jury in the trial of Connor Chapman, 23, who is accused of Ms Edwards\u2019 murder, heard a statement from her younger sister Lucy who had been with her in the pub earlier that evening.She said they had been to the same pub the previous year and wanted to make it a \u201cChristmas Eve tradition\u201d.\u201cIt was generally a good night,\u201d she said.In the statement,\u00a0she said that at one point they left to go to another pub and Elle later dropped her home, between 9.30pm and 10.30pm, before returning to the Lighthouse.Lucy said: \u201cWhen I got out of the car, I told Elle not to be late so not to ruin Christmas. She said she wouldn\u2019t, she would be about an hour.\u201dShe last sent her sister a text just before 11.30pm telling her to \u201cget home\u201d but it was never read, the court heard.Lucy said it was about 1am on Christmas Day that she was woken by her brother George, who told her Elle had been shot.The shooting is alleged to have been the culmination of an ongoing feud between groups on the Woodchurch estate, where Chapman was from, and the Beechwood estate, where Jake Duffy and Kieran Salkeld, said to be the intended targets, lived.Liverpool Crown Court heard that on October 26 last year, Chapman was served with an interim injunction \u201cto prevent gang-related violence\u201d.Katy Appleton, prosecuting, said the notice prohibited Chapman from associating with a number of named individuals \u2013 including Mr Salkeld and Mr Duffy.The jury heard about a number of events in the weeks running up to the shooting linked to people from both estates, on either side of the M53 in Wirral.They included a burglary and two shootings.Footage of an assault carried out by Mr Duffy and Mr Salkeld on Sam Searson, from the Woodchurch estate, the day before the murder was played to the jury.Chapman denies the murder of Ms Edwards, two counts of attempted murder and three counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.He also denies possession of a Skorpion sub-machine gun with intent to endanger life and possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life.Co-defendant Thomas Waring, 20, of Private Drive, Barnston, Wirral, denies possessing a prohibited weapon and assisting an offender by helping Chapman to dispose of the car.The trial continues on Thursday."}, {"_id": "648b23b651ac33150be92954", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/princess-royal-arctic-the-king-windsor-castle-edinburgh-b2357648.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Explorer makes history with polar honours from two monarchs", "lead": "Sir David Hempleman-Adams collected his latest medal from the Princess Royal.", "author": "Helen William", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:51:39 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:06.611220", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T17:51:39+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/19/038db99859fa8795724423ad194d1b7fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODUxMjA4-2.72606090.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA long-awaited merger of Vodafone and Three will bring \u201cthe biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market for over a decade,\u201d experts say \u2013 with significant consequences for all anyone in Britain using a device.The \u00a315bn deal will see the two firms combine to make one of Europe\u2019s biggest operators, with about 27 million customers and more than 11,500 staff.Margherita Della Valle, chief executive of Vodafone, called the deal a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that will create a more sustainable business that supports the cost of rolling out upgrades to 5G.RecommendedVodafone and Three are merging \u2013 is it time for a better mobile phone deal?But will it benefit customers or harm them? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about how the deal might shake up the mobile market.What is happening?Vodafone and Three \u2013\u00a0both relatively small phone networks in the UK \u2013\u00a0will merge, with Vodafone owning 51 per cent of the combined business. It\u2019s not clear yet what the new company will be called.Regulators still have to approve the deal, so the merger is not guaranteed.If it goes ahead, it will be completed before the end of 2024, the companies said.\u201cThis long-awaited megamerger represents the biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market for over a decade,\u201d said Kester Mann, director of consumer and connectivity at CCS Insight.Trade union Unite said the government \u201cmust step in and stop this reckless merger\u201d, arguing it will lead to job losses and push up bills.What does it mean for customers?The companies are looking to position the deal as great for their customers. They say that it will immediately lead to a \u201cbetter network experience with greater coverage and reliability at no extra cost, including through certain flexible, contract-free offers with no annual price increases, and social tariffs\u201d.Over the long term, it is not clear how the new company intends to bring those customers together. When EE and T-Mobile merged into EE, for instance, the two customer groups initially stayed separate and then gradually became integrated.Paul Carter, CEO of mobile intelligence provider GWS, said Vodafone and Three are \u201cboth lagging in terms of internet performance between broadband and mobile services,\u201d while \u201cVirgin Media O2 are currently leading the way in terms of the overall combined connectivity consumers\u2019 experience.\u201dHe added: \u201cOn paper, this merger makes sense for two companies looking to close the gap on competitors. However, it remains to be seen whether it will bring success.\u201dWhat does it mean for people who aren\u2019t Three or Vodafone customers?Those behind the merger argue that it will help everyone else, too. Della Valle insisted the merger is \u201cgreat for the country and great for competition\u201d, thanks to the \u00a311bn investment the new company has promised for the UK, to help \u201ccreate one of Europe\u2019s most advanced standalone 5G networks\u201d. It is argued that the mobile market will become more competitive with the presence of another large operator. In theory, that could lead to better prices and deals for everyone \u2013\u00a0though there is, of course, no guarantee of that.Will prices go up for existing or new customers?It\u2019s difficult to know this far out. Bigger companies have more power, which they can use to try and drive prices higher \u2013\u00a0but they also have more scale, which they can use to be more efficient and reduce prices.Both companies have recently increased prices significantly, above inflation, which might be a clue to how they intend to behave in the future. But they may argue that the deal would allow them to avoid similar rises in the future.This will be the question that regulators grapple with as they decide whether the deal should go ahead. If they cannot be convinced that the merger will lead to better conditions for customers, then they will look to stop it.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: \u201cReducing the number of network providers from four to three risks reducing the choices available to consumers, raising prices and lowering the quality of services available.\u201cThe Competition and Markets Authority needs to conduct a thorough assessment to determine whether this merger will be harmful to consumers.\u201dWill the deal go ahead?There is still a good chance that regulators will stop the deal from going ahead. They did the same when Three attempted to take over O2 in 2016, citing the risk that the deal would lead to higher prices.RecommendedBreakthrough could soon allow us to actually use quantum computers, scientists sayMajor finding boosts hope for finding alien life in our solar systemStrava responds to alarming report suggesting that it could be used to track you down\u201cThis will be a hard sale, given that both companies have been outperforming the market for the last year or so,\u201d said Paolo Pescatore, from PP Foresight.\u201cLet\u2019s see if the authorities have a change of heart.

He took full responsibility and tried to make amends.\u201dMrs Ashton, who had been with her husband since 2008 but had known him since 1992 when they were at secondary school together, suggested he see a counsellor about the issue, but he declined because the money he owed had been paid off and he was feeling better.She said: \u201cHe said when he was gambling, he was just trying to get enough money back to pay off the loans and he hated doing it.\u201d\n\nLuke was a bright, happy and bubbly person, who easily made friends ... he had an intelligent, witty sense of humour with a mesmerising, cheeky, unforgettable giggleAnnie AshtonMrs Ashton said she believed her husband stopped gambling at the end of 2019 and early 2020 and things had \u201cgone back to normal\u201d, but that he started again during the pandemic when he was furloughed from his full-time job, instead taking up part-time delivery work for a friend.Wednesday\u2019s inquest, which is expected to last until Friday, did not discuss the details of the day Mr Ashton took his own life or his cause of death, but it was heard that he had not been honest with his wife or his work colleagues about where he was that day.He had left a number of notes for his wife and children that mentioned gambling twice and he admitted he was suffering with \u201cdemons\u201d.Barrister Philip Kolvin, representing Flutter, said the notes suggested Mr Ashton may have been suffering a mental health condition that pre-dated his experiences with gambling.However, when asked by barrister Jesse Nicholls, who was at the hearing representing the Ashton family, if Mrs Ashton believed her husband\u2019s death was caused by gambling, she replied: \u201cYes.\u201dIn a tribute to her husband, Mrs Ashton said: \u201cLuke was a bright, happy and bubbly person, who easily made friends. I first met Luke in 1992, in secondary school, and even then, he had an intelligent, witty sense of humour with a mesmerising, cheeky, unforgettable giggle.\u201dShe added: \u201cOur children wanted for nothing, he was a real rock to us all, but in reality, he masked his own pain, to protect us from what he was going through.\u201cLuke did not suffer from mental health problems, he led a happy family life and had a good work ethic. However, Luke was suffering from a gambling addiction and unfortunately this was an illness he did not understand or recognise.\u201cI believe Luke blamed himself, not knowing the facts about his illness and consequently was consumed by how it made him feel.\u201cLuke did not want to die, he had everything he wanted. The only thing he did not want was the pain and harm he was experiencing from gambling.\u201d\n\nWe are absolutely committed to safe gambling and to protecting all our customers. We hold ourselves to the very highest standards in the industryIan Brown, chief executive of FlutterIn a statement issued before the inquest started on Wednesday, Ian Brown, chief executive of Flutter, said: \u201cWe wish to reiterate our sincere condolences to Mrs Ashton and her family.

No, because it\u2019s about trying to make sure that the budget is sustainable and that we can deliver proper, quality public services as we move forward in Northern Ireland that are sustainable and financially affordable,\u201d he said.Mr Heaton-Harris said the instruction to civil servants was to provide information to a future executive and he does not have the power to implement such revenue-raising measures.He did, however, say he will not rule anything out if the devolved government does not return.\u201cI do have the powers to go to consultation on some of these matters in the future but I do not have the power to ask for revenue to be raised in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said.\u201cI actually truly believe that should be something that locally elected politicians should do.\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t rule out anything for the future if there was no executive in place.\u201dMr Heaton-Harris is currently in negotiations with the DUP in relation to the restoration of the

Heaton-Harris confirmed on Wednesday he has used new powers provided through passage of the Northern Ireland (Interim Arrangements) Act 2023 for the first time to request information and advice on the revenue-raising measures.His letter said he asked for information on measures such as introducing domestic water charges and drug prescription charges and increasing tuition fees.There is currently no charge to the public for medical prescriptions in the region and Northern Ireland students who study at local universities pay \u00a34,630 a year in tuition fees, compared with a maximum of \u00a39,250 in England.When asked about the impact of water and prescription charges on poorer households, Mr Heaton-Harris said the \u201copportunities and costs\u201d of revenue-raising procedures will be evaluated.\u201cI mean, it would be much better if we did have an executive to be doing this and actually this information will be useful to any future executive in any choices that it might want to make,\u201d he said.\u201cBut, you know, these are important elements to understand that get a feeling for what can be raised, how it can be raised, what are the benefits and costs, opportunities and costs of doing any of these benefits \u2013 or all of them?\u201d\n\nAnd if you want a prosperous city of your nation's capital it needs to expand and bring in the wealth and bring

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSome special chemical properties of baking soda may help develop safe and long-term storage of hydrogen, a fuel seen as essential to achieve \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions in the future, according to a new study.As the world continues to warm at alarming rates due to continued global greenhouse gas emissions, scientists have looked beyond coal, oil, and natural gas towards getting more energy from renewable sources.Over the recent years, clean hydrogen, produced without fossil fuels, has emerged as a key contendor among renewable energy sources.Hydrogen being an ubiquitous element, is found in nearly three-fourths of all matter in the known Universe, and is also non-toxic and highly combustible.However, one major hurdle in utilising the full potential of this clean fuel is that until now there is no safe, cost-effective, and energy-efficient way to store it at large scales.But a new study, published recently in the journal Green Chemistry, finds baking soda as a potential solution to the big problem.\u201cYou have to be a little creative... Not every chemical is going to be efficient at storing hydrogen. You have to work with what Mother Nature gives you,\u201d said Thomas Autrey from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the US, one of the co-authors of the study.RecommendedJapan's Toyota announces battery electric vehicle initiativesJapan earmarks $107 billion for developing hydrogen energy to cut emissions, stabilize suppliesIndian Prime Minister Modi strikes new agreements on migration and green hydrogen in AustraliaScientists agree that achieving safe, long-duration storage is key to hydrogen\u2019s future as a carrier of renewable energy.There are also attempts across the world to reduce the cost of producing the fuel itself from $5 to $1 per kg of hydrogen in a decade \u2013 an 80 per cent reduction.But without figuring out how to move and store hydrogen, the fuel\u2019s prices may remain high, researchers say.While it can be compressed into a gas, this requires very high pressures of up to 10,000 pounds per square inch. Experts say achieving this pressure would need walls of very thick steel or expensive space-grade carbon fiber.The new study points to the non-toxic and abundant sodium salt of bicarbonate as a potential solution.Scientists are now studying the hydrogen energy storage properties of the long-known bicarbonate-formate chemical cycle.Solutions of formate ions \u2013 hydrogen and carbon dioxide \u2013 in water carry hydrogen based on non-corrosive alkali metal formate.These ions undergo a reaction with water in the presence of a catalyst, researchers say, leading to hydrogen and bicarbonates \u2013 the \u201cbaking soda\u201d that scientists like Dr Autrey admire for its properties.With some tweaks to this process, researchers say an \u201con-off switch\u201d can be introduced into the bicarbonate-formate cycle, leading to an aqueous solution that can alternately store or release hydrogen. Scientists say the idea of using formate-bicarbonate salts still needs to be developed into economically feasible scenarios to store greater quantities of hydrogen that meets the industry standards.But in theory, they say the bicarbonate-formate cycle represents \u201ca feasible green alternative for storing and transporting energy\u201d from hydrogen.RecommendedIce-free Arctic summers are now unavoidable and could happen as soon as 2030sCyclone Biparjoy set for landfall as India and Pakistan evacuate over 100,000What is giant hogweed, the UK\u2019s \u2018most dangerous\u2019 plant?\u201cAt present, more information on both the fundamental and systems level is needed to identify the feasible scenarios for using formate/bicarbonate salts for hydrogen/energy storage,\u201d researchers wrote in the study.Dr Autrey calls the current status of the baking soda idea an \u201camazing shiny thing,\u201d adding that \u201cwhat\u2019s exciting are the possibilities\u201d."}, {"_id": "648b23bc51ac33150be92964", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/biparjoy-biporjoy-cyclone-live-landfall-map-b2357241.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cyclone Biparjoy \u2013 live: Four dead as India and Pakistan brace for \u2018heavy damage\u2019", "lead": "<p>Three boys drowned in Mumbai while heavy winds caused an accident in Gujarat </p>", "author": "Stuti Mishra", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 05:12:52 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:12.098809", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T05:12:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/13/7d223c61d4054e9bad8fc379c08c6161.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseHigh tide and strong winds witnessed as \u2018Biparjoy\u2019 approaches India coastSign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe world\u2019s demand for oil is set to \u201cshrivel\u201d before the end of the decade, according to the leading global energy authority on Tuesday.Soaring prices and concerns over energy security caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have hastened the decline as many countries rapidly shift to renewables, the International Energy Agency (IEA) report revealed. It\u2019s an update to IEA findings last year which said oil demand would tail off in the mid-2030s.Oil demand will still rise by six per cent between now and 2028 due to strong demand from the aviation industry and petrochemical sector. RecommendedWhat wildfire smoke does to your health \u2013 and what you can do about itGermany says climate measures will narrow but not fully close the country's emissions gap by 2030Shell ditches lower oil production target but insists it's committed to cutting emissionsDespite this, IEA says that \u201cpeak demand is in sight\u201d.Annual growth is expected to shrivel from 2.4 million oil barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 to 400,000 mb/d in 2028.The drop is attributed to the boom in electric vehicles, more efficient fuel standards, and increases in biofuel use. \u201cOil producers need to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly transition,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. The new forecast is based on current policies and market conditions, IEA notes, but oil demand could decline sooner if more ambitious action is taken.Burning oil, gas and coal are creating the vast amount of emissions causing the global climate crisis. Current climate-tackling efforts put the planet on a path to 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times by the end of the century, according to Climate Action Tracker (the world has currently warmed around 1.1C).To remain at the globally agreed limit of 1.5C would mean emissions being halved by 2030, and net zero reached around 2050.Oil use has rebounded in the first half of 2023 largely due to China easing strict Covid restrictions. But this bounce is temporary, according to the report, with oil demand from Beijing slowing \u201cmarkedly\u201d from 2024.RecommendedIndia, Pakistani coasts on high alert a day before Cyclone Biparjoy is expected to make landfallOil producers say tech will soon handle climate-wrecking fumes. US envoy Kerry says be skepticalWhile advanced economies transition to clean energy sources, gains will be more than offset by a booming petrochemical sector - for plastics, fertilisers, packaging and clothing \u2013 and fossil fuel use in emerging and developing nations.The fossil fuel industry continues to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new exploration, the IEA noted, with investments on track to reach the highest levels since 2015.IEA notes that a number of factors could upend its forecast including global economic shocks, decisions by the oil-production nations in OPEC+, and changes in China\u2019s refining industry.The IPCC, the world\u2019s leading climate science body, warns that avoiding catastrophic temperature rise and an ensuing parade of more destructive storms, wildfires, heatwaves and drought, means slashing fossil fuel use across society; rapid cuts to existing drilling, and no new infrastructure for oil, coal and gas.The IEA along with an increasing number of global leaders support these findings.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBrazil and Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr. has been tasked with leading a special player-run Fifa anti-racism committee. The committee will look to advocate for more stringent punishments for any displays of racism within football, a long overdue need.Vinicius Jr, arguably the face of LaLiga, recently came under attack when he experienced chants from Valenica\u2019s fans in May during a 1-0 away defeat at the Mestalla. The incident accounted for the ninth time the 22-year-old star had reported racial abuse this LaLiga campaign alone.Support around the world came in for the Brazilian star who blasted the Spanish league after the events that unfolded.Vini Jr. made his feelings clear about his experience so far in LaLiga stating that he believed\u00a0racism like he experienced at the Mestalla had become \u201cnormal\u201d all around the top flight. The Brazilian didn\u2019t hold back in expressing his thoughts, stating that in Brazil, Spain is regarded as a country of racists.Javier Tebas, LaLiga\u2019s president, didn\u2019t take kindly to Vinicius\u2019 criticism of Spain. The Costa Rican-born Tebas failed to reinforce support for the abused star, criticising the Brazilian\u2019s reaction to the terrible events.RecommendedGordon McQueen: The tough defender who starred for both Leeds and Man UnitedKompany eager for \u2018perfect\u2019 season start when Burnley face Man CityFormer Scotland defender Gordon McQueen dies aged 70Although LaLiga has had extreme numbers of incidents with racist fan behaviour over the past year, the issues extend beyond Spain. Joelinton, a fellow Brazilian and Newcastle United midfielder, recently revealed that he had his own experience with racism following Newcastle\u2019s defeat to Arsenal.The newly created committee is an important step in the right direction and, at the very least, demonstrates that Fifa is no longer willing to passively observe their players suffer with no consequences.Gianni Infantino, Fifa\u2019s president, spoke with the Brazilian national team in Barcelona encouraging the players that football will no longer deal with racism and stated to Reuters: \u201cThere will be no more football with racism in it. The games should be stopped immediately when it happens. Enough is enough.\u201dInfantino stressed the importance of not just punishing fans within the scope of football but expanding the punishments beyond the stadium and pursuing legal action.

The directors had been in discussions with various parties to provide additional funding together with a potential sale of the business. Unfortunately, these discussions did not progress.\u201dMany drivers, including British Alpine Academy driver Abbi Pulling, had credited W Series with saving their careers, particularly as it was was free-to-enter in a hugely expensive sport that remains overwhelmingly male-dominated.Its 2022 race at Silverstone attracted a peak UK TV audience of more than a million viewers, making it the most-watched motorsport event since 2014 outside of F1.British driver Alice Powell, who finished third in 2022, tweeted: \u201cI am sad to learn of the news of W Series entering administration. At the end of the day, W Series got me out racing again, whether you agreed with the championship or not\u2026\u201cW Series DID NOT fail. It inspired and created opportunities not just for its drivers, but for many young female racing fans too. I have many great memories from racing in the championship, including my win at the British GP in 2021, which will stay with me forever.\u201dCEO Catherine Bond Muir had previously pointed to the pandemic \u2013 which led to the cancellation of the 2020 season \u2013 as one of the many factors working against W Series, with organisers unable to invite as many guests, including potential investors, to the paddock due to pandemic restrictions.Joining F1 and the rising cost of living came with its own financial challenges, but it was the loss of promised investment that never arrived that ultimately caused the curtailment last season.Ley\u2019s joint administrator Harry Shinners encouraged interested parties to step forward in hopes of saving the series.RecommendedEngland batter Dan Lawrence to join Surrey from Essex on three-year dealLeighton Clarkson set to join Aberdeen on permanent deal\u2018Incredible\u2019 Ashes record secured Stuart Broad\u2019s Edgbaston place \u2013 Ben StokesHe added: \u201cThe joint administrators will explore all available options to allow the W Series to restart in the future.

I can remember as a boy watching highlights briefly of the \u201875-76 series in Australia when England were getting pounded by Lillee and Thompson and then Beefy\u2019s Ashes in \u201981, which was about the only day of Test cricket I went to before I played,\u201d Atherton, who now commentates on cricket for Sky Sports, told The Independent.\u201cSo, it\u2019s been a constant throughout my life and I think that\u2019s the same for a lot of people and that\u2019s why people hold it dear.\u201cBecause the game is changing so rapidly before our eyes and you\u2019ve got this thing that doesn\u2019t change. Five Test matches between two sides, and that\u2019s a constant and it\u2019s a reassuring constant.\u201dAtherton\u2019s England never won an Ashes series, in fact during the 1990s when he opened the batting, the team won just 26 matches, losing 43 and with 38 draws.\u201cI haven\u2019t got very many good ones (memories) because I never won the Ashes of course,\u201d Atherton said.\u201cWhat I do remember is I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more nervous than opening the batting in an Ashes series in Australia.\u201cI was thinking of Rory Burns last time, and he obviously got bowled first ball of the series. It took me back actually to Australia and batting in 1990-91, when I was about 23.\u201cI just remember the nerves on that first morning in Brisbane, my heart was pounding and it was a full house. It was about the most nerve-wracking thing you can do as a cricketer, so I still remember that vividly.\u201cIt all came rushing back to me when Rory Burns lost his leg stump.\u201dCharlotte Edwards made her debut in a skirt, and played 13 Ashes Tests  (Getty Images)Charlotte Edwards13 Test matches, 26 innings, 1,026 runs, highest score 114 not out, average 48.85. 44 one-day internationals against Australia, 1,092 runs, average 26.63, 25 T20 matches, average 25.20, 605 runsEdwards made her debut before any money had trickled down into the women\u2019s game, and certainly long before professionalism, she recalls making her debut in a skirt, and having to pay for her own England blazer.\u201cI played my first Ashes in \u201998, it was a three-match Test series, so very different to what that series looks like now,\u201d Edwards told The Independent.\u201cI just loved it, I think you grow up watching Ashes series and you want to play in them and then to be a part of it and to have that experience of playing against Australia was special and they were such a great team at the time.\u201cThen I guess it was winning the Ashes in 2005 was probably one of the highlights of my career.

I was sent off. Missed the final.\u201dAfter six years at Leeds, the offer came in from Old Trafford to make McQueen the most expensive ever signing by a British club, a year after Hamburg splashed out \u00a3500,000 to sign Kevin Keegan from Liverpool.He helped his new club reach the 1978-79 FA Cup final in his first full season and played his part in one of the most dramatic matches the competition has witnessed, his 86th-minute goal sparking a late United comeback from 2-0 down to 2-2 against Arsenal, only for Alan Sunderland\u2019s 89th-minute goal to win it for the Gunners.He did claim an FA Cup winners\u2019 medal in 1982-83 following a replay win over Brighton, but suffered defeat in the League Cup final that same year against Liverpool.On the international front, McQueen made his debut for Scotland in 1974, with his most memorable moment in dark blue coming against England at Wembley in 1977.He powered a header past Ray Clemence \u2013 one of five international goals he scored \u2013 to set Scotland on their way to a famous 2-1 win in front of almost 100,000 fans, 70,000 of them travelling Scots.The wild celebrations that followed have gone down in football folklore, with hoards of jubilant Scotland fans invading the pitch. Supporters clambered on to the goal frames, even breaking a crossbar, while bits of the Wembley turf were ripped up and claimed as souvenirs.McQueen was included in Scotland\u2019s squad for the 1978 World Cup, but could not play in the tournament due to injury. He won the last of his 30 caps in 1981.Following seven years at Old Trafford, he left the club in 1985 after losing his place to Paul McGrath and, after a brief spell in Hong Kong, he retired and took the managerial reins at Airdrie before moving on to backroom roles at St Mirren and Middlesbrough, where he settled down with his family.McQueen was a smoker and drinker throughout his career in an era when it was rife among footballers.After his cancer diagnosis in 2011, he had a further health scare in 2015 when he suffered a stroke in the same month his father died.It affected his movement, despite sessions of physiotherapy, and meant he had to scale back the scouting work he did for Boro.RecommendedEngland batter Dan Lawrence to join Surrey from Essex on three-year dealLeighton Clarkson set to join Aberdeen on permanent deal\u2018Incredible\u2019 Ashes record secured Stuart Broad\u2019s Edgbaston place \u2013 Ben StokesIn February 2021 it was announced he had been diagnosed with vascular dementia, with his family saying that he wondered whether the amount of heading of the ball he did throughout his career was a factor in him getting the disease.McQueen is survived by wife Yvonne, daughters Hayley and Anna, son Edward and grandchildren Rudi, Etta and Ayla."}, {"_id": "648b23be51ac33150be9296e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league-vincent-kompany-burnley-mauricio-pochettino-turf-moor-b2358036.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vincent Kompany eager for \u2018perfect\u2019 season start when Burnley face Man City", "lead": "The Treble winners will visit Turf Moor to face their former captain\u2019s newly-promoted side on the evening of Friday, August 11.", "author": "Robert O'Connor", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 13:58:50 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:14.402805", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T13:58:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/09/b7c7ae27c56c6a6ae6870c2dcd0fe660Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTAwNzk0-2.71431459.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It is likely to be a theme of this international break, along with jokes about Jack Grealish\u2019s last few days.Gareth Southgate may be largely set on the spine of his team, but the players that form that spine are very far from set on their futures.All of Harry Kane, Mason Mount, Declan Rice and Harry Maguire are currently negotiating their futures, with Jude Bellingham having just completed a deal with Real Madrid, and ongoing interest in Jordan Pickford. If any of them step out, as is likely to be the case in forgiving fixtures against Malta and North Macedonia, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher also face uncertainty.The potential Euro 2024 winners may well have a huge influence on the summer 2023 market. Some of them are still subject to wider forces, though.The race for goalscorers is the main market this summer, but that has now been entirely reshaped by Kylian Mbappe\u2019s simple decision to tell Paris Saint-Germain he won\u2019t be extending his contract from 2024. It has already had an effect on Kane\u2019s future.RecommendedOne year to Euro 2024: Who is on the plane for England and who has work to do?Bellingham gone but who\u2019s next? Midfield merry-go-round will define summerLiverpool\u2019s must-add midfielder and Haaland 2.0 to Man Utd: Transfer targets for every Premier League clubReal Madrid have had serious interest in the striker, to the point they have made it clear they will meet any wage demands, and are willing to negotiate with Daniel Levy. Some well-placed sources even maintained last week that a deal was \u201ca lot closer than has even been made out\u201d. The Tottenham Hotspur chairman is increasingly mindful of losing out on around \u00a3100m of rebuilding money for the sake of a season of football and is seen as more willing to do business than ever before. There is also the gradual realisation that it might make some sense to take the money for a player going into his thirties, brilliant as he is, especially as Ange Postecoglou has his own ideas on a team.Madrid could have offered a clean solution, especially as Levy does not want to sell to another Premier League club. It is suddenly a lot more complicated.Harry Kane\u2019s future has suddenly become complicated  (Getty Images)Madrid had planned to bring in Kane for two years before then going big on either Erling Haaland or \u2013 more likely \u2013 Mbappe. The French star\u2019s sudden willingness to move has changed that, especially as it could force PSG\u2019s hand. All of a sudden, people are not talking about Kane to Madrid as so close.It could open the way for Manchester United, who have gone back and forth on the idea of going for England\u2019s top scorer this window. The long-held stance has been that they just don\u2019t want to get into a stand-off with Levy but an increasing number of involved people have spoken of a shift in attitudes over the past few days. Kane\u2019s first choice in this market would similarly be to go to Old Trafford, especially as he wants to win the Premier League and break the goalscoring record.Erik ten Hag\u2019s insistence on a forward will meanwhile work against any move for Rice, who the Dutch coach does greatly admire. Ten Hag has asked to be kept informed of what is happening between the midfielder and Arsenal. United know it would take the Kane price to persuade West Ham United to sell, though, and even then they could get into a bidding war where they are already behind. West Ham are very close to a \u00a390m deal with Arsenal for Rice, with one of the remaining issues concerning the structure of the payments. The widespread expectation is that it gets done.In any case, Casemiro\u2019s influence puts off Ten Hag\u2019s need for that type of midfielder, with the focus on a No 8. The United manager realised towards the last few months of the season that his team needs that greater energy, and few combine that with a profound understanding of pressing instructions as effectively as Mount. Managers love him.There is currently a \u00a315m difference in valuation between United and Chelsea on transfer fee, but the Stamford Bridge club\u2019s need to sell indicates the deal should eventually get done. Ten Hag meanwhile needs to overhaul his squad, too, and it is striking that he wants to move on many of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s signings. This was something that became apparent much earlier in the season. Ten Hag doesn\u2019t have enough players sufficiently trained in that high-pressing approach.Mason Mount is edging closer to a move to Man Utd  (Getty Images)The most prominent of Solskjaer\u2019s signings is Harry Maguire, whose status has been diminished in the last two years. It hasn\u2019t helped that, in the last few weeks, Southgate has told him he has to move in order to keep his England place for Euro 2024. Many Premier League managers still share Southgate\u2019s admiration for Maguire, though, despite a difficult two years. Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are two clubs who would be willing to do a deal this summer, but the player\u2019s high wages mean that could be on loan.Should he go, United have had a look at Crystal Palace\u2019s Guehi, but their interest is not as strong as Arsenal\u2019s. Conor Gallagher meanwhile has a series of upper mid-table sides interested, although his own future could be influenced by that of James Maddison. Whoever doesn\u2019t get the Leicester City midfielder may move for Gallagher. That is if anyone does get Maddison.Relegation has not seen Leicester\u2019s demands change, though, and their asking price is described as \u201cexorbitant\u201d.While Tottenham and Newcastle United had designs on paying \u00a345m for Maddison, Leicester want closer to \u00a380m.Financial Fair Play constraints mean Newcastle can\u2019t quite go to such levels in the way their Saudi Arabian owners would want. The player\u2019s current preference is also to go to London for family reasons, although the reality of the market may change such ideals.RecommendedHow to watch Malta vs England Euro 2024 qualifier online and on TVMalta vs England team news and predicted line-ups for Euro 2024 qualifierOne year to Euro 2024: Who is on the plane for England?It has very much changed the mood around Southgate\u2019s squad right now.

It was a shock, obviously nobody expected that and it was a horrible, horrible night.\u201cI had left Dale Youth at that point but I still knew all the people there, Gary McGuiness and Tony, so I have great memories of Dale Youth.\u201cMe, Hassan (Azim) and Adam (Azim), we all started at Dale Youth and we\u2019re all under the same promotion and same banner. It is pretty amazing to be in this moment now.\u201cAnyone who has watched me or seen me since the beginning of my journey, I hope they are proud and happy for me.\n\nEvery time I step into the ring, I want people to say, 'that girl Caroline was special,' and I want people to take notice of me and respect the performances I put inCaroline Dubois\u201cTony always used to say I would go to the Olympics and I would be special. And here I am, trying my hardest to make sure his words come true.\u201dBefore Dubois (6-0, 5KOs) started to work with Disson, she had spent time at the historic Repton Boxing Club where brother Daniel trained.Remarkably, Dubois pretended to be a boy called Colin when as a nine-year-old girl she sparred for the first time.She quickly got the bug for boxing and more than a decade down the line \u2013 after watching Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become household names after winning gold medals at the London Games \u2013 is thankful no other girls will experience a similar journey.Dubois added: \u201cIt is definitely a funny story now and I look back in hindsight just like, \u2018wow\u2019.\u201cWhat an experience, what a journey and what a story that I can tell.

The likes of Christian Eriksen, Simon Kjaer, and Andreas Christensen have been operating at the top level for years, while in 20-year-old striker Rasmus Hojlund they have one of the hottest properties in European football.

That loss, in Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first home game in charge since his return to the job in December, was a reality check after the away win in San Marino a few days earlier, and made clear that even if Northern Ireland have been handed a relatively favourable draw for this qualifying campaign, they still face an uphill task to get out of Group H.Injuries still bitingO\u2019Neill has been able to welcome back Jonny Evans, Ali McCann and Shayne Lavery after they missed the March window through injury, but the likes of Steven Davis, Stuart Dallas, Corry Evans, Shane Ferguson and Josh Magennis remain out, robbing O\u2019Neill of vital experience.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was a bad night for Josh Taylor in the Garden ring in New York City on Saturday. Taylor was beaten by Teofimo Lopez over 12 rounds in a shock defeat. It was certainly not the fight that Taylor expected. Taylor suffered defeat for the first time in 20 fights, he lost his one remaining world championship belt and at the end he offered no excuses. \u201cThe better man won,\u201d he managed, his voice crackling with emotions. Taylor was putting on a brave face to mask the despair. It had been a fiery and ugly build-up and Lopez had talked of killing Taylor in the ring. Lopez, who has his own personal battles away from the ring, apologised for the comment and received a peck on the cheek for his honesty. \u201cIt\u2019s all song and dance,\u201d Taylor told him. It was an oddly respectful end to a week of promises, insults and stupid claims.It was also glorious redemption for Lopez, once the No 1 at lightweight. Lopez had lost his way on both sides of the ropes, and finished his last fight asking his team live on air if he still \u201chad it\u201d? It was a difficult interview to watch; on Saturday in the ring in the Garden\u2019s basement theatre, Lopez rediscovered the form most people thought had vanished. He is still only 25, by the way. RecommendedTeofimo Lopez hands Josh Taylor his first defeat with decision win in New YorkJosh Taylor says move up to welterweight is \u2018imminent\u2019 after first career defeatMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchIt was a close fight that Lopez won clearly and that often happens when two very good boxers meet. One judge, Benoit Roussel, scored it wide in Lopez\u2019s favour. His 9-3 verdict was too wide, to be honest. The other two judges, Steve Gray and Joseph Pasquale, returned identical scores of 115-113, which means 7-5 in rounds in Lopez\u2019s favour. Taylor never complained, but had he won the last round, he would have retained his title with a majority drawn verdict. Instead, Taylor had to surrender his beloved world championship belt. Last year, Taylor held all four belts at super-lightweight before slowly losing the struggle to keep the quartet of baubles in a protracted series of skirmishes with the sanctioning bodies. Taylor has not fought since February of last year and had been placed under relentless pressure to carry out his mandatory requirements. He surrendered, under threat of being stripped, three belts and was left with just the WBO; he was still considered the best at his weight. Taylor, incidentally, had won all four belts in a series of fights against six men with a combined record of 133 wins and not one loss. Taylor was, make no mistake, the best in the world at his weight. That changed in the Garden ring. Taylor (left) came up short on all three judges\u2019 scorecards  (AP)Lopez was too mobile, too slick and Taylor was just off the pace. It is not a tricky fight to understand; Lopez just worked that bit harder. Taylor had talked before about moving away from the 140-pound limit of super-lightweight and going to welterweight. In New York late on Saturday, there was also talk of a rematch. Taylor will let the loss settle and then make a decision, but hopefully he will not take another 16-month break. On the same night, it was the Sunny Edwards show at Wembley Arena and he retained his IBF flyweight title for the fourth time. On his undercard, Nina Hughes retained her WBA bantamweight title over 10 rounds against Katie Healy and in the bloody fight of the night, Ellie Scotney won the IBF super-bantamweight title. Scotney, having just her seventh fight, was too smart, tough and determined for New Zealand\u2019s Cherneka Sugar Johnson. There was a dark and deep cut by Johnson\u2019s right eye for most of the blood-splattered fight. Scotney was quite brilliant, Johnson\u2019s five M\u0101ori-haka men stole the show with their routine before she walked to the ring. It was her highlight, they were exceptional.Sunny Edwards with promoter Eddie Hearn (PA)Edwards was a clear winner of nine of the 12 rounds, but the Chilean Andres Campos kept it competitive. \u201cI need tests,\u201d Edwards admitted. And he does and the tests might start later this year. And I hope so, Edwards has the style, craft and personality to be a big attraction.

Rodriguez can be enticed over for a December showdown. That, by the way, is a super fight. Edwards won clearly, Hughes did the same, Scotney\u2019s win was hard but clear and in New York, in the basement theatre at the Garden once evocatively known as the Felt Forum, Taylor was left wondering what went wrong.

It is a naked place, preparing to bowl the first ball of a most-likely doomed Ashes series in a bearpit like the Gabba, surrounded by a wall of 40,000 rabid Brisbanites who do not wish you well and are vocally letting you know about it. As he ran towards the crease the noise grew louder. Harmison has tried many times to explain what happened next, why the ball flew diagonally out of his grasp, skidded off the wicket and ended up in the lap of captain Andrew Flintoff at second slip. \u201cI froze,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cMy whole body was nervous. I could not get my hands to stop sweating. The first ball slipped out of my hands, the second did as well and, after that, I had no rhythm, nothing.\u201dHaving stewed on it for more than a decade, he said in 2017: \u201cI was trying far too hard to bowl too fast. Did I freeze? Possibly. I just think I tried too hard.\u201dSteve Harmison and Justin Langer watch his delivery fly towards Freddie Flintoff at second slip  (Getty)It is something unique in Test cricket before that first ball is bowled \u2013 the wait. The batsman shuffles on his crease, the wicketkeeper claps his gloves, the umpire straightens his hat. The morning sun has just emerged over the stadium and it feels like the start of something, something that may be magical or dramatic or destructive \u2013 no one yet knows what, but it will definitely be something. After all the build-up and preparation and mind games, the world slows down in those last few seconds before an Ashes series finally begins. And perhaps the ability of a lead bowler or batsman to handle that moment, that scrutiny, can ripple across the grass and take hold of a team.Harmison\u2019s famous wide has long been credited with \u201csetting the tone\u201d for what was to come: England meekly surrendering the Ashes in a 5-0 whitewash. But does the first ball of the series really indicate \u2013 even influence \u2013 what follows?RecommendedA look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerMost opening balls down the years have been uneventful, offering little in the way of a forecast, but there have been some significant moments. In 1994, Michael Slater bludgeoned England\u2019s stand-in fast bowler Phil DeFreitas\u2019s first delivery to the Gabba boundary, then proceeded to rack up a merciless 176. Needless to say, Australia won the series.\u201cI suppose DeFreitas being cut for four first ball did set the tone,\u201d Phil Tufnell later reflected. \u201cAt the time it really didn\u2019t feel like the end of the world. We just thought: \u2018Oh right, that\u2019s gone for four, next ball.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a groan around the fielders or anything. It\u2019s only looking back you can see that it was one of those moments.\u201dIn the previous Ashes before his infamous wide, Harmison had opened the 2005 series with a fierce over of pace and bounce at Lord\u2019s. The first ball whistled between Justin Langer\u2019s off-stump and his nose, and the second crashed into the batsman\u2019s arm. Yet England lost that Test convincingly, and it was only later that they rallied to eventual victory.Then there was 2010, when Australian bowler Ben Hilfenhaus served up a loose opener in Brisbane which Andrew Strauss comfortably let by. Strauss\u2019s control of the situation was mirrored by England\u2019s performance as they clinched a 3-1 victory and won their first Ashes on Australian soil for 24 years. Yet that first delivery was no omen: Strauss was out two balls later, caught behind for a duck.Andrew Strauss loses his wicket to Ben Hilfenhaus (Getty)Langer certainly believed Harmison\u2019s wide ball in 2006 was more significant than the value of one Australian run, after which \u201cEngland\u2019s body language seemed flat and even a little intimidated\u201d.\u201cTo be perfectly truthful, I felt let down after that first ball,\u201d Langer said. \u201cIt was such a comedown after Lord\u2019s in 2005, where I remember the ball flying past my nose to Geraint Jones. I looked around and England were looking at their toes. It was just a huge letdown and that first ball was really key.\u201dHarmison rejects that idea. \u201cThat ball in Brisbane on the 2006-07 Ashes tour didn\u2019t set the tone,\u201d he wrote in his book, Speed Demons. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough to beat Australia, whether that first ball of the series happened or not.\u201dPerhaps \u201csetting the tone\u201d is just an easy answer with hindsight. What the first ball really can do is solidify a feeling in the air. Australia were overwhelming favourites when England turned up in Brisbane again in 2021, and that sense of inevitability was quickly reinforced. Mitchell Starc started the series with an 88mph swinger which wrapped around Rory Burns\u2019 legs and clattered the stumps. The \u201cGabbatoir\u201d had another first-ball victim. Burns\u2019 Test career never recovered, and neither did England, losing the match by nine wickets and the series 4-0. Burns was memorably bowled by Starc with the first ball of the 2021 series (PA)RecommendedSteve Smith holds fond memories of Edgbaston as he prepares for Ashes battleNew English ground to host men\u2019s Ashes Test for first time in 2027A look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerThat was the last \u201cfirst ball\u201d. England have sparked an unimaginable shift in the Test cricket landscape since then. The next one could be James Anderson to David Warner, or perhaps Starc to Zak Crawley. For all England\u2019s talk of fearless cricket, Crawley pumping the first ball to the Edgbaston boundary would be an apt way to spell out what\u2019s to come this summer.England would do well to be wary, though \u2013 they have generally been on the wrong end of most dramatic Ashes starts, and head coach Brendon McCullum knows the consequences of going hard early. He tried to knock out the floodlights at the start of the 2015 World Cup final, only to swing and miss, handing over New Zealand\u2019s most prized wicket. The bowler that day was Starc too, and Australia never looked back."}, {"_id": "648b23c351ac33150be92987", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/carabao-cup-2023-24-fixtures-schedule-b2358070.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carabao Cup 2023/24 fixture dates and schedule revealed", "lead": "<p>Manchester United will defend the trophy after defeating Newcastle in last year\u2019s final</p>", "author": "Jack Rathborn", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 10:09:42 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:19.260243", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T10:09:42+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/27/17/GettyImages-1469828793.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Fighting for Team GB, he had watched through the stream of blood trickling over his right eye as Bakhodir Jalolov took home a silver medal for Uzbekistan, yet there was little room in his mind or heart for disappointment. \u201cIt was just crazy,\u201d he explains to The Independent, \u201cbecause he had won the fight \u2013 his team were clapping and celebrating \u2013 but I looked up at all the Team GB boxers, staff, coaches, then at my corner... and I was just elated with happiness. \u201cEveryone was so proud. We Brits made more noise than anyone in there. There was Covid, so there was no crowd, but there was about 15 of my teammates, staff, coaches and friends. There\u2019s a picture online somewhere of me with open arms, looking up at them. I was just so elated, because it was the end of a big chapter in my life and I feel like I\u2019d done myself proud, I\u2019d done Burton-on-Trent proud, and I hope I\u2019d done everyone in the country proud.\u201dFrazer Clarke reflects on Olympic boxing glory as he prepares for biggest pro fight yetRecommendedBoxer Frazer Clarke reflects on Olympic glory ahead of Wach fightErrol Spence Jr and Terence Crawford leave crowd in laughter with \u2018fishing\u2019 analogyJosh Taylor plunged into the unknown as Teofimo Lopez earns redemptive winClarke had done just that, endearing himself to the public back in Britain and joining the unique pool of athletes to have secured eternal legacies by competing \u2013 and winning a medal \u2013 at an Olympic Games.\u201cThere\u2019s a great saying: You\u2019re not just an Olympian for an Olympic Games; you\u2019re an Olympian for life,\u201d the 31-year-old says. \u201cSomeone explained it to me well: If you were to put everyone in the world in one place and colour in the Olympians, you\u2019re a small minority \u2013 you\u2019ve done something fantastic; then you do the medalists a different colour, you\u2019re an even more special minority. It\u2019s something I\u2019m extremely proud of, and it\u2019s good for myself massively, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I think to give inspiration to children or other people with a dream who probably think, \u2018It ain\u2019t going to happen for me...\u2019 I was that person. \u201cI wasn\u2019t athletically blessed, I wasn\u2019t the toughest, fastest or fittest, but I had a really good determination and learned to keep good people around me. It also took me to the dreamland; it took an overweight kid who was unconfident, to walk into a boxing gym, to be in Tokyo in front of the eyes of the world and live his dream.

Despite encouraging signs this week, boxing will still not \u2013 as it stands \u2013 feature at the 2028 Games, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accused the International Boxing Association (IBA) of governance issues and alleged corruption. The IBA typically runs boxing at each Olympics, though the IOC did so in Tokyo amid the IBA\u2019s ongoing suspension.Asked about the prospect of boxing being omitted from the 2028 Olympics, a crestfallen Clarke sighs: \u201cI think it\u2019s a tragedy, I really do. \u201cYou take the boxing away, and the boxers, and that\u2019s taken a lot of character out of the Olympics. Anyone that\u2019s been at the Olympic Games, in the Olympic Village, they know about the boxers \u2013 they know what boxing brings. It brings excitement, it brings an unbelievable skill, and people are quite fascinated by what [we] have to go through. \u201cAnd remember, this sport inspires kids. It keeps kids safe, it saves so many lives every single year, it will save generations. To take the Olympic dream away \u2013 not from the people in this cycle, but the eight, nine or 10-year-olds who are joining boxing clubs now... They\u2019ve got to keep it in the Olympics. Simple as that.\u201dClarke is 6-0 as a professional, with five knockout wins to his name  (Action Images via Reuters)It is a passionate plea from Clarke as he looks into the future, but his focus is quickly pulled back to the present, where he will face his toughest test yet as a professional on Friday.At London\u2019s York Hall, the 6-0 Briton (5 knockouts) takes on resilient Polish heavyweight Mariusz Wach, a man who has fought the likes of Dillian Whyte, Alexander Povetkin, Wladimir Klitschko and Jarrell Miller. Still, he is not the foe whom Clarke originally eyed, with \u201cBig Fraze\u201d left frustrated last month when a British title fight with Fabio Wardley fell through.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of controversy with my career over the last eight weeks, probably more than ever with the British title situation, so I think it\u2019s good to not worry about anyone else, what people are saying online or in papers and magazines. Strip it back, do what you do best, be in the gym and be aware that this is your toughest fight to date.\u201cI feel like with myself and boxing, there\u2019s always a story,\u201d Clarke adds. \u201cThere\u2019s always some form of drama.\u201d On Friday night, he will hope the story is a short, simple one \u2013 ending with another knockout in his favour.Click here to subscribe to The Independent\u2019s Sport YouTube channel for all the latest sports videos."}, {"_id": "648b23c751ac33150be9299f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league-fixtures-opening-day-23-24-b2357987.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Opening day fixtures 2023/24: Every Premier League match in first round of games", "lead": "<p>Chelsea host Liverpool, Arsenal are home to Nottingham Forest and Man United entertain Wolves on Monday </p>", "author": "Karl Matchett", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 09:37:09 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:23.901782", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T09:37:09+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/08/GettyImages-1489764383.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeParis Saint-Germain had long expected Kylian Mbappe\u2019s letter, such was his overt dissatisfaction with how everything was going, but that was emphatically not the case with the rest of Europe. Monday\u2019s news that the French star would not be signing his one-year contract extension caused \u201ca scramble\u201d around the continent\u2019s top clubs.\u201cNobody was prepared for this,\u201d one well-placed figure says. It instantly saw a number of sporting departments do a lot of investigation on Tuesday, to see if any deal might be possible. That\u2019s the power of Mbappe, who has probably succeeded Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in becoming one player who clubs will drop everything for.It also speaks to that power that the player\u2019s camp didn\u2019t even feel the need to reach out to potential suitors beforehand. There were no backdoor soundings here. The door was instead blown off, with Mbappe himself then casually insisting he would still see out next season with PSG.That is dependent on a range of circumstances. Mbappe\u2019s decision came down to some simple factors, though.While the primary issue was the club\u2019s failure to progress at Champions League level, he is also conscious of how globally sidelined he is for most of the club season. Mbappe only really plays in about eight high-profile matches a year outside of tournaments, if even that. It is why so much is built up to those Champions League last-16 games.RecommendedKylian Mbappe breaks silence after speculation over PSG exitWhat next for Kylian Mbappe? Real Madrid, Man Utd and other options for PSG forwardHow Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridAn irony is that this is a world PSG have also created. Their 2011 takeover fostered an almost one-team league in France, that just doesn\u2019t command attractive broadcasting offers outside the country or Qatari station BeIn Sport. Mbappe destroying Ajaccio and Guingamp may make for a nice highlight reel on social media, but the interest for most fans doesn\u2019t last beyond the time it takes to scroll up the feed.Mbappe\u2019s exploits at domestic level don\u2019t move the needle  (Getty)It\u2019s all the more incongruous a situation given that Mbappe is the first player to truly realise the power that the Messi-Ronaldo era afforded the most famous players, especially those of his class. He gets it even more than they do.As such, he needs a move for the benefit of his life ambitions, not just his football ambitions.One increasing complication is that Mbappe faces a very modern dilemma. Just like Messi in 2021, his sheer value has actually limited his options.There are only a handful of clubs who could afford him in the current market.They are Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid. New Financial Fair Play constraints meanwhile limit that further.When one \u201cbig-six\u201d executive was asked on Tuesday whether his club would be interested in pursuing a move, they just laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201dCity have a long-standing interest in Mbappe from 2017, but they \u2013 again \u2013 have the issue that came up with Messi in 2020 and 2021. It would take a complete rearrangement of their squad in order to accommodate him.Man City face the same problem signing Mbappe that thye did when pursuing Messi  (Getty Images)This is really a profound illustration of FFP\u2019s positives, even as there is so much debate about the regulations. They are visibly preventing the same small group of clubs hoarding even more players.Many might consider that a bit of a joke given Chelsea\u2019s movements over the last year, but they almost need to sell an entire starting XI before they can even think of Mbappe.United offer a more interesting option, especially as they are actively looking for a No 9 \u2013 especially a fast one \u2013 and could come up with the budget. The issue is that it would prevent strengthening elsewhere, which raises another great variable in all of this. There remains the uncertainty of the sale of the club, as Qatar seek to buy United through Sheikh Jassim. PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi\u2019s involvement in discussions is now well known.Mbappe going to a Qatari-owned United could offer a clean solution for a lot of involved parties here, if not necessarily for the wider game. It would also display a further issue with state involvement in the sport, way beyond FFP.There are still a number of circumstances that need to change for that prospect to become a serious one, though.All of which again leaves Madrid as the most serious option. That has long felt like his career destiny, and the Spanish club have taken longer-term steps that make it even more likely. Madrid have spent the last few years reshaping their budget for more vintage Bernabeu outlay, and this had already been anticipated as the first summer window since 2019 where they go big.Even they didn\u2019t expect this Mbappe news, though.Real Madrid still appear the frontrunners to snap up Mbappe  (Getty Images)It has caused a rethink in their transfer plans, with that already from another rethink after the surprising departure of Karim Benzema for Saudi Arabia. The idea in the last two weeks had been that Madrid would bring in Jude Bellingham and a two-year option like Harry Kane \u2013 with that move more advanced than many had anticipated. Tuesday instead brought intensive talks about what to do next.Mbappe is there to be signed. Florentino Perez may have had a bit of a huff when the player rejected them for PSG last summer, with some Bernabeu executives even making empty claims about the French star never being allowed to play for Madrid in the future, but Monday night ensured all of that was forgotten in a flash.The main problem may be political rather than financial. Such is the current relationship between Madrid and PSG that Perez does not want to give the Qatari-owned project any money in terms of a fee, and PSG do not want to sell to Madrid.The French champions are \u201clivid\u201d at the entire situation, particularly with Mbappe himself.RecommendedFootball rumours: Man United, Real Madrid and Chelsea fight for Kylian MbappeKylian Mbappe breaks silence after speculation over PSG exitReal Madrid or Man Utd?

They were also FA Cup runners-up in 2021-22.Having finished second and then third in the WSL in the previous two seasons, the team missed out on the Champions League spots in 2022-23 with a fourth-placed finish.At the start of the campaign they were knocked out in the qualifying rounds of the European competition for a second successive year.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAfter seeing the likes of Lucy Bronze, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Caroline Weir leave the club last summer, City lost their first two league games, then bounced back by going unbeaten in the next 14, winning 12, before finishing with three defeats and three victories across their final six matches.Taylor, whose tenure has featured 79 wins from 109 games in all competitions to date, said: \u201cI\u2019m very happy to have signed a new deal with the club \u2013 it feels great to have gotten it over the line.\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be able to commit to City for another season, and 2023-24 is one that I\u2019m so excited about.\u201cWe have been in a transitional period over the past 12 months, and the women\u2019s game has changed so much during my three years in charge.\n\nI know that there is pressure on us to succeed, but I enjoy that \u2013 I have always challenged myself throughout my career and that\u2019s now more important than ever as a coachGareth Taylor\u201cWe were fortunate to win trophies in each of my first two seasons, and although we haven\u2019t been successful on that front this past year, the pride I\u2019ve taken has come in different forms.\u201cI\u2019ve really felt that it has been so enjoyable in terms of where the team is at, where I think that they can go and what they can achieve for this football club.\u201cI know that there is pressure on us to succeed, but I enjoy that \u2013 I have always challenged myself throughout my career and that\u2019s now more important than ever as a coach.\u201cI really want to try and squeeze every single last drop out of what I feel I\u2019m able to do personally, and I believe that this group of players have the ability to turn those nearly moments into actual moments with the support of myself and the staff to get us to the next level.\u201dManaging director Gavin Makel said: \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have Gareth commit himself to the club for another year.\u201cTogether, we are building an exciting team full of talented players, both young and experienced, all with a shared vision of beautiful football and on-pitch success.RecommendedAustralia must put aside team ego to end winless run in England \u2013 John BuchananGolf\u2019s shock merger could face multiple legal challenges \u2013 Competition lawyerWales take aim at Armenia as Euro 2024 qualifying heats up \u2013 5 talking points\u201cGareth is someone who embraces the City Football Group methodology in its entirety, and it has been really pleasing to see him grow as a coach over the past three years.\u201cNils (Nielsen, the team\u2019s director of football) and I are very much looking forward to continuing our work with him next season alongside this amazing group of players, with the future being incredibly bright for Manchester City.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23c851ac33150be929a5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/charles-oliveira-ufc-career-b2355884.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Meet Charles Oliveira, the UFC\u2019s miracle man", "lead": "<p>The Brazilian was told aged 7 that he may become paraplegic.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf it is a miracle that Charles Oliveira can walk, perhaps no word exists to sufficiently describe the Brazilian\u2019s UFC career.Up until he was seven years old, Oliveira was no different than any of the other children in the impoverished favela of Vicente de Carvalho in Guaruja, Sao Paulo; he spent every waking moment playing football, apathetic to the dearth of opportunities in the village, determined to convert his passion for the sport into a career. While the conditions in Vicente de Carvalho were not exactly the type to incubate Oliveira\u2019s dream, he decided that they were also not the type to extinguish it. Remarkably, neither was a doctor\u2019s prognosis that Oliveira could become paraplegic.The Brazilian received the news aged seven, a result of his affliction by Rheumatic fever, which left him in frequent, intense pain and even unable to walk at times. To add insult to illness, Oliveira was also diagnosed with a heart murmur.Twenty-six years on, he is one of the greatest mixed martial artists on the planet.While Oliveira\u2019s dream of becoming a professional footballer did not materialise, he was nevertheless able to overcome his illness to excel at jiu-jitsu and go on to become one of Brazil\u2019s most inspiring sporting figures: a UFC lightweight champion, and a fighter with more finishes and submission wins than any other in the company\u2019s history.RecommendedFull UFC 289 card featuring Amanda Nunes vs Irene AldanaVettori vs Cannonier and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendWhat time does Vettori vs Cannonier start in UK and US this weekend?\u201cWith my illness, I never thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve my dreams,\u201d Oliveira told The Independent over Zoom in 2022, his t-shirt seemingly on the verge of disintegration from the sweat induced by an afternoon spent training.Oliveira won the UFC lightweight title in 2021 with a knockout of Michael Chandler  (Getty Images)\u201cI always believed and had a lot of faith that any dream I had, I could achieve it. Of course, as with any kid at the time, I just wanted to play football and have a future in that. But sports in general in Brazil are complicated; there aren\u2019t many opportunities for everyone, so I knew it would be hard. But I just kept my faith and believed everything would happen the way I wanted.\u201dJust as Oliveira, a devout Christian, refused to view his early ailments as divine signs that he was not destined to become an athlete, he refused to accept moments of adversity in his first UFC title shot and first defence as signs that he was not supposed to be a champion. Having debuted in the UFC in 2010 and endured inconsistent stints at featherweight and lightweight, it took Oliveira 11 years and a stupefying 28 fights to secure his first title shot in the promotion. In that bout, against Michael Chandler in May 2021, Oliveira was on the verge of being knocked out late in the first round. Within seven seconds of the second frame, \u201cDo Bronx\u201d had knocked down the American, completely turning the tide to knock out Chandler moments later. Then, that December, the champion was the underdog in his defence against Dustin Poirier, who knocked down Oliveira twice in the first round. The jiu-jitsu black belt, whose mentor in the art was killed in a shooting in Vicente de Carvalho when Oliveira was just 14, somehow remained composed and stuck to his gameplan. He targeted Poirier\u2019s body with kicks and knees, wearing down the American on the feet then on the ground with his grappling, before submitting the former interim champion in the third round.Dustin Poirier twice knocked down Oliveira but was ultimately submitted by the Brazilian (Getty Images)\u201cIt\u2019s an evolution, I\u2019m always evolving,\u201d Oliveira explained to The Independent, later joking that his eyesight is so poor that he sees three versions of his opponent during a bout. \u201cA fighter can\u2019t only know how to hit; he needs to know how to take a hit and stay calm and get over it. I was in trouble at some points in those fights, but I kept my head in the game, kept composed and knew that I couldn\u2019t waste any opportunity that I had.\u201cAgainst Dustin... we\u2019re talking about MMA, it\u2019s unpredictable. So, I knew I had to keep an eye on him anyway, but each round I was improving, growing, and he was getting tired. He was looking at the clock the whole time, especially after the middle of the first round. I knew that I surprised him; he was hitting me and I was still moving forward. I knew then that he was in trouble in some way, and that things were looking better on my end than his.\u201cI always say I want to bring joy and boldness to the Octagon, and I feel like I did that [against Chandler and Poirier]. I was shocking the world and showing everyone I\u2019m not just one more fighter; I\u2019m Charles Oliveira, I am the champion. I showed how much I can evolve and have evolved, so I had a lot of fun in there and just shut up everyone who was criticising me.\u201dOliveira celebrates his title victory at UFC 262 (Getty Images)Oliveira suffered from Rheumatic fever and a heart murmur as a child (Getty Images)Oliveira\u2019s victory over Chandler \u2013 to claim the belt vacated by Khabib Nurmagomedov \u2013 was followed by jubilant celebrations from the 33-year-old, who jumped over the fence and shouted joyously at Joe Rogan at the commentary desk, before sprinting around the arena to share the moment with his friends and family \u2013\u00a0as well as fans, whose adoration for the fighter was at this point accelerating with every bout. Shortly thereafter, UFC president Dana White wrapped the belt around Oliveira\u2019s waist, but the Brazilian took it off to run around the ring with the gold clutched against his chest like a child with their favourite stuffed toy.\u201cWhile Dana was putting the belt around my waist, I just kept thinking about everything I\u2019d gone through, everyone that said I wouldn\u2019t get the belt, that I wasn\u2019t talented enough to get there,\u201d Oliveira recalled. \u201cI was just thinking about my faith and how much I worked, believed and bled to get to that place. All I have right now is just gratitude for everything I\u2019ve achieved so far.\u201dWhile Oliveira\u2019s celebrations after his title win were ecstatic, he followed his victory over Poirier with the calmest of reactions, strolling slowly and stony-faced across the Octagon while pointing to the ceiling, acknowledging his faith. \u201cMy first title shot, my friends and family were there, it was the first time I\u2019d been in that position,\u201d Oliveira told The Independent. \u201cIt was achieving a dream after 11 years of hard work, so that\u2019s why I reacted that way. The second time actually, with Dustin, the commission warned me before that I couldn\u2019t jump the cage or anything, because I would get fined. So, I had that in mind. That kind of made my celebration a little less crazy. But I felt the same way inside, so happy.\u201dWith his victories over Chandler and Poirier, Oliveira extended his win streak to 10, with all of those results having come via stoppage. Next up for the champion was Justin Gaethje \u2013 a former interim lightweight title holder, like Poirier. Oliveira lost his title on the scales but throttled Justin Gaethje one day later  (USA TODAY Sports)In a late twist, however, Oliveira would miss weight by half a pound, leading him to be stripped of his belt one day before his clash with Gaethje. An irate Oliveira ran through the American regardless, dropping the \u201cHighlight\u201d before wrapping him up like a boa constrictor and forcing Gaethje to tap in the first round. It marked an extension of Oliveira\u2019s already bewildering run of form, and set up a fight with a man on his own, extensive win streak: Islam Makhachev. The protege and childhood friend of Khabib was intended by Nurmagomedov\u2019s father and coach to be Khabib\u2019s successor \u2013 not Oliveira, though the Brazilian complicated those plans. Yet \u201cfather\u2019s plan\u201d was still fulfilled, if later than anticipated, when Makhachev produced a dominant display to hurt and submit Oliveira in the second round, finally ending \u201cDo Bronx\u201d\u2019s fairytale run. There was no shame in that loss, though Oliveira did not share that sentiment. As motivated as ever, the Brazilian returned to the ring a little over six months later to face Beneil Dariush, who \u2013\u00a0like Makhachev \u2013 had been on his own storming surge through the division. Many suggested that Oliveira had perhaps reached his peak and was due a downturn in fortunes. Instead? Oliveira brutalised Dariush with head kicks and punches to get his opponent out of the Octagon within a round.Islam Makhachev halted Oliveira\u2019s long winning run to win the vacant title  (AFP via Getty Images)Oliveira overwhelmed Beneil Dariush in the first round to bounce back from his loss to Makhachev  (Getty Images)RecommendedVettori vs Cannonier and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendWhat time does Vettori vs Cannonier start in UK and US this weekend?How to watch Vettori vs Cannonier online and on TV this weekendIt reaffirmed Oliveira\u2019s status in the division, and restored fans\u2019 belief in him.

That was a rare case of two coaches taking part in the programme but not fighting each other afterwards, and McGregor vs Chandler has been announced for later this year.No date, location or weight class has been confirmed, but both fighters have promised that the bout will go ahead.RecommendedConor McGregor mentee loses in eight seconds on The Ultimate FighterConor McGregor\u2019s team suffer more misfortune on The Ultimate FighterConor McGregor\u2019s team fall to 0-3 on The Ultimate FighterThe first episode of The Ultimate Fighter season 31 aired on Tuesday 30 May in the US, and on Thursday 1 June in the UK.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoxing matches tend to be organised as one of three types: professional, amateur or exhibition. But what is the difference between them?Generally speaking, most \u2018major\u2019 fights \u2013 including title fights \u2013 are professional bouts, while exhibition contests are those staged with more of a focus on the audience and entertainment. Most professional fighters have an amateur career before turning pro, and Olympic fights count as amateur bouts.For example, Anthony Joshua\u2019s Olympic gold-medal win in 2012 was part of his amateur career. Meanwhile, his heavyweight title fights with Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 and 2022 were professional bouts. Elsewhere, Floyd Mayweather\u2019s recent matches against YouTubers Logan Paul and Deji were exhibitions.All fights \u2013 professional, amateur and exhibition \u2013 must be licensed by a commission (e.g. fights in Las Vegas are regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission), but exhibition bouts do not need to be sanctioned by a governing body. In contrast, the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioned Tyson Fury\u2019s three fights with Deontay Wilder, as the WBC heavyweight title was on the line.Professional fights do not need to be title bouts, but they tend to have an effect on the rankings in the weight class in which they take place, as seeded by the governing body sanctioning the fight. I.e. Andy Ruiz Jr is the World Boxing Organization (WBO)\u2019s No 1-ranked fighter below its champions, while Wilder is ranked sixth. If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings.RecommendedFloyd Mayweather vs John Gotti III fight ends with mass brawl in ringJosh Taylor plunged into the unknown as Teofimo Lopez earns redemptive winThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound boxing rankingsFurthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men\u2019s boxing \u2013 a professional bout \u2013 will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women\u2019s world title fight will always be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples).Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter\u2019s record \u2013 and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared.Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib. Readers might expect such fights to be exhibitions, but they have in fact been organised as professional bouts, meaning Paul has a 6-0 record (4 KOs).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe boxing landscape is arguably as intriguing as it has ever been.The past few years have seen heavyweight epics for the ages between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, they have seen Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez establish himself as the face of the sport in the eyes of many fans, and they have seen frequent displays of technical brilliance from champions in lighter weight classes.There have been upsets, title unifications, and there has been no shortage of drama \u2013 Anthony Joshua\u2019s defeats by Andy Ruiz Jr and Oleksandr Usyk standing out as prime examples.All of these fights and results have factored into The Independent\u2019s own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s boxers, to be updated monthly. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.RecommendedTyson Fury promises \u2018imminent\u2019 announcement of \u2018big fight\u2019Joe Joyce on knockouts, oil painting, and teaching 60-year-olds to swimTyson Fury may be given mandatory challenger amid fruitless search for fightThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings10. Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight. RecommendedTyson Fury vs Anthony Joshua collapses yet againJoe Rogan is right: Tyson Fury has \u2018no chance in hell\u2019 against Jon JonesJosh Taylor plunged into the unknown as Teofimo Lopez earns redemptive winWith that second victory over Donaire, Inoue added the WBC belt to his collection of bantamweight titles, and he also surged to the top of this list from No 5.

While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.Before diving into the top 10, here are a couple of honourable mentions:RecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearBest seat in the house: UFC\u2019s commentary team on what it\u2019s like to be cageside for the biggest fights in the world\u2018The only rules? No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornColby Covington (17-3, welterweight)The former interim welterweight champion is one of the best 170lbers on the planet. While the American, 35, has lost both of his shots at undisputed gold, he pushed then-champion Kamaru Usman to the brink in both fights. Covington, a wrestling specialist, responded to his second defeat by Usman with a dominant points win over friend-turned-rival Jorge Masvidal in March 2022. He has not fought since.Stipe Miocic (20-4, heavyweight)The consensus heavyweight GOAT, the part-time firefighter holds the record for most successful title defences in the division \u2013 the hardest weight class at which to put together a sustained run. The American surrendered the belt to Francis Ngannou and the French-Cameroonian\u2019s freakish knockout power in March 2021, but prior to that achieved back-to-back wins against one of the greatest ever in Daniel Cormier. The veteran, 40, also holds a decision victory over Ngannou, plus wins against more UFC champions in Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Werdum and Andrei Arlovski. However, he has dropped out of our top 10 due to two years of inactivity. Miocic is expected to return in July, to challenge current heavyweight champion Jon Jones.Brandon Moreno (20-6-2, flyweight champion)Mexico\u2019s first ever UFC champion has just one loss in the last five years, though he has also competed in two competitive draws in that period \u2013 the most recent kickstarting the most entertaining run of his career. There was no winner when Moreno challenged Deiveson Figueiredo in 2020, but the \u201cAssassin Baby\u201d submitted the Brazilian in their 2021 rematch to win the gold. Figueiredo wrestled the belt back in a close trilogy bout last year, but Moreno claimed the interim title by stopping Kai Kara-France and went on to stop Figueiredo again this January. In doing so, he became a two-time undisputed champion.Top 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally.9. Robert Whittaker (24-6, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just twice in the last eight years. Both of those losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but each has come against a former world champion, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around). An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (25-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski is riding a 22-fight winning streak  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro loss came against a welterweight champion, until this February. Seven of the Australian\u2019s last eight fights have pitted him against \u2018elite\u2019 fighters, and in 2022 Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that title \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as Chad Mendes and Brian Ortega.RecommendedUFC schedule 2023: Every fight happening this yearMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchMMA great Amanda Nunes retires after win over Irene Aldana at UFC 289Volkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "648b23ca51ac33150be929ad", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/next-ufc-fight-event-june-schedule-2023-b2356611.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Next UFC Fight Night: Event start time, card and how to watch", "lead": "<p>All you need to know about the MMA promotion\u2019s upcoming fights</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 09:00:36 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:26.353688", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T09:00:36+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/10/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The United States Senate has already opened an investigation into it, with Senator Richard Blumenthal writing to PGA Tour chief executive Jay Monahan to say that the PGA Tour\u2019s \u201csudden and drastic reversal of position concerning LIV Golf\u201d raised \u201cserious questions\u201d.The PGA Tour insists this agreement is not a merger, and that the deal did not mean PIF now owned the PGA Tour. Instead, it says PIF will be investing in this new subsidiary of the PGA Tour, with the PGA Tour retaining majority ownership and control.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHowever, Andrew Evans, a partner at the law firm Irwin Mitchell, believes there are a number of hurdles for the new venture to overcome.\u201cEven though the structure for the PGA Tour/LIV merger is not known at present, competition law, or antitrust law as it is also known, tends to look at the economic impact of a merger regardless of the legal form it takes,\u201d he told the PA news agency.\u201cSo structuring the merger in a particular way, referring to it is a partnership\u00a0etc will not hugely affect the analysis from a competition law perspective.\u201dIn the United Kingdom mergers are the responsibility of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), while, in the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) are the bodies responsible.\n\nFor a worldwide business such as PGA Tour and LIV Golf there is lots of potential for regulators in many different jurisdictions to get involvedCompetition lawyer Andrew EvansHowever, Evans believes the global nature of golf at a commercial level means many more jurisdictions may take a look.\u201cFor a worldwide business such as PGA Tour and LIV Golf there is lots of potential for regulators in many different jurisdictions to get involved and investigate the merger and, in a worst-case scenario, block the merger,\u201d he said.\u201cWhilst there is little granular detail about how the merger will work and be implemented, hopefully the parties have already sought and obtained merger control advice.\u201cEven if they have, they may be in for an uncomfortable ride in some jurisdictions around the world before the merger, if cleared, is allowed to proceed.\u201cMerger investigations can also be very time-consuming and costly, with the full processes taking many months and potentially more than a year to conclude in some jurisdictions.\u201dEvans said regulators will be concerned about the \u201cdownstream\u201d and \u201cupstream\u201d impacts on competition that the deal might create.\u201cDownstream\u201d impacts might include the impact on broadcasters seeking to buy television rights.\u201cPrior to the merger both PGA Tour and LIV Golf would be in competition with each other to sell their respective television rights, and therefore each imposes a constraint on the other in relation to the price that they can charge as there is an alternative that anyone seeking to buy television rights has,\u201d Evans said.\u201cOnce they are merged and under common control that constraint is removed or reduced, particularly in a case where there is no other comparable worldwide golf tour, so there is no alternative choice.\u201cThat would allow the merged business to have greater market power and greater ability to dictate the price at which television rights would be sold.\u201dRecommendedAustralia must put aside team ego to end winless run in England \u2013 John BuchananWales take aim at Armenia as Euro 2024 qualifying heats up \u2013 5 talking pointsNick Hammond takes on short-term advisory role at Leeds\u201cUpstream\u201d rights could include the impact on players\u2019 earning potential, Evans said.\u201cThough professional golfers may not be a group most people would immediately think of as being worthy of protection, the impact the merger would have on them and the reduced choice as to which tour to join and on what terms, if both are controlled by the same operator, is another consideration,\u201d he added."}, {"_id": "648b23ca51ac33150be929b0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/tnt-sports-premier-league-fixtures-b2358032.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "TNT Sports reveals first Premier League game after Eurosport merger", "lead": "<p>The 2023/24 season will see TNT Sports enter the UK market following a BT Sport rebrand </p>", "author": "Jack Rathborn", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 08:59:34 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:26.875706", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T08:59:34+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/05/05/Soccer_Racism_England_44152.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe US Open returns to Los Angeles for the first time in 75 years as the major season continues.There is a sense of the unknown as the class of the men\u2019s golfing world head to the LA Country Club, which hosts the event for the first time.Free scoring would again appear unlikely with a challenging layout expected in California, with four gruelling rounds likely for a wide group of contenders.And the news of the merger between the PGA Tour and the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf Series only adds to the anticipation as Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Rory McIlroy and the rest of the potential challengers get ready to tee off.Groups to look out forMatt Fitzpatrick starts the defence of his US Open crown at 9.32pm BST on Thursday, with the Englishman playing alongside Australia\u2019s Cameron Smith, winner of the Open at St Andrews last July. The pair are joined by Sam Bennett, the American amateur who so impressed at the Masters earlier this spring.RecommendedMatt Fitzpatrick fully focused on US Open defence despite confusion over mergerRory McIlroy trying different approach to end major drought at US OpenUS Senate opens investigation into planned merger between PGA Tour and LIV GolfCould this be the weekend Rory McIlroy ends his long major drought? The Northern Irishman is joined in a talented three-ball by Japan\u2019s Hideki Matsuyama and Brooks Koepka, with the American hoping to continue an outstanding major season that brought success at the US PGA Championship last month. They start at 9.54pm on Thursday.Tommy Fleetwood showed his good touch in a narrow play-off defeat at the Canadian Open, and also has two major winners for company in the form of Shane Lowry and Justin Thomas. The trio are among the early starters on the opening day with a tee time of 3.40pm.Jon Rahm begins at 4.24pm with Viktor Hovland and Xander Schauffele, with all three likely to fancy their chances of a tilt at the title. That might also be true of the all-American group off at 4.13pm - it is headlined by Scottie Scheffler, the top-ranked player in the world, but Collin Morikawa shapes as a contender with his smooth iron play, and Max Homa is on home California soil and seeking a major tournament breakthrough.Here are the tee times for the first two rounds at Los Angeles Country Club:Round one: Thursday, 15

(Getty Images)A potential battle at the bottom could ensue - or will we by then see that the Clarets have done enough to survive, or the Toffees having improved from last year to avoid yet another relegation struggle?Luton vs Newcastle - 23 DecemberHow about this for an early Christmas present: the richest club in the world heading to the smallest club and ground in the Premier League.Suddenly-mighty Newcastle, who will have just about wrapped up their Champions League group stage at this point, head on 23 December to the 10,356 capacity Kenilworth Road. (PA Wire)That\u2019ll be the smallest in Premier League history if there are no major works done before the campaign gets underway, with tiny Luton proud of their home and ready to welcome the game\u2019s top stars there.Liverpool vs Man City - 9 MarchWe\u2019ll be heading towards the home straight at this point and we\u2019ll already know what teams are really aiming for at both ends; presumably at the top, this massive match will give us an idea of what they are actually capable of.These are the two best teams from the past half a decade, but last year there was a huge gap between them.Are Liverpool back? Has the squad renewal paid dividends? Are Man City an unstoppable juggernaut heading for a second treble in a row...or even all four trophies perhaps?The additional wrinkle here is that the game takes place shortly after a potential piece of silverware for either of these clubs, with the League Cup final at Wembley set for 25 February. Will it be a case of a second marker being put down at Anfield, one way or another?Man United vs Arsenal - 11 MayFinally, this could be a late-season battle for a Champions League spot - or even for the title itself.

That might also be true of the all-American group off at 4.13pm - it is headlined by Scottie Scheffler, the top-ranked player in the world, but Collin Morikawa shapes as a contender with his smooth

Brian Deane scored it, then won it for the hosts from the spot after Mark Hughes had levelled. Fortunes soon changed as Alex Ferguson\u2019s side won the title and the Blades were relegated.1994: Sheffield Wednesday 3 Tottenham 4This launched what was meant to be a continental new era for Spurs, with Jurgen Klinsmann leading the line after a move from Monaco. He delivered too, scoring and then performing one of the Premier League\u2019s most memorable celebrations \u2013 a dive to live up to his reputation.1996: Middlesbrough 3 Liverpool 3It was shirts-over-your-head time at the Riverside as Fabrizio Ravanelli marked his Boro debut with a hat-trick. The White Feather took on Liverpool\u2019s Spice Boys and nearly came out on top but, at the end of the season, Boro went down despite the Italian\u2019s 16 goals.1996: Wimbledon 0 Manchester United 3David Beckham\u2019s majestic lob from his own half triggered one of the English game\u2019s most celebrated and high-profile careers. Beckham was a well-established prospect before he caught Neil Sullivan napping \u2013 but this goal certainly helped him make a name for himself.2016: Arsenal 3 Liverpool 4The hosts took the lead through Theo Walcott, who recovered from seeing a penalty saved by Simon Mignolet to score just 69 seconds later. However, Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side stormed back as Philippe Coutinho (2), Adam Lallana and Sadio Mane put them 4-1 ahead, before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers set up an exciting finish to a thrilling game.2017: Arsenal 4 Leicester 3The night started perfectly for Arsenal as new signing Alexandre Lacazette marked his league debut with a goal after just 94 seconds, only for Shinji Okazaki to level three minutes later. Jamie Vardy then capitalised on poor defending to twice put the Foxes ahead either side of Danny Welbeck\u2019s equaliser. However Aaron Ramsey levelled, then fellow substitute Olivier Giroud\u2019s 85th-minute goal settled a breathless encounter in Arsenal\u2019s favour.2017: Watford 3 Liverpool 3Stefano Okaka gave Watford an eighth-minute lead, with Abdoulaye Doucoure re-establishing their one-goal advantage shortly after Mane equalised. Roberto Firmino levelled from the penalty spot after debutant Mohamed Salah was fouled, with the Egypt international then poking Liverpool ahead \u2013 only for Miguel Britos to equalise and give Marco Silva a positive first outing as Watford boss.2020: Liverpool 4 Leeds 3Champions Liverpool were given a scare by a fired-up Leeds side playing their first top-flight match in 16 years but ultimately a Salah hat-trick proved decisive. Three times the Reds were pegged back after taking the lead with a Salah penalty, a Virgil van Dijk header and another Salah strike, with equalisers coming from Jack Harrison, Patrick Bamford and Mateusz Klich. Salah finally settled the contest with a second spot-kick two minutes from time.2021: Brentford 2 Arsenal 0Brentford announced their arrival in the Premier League in style as goals from Sergi Canos and Christian Norgaard secured a memorable 2-0 win over Arsenal. The Bees finally came full circle as their last match in the top flight, in May 1947, was a 1-0 home defeat against Arsenal.RecommendedWe are treated as small men \u2013 Shaunagh Brown wants more done for female athletesMan City to begin Premier League title defence at Vincent Kompany\u2019s BurnleyTravball, indomitable Lyon and all out attack \u2013 key stats ahead of Ashes2022: Manchester United 1-2 BrightonErik ten Hag endured a chastening reminder of the size of the job he had taken on at Manchester United as his first game in charge ended in a 2-1 defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford. Starting with Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench, United were thoroughly outplayed in the first half as two Pascal Gross goals in the space of nine minutes gave the Seagulls a deserved lead. Ten Hag\u2019s men did improve after the break once Ronaldo had come on, but only found the back of the net through an Alexis Mac Allister own goal and were unable to get a leveller."}, {"_id": "648b23cd51ac33150be929bd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/leah-williamson-acl-beth-mead-vivianne-miedema-lioness-b2358037.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "We are treated as small men \u2013 Shaunagh Brown wants more done for female athletes", "lead": "The 33-year-old retired from the Red Roses in December, and also represented England in the hammer at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.", "author": "Rachel Steinberg", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 08:00:26 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:29.087340", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T08:00:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/09/3368225ef287dcb0ae5d74a497ef4b31Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODQ1NDk3-2.68257508.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEx-England rugby player Shaunagh Brown has called out sport governing bodies she feels treat female athletes like \u201csmall men\u201d to the detriment of their health and performance.The 33-year-old retired from the Red Roses in December after earning 30 caps for her country, and also represented England in the hammer at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.While the former prop has witnessed some positive change, she remains adamant that not enough consideration is directed to the unique needs of women, from the impact of menstrual cycles to a higher risk of certain injuries \u2013\u00a0including the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) issues that ended the World Cup dreams of England footballers Beth Mead and Leah Williamson.\u201c(It needs to) be based in the research why we\u2019re rehabbing this way, why we\u2019re asked to do this activity, why we\u2019re using this training programme, because what you\u2019ll find is a lot of it has come from men,\u201d Brown told a Parliamentary Women and Equalities Committee session.\u201cWhether that\u2019s concussion protocols, for me it just doesn\u2019t sound right that male and female concussion protocols are exactly the same.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cIt\u2019s just because so often we are treated as small men as opposed to completely different needs as women. Where it\u2019s all come from, there is no base at the moment. It\u2019s changing slowly, more people are looking into it.\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s more looking after people of a different age and potentially different weight categories than there is of a gender category. I\u2019m heavy for a woman, I\u2019m 16 stone, and I\u2019d be expected to basically just train like a 16-stone man.\u201cBut if I was a lot lighter, I\u2019d probably have a different training programme. If I was weaker or stronger, I\u2019d have a different training programme.\u201dNext month, England will begin their quest for a maiden football World Cup without several of the most recognisable names from their Euro 2022 triumph.Two of the injured \u2013 captain Williamson and forward Mead \u2013 are ruled out with ACL injuries, an issue that disproportionately affects women, who according to the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) have three-to-six times higher risk than males.Williamson and Mead are among a worrying number of female footballers, including their Arsenal team-mates Vivianne Miedema and Laura Wienroither, to have suffered the same injury this season.A BOA report released on Tuesday read: \u201cOne anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in your squad is unfortunate. A second is really bad luck. By the time you\u2019re at your fourth, including both the current Lioness captain and the reigning BBC Sports Personality of the Year, there\u2019s clearly an intrinsic problem that needs to be addressed.\u201cWhat is happening this season at the elite level is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dThe report, co-authored by surgeons Morgan Bailey and Nathanael Ahearn, revealed that of groups of young athletes the biggest rise in ACL injuries was observed by their organisation in teenage girls, who have taken up football in significant numbers following the Lionesses\u2019 victory.The doctors cautioned against writing off the discrepancy as simply due to biological differences, including hormonal influences and limb alignment, instead agreeing with Brown that \u201cthe gendered environment has a greater part to play.\u201d\n\nIt's just because so often we are treated as small men as opposed to completely different needs as womenShaunagh BrownContributing factors include a lack of equipment designed for women and a difference in quality when it comes to both pitches and coaching \u2013 with preventative training critical in reducing ACL injuries.Like Brown, the BOA report authors warned efforts to make things simply the same for men and women are misguided.RecommendedMan City to begin Premier League title defence at Vincent Kompany\u2019s Burnley10 of the most memorable opening-round games in Premier League historyTravball, indomitable Lyon and all out attack \u2013 key stats ahead of AshesThey concluded: \u201cAs more women and young girls take up football, the seemingly most straightforward method for development is to mirror that of the boys and men before them, but it is equity, rather than equivalence, that we should be striving for.\u201cThis means rather than simply encouraging more women to take up these sports in line with men, we should be creating the appropriate environment to do so, that accounts for both sex and gender based differences.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23cd51ac33150be929be", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league-boxing-day-fixtures-2023-b2358006.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Boxing Day fixtures 2023/24: Every Premier League match over festive period", "lead": "<p>The festive period is likely to define many clubs\u2019 seasons in the Premier League</p>", "author": "Jack Rathborn", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 08:00:05 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:29.241297", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T08:00:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/08/GettyImages-1452594615.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe 2023 Ashes is set to be one of the most exciting in history, with a resurgent England taking on Test champions Australia.Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum have led England to 11 victories in 13 matches since their appointments as captain and coach last summer, while Australia cemented their status as the best five-day team in the world by thrashing India by 209 runs in the World Test Championship final.Here, the PA news agency picks out five key stats ahead of the five-match series.TravballFreed up by Stokes\u2019 and McCullum\u2019s ultra-positive mindset, England\u2019s batters account for seven of the eight fastest strike rates among players with more than 500 runs to their name since the New Zealander was installed as coach on May 12, 2022.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAustralia batter Travis Head is the only non-Englishman in the list, with his strike rate of 83.75 runs per 100 balls ranking fourth behind Harry Brook, Ben Duckett and Jonny Bairstow.Stokes described Head as \u201cso hard to bowl to\u201d in the previous Ashes in Australia, in which he scored 357 runs \u2013 the most by anyone on either side \u2013 from just 415 balls faced.He has maintained that form ever since, most recently in a trademark counter-attacking innings of 163 from 174 deliveries against India.Head\u2019s performances have seen him climb to third spot in the Test batting rankings, behind countrymen Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith.Joe Root is the highest-ranked England batter in sixth.The last time three batters from the same team were first, second and third in the Test rankings was in December 1984, when Gordon Greenidge, Clive Lloyd, and Larry Gomes from West Indies were at the top.All out attackWhile England\u2019s cavalier batting under Stokes and McCullum has attracted lots of attention, their bowlers have been equally destructive by dismissing the opposition in 25 consecutive innings.This is their longest run since 1978 and 1979, when England bowled out 26 successive opponents in a sequence that brought series wins against Pakistan and New Zealand, plus a 5-1 Ashes success in Australia.The wickets have been shared among 14 players during the current run, with veteran seamers James Anderson and Stuart Broad \u2013 as well as the injured Jack Leach \u2013 leading the way on 45 apiece.Anderson has the best overall figures having claimed his scalps at an average of 17.62, ahead of Ollie Robinson who has 27 wickets at 21.25.Matthew Potts has chipped in with 23 victims, ahead of captain and Durham team-mate Stokes on 20.Then comes a bit of a gap to Root on nine wickets and Mark Wood \u2013 who has only played two Tests under Stokes and McCullum \u2013 on eight.The overlooked Rehan Ahmed and Will Jacks took seven and six wickets in Pakistan respectively, while Josh Tongue claimed a five-for on debut against Ireland at Lord\u2019s.Jamie Overton (two), Brook (one) and Matt Parkinson (one) have also contributed, while there have been five run-outs and one retirement through injury.Stokes fitness worriesStokes\u2019 bowling capability remains somewhat shrouded in mystery ahead of the first Test.England\u2019s captain has been recovering from a troublesome left knee and \u2013 despite insisting he is ready to bowl \u2013 has sent down only nine overs in six Test innings so far in 2023.He also bowled only one over for Chennai Super Kings in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League and was described by coach Stephen Fleming as \u201cbatting cover\u201d during the second half of the tournament.Stokes\u2019 all-round abilities are key to the balance of England\u2019s side, particularly given his preference for fast, flat pitches which could result in bowlers having to get through lots of overs.Meanwhile, Australia all-rounder Cameron Green \u2013 who is playing in an Ashes in England for the first time \u2013 has enjoyed a promising start to his Test career.He has lost only three of the 21 matches he has played in.Indomitable LyonNathan Lyon has played a remarkable 98 consecutive Tests for Australia, the joint-sixth longest run in history.The 35-year-old off-spinner \u2013 who took four for 41 to help dismiss India in their second innings and clinch the World Test Championship \u2013 has not missed a single game since sitting out the opening two Tests of the 2013 Ashes in England.While Lyon is unlikely to break the record held by former England captain Sir Alastair Cook (159), he is already out on his own among bowlers.All-rounders Garry Sobers (85), Kapil Dev (66) and Ian Botham (65) have been surpassed, although India\u2019s Dev can consider himself unlucky not to hold the bowlers\u2019 record having missed only one Test in his 131-match career.Lyon\u2019s omnipresence is in stark contrast with his opposite number Moeen Ali, who is returning to red-ball cricket after nearly two years away as an emergency replacement for the injured Leach.Moeen admitted this week that he has \u201cnever been able to hold an end up\u201d and the stats back this up \u2013 his economy rate of 3.61 runs per over is far worse than Lyon\u2019s 2.92.However, he has a better strike rate than his Australian counterpart, taking a wicket every 60.7 deliveries compared with Lyon\u2019s 63.7.Absent friendThis will be the first Ashes series since Shane Warne\u2019s sudden death in March 2022.Warne will be forever synonymous with the urn, having taken more wickets against England than any other player in Test history (195).The Australian introduced himself to Ashes cricket in 1993 by dismissing Mike Gatting with his very first ball. The delivery \u2013 which pitched outside leg and clipped the top of off \u2013 was subsequently dubbed the \u201cball of the century\u201d.Warne went on to claim 129 Ashes wickets in England at an average of 21.94, compared with 66 scalps at 25.81 in his native Australia.He won 24 of the 36 Ashes Tests he played in, losing seven and drawing five.RecommendedFootball rumours: Man United end pursuit of Harry Kane over \u2018unrealistic\u2019 feeTommy Fleetwood talks up \u2018unbelievable\u2019 Brooks Koepka ahead of US OpenChampionship clubs\u2019 wage bill exceeds revenue for fifth year running \u2013 reportTwo of those defeats came in 2005, which was arguably Warne\u2019s greatest Ashes performance despite him finishing on the losing side.The leg-spinner claimed 40 wickets at an average of 19.92, including six in both innings in the fifth Test at the Oval as Australia tried unsuccessfully to prevent an England series victory."}, {"_id": "648b23cd51ac33150be929c0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/qatar-human-rights-abuse-world-cup-amnesty-b2357713.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Qatar World Cup workers suffered \u2018human rights abuses\u2019, new Amnesty report finds", "lead": "<p>The investigation showed a \u201cpattern of abuses against migrant workers\u201d and accused Fifa of failing to investigate the issue, <strong>writes Miguel Delaney</strong></p>", "author": "Miguel Delaney", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 06:53:08 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:29.587694", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T06:53:08+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/11/07/14/WCup_Qatar_Laborers_79525.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHundreds of security guards and marshals at the Qatar World Cup went unpaid for long working periods without days off, before being forced out of the country when the tournament ended, a new Amnesty International investigation has found. Some did not earn enough to pay off the loan required for recruitment costs.The human rights body state that research into Teyseer Security Services \u201cshows pattern of abuses against migrant workers\u201d. Steve Cockburn, Amnesty\u2019s Head of Economic and Social Justice, has meanwhile accused Fifa of failing \u201cto effectively investigate the issue or offer remedies\u201d, demanding that the global governing body step in and \u201coffer immediate and meaningful remediation for the human rights abuses suffered by workers\u201d.The group spoke to 22 men from Nepal, Kenya and Ghana, who were among thousands of migrant workers employed on short-term contracts by Qatar-based Teyseer Security Services to work as marshals and security guards at World Cup sites in the build-up and during the tournament itself. Among the locations were Khalifa International Stadium, Fifa fan zones, the Corniche and the metro station in Souk Waqif.All of the workers interviewed said \u201cfalse promises\u201d were made by either Teyseer\u2019s representatives or recruitment agents, among them the suggestions they could take up more senior roles to earn an extra \u00a3220 a month, or stay and work in the country beyond the three-month contract period. Once in Qatar, however, nothing materialised.Instead, a third of those interviewed \u2013 particularly those employed as marshals \u2013 said they had to work 12 hours every day for 28 consecutive days. That came without any day off or adequate pay to reflect this work, which breaches Qatari law. The work often involved standing for long hours without sitting down and dealing with large crowds without adequate training or support.RecommendedThis is the side of the World Cup that Qatar would prefer you ignoreEverything wrong with the Qatar World CupThe man who was jailed after working on Qatar\u2019s World Cup\u201cI had to take out a loan to pay for the expenses to travel to work in Qatar during the World Cup,\u201d Marcus, his name changed at his request, told Amnesty. \u201cI am still paying it, what I earned was not enough.\u201dRichard, who has also requested his name be changed and worked at one of the team training grounds, found he would have earned more had he stayed in Ghana.\u201cI lost because I paid almost \u00a3550 before going there. I only received about \u00a31,200, so I only made \u00a3650. I would get more than that if I had stayed in Ghana.

I had to stand for ten to 12 hours a day\u2026 just resting my back on the barricades. At times we felt scared because it was too busy, and people were pushing.\u201dCockburn puts the primary responsibility on Fifa and Qatar, stating the country\u2019s existing mechanism for redress is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.He said: \u201cThe World Cup organisers were well aware of the issues but failed to put in place adequate measures to protect workers and prevent predictable labour abuses at World Cup sites, even after workers raised these issues directly.\u201cIt\u2019s six months since the tournament concluded but Fifa and Qatar have yet to offer an effective and accessible scheme to enable abused workers to receive the justice and compensation they are owed. Qatar\u2019s existing mechanism for redress is not fit for purpose and has left thousands of workers deprived of compensation for the abuses they suffered.\u201cFifa has a clear responsibility to ensure human rights are respected throughout the supply chain engaged in preparing and delivering its showcase competition.\u201cAlthough six months have passed since the World Cup, Fifa has yet to effectively investigate the issue, or offer remedies. Workers have already waited too long for justice. Fifa must now step in and offer immediate and meaningful remediation for the human rights abuses suffered by workers.\u201dThe abuses led many of Teyseer\u2019s workers to protest on multiple occasions while they were in Qatar. Some told Amnesty they reported their treatment on the World Cup Grievances Hotline but no action was taken.One said a manager threatened to fire him in relation for complaining and warned him not to report issues again. Hundreds of marshals eventually staged a protest demanding their dues days before their contracts expired in January, after which workers said representatives of both Teyseer and the government promised they would be compensated. That has not yet been honoured.The Amnesty report details \u201chiman rights abuses\u201d suffered by workers in Qatar  (Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Amnesty report that Teyseer representatives threatened \u201caction\u201d if the men failed to leave Qatar on flights arranged by the company. Hundreds had to leave Qatar without compensation.Teyseer denied the allegations to Amnesty, saying the company followed an \u201cethical recruitment process\u201d while detailing various measures it had taken to protect workers\u2019 rights. Fifa told Amnesty due diligence was conducted on the security firm but there were \u201cdifferent perceptions and views\u201d on the experience of workers.The global governing body said it would seek further clarification on the issues raised but did not offer commitment to provide remedy.Qatar has introduced a grievance mechanism but workers must still be in the country to access the state\u2019s labour courts and any compensation scheme. There is no way to complain remotely and, with workers inevitably forced to leave once their contracts are up, Amnesty state they have been \u201cdenied justice\u201d.The Qatari government repeated the common line to Amnesty that measures had been taken in recent years to reform its labour system.Amnesty conclude by stating that the abuses endured are \u201cpart of a pattern suffered by migrant workers in Qatar\u201d since the decision was taken to award the state the World Cup in 2010.In a statement to The Independent, Fifa said: \u201cFifa, in collaboration with its Qatari counterparts, implemented a far-reaching due diligence process with the aim to ensure that companies involved in Fifa World Cup-related construction and services abide by the Supreme Committee\u2019s Workers\u2019 Welfare Standards. We consider any non-compliance with these standards unacceptable and are actively following up when we learn about alleged breaches.\u201cAfter receiving Amnesty International\u2019s allegations concerning Teyseer\u2019s workers on 19 April 2023, Fifa promptly followed up with the SC\u2019s Worker Welfare Department (WWD) as well as with the Doha Office of the International Labour Organisation ILO. It is the primary responsibility of the respective companies as well as the Qatari authorities to rectify possible adverse impacts on workers. As Fifa, we work to use our leverage with the relevant entities to promote the provision of remedy when we become aware of such allegations, in line with our responsibilities under international standards.\u201cWe kindly refer you to the SC and the ILO for further information on this case.RecommendedToney compares ban to missing out on World Cup squadFifa accused of lying about environmental impact of Qatar World CupEngland\u2019s future is about to be defined \u2013 and it\u2019s out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s control\u201cMore broadly, one should not lose track of the bigger picture: International experts and trade union representatives who have assessed and collaborated in the labour rights programme for Fifa World Cup workers have repeatedly recognised that it led to heightened protection and welfare for Fifa World Cup workers. \u201cIn addition, according to the International Labour Organisation, Qatar\u2019s labour reforms have been significant and benefitted hundreds of thousands of workers with the World Cup being an important catalyst for these reforms.

Marcus Rashford faces the dilemma many a Manchester City player of previous years did: watch the neighbours claim the biggest prizes or ignore it and pretend it did not happen?The football fan in the forward dictated he saw City beat Inter Milan. The Manchester United supporter in him did not want to see the subsequent scenes of delight. \u201cI like watching football, I like watching the best games and that is what I did,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut after they won the game I don\u2019t need to watch them celebrating, so TV off.\u201dRashford was at a friend\u2019s house. He had a closer view of the second part of City\u2019s historic treble, an opponent in the FA Cup final when the United players stayed on the pitch to see their local rivals lift the trophy. He had done his bit in a vain bid to prevent them from retaining the Premier League title, scoring a derby winner at Old Trafford in January. Seeing City win a treble previously only achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s United in 1999 was, he said, \u201cnot nice\u201d.Rashford had scored 30 goals, the most in a campaign by any United player since Ferguson retired, but he can seem a player trapped in the wrong era. Growing up as a United fan in Wythenshawe, he was on their books from the age of seven. It was a point when the dominant force in the city was clear. Now he has appeared in the first team in eight seasons: in all eight, United have finished below City. With 123 goals, Rashford is their top scorer since Ferguson retired. It has never brought a title challenge in his career, let alone a prize the Scot won 13 times.RecommendedMarcus Rashford underlines commitment to England after missing recent gamesKeep or sell?

Is it a challenge? Yeah, but we can\u2019t shy away from it, we have to face it and do our best next season. It is up to the rest of us to catch them up.\u201dRashford had no desire to watch City celebrate Champions League glory  (PA Wire)A difference for United, however, is that City\u2019s superiority feels more of an indictment of them. Their supporters have to live next to City\u2019s. The parade in their home city was not for them. An international call-up allowed Rashford to miss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be worrying about what is going on in Manchester,\u201d he said. The arrival of City\u2019s five England players to link up with Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad means he is likely to get reminders. \u201cIt is going to be funny but congratulations to them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, they deserved it; they played the best football this year. The talking is done on the pitch and they did really well.\u201dUnited\u2019s objective is to overhaul them. \u201cI think that was always the aim regardless of their success this year or the previous years,\u201d Rashford said. Now, at least, he has renewed hope after Erik ten Hag\u2019s debut season. Rashford was rejuvenated by the Dutchman. He was damning about the period before his appointment.\u201cThe manager came in and he wanted to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel at times we have lacked that ambition. He wasn\u2019t [just] caring about getting into the top four, he just wanted to win trophies and when you strive for the best sometimes you are going to fall short as we did in areas this season. You have to look at the outcome.\u201cWe managed to win a trophy and get back in the Champions League spots, get to another final and it is definitely a progression from the previous year or a couple of years before.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was last weekend when it really sank in for Callum Wilson that he and Newcastle United are bound for the Champions League. Not, as might seem logical, Saturday\u2019s Champions League final, the sort of occasion that may have prompted thoughts of progressing that far, or at least welcoming Inter Milan to Tyneside, but Sunday\u2019s Sam Fender gig at St James\u2019 Park.Wilson had been on holiday, \u201ctotally switched off\u201d, before the Newcastle-supporting rock star exposed him to his new reality. \u201cI went to the concert with my wife at St James\u2019 Park,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a sea of black and white. And before he came out, he actually played the Champions League song and everyone was cheering and I was like \u2018this is absolutely real\u2019. I could see how much it meant to everybody. Hearing the anthem in the stadium, without actually walking out to play, was surreal. This is going to happen next season and I cannot wait to get started.\u201dAmid the broader picture of Newcastle\u2019s rise and the reasons behind it are endearing stories of players who carried themselves further than most envisaged. In 14 years of professional football, Wilson has never played in Europe. He was part of a winless team when the club was taken over in 2021 and his former Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was appointed. He was one of seven survivors from Steve Bruce\u2019s reign to make at least 31 Premier League appearances last season when Newcastle came fourth. Like Fabian Schar, Sean Longstaff, Joe Willock, Joelinton, Jacob Murphy and Miguel Almiron, he exceeded expectations. Wilson\u2019s 18 goals were a career-best total in the top flight and exceeded by only four others: Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Ivan Toney and Mohamed Salah.Newcastle, who failed to win any of their first 14 league games last season, lost only five of 38 this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible achievement what has happened,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSeven or eight of the players who started the games at the back end of the season were also the ones who were fighting relegation in the previous two seasons. That shows what a good job the manager has done with the current squad. But it also shows where the club has got to with a few new good players around us. Now it is only going to get better if we keep investing in the right way and become a top-four team more regularly.\u201dRecommendedThe year that sportswashing won: A season that changed football foreverBellingham gone but who\u2019s next?

There was a high-class alternative in attack. \u201cWe brought in a \u00a360m striker last summer and that was one of our first big signings,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou use it as competition, as fuel. You know, with the way that the club is going, that if you don\u2019t perform then potentially it could be your time done at the club.\u201dAlexander Isak and Callum Wilson give Newcastle two high-class options up front  (Action Images via Reuters)Especially when there was a point where Isak seemed to have displaced Wilson. A burst of goals earned him a World Cup spot but he entered April with a solitary strike in 18 appearances for club and country and as a substitute.\u201cWe went to Dubai for a mid-season training camp and we had five days there when we didn\u2019t play football and I got to sit back and think \u2018yes, it has been a fantastic start to the season but it has turned out into a bad season,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was out of the team so I had to basically pull my finger out and start scoring goals again.\u201dWhich he did, in impressive fashion. A run of 11 goals in 10 appearances powered Newcastle into the Champions League. If it was a dramatic intervention, Wilson is not alone in pulling his finger out. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone is doing,\u201d he added. \u201cPlayers like Sean Longstaff, who has come through the academy, and now the manager is getting the best out of him and he looks a top player week in, week out. We wouldn\u2019t change him for anybody now. I think it\u2019s a good place to be at.\u201dWhether Wilson remains there remains to be seen. His form would suggest so, but he will soon enter the last year of his contract. \u201cMy time at Newcastle has been amazing so far and long may it continue,\u201d he added. \u201cMy agent and the club will be speaking on my future at some point and hopefully it will be with Newcastle.\u201dRecommendedCallum Wilson tuned up to secure England recall after Newcastle disappointmentPremier League fixtures LIVE: Opening weekend and full schedules for every clubEngland World Cup goalkeeper set to leave WSL side this summerIf the Champions League provides one reason to stay, the Premier League is another. Alan Shearer is an admirer, helping persuade him to join. Wilson wants to rank next to Newcastle\u2019s record scorer. \u201cIn terms of Premier League goals, behind Shearer at Newcastle, there aren\u2019t many in front of me now,\u201d he said. He is sixth, but only nine goals behind Peter Beardsley, both the man nearest to Shearer and still far behind him. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get second \u2013 it\u2019s a long way to catch Alan,\u201d Wilson added.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Brooks Koepka swagger is back after muscling his way to a fifth major at the PGA Championship and Rory McIlroy is poised for an intimate viewing experience this week.With the sport still shaking from the seismic announcement that the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF will be joining forces, Koepka has a chance to extend his dominance in the majors at the US Open.Alongside McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama, a star-studded three-ball that can boast 10 majors, the American begins his quest at Los Angeles Country Club on Thursday.Unlike McIlroy, who has been conspicuous by his silence this week, Koepka\u2019s emotional energy remains compressed into the pursuit of competition, having rebounded brilliantly after a draining battle with injury before a triumphant return at Oak Hill.\u201cLike I\u2019ve said, the more chaotic things get the easier it gets for me,\u201d Koepka said this week when discussing his unique record of five major wins from nine PGA Tour victories in total.RecommendedUS Open 2023: Tee times and schedule for Round 1 including Rory McIlroy and Jon RahmJon Rahm looking forward to US Open test that has \u2018everything\u2019Matt Fitzpatrick fully focused on US Open defence despite confusion over merger\u201cEverything starts to slow down and I am able to focus on whatever I need to focus on while everybody else is dealing with distractions, worried about other things. I think there\u2019s a few reasons (I peak at majors), but I think it\u2019s definitely one of them. I enjoy the chaos.\u201dMcIlroy may well be feeling the effects of \u201cbetrayal\u201d, in the words of 2021 champion Jon Rahm, but his pairing for the first two rounds offers an ideal opportunity to address an undervalued area of the game: mental resilience.Never is that more important than the US Open week and this fiendishly difficult test, which could descend into \u201ccarnage\u201d. That\u2019s the hope for hotly-tipped world No 7 Max Homa, who holds the course record with a nine-under-par 61: \u201cA little bit of wind is going to make it spicy. I hope it\u2019s a typical US Open. The greens are severe, and if they keep getting firmer and faster I think it\u2019ll be a really good test. I think it will be really fair.Brooks Koepka watches his putt on the 13th hole during a practice round for the US Open (AP)\u201cIt will really show a quality shot will go to a good spot, and one that\u2019s not great is going to go to a bad spot and you\u2019re going to see a lot of silliness go on. This venue is awesome for a US Open.\u201dMcIlroy will hope his fresh focus on golf may produce similar results to Tommy Fleetwood. The Englishman was seen bounding down the fairways last week during a Canadian Open practice round at Oakdale Golf and Country Club. Fleetwood shunned a scheduled press conference moments after the PGA Tour and PIF announcement, instead preferring to focus on his game. Fleetwood was vindicated after blocking out a potential distraction when he came closer than ever to his first PGA Tour victory, falling agonisingly short in a play-off to local favourite Nick Taylor.McIlroy, a US Open champion at Congressional in 2011, has lingered in recent years at this tournament with ninth, eighth, seventh and fifth place finishes.  Rory McIlroy did not speak to the media this week (Getty Images)And ninth at the Canadian Open last week ensures he cannot be dismissed here, but the stress of the last week adds another hurdle to the ever-growing challenge of ending his nine-year major drought.Not only does Koepka stand in his way, but Scottie Scheffler, the world No 1, is perhaps a change of putter away from lapping the field. Gaining 20.74 strokes on the field from tee-to-green at the recent Memorial tournament, approximately nine strokes clear of second-placed Rahm, underlines the absurd quality of his ball striking. His rivals\u2019 relief comes when examining a woeful 8.58 strokes lost on the greens at the same tournament, placing him dead last from those who made the cut and ultimately forced to accept third.RecommendedUS Open 2023: Tee times and schedule for Round 1 including Rory McIlroy and Jon RahmTommy Fleetwood talks up \u2018unbelievable\u2019 Brooks Koepka ahead of US OpenJon Rahm looking forward to US Open test that has \u2018everything\u2019Should his putting woes extend this week, then the tournament appears wide open, with Matt Fitzpatrick eager to defend the title he won so magnificently last year with such that majestic swipe from the Brookline sand.The affable Homa\u2019s mantra this week may resonate with all after what promises to be a brutal experience: \u201cbogeys are okay.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s last week might resemble a bogey, so his chances here rest on his resilience and focus.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWarren Gatland stopped short of saying that he regretted his return to Wales, but the tone of his comments could hardly have been more plain. \u201cWhen I came into the Six Nations, I had no idea,\u201d the Welsh head coach said to the BBC of the problems that have beset him and his side during a frightful start to his second stint in charge. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise a lot of the things that were going on and the issues that were behind rugby and the squad and the players. At the time if I had known, I would have made a different decision and probably gone somewhere else.\u201dWhen the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) re-appointed the popular New Zealander last December, the hope was of a quick fix, a proven short-term schemer the right man to reinvigorate a side that had been drifting towards a World Cup disaster under Wayne Pivac. Gatland was the proverbial safe pair of hands to guide the team out of choppy waters.Things have not gone as planned. In these last six months, Welsh rugby has lurched from crisis to crisis. First came the allegations of sexism and misogyny within the WRU, which precipitated the resignation of a chief executive and a cultural review. Then, as the sport\u2019s financial problems were laid bare, there was the threat of strike action before the marquee clash with England in Cardiff as many professional players fretted over contract uncertainty. RecommendedWhen and where is the 2023 Rugby World Cup?Record-breaking Alun Wyn Jones will go down as an all-time greatSaracens have unlocked a new Owen Farrell \u2013 will England benefit at the World Cup?If the international success of the first Gatland premiership papered over cracks apparent within the Welsh game, then in these last few months it has all been laid bare. Remember, also, that Gatland\u2019s attempt to re-appoint Rob Howley, sent home from the 2019 World Cup after breaching betting rules, as attack coach ahead of the Six Nations was blocked by the union. The problems have continued into the summer. After going early by naming a 54-player World Cup squad in May, Gatland was rocked by the retirements of Alun Wyn Jones and Justin Tipuric, before Rhys Webb elected to withdraw from consideration, too. Lock Cory Hill, unable to source a club in Europe, has also been forced out of contention, while Rhys Carre\u2019s ejection from the squad was rather inconsiderately conveyed in a public declaration that the prop had \u201cfailed to meet performance targets\u201d. The Welsh ship may be listing but Gatland has not proved the steady hand on the tiller, either, repeatedly steering it on to the rocks. His comments as the sexism allegations were highlighted on the eve of the Six Nations were clumsy at best, while his muddled team selections prevented a young squad from forging crucial connections in the midst of a tournament run that brought significant woe. Wales will head into their warm-up fixtures with barely even a handful of certain starters. Then, just days after a fifth-placed finish was confirmed, the Wales head coach picked a British and Irish Lions 23 in his column for The Telegraph, including not a single Welshman among his selection. As a motivational tool, perhaps there was some merit in clearly evidencing how he viewed a squad that probably would not provide many tourists were the Lions away this summer, but for a head coach to so publicly disparage his players seemed curious. Certainly, the withdrawals of Jones, Tipuric and Webb do not paint a picture of a happy camp, even if all three may have had their individual reasons for wishing to step away.Gatland\u2019s latest remarks appear oddly pitched, too, with apparent cricitism of young centre Joe Hawkins\u2019s decision to move to Exeter - \u201cI was just really surprised that a 20-year-old would throw away the chance to be involved in international rugby\u201d - surely a misjudgement given all of the doubt caused by the lack of clarity over regional budgets for next season. Perhaps this, though, is all part of the plan. Gatland feels Welsh teams play their best rugby when backed into a corner. \u201cWhat gives me an edge or a buzz is when the expectations aren\u2019t there or the challenges appear to be greater. That drives me even more,\u201d Gatland explained to Scrum V. \u201cIf some of the Welsh media can keep writing us off that would be great because they\u2019re doing us a huge favour.\u201cIt\u2019s allowing us to come in under the radar and there\u2019s nothing the Welsh boys love better than being written off and backs-to-the-wall, they tend to respond to that.\u201dThey will have to. While part of the reason for both Wales and England moving to new regimes so close to the World Cup was a perceived easier route to the final away from France, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand on the other side of the draw, Gatland\u2019s French itinerary could yet prove mighty tough. Australia would appear to be making more optimistic movements under Eddie Jones, while Georgia beat Pivac\u2019s Wales last November. A meeting with Fiji will mean the memories of Nantes in 2007 will be all too easily recalled. Welsh rugby\u2019s pain could yet continue before this annus horribilis is out.

Relative to the 2022-23 season, it says revenue from broadcasters is expected to provide a minimum uplift of more than \u00a390m for Luton, approximately \u00a384m for Sheffield United and \u00a354m for Burnley, with both of those two clubs in receipt of parachute payments whilst participating in the Championship.The report said that should a club suffer immediate relegation, assuming they are not in receipt of parachute payments at that point, under existing arrangements the parachute payments from the Premier League will continue to provide an uplift over the following two seasons of at least \u00a380m.For a Championship club not otherwise in receipt of parachute payments, the value of promotion will be at least \u00a3170m across the next three seasons and, if a club survives their first season in the Premier League, they will be entitled to three seasons of parachute payments and the incremental revenue will be over \u00a3290m across five years.Discussions over a new financial settlement between the two leagues are ongoing. The Government said in its White Paper on football governance that a new regulator will be given backstop powers to impose a settlement if one cannot be agreed, but it is unlikely the regulator will be up and running until 2024-25 at the earliest.Parry accepts that reform of the distribution package has to go hand in hand with cost control measures, which are also part of the ongoing \u2018New Deal For Football\u2019 talks between the EFL, the Premier League and the Football Association.\n\nWhat we really want to see in the English game is a variety and diversity of clubs coming through the league at different points in time Tim Bridge, lead partner in Deloitte\u2019s Sports Business GroupBridge believes it is vital for the leagues to see the common ground they share to resolve the dispute on distribution.\u201cThe point I would make is that the longevity of the Premier League and the ability for clubs to move up and down between the Premier League and the Championship and to achieve variety in those clubs is a good thing for the overall brand and the marketing position of English football,\u201d he said.\u201cPart of the beauty of the Premier League is always that any team can beat any other team. And so at any one point in time, what we really want to see in the English game is a variety and diversity of clubs coming through the league at different points in time, bringing new storylines, bringing new faces to the league because frankly that keeps it fresh.\u201dWage spending in the Premier League in 2021-22 grew by \u00a3192m compared to the previous season, but this was outpaced by a \u00a3586m increase in revenue, meaning the top flight\u2019s wages-to-revenue ratio fell for the second consecutive season from 71 per cent to 67 per cent.That is still a significantly higher ratio than the average of the three seasons pre-pandemic up to 2018-19 \u2013 58 per cent.Across Europe\u2019s \u2018Big Five\u2019 leagues as a whole however, revenue growth was outpaced by wages, which stood at 12.3 billion euros (\u00a310.5bn).Recommended\u2018Incredible\u2019 Ashes record secured Stuart Broad\u2019s Edgbaston place \u2013 Ben StokesFormer Scotland defender Gordon McQueen dies aged 70Gordon McQueen: The tough defender who starred for both Leeds and Man UnitedThis comes at a time when the continent\u2019s football governing body UEFA has introduced new financial sustainability regulations, including a cost control rule which by 2025-26 will limit a club\u2019s spending on wages, transfer fees and other player and coach costs at 70 per cent of turnover.UEFA could go even further in the future, with president Aleksander Ceferin raising the possibility of a Europe-wide salary cap in an interview in April."}, {"_id": "648b23cf51ac33150be929c8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/croatia-netherlands-nations-league-dutch-dinamo-zagreb-b2357777.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Croatia reach Nations League final with extra-time win over Netherlands", "lead": "The 2018 World Cup runners-up are through to another final.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:49:03 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:31.099996", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T21:49:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/22/14-1a3943ac91514f78b52ebf8dc1d0c0c4.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Yeah, but we can\u2019t shy away from it. We have to face it and do our best next season.\u201dRashford says United\u2019s players and staff spoke in the dressing room after the FA Cup final about the need to kick on again as the 2023-24 campaign quickly comes into focus.There are only 23 days between Rashford, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw playing in England\u2019s final June qualifier against North Macedonia at Old Trafford on Monday and United playing their first pre-season match.It is a far cry from the full summer of preparation Rashford enjoyed last year, which provided a platform for him to bounce back from the most challenging campaign of his career.The rejuvenated 25-year-old went onto score a career best 30 goals in all competitions under Ten Hag, who the United forward credits for changing the mindset of the group and helping him find his fire again.\u201cHe came in and he wanted to win,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cI feel like at times we have lacked that ambition, as I\u2019ve said before.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t caring about getting into the top four, doing any of that \u2013 he just wanted to win trophies and when you strive for the best sometimes you are going to fall short as we did in areas this season.\u201cBut you have to look at the outcome.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the summer of 2002, producer and screenwriter James Schamus went to Times Square to see Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man. Schamus, a frequent collaborator with director Ang Lee, went for two reasons: to celebrate the star-making moment of Tobey Maguire, with whom Lee and Schamus worked on The Ice Storm; and to \u201cscope out what was going in Marvel-land\u201d. Lee and Schamus were deep into production on Hulk, a rival superhero smackdown now marking its 20th anniversary.Hulk \u2013 which starred Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the scientist with severe anger management issues \u2013 had been more than a decade in development. These were the old times, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe had taken over \u2013 when Marvel\u2019s top-billed characters were in the hands of other studios, and filmmakers were scrambling to figure out the formula of blockbuster cinema\u2019s hot new trend.For Schamus, that all changed in the closing seconds of Spider-Man. Having dispatched the Green Goblin, Spidey takes one final, triumphant swing through New York City and lands in front of the American flag. \u201cIn my mind it created the genre,\u201d Schamus tells me. Leaving the cinema in Times Square, Schamus called Lee and told him: \u201cI think we\u2019re in a little trouble\u2026\u201d The audience, said Schamus, would go to watch superhero movies expecting to see \u201cthe American flag version\u201d from that point on. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve got!\u201dIndeed, Hulk \u2013 which released to mixed reviews in June 2003 \u2013 is a curiosity of pre-MCU super-heroics: a film that, for the most part, eschews the expected hulk-smashery for a more contemplative exercise in soul searching. \u201cAng was committed to the abstract and ethereal outsider version,\u201d says Schamus. But Lee \u2013 who even 20 years on seems an unlikely choice for Hulk (his films either side were Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain) \u2013 was also committed to the film\u2019s major selling point. That being the once fanboy-quivering prospect of seeing the Hulk brought to life \u2013 a transformation that didn\u2019t involve slapping green paint on a bodybuilder.\u201cAng Lee was such a team player, he decided to suit up and do a bunch of the motion capture himself,\u201d says Aaron Ferguson, then a creature supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic. \u201cHe was able to channel his inner Hulk and storm around.\u201dRecommendedBruce Lee\u2019s long, violent journey to immortality: \u2018He knew the star should always be the boss\u2019Daredevil at 20: Backlash, Evanescence and Ben Affleck\u2019s (first) superhero flopEric Bana: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be James Bond \u2013 it would have been too much fame for my head\u2019Hulk began development in the early 1990s, with multiple screenwriters writing multiple drafts and various directors attached. Different proposed scenarios would have seen Hulk battling terrorists, insect men, sharks, or his giant-headed nemesis, The Leader. Leaked details were also subject to early examples of toxic online fandom \u2013 the kind of entitled, gate-keeping bile that spews up around certain pop culture properties. Universal had blown a reported $20m on pre-production before Lee even joined. Schamus remembers there being \u201c15 or 16 prior drafts\u201d when they signed on. \u201cIt was just all over the map,\u201d he adds. Lee may have been an unlikely candidate for Hulk, but he took on the project \u2013 in part \u2013 out of cinematic wonderment. Their attitude with their projects by that point, says Schamus, was \u201cthat sounds cool. We love movies; let\u2019s go make movies!\u201d\n\nThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing. There was more of that self-aware wisecracking!James SchamusSchamus had previous experience, having worked (uncredited) on the script of 2000\u2019s X-Men, the film that set the superhero boom in motion. Schamus recalls that Marvel Studios at the time consisted mostly of CEO/producer Avi Arad, with Kevin Feige \u2013 now the mastermind of the MCU \u2013 as a junior assistant. \u201cI would notice him and think, \u2018Oh, this guy, he knows what he\u2019s doing!\u2019\u201d laughs Schamus.With Schamus rewriting the script himself, Hulk followed the long-held movie tradition of tampering with the original comic (see also: Spider-Man\u2019s organic web-shooters and Power Ranger-like Green Goblin; the X-Men not being man enough for yellow spandex). In the Incredible Hulk comic, first published in 1962, Bruce Banner is a scientist who \u2013 while saving someone else\u2019s life \u2013 gets caught in the blast of a gamma bomb, which causes him to transform into the Hulk. Schamus was free from the restraints of hardcore fandom (\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up as a comic-book geek kid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t formative to me\u201d), but he did go back to the comics. He was taken by a 1980s storyline that introduced Banner\u2019s abusive father, who killed the future Hulk\u2019s mother \u2013 the source of grown-up Banner\u2019s anger issues.The 2003 movie follows loosely: Banner\u2019s father, David (Nick Nolte) is a government scientist who \u2013 against orders \u2013 performs an experiment on himself and passes mutant genes to his son. Years later, Bruce (Bana) \u2013 now a nanotech scientist \u2013 is involved in a gamma accident that triggers the mutant cells. Like the Eighties comic book, this version of Banner witnessed his father murder his mother. The real cause of the monster is the repressed memory of this incident.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7-daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeWith so many previous script drafts and writers, the film was subject to a tricky arbitration over the writing credits. Certain elements, including the abusive father, had shown up in previous drafts. In the end, Schamus shared the writing credit with previous scriptwriters Michael France and John Turman. The arbitration was detailed in a New Yorker cover story. Two decades on, Schamus is pragmatic about the controversy. He thinks there was some political wrangling in the Writers Guild. \u201cAlso, whatever,\u201d he says, laughing.Ang Lee studies Hulk heads on the set of the 2003 film (Shutterstock)Schamus recalls pushing to cast Bana after seeing him in Chopper. Bana, as wonderful as he is, gets eaten alive by Nolte, who plays his onscreen father with off-kilter, sunken-eyed menace \u2013 despite the inherent ridiculousness of being a mad scientist with three giant mutant dogs (including a killer poodle). Discovering his own superhuman ability \u2013 to fuse with any material he lays his hands on \u2013 he becomes a reworking of the comics\u2019 Absorbing Man.\u201cI really adored Nick,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cHe was definitely in the process of becoming the character that he\u2019s now more known as \u2013 after the mugshot that happened when we were in post [he was arrested for driving while high on the date rape drug, GHB]. But he doesn\u2019t show up on screen without giving everything. Ang let him chew the scenery right down to the floorboards.\u201dCo-stars include Jennifer Connelly as Banner\u2019s long-time sweetheart, Betty Ross; Sam Elliot as Hulk\u2019s military adversary (and Betty\u2019s father), Thunderbolt Ross; and Josh Lucas \u2013 the only person in the film who seems to be having some fun \u2013 as a soldier-turned-corporate snide, whose job it is to bully Banner then get thrown around by the Hulk. There are cameos, too, from Hulk co-creator Stan Lee (naturally) and Lou Ferrigno, the 6ft 5in bodybuilder who played the Hulk (with the help of green grease paint) in the 1970s TV series. The original Hulk comic was cancelled after six issues. It was actually the TV show that made the Hulk a pop culture icon, as summed up by its most iconic line: \u201cDon\u2019t make me angry, you wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry\u201d. The 2003 Hulk saves the line for the very last scene.Lou Ferrigno as the Hulked-out version of Dr Bruce Banner in the classic \u2018Incredible Hulk\u2019 TV series (Snap/Shutterstock)At one stage, the VFX maestros at Industrial Light & Magic considered going down the Ferrigno route to create the Hulk \u2013 an ambitious project in the early Noughties. \u201cThere was a lot of wondering what we had gotten ourselves into \u2013 was this more than we could do?\u201d Aaron Ferguson says. \u201cThere were lots of people shaking their heads and a lot of crazy ideas. One idea was that maybe we should do it as a guy in a suit and adjust it all after [digitally]. People were like, \u2018That\u2019s not gonna work!\u2019\u201dOne major challenge, recalls Ferguson, is that ILM hadn\u2019t quite caught up with the latest evolution in CGI tech. Even then, the techniques ILM was using to create the Hulk were old school. The colour green was a problem, too. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around with the dailies and think, \u2018What is wrong with this shot?\u2019\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cA co-worker said \u2018look at this\u2019 and changed the monitor so it was just black and white. Everyone was like, \u2018That looks so much better!\u2019 The green breaks the illusion of it being human. No matter what shade you use, somewhere in your mind there\u2019s something wrong with it.\u201dFor Ferguson, the best part of the job was working with Lee. \u201cAn all-in kind of guy,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m coming and staying at the studio and working with you guys.\u2019 We had dailies with him every day. He was full of ideas.\u201dTwenty years on, the Hulk CGI looks better than you might expect \u2013 though certainly primitive. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say cringeworthy,\u201d says Ferguson, \u201cbut there\u2019s dated material in there.\u201d A fight with the mutant dogs \u2013 which felt like a cop out in lieu of a proper superhero vs supervillain punch-up at the time \u2013 is a highlight. And a desert battle between Hulk and the US army feels like a bit of freeform Hulk action.Eric Bana\u2019s Dr Bruce Banner is consoled by Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in \u2018Hulk\u2019  (Shutterstock)But for all of Lee\u2019s stomping around in mo-cap Hulk mode, the film \u2013 about a man who turns into a green monster, lest we forget \u2013 is jarringly straight-faced. \u201cThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cThere was more of that self-aware wisecracking! By the time you got the finished film it was taking itself very seriously.\u201dIt\u2019s best demonstrated by the film\u2019s first Hulk-out scene \u2013 the moment that everyone\u2019s been waiting for. It\u2019s not part of an all-action spectacle, like Avengers Assemble\u2019s helicarrier wallop-fest, but a scene of Bana\u2019s troubled scientist sitting alone, having a good old think about who he really is deep down.Lee is also one of the few directors \u2013 alongside Tim Burton and Sam Raimi, perhaps \u2013 to make a film that actually resembles a comic book. Using split screen and other techniques, Lee replicates comic panels and gives scenes a sense of propulsion. The sound, says Schamus, was designed to draw you to different places on screen.It\u2019s as if Hulk leapt forward. We didn\u2019t get the straight-up, all-action Incredible Hulk movie \u2013 something more like the 2008 film starring Edward Norton. Instead, Lee went straight to the subversive reinvention \u2013 like skipping Batman and making The Dark Knight first; or giving us Logan before \u00adX-Men. But some critics didn\u2019t have the same foresight. The New York Times said \u201cincredible, but only in a negative sense: incredibly long, incredibly tedious, incredibly turgid\u201d. The Independent called it \u201ca decent but doomed attempt to humanise a debased genre\u201d.Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno, Ang Lee, Eric Bana and Nick Nolte at the \u2018Hulk\u2019 world premiere in June 2003 (Getty)\u201cI think the studio was much more surprised than I was,\u201d Schamus says about the reaction. \u201cTo their credit, the money people and executives were very supportive and really loved the film. I think it was very sobering to them to crash against the initial wave of disappointment. For me, it was what I thought was going to happen.\u201dRecommended\u2018Nightmarish\u2019: 17 terrible performances by great actorsEmile Hirsch on remorse, wanderlust and child stardom: \u2018I was wary of Hollywood\u2019\u2018You can\u2019t act!\u2019 26 co-stars who famously didn\u2019t get onStill, Hulk made money \u2013 $245m \u2013 and Schamus put together ideas for a sequel. Instead, the character was rebooted for the MCU with Norton\u2019s unfairly-unloved The Incredible Hulk five years later. Banner was then recast with Mark Ruffalo for Avengers team-ups. Universal still owns the distribution rights for Hulk-led films, which means Hulk plays a supporting role in MCU adventures. It might be for the best. The Bana and Norton films prove that he\u2019s a tricky solo act.Hulk is best appreciated within the context of 20 years\u2019 worth of superhero cinema that followed \u2013 to see how, like the Hulk himself, it\u2019s an outsider. \u201cIt\u2019s not your typical film,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a weird movie. I can understand why Marvel wouldn\u2019t want to do something like this again. But if directors were given a little more creative freedom, maybe they wouldn\u2019t see the burnout we\u2019re starting to have with superhero films \u2013 they\u2019re all kind of the same.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23d051ac33150be929cd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/glenda-jackson-death-cause-films-labour-b2358134.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glenda Jackson death: Oscar-winning actor and former Labour MP dies aged 87", "lead": "<p>Veteran actor had just completed filming a new project with Sir Michael Caine </p>", "author": "Roisin O'Connor", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 10:39:49 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:32.172581", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T10:39:49+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/12/Britain_Obit_Glenda_Jackson_96458.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the summer of 2002, producer and screenwriter James Schamus went to Times Square to see Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man. Schamus, a frequent collaborator with director Ang Lee, went for two reasons: to celebrate the star-making moment of Tobey Maguire, with whom Lee and Schamus worked on The Ice Storm; and to \u201cscope out what was going in Marvel-land\u201d. Lee and Schamus were deep into production on Hulk, a rival superhero smackdown now marking its 20th anniversary.Hulk \u2013 which starred Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the scientist with severe anger management issues \u2013 had been more than a decade in development. These were the old times, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe had taken over \u2013 when Marvel\u2019s top-billed characters were in the hands of other studios, and filmmakers were scrambling to figure out the formula of blockbuster cinema\u2019s hot new trend.For Schamus, that all changed in the closing seconds of Spider-Man. Having dispatched the Green Goblin, Spidey takes one final, triumphant swing through New York City and lands in front of the American flag. \u201cIn my mind it created the genre,\u201d Schamus tells me. Leaving the cinema in Times Square, Schamus called Lee and told him: \u201cI think we\u2019re in a little trouble\u2026\u201d The audience, said Schamus, would go to watch superhero movies expecting to see \u201cthe American flag version\u201d from that point on. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve got!\u201dIndeed, Hulk \u2013 which released to mixed reviews in June 2003 \u2013 is a curiosity of pre-MCU super-heroics: a film that, for the most part, eschews the expected hulk-smashery for a more contemplative exercise in soul searching. \u201cAng was committed to the abstract and ethereal outsider version,\u201d says Schamus. But Lee \u2013 who even 20 years on seems an unlikely choice for Hulk (his films either side were Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain) \u2013 was also committed to the film\u2019s major selling point. That being the once fanboy-quivering prospect of seeing the Hulk brought to life \u2013 a transformation that didn\u2019t involve slapping green paint on a bodybuilder.\u201cAng Lee was such a team player, he decided to suit up and do a bunch of the motion capture himself,\u201d says Aaron Ferguson, then a creature supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic. \u201cHe was able to channel his inner Hulk and storm around.\u201dRecommendedBruce Lee\u2019s long, violent journey to immortality: \u2018He knew the star should always be the boss\u2019Daredevil at 20: Backlash, Evanescence and Ben Affleck\u2019s (first) superhero flopEric Bana: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be James Bond \u2013 it would have been too much fame for my head\u2019Hulk began development in the early 1990s, with multiple screenwriters writing multiple drafts and various directors attached. Different proposed scenarios would have seen Hulk battling terrorists, insect men, sharks, or his giant-headed nemesis, The Leader. Leaked details were also subject to early examples of toxic online fandom \u2013 the kind of entitled, gate-keeping bile that spews up around certain pop culture properties. Universal had blown a reported $20m on pre-production before Lee even joined. Schamus remembers there being \u201c15 or 16 prior drafts\u201d when they signed on. \u201cIt was just all over the map,\u201d he adds. Lee may have been an unlikely candidate for Hulk, but he took on the project \u2013 in part \u2013 out of cinematic wonderment. Their attitude with their projects by that point, says Schamus, was \u201cthat sounds cool. We love movies; let\u2019s go make movies!\u201d\n\nThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing.

Schamus recalls that Marvel Studios at the time consisted mostly of CEO/producer Avi Arad, with Kevin Feige \u2013 now the mastermind of the MCU \u2013 as a junior assistant. \u201cI would notice him and think, \u2018Oh, this guy, he knows what he\u2019s doing!\u2019\u201d laughs Schamus.With Schamus rewriting the script himself, Hulk followed the long-held movie tradition of tampering with the original comic (see also: Spider-Man\u2019s organic web-shooters and Power Ranger-like Green Goblin; the X-Men not being man enough for yellow spandex). In the Incredible Hulk comic, first published in 1962, Bruce Banner is a scientist who \u2013 while saving someone else\u2019s life \u2013 gets caught in the blast of a gamma bomb, which causes him to transform into the Hulk. Schamus was free from the restraints of hardcore fandom (\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up as a comic-book geek kid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t formative to me\u201d), but he did go back to the comics. He was taken by a 1980s storyline that introduced Banner\u2019s abusive father, who killed the future Hulk\u2019s mother \u2013 the source of grown-up Banner\u2019s anger issues.The 2003 movie follows loosely: Banner\u2019s father, David (Nick Nolte) is a government scientist who \u2013 against orders \u2013 performs an experiment on himself and passes mutant genes to his son. Years later, Bruce (Bana) \u2013 now a nanotech scientist \u2013 is involved in a gamma accident that triggers the mutant cells. Like the Eighties comic book, this version of Banner witnessed his father murder his mother. The real cause of the monster is the repressed memory of this incident.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7-daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeWith so many previous script drafts and writers, the film was subject to a tricky arbitration over the writing credits. Certain elements, including the abusive father, had shown up in previous drafts. In the end, Schamus shared the writing credit with previous scriptwriters Michael France and John Turman. The arbitration was detailed in a New Yorker cover story. Two decades on, Schamus is pragmatic about the controversy. He thinks there was some political wrangling in the Writers Guild. \u201cAlso, whatever,\u201d he says, laughing.Ang Lee studies Hulk heads on the set of the 2003 film (Shutterstock)Schamus recalls pushing to cast Bana after seeing him in Chopper. Bana, as wonderful as he is, gets eaten alive by Nolte, who plays his onscreen father with off-kilter, sunken-eyed menace \u2013 despite the inherent ridiculousness of being a mad scientist with three giant mutant dogs (including a killer poodle). Discovering his own superhuman ability \u2013 to fuse with any material he lays his hands on \u2013 he becomes a reworking of the comics\u2019 Absorbing Man.\u201cI really adored Nick,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cHe was definitely in the process of becoming the character that he\u2019s now more known as \u2013 after the mugshot that happened when we were in post [he was arrested for driving while high on the date rape drug, GHB]. But he doesn\u2019t show up on screen without giving everything. Ang let him chew the scenery right down to the floorboards.\u201dCo-stars include Jennifer Connelly as Banner\u2019s long-time sweetheart, Betty Ross; Sam Elliot as Hulk\u2019s military adversary (and Betty\u2019s father), Thunderbolt Ross; and Josh Lucas \u2013 the only person in the film who seems to be having some fun \u2013 as a soldier-turned-corporate snide, whose job it is to bully Banner then get thrown around by the Hulk. There are cameos, too, from Hulk co-creator Stan Lee (naturally) and Lou Ferrigno, the 6ft 5in bodybuilder who played the Hulk (with the help of green grease paint) in the 1970s TV series. The original Hulk comic was cancelled after six issues. It was actually the TV show that made the Hulk a pop culture icon, as summed up by its most iconic line: \u201cDon\u2019t make me angry, you wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry\u201d. The 2003 Hulk saves the line for the very last scene.Lou Ferrigno as the Hulked-out version of Dr Bruce Banner in the classic \u2018Incredible Hulk\u2019 TV series (Snap/Shutterstock)At one stage, the VFX maestros at Industrial Light & Magic considered going down the Ferrigno route to create the Hulk \u2013 an ambitious project in the early Noughties. \u201cThere was a lot of wondering what we had gotten ourselves into \u2013 was this more than we could do?\u201d Aaron Ferguson says. \u201cThere were lots of people shaking their heads and a lot of crazy ideas. One idea was that maybe we should do it as a guy in a suit and adjust it all after [digitally]. People were like, \u2018That\u2019s not gonna work!\u2019\u201dOne major challenge, recalls Ferguson, is that ILM hadn\u2019t quite caught up with the latest evolution in CGI tech. Even then, the techniques ILM was using to create the Hulk were old school. The colour green was a problem, too. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around with the dailies and think, \u2018What is wrong with this shot?\u2019\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cA co-worker said \u2018look at this\u2019 and changed the monitor so it was just black and white. Everyone was like, \u2018That looks so much better!\u2019 The green breaks the illusion of it being human. No matter what shade you use, somewhere in your mind there\u2019s something wrong with it.\u201dFor Ferguson, the best part of the job was working with Lee. \u201cAn all-in kind of guy,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m coming and staying at the studio and working with you guys.\u2019 We had dailies with him every day. He was full of ideas.\u201dTwenty years on, the Hulk CGI looks better than you might expect \u2013 though certainly primitive. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say cringeworthy,\u201d says Ferguson, \u201cbut there\u2019s dated material in there.\u201d A fight with the mutant dogs \u2013 which felt like a cop out in lieu of a proper superhero vs supervillain punch-up at the time \u2013 is a highlight. And a desert battle between Hulk and the US army feels like a bit of freeform Hulk action.Eric Bana\u2019s Dr Bruce Banner is consoled by Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in \u2018Hulk\u2019  (Shutterstock)But for all of Lee\u2019s stomping around in mo-cap Hulk mode, the film \u2013 about a man who turns into a green monster, lest we forget \u2013 is jarringly straight-faced. \u201cThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cThere was more of that self-aware wisecracking! By the time you got the finished film it was taking itself very seriously.\u201dIt\u2019s best demonstrated by the film\u2019s first Hulk-out scene \u2013 the moment that everyone\u2019s been waiting for. It\u2019s not part of an all-action spectacle, like Avengers Assemble\u2019s helicarrier wallop-fest, but a scene of Bana\u2019s troubled scientist sitting alone, having a good old think about who he really is deep down.Lee is also one of the few directors \u2013 alongside Tim Burton and Sam Raimi, perhaps \u2013 to make a film that actually resembles a comic book. Using split screen and other techniques, Lee replicates comic panels and gives scenes a sense of propulsion. The sound, says Schamus, was designed to draw you to different places on screen.It\u2019s as if Hulk leapt forward. We didn\u2019t get the straight-up, all-action Incredible Hulk movie \u2013 something more like the 2008 film starring Edward Norton. Instead, Lee went straight to the subversive reinvention \u2013 like skipping Batman and making The Dark Knight first; or giving us Logan before \u00adX-Men. But some critics didn\u2019t have the same foresight. The New York Times said \u201cincredible, but only in a negative sense: incredibly long, incredibly tedious, incredibly turgid\u201d. The Independent called it \u201ca decent but doomed attempt to humanise a debased genre\u201d.Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno, Ang Lee, Eric Bana and Nick Nolte at the \u2018Hulk\u2019 world premiere in June 2003 (Getty)\u201cI think the studio was much more surprised than I was,\u201d Schamus says about the reaction. \u201cTo their credit, the money people and executives were very supportive and really loved the film. I think it was very sobering to them to crash against the initial wave of disappointment. For me, it was what I thought was going to happen.\u201dRecommended\u2018Nightmarish\u2019: 17 terrible performances by great actorsEmile Hirsch on remorse, wanderlust and child stardom: \u2018I was wary of Hollywood\u2019\u2018You can\u2019t act!\u2019 26 co-stars who famously didn\u2019t get onStill, Hulk made money \u2013 $245m \u2013 and Schamus put together ideas for a sequel. Instead, the character was rebooted for the MCU with Norton\u2019s unfairly-unloved The Incredible Hulk five years later. Banner was then recast with Mark Ruffalo for Avengers team-ups. Universal still owns the distribution rights for Hulk-led films, which means Hulk plays a supporting role in MCU adventures. It might be for the best. The Bana and Norton films prove that he\u2019s a tricky solo act.Hulk is best appreciated within the context of 20 years\u2019 worth of superhero cinema that followed \u2013 to see how, like the Hulk himself, it\u2019s an outsider. \u201cIt\u2019s not your typical film,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a weird movie. I can understand why Marvel wouldn\u2019t want to do something like this again. But if directors were given a little more creative freedom, maybe they wouldn\u2019t see the burnout we\u2019re starting to have with superhero films \u2013 they\u2019re all kind of the same.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23d051ac33150be929d0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-flash-movie-review-ezra-miller-metacritic-b2352838.html", "primaryCategory": "Reviews", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Flash review: Muddled, poignant and \u2013 because of Ezra Miller \u2013 morally tricky", "lead": "<p>Blighted by development problems and a star whose downward spiral has been widely dissected by all, this superhero blockbuster emerges just as confused as predicted </p>", "author": "Clarisse Loughrey", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 12:59:30 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:32.791409", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T12:59:30+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/06/15/the-flash-ezra-miller.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeShould Warner Bros have shelved The Flash? I\u2019m honestly not sure I have an answer. The accounts of its star, Ezra Miller, and their two-year downward spiral \u2013 which include allegations of harassment, grooming and physical violence \u2013 is distressing in a way that extends beyond all critical analysis. What needs to come, before even the matter of accountability, is the question of why there was no support system in place. Why was no one empowered either with the tools or with the moral imperative to intervene in a situation where an individual was in such a clearly dangerous state?There\u2019s no real sense that anyone would be helped by either the release or the cancellation of Miller\u2019s movie. In both scenarios, Warner Bros gets to shrug all responsibility and focus on the fate of its product and not the people it employs. And though the actor is (as their representatives stress) currently seeking treatment, the hand-wringing over a proposed sequel brings with it the perverse implication that said treatment will end not when medical professionals say so, but when Hollywood decides it\u2019s time for Miller to go back to work.The Flash, which has been in active development for nearly a decade, now also arrives after the announcement that DC\u2019s new leadership, Peter Safran and James Gunn, will largely be starting over from scratch. Farewell to 10 years of impotent franchise blueprints. It means that the film arriving here is an odd one \u2013 muddled and uncertain of its own identity, coloured by outside circumstance, but oddly poignant at times. It\u2019s stuck somewhere in between cynical fan service and a more sincere yearning to create art out of corporate strategising.Much of that division is inherent to its plot, which sees The Flash, aka Barry Allen, on an intimate journey of metaphysical implications. Barry, when we first meet him, is frustrated by his place in the superhero pantheon, having essentially become \u201cthe janitor of the Justice League\u201d and left to clean up Batman\u2019s (Ben Affleck) messes. He\u2019s also pained by his inability to prove his father (Ron Livingston) innocent of the murder of his mother (Maribel Verd\u00fa). And so he uses his powers to, as Cher would put it, turn back time. But that screws up the space-time continuum in the process \u2013 leading Barry to cross paths with a younger version of himself that\u2019s never experienced any of the same loss or any of the same heroics.Screenwriter Christina Hodson, who also wrote DC\u2019s Birds of Prey, is thankfully able to tease some of the humanity out of this meta-human. This is, after all, a story about the grief process, and a literalisation of the concept of healing one\u2019s inner child. Barry gets to see who he\u2019d have been without the personal pain, and naturally starts to resent his more fortunate, unperturbed self. Miller consistently hits the right balance with these dual, sometimes competing performances \u2013 a step up for a character whose only defining trait used to be \u201cirritating\u201d. It\u2019s a product of the strong writing here\u2026 when you can actually hear it over the sounds of explosions and cheques being cashed.RecommendedThe Flash director says Tom Cruise cold called him to praise Ezra Miller movie: Huge \u2018confidence boost\u2019Ezra Miller alludes to legal troubles at The Flash premiereEzra Miller: Everything we know about the controversial star of The FlashAs has been exhaustingly teased, Barry\u2019s timeline shenanigans land him in a universe where Michael Keaton is Batman, as he was in Tim Burton\u2019s double-dose of films in 1989 and 1992. Keaton turns up with the same winsome smirk as Andrew Garfield in Spider-Man: No Way Home, if very little of the same emotional closure. Director Andy Muschietti is probably the one having the most fun here, as he enthusiastically launches his film into the gothic, fog-encrusted aesthetics of Burton\u2019s work and the desaturated gloom of Zack Snyder\u2019s DC contributions (Michael Shannon\u2019s Zod, of Man of Steel fame, also returns). There are additionally two Flash-centric sequences that pay unexpected homage to the Looney Tunes, complete with babies freefalling out of skyscrapers and a band\u2019s worth of musical instruments tumbling out of a truck. They\u2019re so self-indulgently silly that they kind of work. That\u2019s if you ignore the wildly inconsistent special effects.There are a handful of other cameos, some of them so ludicrous you almost have to admire the tenacity, as well as a featherlight appearance from Sasha Calle\u2019s Supergirl. It\u2019s clear that DC doesn\u2019t really know what it\u2019s paying tribute to, other than the knowledge that other comic book movies exist. The Flash, much like Barry himself, has been stranded with no real sense of history, and no real sense of the future, either. It does the best it can.Dir: Andy Muschietti.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAmerican novelist Barbara Kingsolver says she could hear the cheering all the way from her home region of Appalachia when she won the Women\u2019s Prize on Wednesday night.She took home the top prize for her novel Demon Copperhead, making history as the first author to win twice (she also won in 2010 for her sixth novel, The Lacuna).The book is a modern retelling of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, set in Virginia in the Nineties and putting the spotlight on the devastation of the opioid crisis.As someone who lives in Virginia, Kingsolver saw the crisis take hold before it was covered by mainstream media.\u201cOne of my daughters is a therapist, who works full time with teenagers,\u201d says Kingsolver, explaining that through this she was able to begin to grasp \u201cthe stretch of it, the intensity of it, the life and death situations every day of it \u2013 this is a huge crisis.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cAnd the least told part of the story is the kids,\u201d Kingsolver adds. \u201cWe have a generation of kids growing up in our region, who are being raised by a horribly flawed foster care system, or relatives who really would rather not be raising them \u2013 and that\u2019s going to be with us forever.\u201dAs stories of the crisis began to hit the news, Kingsolver says: \u201cI thought, OK \u2013 people know the story of the big guys, but nobody knows the story of the little guys \u2013 that is not resolved, that will never be resolved. This is generational trauma, and it\u2019s going to be with us forever.\u201dAppalachia has been particularly affected by the crisis, and the writer says the region now looks vastly different from her youth.\u201cWhen I was growing up, there was beer and whisky and weed. Now, there\u2019s meth and oxy and fentanyl. The extent of the addiction crisis is not something any of us could have imagined when I was growing up.\u201dDemon Copperhead gives the crisis a human face, particularly with the struggles of the titular character.Kingsolver aimed to \u201ccreate empathy\u201d, saying she wanted to \u201ctell people a story that gently brings them inside of that world and helps them understand this, helps them develop some empathy and compassion for this disease\u201d.When researching the book \u2013 which took her three years to write \u2013 she spoke to recovering addicts, something she says was \u201cessential\u201d as \u201cthat was a part of this world I had only seen from the outside, fortunately\u201d.She seems moved when talking about the women who shared their stories with her, saying: \u201cThey were so generous. I can\u2019t imagine it \u2013 sitting down with me for hours and talking to me about the most scary, degrading parts of their lives, and what they had to go through, and what they had to do in order to just stay alive.\u201dShe says she\u2019s become good friends with the women. They messaged her this morning to say, \u201cOur book won a prize!\u201d, Kingsolver shares with evident pride. \u201cI could hear the cheering all the way from Virginia \u2013 just to be seen and heard, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she adds.Kingsolver, 68, left Kentucky when she went to university at 18, and says she was \u201cshocked\u201d by how she was treated.\u201cI got to go to a little college in Indiana, where I got a scholarship \u2013 it was just Indiana, but people there made so much fun of me, so much fun of my accent and my Kentucky hillbilly-ness. I\u2019d never known that about myself until I left.\u201dShe admits spending years trying to \u201ccover\u201d that part of herself up. \u201cJust in order to try and succeed in the world and feel equal to people,\u201d she says, \u201cI really aspired to some cosmopolitan constructed persona that nobody would recognise as hillbilly.\u201dEven now, Kingsolver says she code switches: \u201cWhen I\u2019m at home, I don\u2019t talk like this. I have another whole language that I use to talk with my neighbours.\u201dWhile she did try and write in the new, cosmopolitan persona she adopted, Kingsolver pulls no punches in saying it was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started reading Kentucky writers \u2013 Bobbie Ann Mason was really important to me and Wendell Berry \u2013 it shocked me that there were people from back home, who were claiming that identity and writing from that place. When I began to do that \u2013 I won\u2019t say I recovered who I am, I discovered who I am. I discovered I was Appalachian only after I left.\u201dShe went on to find huge success with novels like The Poisonwood Bible in 1998 and previous Women\u2019s Prize-winner The Lacuna.With books like Demon Copperhead, Kingsolver strives to overturn common misconceptions and stereotypes around people from Appalachia.\u201cIf Appalachia shows up at all in television or the movies, it\u2019s as a joke \u2013 this monochromatic monoculture of backward white people. We\u2019re so much more than that, and to represent my people with nuance is my first goal.\u201dAfter years living in Europe and Arizona, Kingsolver finally returned to Appalachia full time in 2004 \u2013 and she\u2019s suitably poetic about why she loves the region so much.\u201cThe moss, the ferns, the trees, the water that comes pouring out of the mountains, the natural beauty of the place, the people, the language, the storytelling, the resourcefulness \u2013 it\u2019s a culture where people make things for themselves, by themselves.

He will leave in 2025, when his 10-year term comes to an end.\u201cIt has been and remains the greatest privilege of my career to lead the National Theatre,\u201d Norris said in a statement on Thursday 15 June.\u201cFor the past eight years I have had the honour of shaping the programme of extraordinary work that sparks imagination, brings people together and illustrates the vital role theatre can play in all our lives.\u201cThe daily highlight has been to work with the peerless theatre-makers who work here, together with the incredible range of freelance artists upon whom the present and the future of the art form relies.\u201dRecommendedJurassic Park fans feel ancient as child star recreates green jelly scene aged 43Black Mirror season six review: Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi mishmash needs to stop messing with a winning formulaThe Love Island cast\u2019s reactions to 30-year-old Charlotte were disappointing, but not surprisingIn the five years before Covid, the National Theatre under Norris had its biggest audiences so far. Norris said today that audience numbers have now returned to pre-pandemic levels. He has overseen a number of hits, from Dominic Cooke\u2019s revival of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Follies to Marianne Elliott\u2019s star-studded production of Angels in America, which won Tonys upon its transfer to Broadway.Other acclaimed productions have included Natasha Gordon\u2019s Nine Night, an adaptation of Network starring Bryan Cranston, and a stage version of Andrea Levy\u2019s classic novel Small Island, which Norris directed himself.However, the National\u2019s commitment to staging new writing has on occasion resulted in a few notorious flops, including Moira Buffini\u2019s Manor and DC Moore\u2019s Common. Norris said he was \u201cenormously proud\u201d of the \u201cdiverse, thriving, creative hub the National Theatre is today.\u201d\u201cFrom the work on our stages, to the audiences all around the UK and beyond that engage with us on tour, in cinemas, in schools and at home, the NT entertains and inspires people through our creativity, expertise and unique reach,\u201d he said.\u201cThe magic of the National Theatre is that there is nowhere else like it; to have been a small part in its illustrious history, particularly through the challenges of the last few years, is a true honour.\u201d (Getty)The Independent understands that the search for a \u201csuccessor or successors\u201d will start now, with an aim to announce a replacement by the end of this year or the beginning of 2024.Norris trained as an actor at the illustrious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) in London, before turning his hand to directing.He won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Outstanding Newcomer in 2001 with his production of David Rudkin\u2019s Afore Night Come at the Young Vic. He won a second award, this time for Best Director, for his 2004 production of Festen.Along with the news of his forthcoming departure, Norris has announced 12 new productions that will be held on the National Theatre\u2019s South Bank stages. These include Nye, a new play from Tim Price starring Michael Sheen, and a production of Shakespeare\u2019s Roman tragedy Coriolanus, starring David Oyelowo in the title role.David Oyelowo at the Oscars in 2017 (Ian West/PA) (PA Archive)Attending a press conference to announce the news, Norris joked to reporters of his plans: \u201cI\u2019d like to go outside for a bit, in a couple of years, but beyond that no plans.\u201dNorris said he hoped to be remembered as \"someone whose dress sense got better as time went on\", as well as the person who oversaw the NT's improving representation among artists and audiences. The NT has yet to appoint a woman to the role of artistic director. Asked about his prospective replacement, Norris said: \u201cLook this just isn\u2019t my business, the board have to choose the best person for the job, but if I felt I was employed for anything other than my aptitude for the job that\u2019s another form of exclusion and patronisation.\" (Ellie Kurttz/National Theatre)Chair of the National Theatre, Sir Damon Buffini, said in a statement: \u201cRufus Norris has led the National Theatre with extraordinary skill, foresight and resilience during a decade of huge change in the UK and globally.\u201cThe National\u2019s artistic programme, as shaped by Rufus, has been exceptional in quality, prescience and popular appeal, reaching bigger audiences than at any time in the theatre\u2019s history.RecommendedDenise Welch to play Queen Elizabeth II in a musical about Princess DianaLea Michele shares selfie with former Glee co-star Alex Newell at Tony AwardsSamuel L Jackson\u2019s \u2018loser face\u2019 at Tony Awards goes viral\u201cAlongside that, Rufus\u2019 passionate belief in opening up hands-on opportunities to young people and communities has boosted creativity right across the country and beyond.

His collaborators include Canadian pop star Drake, Barbadian singer Rihanna, US rapper Lil Wayne, and singer/producer Akon. Earlier this week, Khaled posted a video of an accident that occured when he was surfing on what appears to be a foilboard in Florida. A foilboard, also known as a hydrofoil, is a type of surfboard that lifts above the water. Rather than a regular fin, a foilboard has a longer fin \u2013 called a hydrofoil \u2013 that extends down, allowing the board to hover up and out of the water. The clip shows Khaled attempting to stand up on the board only to wipe out moments later.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeUS superstar Beyonc\u00e9 is said to be behind the surprisingly high inflation that occurred in Sweden last month.Inflation in the country fell below 10 per cent in May, according to official statistics, but was still higher than expected. While a decrease in electricity and food prices contributed to the lower inflation rate of 9.7 per cent (down from 10.5 per cent in April), Statistics Sweden said that costs of hotel and restaurant visits rose.Michael Grahn, an economist at Danske Bank, believes that the launch of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance World Tour in Stockholm on 10 May could be behind it. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t... blame Beyonc\u00e9 for [the] high inflation print, but her performance and global demand to see her perform in Sweden apparently added a little to it,\u201d he told the BBC.RecommendedBeyonc\u00e9 review, Cardiff: Full-throttle dance moves or not, Bey rides her disco horse into megastardomEminem\u2019s daughter Alaina Marie Scott marries longtime boyfriend Matt MoellerTom Holland says he wasn\u2019t trying to make a \u2018statement\u2019 with his iconic Rihanna lip syncLast month, Visit Stockholm described the boom in tourism in the country as the \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 effect\u201d.According to the agency\u2019s press officer, Birgitta Palm\u00e9r, visitors from US, Germany, and the UK accounted for the largest number of bookings in the city in May, apparently taking advantage of lower ticket prices and the weak Swedish currency.Grahn told the Wall Street Journal that this effect was \u201cvery rare\u201d and he expected the situation to settle by next month. However, another economist warned that Sweden could experience a similar increase when rock star Bruce Springsteen performs three shows in Gothenburg in June, the Financial Times reports.In her four out of five-star review of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cardiff concert, The Independent\u2019s Nicole Vassell wrote that \u201cin her forties\u201d, the singer \u201cis doing some of the best singing of her life.\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 literally rides her disco horse into the distance, leaving in her wake the thousands left marvelling at her musical and visual voyage they\u2019ve been a part of,\u201d she added.

Zachariah, however, did choose to sleep with his new partner Catherine.In the morning, Mitchel told his fellow contestants that it was \u201cover\u201d between him and Molly.Love Island continues on ITV2 and ITVX at 9pm every day of the week except Saturdays.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeReviewing a season of\u00a0Black Mirror is like reviewing the British weather. One moment you\u2019re basking in the sun, the next you\u2019re being drenched with rain. When Charlie Brooker\u2019s speculative anthology series, predominantly concerned with our technological future, first aired in 2011, it was hailed as both brilliantly acerbic and powerfully prescient. But as the years have gone on \u2013 and as the series has moved from Channel 4 to Netflix, employing ever more American stars \u2013 the quality has become more variable. Like the weather.Four years after the release of series five \u2013 which suffered a significant dip in critical reception \u2013\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0is back with a five-episode season. Tackling issues from artificial intelligence to automaton clones, via genres ranging from black comedy to supernatural horror, the new series is inflected with classic\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0tropes but also brings something new. For the first time,\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0is not merely holding the looking glass up to the damage wrought by technology,\u00a0but to the self-inflicted wounds of society as well. The resultant mishmash demonstrates that the best episodes of\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0will always be dystopian, and experimenting with that winning formula is a fool\u2019s errand.Joan is Awful \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606Joan (Annie Murphy) is a middle manager at an amorphous tech firm. She\u2019s having a bad day: the coffee tastes like\u00a0garbage,\u00a0she has to fire an employee, her ex is in town and hitting her up, and she vents about her milquetoast relationship to the paid ears of her therapist. She\u2019s shocked, therefore, when she returns home and, scrolling through Streamberry (in a Netflix dupe), sees a show called\u00a0Joan is Awful, starring Salma Hayek as someone who looks an awful lot like her. Thus begins her slow descent into chaos.RecommendedJosh Hartnett on Black Mirror, Oppenheimer and saying no to celebrity: \u2018I was on a different path\u2019Succession\u2019s brutal finale cements Shakespearean tragedy as one of this century\u2019s greatest works of artThe Idol review: Striking, sordid drama comes close to a profound insight into our times\u201cJoan is Awful\u201d is, in many ways, the most classic episode of\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0in this season. High concept, it deals with the impacts of personalised content, privacy invasion and deep fakes. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not the main character in my life story,\u201d Joan says, before her reality begins to disassemble. It\u2019s also the episode that best reminds viewers that\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0started life with a story about the prime minister getting amorous with a pig on live television. Irreverent, scatological, and nightmarishly claustrophobic, \u201cJoan is Awful\u201d is an excellent instalment in\u00a0Black Mirror\u2019s catalogue of Orwellian farces.Annie Murphy as Joan in 'Joan is Awful\u2019 (Nick Wall/Netflix)Loch Henry \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u201cLoch Henry\u201d first appears as an option on Streamberry during \u201cJoan is Awful\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t really do another true crime,\u201d comes the verdict of Joan\u2019s fianc\u00e9. The true crime in question is the historic murder of some honeymooners in the Scottish Highlands, a subject that Davis (Samuel Plenkin) and Pia (Industry\u2019s excellent\u00a0Myha\u2019la Herrold) decide would make a fitting topic for their graduate documentary project. Of course, this being\u00a0Black Mirror, all is not quite what it seems, and a sterling cast of locals (including Monica Dolan, John Hannah and Daniel Portman) bring an increasing sense of unease to this dredging of past trauma.As a standalone, hour-long piece of meta true crime,\u00a0Loch Henry\u00a0is effective. Plenkin and Herrold stay \u2013 just about \u2013 on the right side of annoying (\u201cI thought you were in London studying woke film theory,\u201d comes the earthy verdict of Portman\u2019s publican). As the plot progresses, shades of David Fincher\u2019s\u00a0The Girl with theDragon Tattoo appear, and\u00a0\u201cLoch Henry\u201d frequently shapes like it\u2019s about to burst into full horror. Whether through restraint or lack of ambition, that generic metamorphosis never happens, and ultimately the episode becomes a little limp. There is a vague, underlying commentary on the commercialisation of tragedy (a critique that feels very contemporary, and not at all speculative) but little to root this in the traditions of great Black Mirror episodes. \u201cThat\u2019s real,\u201d Davis laments, of his family history. \u201cThat\u2019s not f***ing content!\u201d Well, it\u2019s not really f***ing\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0either, though, is it?Myha\u2019la Herrold as Pia in \u2018Loch Henry\u2019 (Nick Wall/Netflix)Beyond the Sea \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606David (Josh Hartnett) and Cliff (Aaron Paul) live very separate lives, down in 1960s America. David and his beautiful brood live in a modernist house in California, and he struts around like an all-American hero; Cliff, his wife Lana (Kate Mara) and their son have just relocated to a rural idyll where they chop wood and tickle trout from babbling brooks. These men, however, are \u201creplicas\u201d, mint-condition robots controlled by the consciousness of the real David and Cliff, who are serving a\u00a0six-year mission on a space station. But the programme is proving controversial. \u201cA man sleeps in the sky while his mechanical image walks the earth,\u201d says Rory Culkin\u2019s Mansonesque hippy, who breaks into David\u2019s home and kidnaps his wife. \u201cAnd you share your bed with this abomination?\u201dFrom this central tragedy, the drama spins off in two locations. The men, trapped in their tin can, floating\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of miles from Earth,\u00a0and robot Cliff, home on the ranch, and now remotely operated by both men.\u00a0Like the very best episodes of\u00a0Black Mirror, this is gloomy, high-concept stuff, and the A-list cast excels in this 80-minute character study, which essentially becomes a very\u00a0human\u00a0three-hander between David, Cliff and Lana. The Hartnaissance (he is due to appear in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer this summer after a quiet second decade to his career) is well and truly on, while Paul and Mara crackle as a brittle couple struggling with their, um, long-distance relationship (though Mara\u2019s agent ought to note that she\u2019s in danger of being typecast as an adulteress).At its core, \u201cBeyond the Sea\u201d has the key to a great Black Mirror chapter: slow-burning\u00a0dread and myriad ways for things to go wrong. Already at a quasi-feature length, the episode could easily have used an extra half-hour to come to the boil \u2013 the climax is a little rushed \u2013 but it tackles big sci-fi issues, the sort addressed in films like\u00a0Moon\u00a0and\u00a0Sunshine, with superb confidence.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7-daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Back in Los Angeles, Bo (Zazie Beetz) is an invasive paparazzo, whose snooping has just resulted in the suicide of a minor television celebrity. \u201cHalf of these assholes would kill themselves if we didn\u2019t take their picture,\u201d a cynical fellow pap tells her.\u00a0She\u2019s\u00a0able to compartmentalise the guilt as she\u2019s tasked with establishing Day\u2019s whereabouts after the actress is booted off set and disappears from public view. With a $30,000 bounty placed on a photograph of the troubled starlet, Bo heads off, following the scent.In every season of\u00a0Black Mirror, there\u2019s an episode that feels a real bugger\u2019s muddle. \u201cWhite Bear\u201d, say, from season 2, or season 5\u2019s \u201cSmithereens\u201d. \u201cMazey Day\u201d fulfils that role in the latest tranche of episodes, proving that Brooker is as capable of inanity as profundity. Set in the\u00a0mid-Noughties\u00a0(the birth of Suri Cruise is announced on the radio in the opening) and taking aim, in quite a ham-fisted way, at the tabloid culture that harangued celebrities, \u201cMazey Day\u201d is the apex of the issue with these latest episodes: it has nothing to do with technology, nor is it making a substantive dissection of the modern moment. Put aside the fact that the episode dissolves into a melange of sub-horror fantasy tropes,\u00a0and\u00a0the representation of paparazzi culture\u00a0here\u00a0seems a rather Nineties and Noughties\u00a0obsession. Slender (it\u2019s just 40 minutes long) and scattershot, it is also a rare episode of\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0that\u00a0feels actively backwards looking.Zazie Beetz in \u2018Mazey Day\u2019  (Netflix)Demon 79 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606It\u2019s 1979, and the Winter of Discontent has left Britain on a political knife edge. Callaghan\u2019s government is in crisis, and right-wing firebrands are swarming through the north of England, inciting racial unrest. Nida (Anjana Vasan) lives in a house which is daubed with National Front graffiti and works in a shoe store where she is routinely victimised by colleagues. When she finds a talisman in the basement, and accidentally imbues it with her blood, she inadvertently summons the demon Gaap (Paapa Essiedu) from the bowels of hell. He tells her \u2013 taking the form of the lead singer of Boney M \u2013 that she must make three human sacrifices, over three days, in order to stop the world from burning up in the fires of nuclear war. And so begins a tough week for Nida.It\u2019s easy to forget \u2013 as\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0has achieved global domination and a massive Netflix deal \u2013 that Brooker began his career on comedy TV projects like\u00a0Brass Eye\u00a0and\u00a0Nathan Barley. Of all the episodes in this new series of\u00a0Black Mirror, \u201cDemon 79\u201d is the closest to a comedy. Sure, there\u2019s some graphic violence involving people being bludgeoned to death with bricks and hammers, but there\u2019s also a foundational buddy comedy element in the mismatched partnership between Nida and Gaap, who will be kicked out of \u201cdemon school\u201d if she doesn\u2019t complete her triple-murder. \u201cI would endure a profound, palpable and ever-present lack of existence,\u201d he tells Nida, imploring her to pick up her hammer. \u201cSounds like my life,\u201d she deadpans back.Anjana Vasan as Nida in 'Demon 79\u2019 (Nick Wall/Netflix)At 75 minutes long, \u201cDemon 79\u201d flirts with the same scope as \u201cBeyond the Sea\u201d. Tonally, it is not dissimilar to Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon\u2019s\u00a0The Cabin in the Woods, braiding violence, comedy and apocalyptic ennui into a slick plait\u00a0Like \u201cMazey Day\u201d, it is more\u00a0nostalgic than\u00a0the prophetic, Dickensian (that\u2019s Philip K Dick, I mean, not Charles Dickens) episodes, but the issues of 1979 Britain feel strikingly (no pun intended) present.

It will be offered as part of their marquee modern and contemporary evening.The painting was created when Klimt was in his artistic prime, and at a moment when the \u201cformality\u201d of his earlier commissioned work gave way to a new expressivity. The artist died unexpectedly in 1918 at the age of 55.Klimt started work on Lady With A Fan in 1917, by which time he was among the most celebrated portrait artists in Europe, receiving commissions at prices far higher than his contemporaries.However, this was a rare work painted entirely in the pursuit of his own interests and demonstrates a \u201cfreedom and spontaneity\u201d that reflects Klimt\u2019s joy in painting, experts said.RecommendedJurassic Park fans feel ancient as child star recreates green jelly scene aged 43Phillip Schofield\u2019s lover denied affair 12 times, ITV boss Carolyn McCall tells MPsThe Idol viewers horrified by The Weeknd\u2019s dialogue during Lily-Rose Depp sex scene: \u2018Nasty\u2019Unlike traditional vertical \u201cportrait\u201d paintings, Lady With A Fan returns to the square format that Klimt used for his avant-garde landscapes earlier in the century, giving this painting a uniquely \u201cmodern\u201d edge.

This, though, is something completely different \u2013 a technical tour de force, full of boundary-pushing experimentation, as well as a heartfelt ode to absolute beauty.\u201dThe painting was acquired shortly after Klimt\u2019s death by Viennese industrialist Erwin Boohler, whose family was close friends and patrons of both Klimt and fellow painter Egon Schiele.The exhibition at Sotheby\u2019s New Bond Street galleries later this month will see three major portraits by the artist on view simultaneously in the capital for the first time.RecommendedDamien Hirst painting of Leonardo DiCaprio sells for more than \u00a31m at charity auctionAndy Warhol in breach of copyright over Prince artwork, Supreme Court rulesTurner Prize shortlist includes \u2018tender\u2019 tribute to Windrush generationLady With A Fan will be displayed alongside Hermine Gallia, of 1904, and Adele Bloch Bauer II, of 1912, which are currently on view in the National Gallery\u2019s After Impressionism show.Additional reporting by Press Association"}, {"_id": "648b23d751ac33150be929f4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/marvel-john-romita-death-jonathan-ross-james-gunn-b2357972.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jonathan Ross leads tributes to \u2018truly beautiful\u2019 Marvel artist John Romita", "lead": "<p>Romita died \u2018peacefully in his sleep\u2019 aged 93</p>", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 06:43:44 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:39.988849", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T06:43:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/11/14104106-8e22aee0-077a-4017-acde-5135d01242ed.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A couple of travelling musicians are playing instruments unlike anything found in an orchestra on Earth, while the intergalactic singing sensation Gaya meets her adoring fans.

We\u2019re delighted to have played our part, even if the rest of the evening has fellow travellers who weren\u2019t in on the plan congratulating us on our fake engagement.Although the opportunities to learn lightsaber moves, take the helm on the starship\u2019s bridge and learn the intricacies of the engine room were the more eye-catching features of Disney World\u2019s Galactic Starcuiser, what made the Star-Wars hotel-meets-live-action-roleplaying-experience special was the opportunity to be right in the middle of the action \u2013 to feel part of a Star Wars story.Read more on Orlando travel:The ultimate guide to Orlando\u2019s best theme parksWhy it\u2019s time to swap Disney for downtown OrlandoBest hotels in OrlandoThere are many opportunities for Star Wars fans to do something special, with the most obvious being the regular Star Wars Celebration event, where you\u2019re surrounded by other devotees and can pack a decade\u2019s worth of talks, screenings and exhibits into four days. Then there\u2019s also Steve Sansweet\u2019s incredible memorabilia museum near San Francisco, Madame Tussauds\u2019 accurate recreations of the movie characters in London and, of course, Galaxy\u2019s Edge at Disney\u2019s US theme parks.What none of these attractions offer, though, is the sense of total immersion that I found on the Galactic Starcruiser at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. This is the first Star Wars experience that allows you to actually be a participant in the story \u2013 and that\u2019s why, despite the many people who seem to be crowing over the pricey attraction\u2019s premature demise, in my opinion it\u2019s a real shame that it will be closing its doors for good this September.Participants sleeps in \u2018cabins\u2019 aboard the starcruiser (Graham E. Hancock)Arriving at the building filled me with anticipation, but the bunker-looking exterior is very much going for the functional starport vibe. Once we stepped onto a \u2018transport\u2019 though, and felt the ground rumbling as we were taken up to the Starcruiser (known as the Halcyon), I knew we were in for something unique. Stepping out of the transport and into the Halcyon\u2019s atrium gave me a literal jaw-drop moment as it really did feel like being aboard a starship in a galaxy far, far away.The building was dreamed up by the same creative artists who work on the movies, and it showed. While the broad-brushstrokes are great, the smallest details are there too, right down to the Hyperspace Compass on display that houses the objective of the heist. While the first impressions were great, what continued to impress me during our two days of adventuring were the interactive elements. The wristbands we received on arrival interacted with the computer terminals, so we were able to scramble an astromech droid\u2019s memory and delete the cruiser\u2019s flight log when the mission called for it. Down in the engine room, everything you touch can impact the functioning of the cruiser, so we decoded the puzzles and got things operational.\n\nStepping out of the transport and into the Halcyon\u2019s atrium gave me a literal jaw-drop moment One of the most innovative interactive elements is the droid that\u2019s on call in each bedroom (or cabin) \u2013 through a monitor we had fully-fledged conversations with an animated droid, who even had me negotiate with a pirate who controlled the hyperspace lane the ship was flying through.Although these technical innovations are impressive and add to the sense of immersion, it wouldn\u2019t have worked without the talented and well-trained cast who play the characters that lead the story, from the ship\u2019s blue-skinned Captain Keevan to the Basil Fawlty-esque antagonist Lieutenant Croy. Beyond the cast, the crew staffing the hotel were also fully in character, each with their own backstory \u2013 when our server ended her shift at the Sublight Lounge, she explained that she had to get back to feed her Puffer Pig.While it wasn\u2019t on my mind in the moment, it was very clear why the Galactic Starcruiser was so expensive to book. When Disney World announced that prices would start at $4,800 for the two-night experience, the online reaction was decidedly negative. There\u2019s a strong argument that Disney World shouldn\u2019t even be offering experiences that are so exclusive and elitist.Interiors were designed by the same people who work on the films, and it shows (Graham E. Hancock)But if this sort of thing is going to be done \u2013 and done to this standard \u2013 then there\u2019s no way to get around the fact that it will be expensive to run. At a Secret Cinema event, you have to suspend some disbelief because the edges are visible; you can see where the set has been constructed in a warehouse. On board the Galactic Starcruiser, though, that was entirely unnecessary; you can see the vastness of space through the windows, you can have an interaction with a Rodian musician and you can touch the walls without them wobbling.Ever since the original Disney studio was founded, the company has pushed to tell stories in new and innovative ways. When the theme parks were first built, they seemed like an incredibly risky proposition \u2013 but pushing in an innovative direction led to holiday destinations that families travel around the world for, to experience a truly bucket-list trip.Is any trip that lasts just two days and never sees you interact with the real world \u201cworth the money\u201d? It\u2019s hard to know how to even start measuring that. But, for a fan, getting to experience the seemingly impossible and live through a Star Wars adventure felt very special indeed. Now that the attraction-crossed-with-a-hotel is closing down permanently, to become a strange quirk of Disney World and Star Wars history, those memories will be even more treasured.Read more of our best USA hotel reviews"}, {"_id": "648b23df51ac33150be92a17", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/england/yorkshire/best-spa-hotels-yorkshire-b2356521.html", "primaryCategory": "Yorkshire", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Best spa hotels in Yorkshire for a relaxing 2023 escape", "lead": "<p>From five-star luxury estates to idyllic rural hideaways, here are the best places to relax and recharge </p>", "author": "Jenny Elliott", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 09:56:31 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:47.087257", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T09:56:31+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/11/243683632_4282764988468702_3467486921854580932_n%20%281%29.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Or, on sunny days, plunge into the wild swimming lake.Best spa hotel for shopping: The GrandLocation: YorkThe Grand\u2019s treatment menu includes cutting-edge cryogenic face masks (The Grand Hotel, York)The Grand pulls off the neat trick of combining five-star glamour with easygoing charm.

Treatments include cutting-edge cryogenic face masks and detoxifying mud wraps.You\u2019re handy here for the station and York\u2019s timeworn centre, where you\u2019ll discover a hurly-burly mix of big brands, indie boutiques, antique stores and open-air markets clustered within medieval city walls. Return for afternoon tea on the terrace.Best five-star luxury spa hotel: Grantley HallLocation: Yorkshire Dales, near RiponGrantley Hall was named the AA\u2019s 2022 English Hotel of the Year (Grantley Hall)It seems fitting that Grantley Hall\u2019s Three Graces Spa was named after Canova\u2019s tribute to Zeus\u2019s daughters (those bestowers of elegance, mirth and beauty). After all, this marble-clad sanctuary \u2013 concealed within the AA\u2019s 2022 English Hotel of the Year \u2013 has plenty to make you feel at your most poised, carefree and radiant, including a collonaded swimming pool, indoor-to-outdoor hydrotherapy pool and sauna and snow rooms.Not that the five-star pleasures stop there.

Come evening, book a table at the 3 AA Rosette Burlington Restaurant to sample the innovative modern British menu alongside local foodies.Best market-town spa hotel: Feversham Arms Hotel & Verbena SpaLocation: HelmsleyThe outdoor pool at The Feversham arms is heated and there\u2019s a hot tub nearby, too  (Feversham Hotel)Situated in the North York Moors National Park, Helmsley has everything you\u2019d want from a town: interesting indie shops and top-notch restaurants cluster around its handsome market square.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBrexit has resulted in a sharp drop in the number of UK workers in EU holiday jobs, new figures show.Only 3,700 people from the UK are being employed in the bloc to do roles such as chalet hosts, holiday reps and tour guides, travel trade organisations said, which is a 69 per cent drop from the 11,970 workers seen in 2017.Employing UK staff in popular EU destinations such as Spain, France, Greece, Italy and Austria has traditionally been a vital part of UK holiday companies\u2019 overseas operations.Complex paperwork, extra costs and a lack of agreements is impeding the process, according to Abta and Seasonal Businesses in Travel (SBit), which released the employment figures. Prior to the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, UK workers were entitled to live and work in the rest of the EU with no restrictions.Abta and SBit said since the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc, it costs travel companies an additional \u00a3880 to recruit each UK worker in France, while many other member states have no viable entry routes for UK staff.RecommendedSunak rules out any new EU trade deal that undermines Brexit freedomsTory MP broke rules over \u00a3150,000 loan from Russian businessmanWhat is the future of the Conservative Party?A survey of 127 UK travel businesses who sell holidays in the EU indicated that 61 per cent believe the issue could reduce their growth over the next five years, and is their biggest concern.Abta and SBit called on the UK and EU governments to extend the Youth Mobility Scheme to EU countries, which would allow young people to work in the UK and EU for up to two years, with no automatic longer-term right to remain.The UK has similar existing arrangements with countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand.The travel trade also called for an enhanced UK-EU seasonal mobility agreement for tourism workers, as current arrangements only apply to certain roles and limit stays to 90 days.Speaking at Abta\u2019s Travel Matters summit in Westminster, the body\u2019s chief executive Mark Tanzer said: \u201cIt can\u2019t be emphasised enough just how fundamental being able to work abroad is for the UK travel industry. Not only do people gain those important language and soft skills, they\u2019re also set on a path for a good career and many become leaders in the industry.\u201cWith the UK outbound travel industry contributing \u00a349 billion a year to the UK economy, and a major driver of growth, not putting in the right mobility arrangements with the EU could come at a cost to UK plc. Yet there are simple and sensible solutions to overcome these barriers, and I\u2019d urge ministers to make this a priority and take action urgently.\u201dSBit managing director Charles Owen said: \u201cIt\u2019s proving tremendously difficult to employ the UK staff we need to run our businesses in the EU. In some countries it\u2019s a mountain of complex paperwork, delays and extra costs that need to be overcome, in others there isn\u2019t really a workable route.RecommendedCruises pumped out more emissions than 1 billion cars last yearPlus-size travel blogger shares how she secures two seats on \u2018almost every\u2019 flightRyanair chief pilot sacked for \u2018unacceptable behaviour\u2019 towards female pilots\u201cAs an industry we rely on UK staff being able to work in the EU to help our businesses grow and thrive.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCruise ships were responsible for more than four times the sulphuric emissions into Europe\u2019s atmosphere than all of the continent\u2019s car last year, according to a new report.This comes despite repeated pledges by the industry to move towards a greener model of operating.Research from Transport & Environment, who describe themselves as a \u201cclean transport campaign group\u201d, shows 509 tonnes of sulphur oxides were emitted by the 218 cruise vessels sailing in Europe last year. This is up from pre-pandemic levels of 465 tonnes.Although a cap on sulphur in marine fuels, introduced by the UN in 2020, has cut emissions per tonnes of fuel consumed, the addition of new ships to existing fleets means that overall emissions have increased \u2013 although passenger levels are not yet at pre-pandemic in Europe.Barcelona was Europe\u2019s most polluted port last year followed by Civitavecchia, a coastal port northwest of Rome and the Athenian port of Piraeus.RecommendedHurtigruten unveils its first zero-emissions ship\u2018Disgusted\u2019: Passengers left sleeping on airport floor after diverted Ryanair flightBrexit is blocking UK workers from seasonal roles, say travel firmsIn better news, Venice \u2013 the most cruise-polluted port in 2019 \u2013 dropped to 41st in the list last year following a ban on large cruise ships entering the port that was introduced in 2021, leading to an 80 per cent fall in sulphur oxide emissions.In the UK, Southampton ranked as Europe\u2019s seventh most-polluted port in terms of cruise ship air pollution, with just 45 ships responsible for almost 10 times more harmful pollutants than all of the city\u2019s 93,000 cars.Constance Dijkstra, shipping campaigner at Transport & Environment, said: \u201cThe pandemic provided some respite for port cities, but this is now well and truly over. Cruising is back and tourist hotspots like Barcelona and Athens are again choking on toxic air pollution from cruise ships.\u201cVenice has shown that tackling cruise ship pollution is possible, but bans aren\u2019t the only way. Ports can significantly reduce pollution levels by forcing ships to plug into electricity at the port instead of running their engines, and by supporting the adoption of zero-emission fuels.\u201dJon Hood, Transport & Environment\u2019s UK sustainable shipping manager, said: \u201cWith the government currently revising its flagship green shipping plan we have the perfect opportunity to finally get serious about addressing shipping pollution.\u201cThat means switching away from filthy fossil fuels and onto clean, zero emission fuels like green hydrogen, and setting binding targets for UK ports to support zero-emission technologies.\u201dThe predominant sulphur oxide found in the lower atmosphere is sulphur dioxide, which is a corrosive, acidic gas. According to the UK government, direct exposure to SO2 is associated with asthma and chronic bronchitis and can lead to irritation and constriction of the airways, and can also form acid rain.Along with Venice, which has long been at the centre of the anti-cruise movement, other European port cities have also placed restrictions on larger vessels, including Santorini, Palma de Mallorca and Dubrovnik. The mayor of Barcelona has previously called on the regional government to curb the number of ships allowed in the city\u2019s port.Andy Harmer, managing director Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) UK & Ireland, told The Independent that the cruise industry is \u201cstrongly committed to continually improving its sustainability efforts, and cruise lines are making significant investments to develop new environmental technologies, sustainable marine fuels and to equip cruise ships to connect to shoreside electricity, removing emissions while at berth.\u201dRecommended\u2018Disgusted\u2019: Passengers left sleeping on airport floor after diverted Ryanair flightBrexit is blocking UK workers from seasonal roles, say travel firmsPlus-size travel blogger shares how she secures two seats on \u2018almost every\u2019 flight\u201cThe global cruise fleet, which totals around 300 ships, is one of the most technologically advanced and energy efficient in history. The ships launching this year are indicative of the advancements cruise is making in moving away from a single-fuel industry towards multiple-fuel capabilities. \u00a0As part of this transformation, cruise lines are pursuing a variety of new and more sustainable alternative energy sources, including preparing their ships for electric batteries, advanced biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, and synthetic fuels.\u201cToday, already more than 80 ships in the CLIA-member cruise line fleet, representing 40 per cent of global capacity, are equipped with onshore power connections and another 83 ships are planned for retrofits. It is anticipated that around 85 per cent of cruise ships coming online between now and 2028 will be equipped with the ability to connect to shoreside electricity.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23df51ac33150be92a1b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/plus-size-blogger-empty-seat-flight-b2357977.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Plus-size travel blogger shares how she secures two seats for the price of one on \u2018almost every\u2019 flight", "lead": "<p>\u2018You deserve to be comfortable too\u2019 </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 06:52:50 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:47.761680", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T06:52:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/21/plus%20size%20travel%20seat.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNorthern Ireland may be more closely associated with charming cities \u2013 such as Belfast or Derry \u2013 and natural wonders like the Causeway Coast, but the country also has dozens of pristine, serene beaches to discover.From well-known seaside resorts to secluded stretches of golden sand, Northern Ireland offers some of the best beaches in the UK to those who want to explore its coast.With flights from major UK cities \u2013 including London, Manchester and Glasgow \u2013 and ferries from Liverpool and Cairnryan, getting to the Northern Irish capital has never been easier. From there, the coastal counties of Derry, Antrim and County Down are just a matter of minutes away.As the temperature rises this summer, there\u2019s never been a better time to explore some of the country\u2019s beaches. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the best to help you plan a holiday by the Irish Sea.Tyrella Beach, County DownRecommendedBest budget hotels in Belfast 2023: Where to stay for style and affordabilityThinking of visiting Northern Ireland? These are the 7 best hotels in BelfastNorthern Ireland celebrates bumper year for barn owls in 2022Tyrella Beach at sunset, with the Mourne Mountains in the background (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Located in Downpatrick in the south the country, Tyrella Beach sits in Dundrum Bay, a small enclosed area of beach backed by dunes and overlooked by the Mourne Mountains and the St John\u2019s Point lighthouse on either side. The mile-long stretch is one of the area\u2019s Blue Flag beaches \u2013 awarded due to general cleanliness and high water quality \u2013 and lies in a conservation area that\u2019s perfect for peaceful walks, water sports or simply admiring the flora and fauna. Nearby, Downpatrick is reputedly home to the final burial place of St Patrick himself. The town will provide basic amenities (the beach itself only has toilets and nearby parking), but also has a cathedral, church and abbey, as well as the Down County Museum and Saint Patrick Centre for those who might want to learn a little more about the area.Benone Beach, County Derry Benone Beach is overlooked by Mussenden Temple (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The longest beach in Northern Ireland, Benone is a seven-mile stretch of sand that reaches from the end of Portstewart Strand to Magilligan Point, with fantastic views over Donegal. Another Blue Flag beach, its golden sands are surrounded by high cliffs and dunes, making the area another particularly scenic area of the coast. It is also an inclusive beach, offering free beach equipment loan schemes that include all-terrain wheelchairs (other facilities include an RNLI Lifeguard Service in July and August, specific zones for activities and food and drink options).Limavady is the nearest town, roughly 15 minutes away by car (though there are smaller villages closer to Benone). While there isn\u2019t a large variety of things to do here, you\u2019ll find several cafes and pubs to help keep everyone fed and watered after a beach visit.

This beach is popular with surfers and other water sports enthusiasts all year round (with board hire available in summer), but is arguably most well-known for its unique natural setting. This section of the coast is backed by lush greenery and vast limestone cliffs that have been eroded to create magnificent rock formations, including Elephant Rock and Lion\u2019s Paw. While there are toilets and a cafe on the beach, the town of Portrush itself is worthy of a visit as a great Northern Irish seaside resort. In addition to several other beaches, the town has an impressive range of things to do, from small theme parks to walks along sections of the Causeway Coast Way. Helen\u2019s Bay, County DownAn aerial photo of the beach at Helen\u2019s Bay (Getty Images)Helen\u2019s Bay itself is a village near Bangor, with a beach, local golf course and the Crawfordsburn County Park (home to woodland areas, fields and footpaths). On the beach, calm and clean waters meet gently sloping sands to provide good, safe swimming opportunities, making it a popular place for swimming clubs and families. The village itself is small, but is only four miles from Bangor, the newest city in Ireland. While it only received its status last December (as part of the late Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Platinum Jubilee civic awards), Bangor has long been a popular seaside resort, with its castle and marina among the main attractions. Ballycastle Beach, County Antrim Part of the coast near Ballycastle  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Ballycastle is another beach in the north, not far from Portrush and Portstewart. Regarded as a good place for swimming and surfing, it runs from the marina to Pans Rocks, a popular fishing spot around one mile away. Quieter and more accessible than some of the other beaches on this list, it also possesses amazing views out to sea and of Rathlin Island (which can be reached via regular 30-minute ferry journeys).The town sits east of Portrush, close to the Giant\u2019s Causeway, one of the country\u2019s most-visited sites. While seeing the Causeway is definitely a recommended trip, Ballycastle is also close to Downpatrick Head (a scenic geological site on the Wild Atlantic Way) and part of the Nine Glens of Antrim (a series of valleys). Its charming marina area is an option for relaxing by the water in town. Whitepark Bay, County Antrim Whitepark Bay is another gem along the Causeway Coast  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Found in a secluded spot along the Causeway Coast, Whitepark Bay (sometimes written as White Park Bay) is even closer to the Giant\u2019s Causeway than Ballycastle, but offers a welcome retreat from seaside resort towns and swarms of people. Flanked by both steadily rising hills and limestone cliffs \u2013 and backed by dozens of ancient dunes \u2013 its sweeping white sands stretch for over a mile between Portbradden and Ballintoy, two small fishing villages. Its seclusion means that there are no real facilities, but the payoff is an abundance of peace and tranquility (but beware of swimming due to rip currents). Both nearby villages are tiny (Bllintoy had a population of 150 people in the 2011 census)\u00a0but offer spectacular views that would normally be reserved for Caribbean or Mediterranean destinations \u2013 Ballintoy\u2019s harbour was even used as a filming location for Game of Thrones\u2019 Lordsport. Murlough Beach, County DownMurlough Beach sits at the foot of the Mourne Mountains  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The area around this beach \u2013 now named the Murlough Nature Reserve \u2013 became Northern Ireland\u2019s first nature reserve in 1967. It is now managed by the National Trust, and today boasts a 6,000-year-old sand dune system and network of paths to add to the four-mile stretch of coastline. Part of the beach is nestled near the foot of the Mourne Mountains, with much of its golden sand overlooked by Slieve Donard, the highest point in Northern Ireland.

In her initial video \u2013 which has more than 13.7m views so far \u2013 Stickler said that a parent grabbed a plate from her daughter, MK, while she was on line for cake at the park. The woman allegedly told the three-year-old that she couldn\u2019t eat the dessert, and that other kids at the party were \u201cnot her friends\u201d.In her most recent clip, Stickler addressed how people had been reaching out to her, before sharing the one thing that she wished she did differently in the situation.\u201cI wanted to take full responsibility for the fact that I should have gotten to MK faster,\u201d she said, referring to when her daughter was waiting to get cake at the party. \u201cThat\u2019s my one regret. That I did not get to her before she could grab the plate.\u201dStickler noted that her issue was \u201cnot with this person\u201d who didn\u2019t let \u201c[her] kid have cake\u201d.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBrooklyn Beckham has come under scrutiny with his latest cooking video, which sees the aspiring home chef fry chicken using \u201cat least $25 worth of avocado oil\u201d.On Tuesday, Beckham, 24, the eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham, shared his newest recipe video, which was created in partnership with Chosen Foods\u2019 avocado oil, to Instagram. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make some fried chicken with Chosen Foods,\u201d Beckham tells viewers at the start of the video while holding a bottle of the brand\u2019s avocado oil, which retails from $15 to $25.99 per bottle.In the caption of the video, where Beckham confirmed the recipe is a sponsored ad for the brand, he wrote: \u201cFried chicken with @chosenfoods. 100 per cent Pure Avocado Oil and their Classic Avocado Oil Mayo are the best. I love Chosen Foods for frying because of its high smoke point and neutral flavour. #chosenpartner.\u201dIn the step-by-step recipe clip, Beckham filmed himself pouring milk, various seasonings and flour into a glass dish before whisking the concoction. He then proceeded to soak two chicken breasts in the mixture, before making a dry flour and seasoning mixture in a different glass bowl.The 24-year-old could then be seen pouring a liberal amount of oil into a shallow pan, with Beckham ensuring the pan was filled with several inches of the avocado oil before frying the two chicken breasts and eating them with a thumbs up.RecommendedBrooklyn Beckham roasted for grilling cheese toastie with blow torch: \u2018And a tiny bit of salt\u2019Brooklyn Beckham mocked after fans spot bizarre cooking technique: \u2018Cork in your pot & dog hair about to join\u2019Italian chef reacts to Brooklyn Beckham\u2019s wine cork in pasta sauce \u2018hack\u2019Beckham\u2019s video has divided viewers, however, due to the amount of oil used by the former photographer to fry his chicken breasts.\u201cThat\u2019s at least $25 worth of avocado oil,\u201d one viewer suggested in the comments, while another speculated the amount was worth closer to \u201c$48 of avocado oil\u201d.Someone else wrote: \u201cWhy on earth are you deep frying in oil that costs \u00a315/$20 per bottle? I realise this is a paid promo but do something a bit more logical like make a mayo from scratch with it, rather than dump that much into a pan to fry some chicken! #cozzielivs Brookie babes x.\u201dAccording to another person, although avocado oil is \u201cgreat for frying\u201d because it has the highest smoke point of any oil, \u201cnormal people\u201d use the \u201cmost affordable avocado oil\u201d and \u201creuse it\u201d.\u201cFried foods require sooo much oil, so for normal people, we have to use the most affordable avocado oil AND you can strain it and REUSE it, so if you find a $10 bottle and you use it two times, then at least it\u2019s about $5 per use,\u201d they wrote.\u201cMaking the simplest food with the most expensive ingredients,\u201d someone else commented.Others called out the food \u201cwaste\u201d in Beckham\u2019s cooking video, with one person writing: \u201cA whole bottle of oil for fried chicken breast? What a waste,\u201d while another said: \u201cThere are people dying in the world from starvation - you used enough oil and milk for about 20 people. But you wouldn\u2019t understand that.\u201dAlthough many viewers were critical of Beckham\u2019s latest recipe, some defended the former model from backlash on the basis that he likely received the oil for free as part of his partnership with the brand.\u201cIf he\u2019s been given it or paid for it he can do what he wants with it,\u201d one person commented.Another said: \u201cLove using avocado oil to fry with. Avocado oil fries stuff so evenly and tastes wonderful! Keep doing your thing Brooklyn!

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has been praised for the amusing way she sought \u201crevenge\u201d on her employer after she was laid off.In a viral video posted to TikTok, the former employee \u2013 who goes by Marchie \u2013 revealed that she was laid off from her job in May. Marchie, who has 543,000 followers on TikTok, explained how she was the only member from her team to get laid off, which she said \u201creally super sucked\u201d.But, instead of leaving quietly, she came up with a creative way to show her employer that they couldn\u2019t get rid of her that easily.\u201cTo prove that I will never actually leave, I hid these tiny pictures of myself all over the office with different things in the speech bubble,\u201d she said, laughing. In the clip, Marchie showed a close-up photo of herself printed out alongside a speech bubble, which read \u201cBazinga\u201d inside.When she zoomed out, the whiteboard in Marchie\u2019s former office was covered with nearly 15 tiny photos of herself, all with different quotes displayed. \u201cAnd at 3.30 today on Monday, I\u2019ve been informed that this is what they\u2019ve been doing all day,\u201d Marchie said.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeViewers of HBO\u2019s new drama series The Idol have, perhaps uknowingly, been offered a glimpse inside The Weeknd\u2019s sprawling Bel-Air mansion.The six-episode series began on Sunday 4 June and is airing one episode per week on HBO\u2019s streaming platform Max. It has already proven controversial despite having dropped only two episodes so far, amid accusations of objectification and overtly sexual themes.However, people are still tuning into the show, created by Euphoria\u2019s Sam Levinson, with nearly a million (913k) viewers across HBO and Max for its premiere. The Independent gave it four out of five stars and described it as a \u201csordid drama\u201d that \u201ccomes close to a profound insight into our times\u201d.According to Rolling Stone, budget restrictions led Canadian musician, actor and producer, real name Abel Tesfaye, to open up his nine-bedroom mansion as one of the show\u2019s main locations.Tesfaye, who stars in the series as Tedros alongside Lily-Rose Depp as flailing pop star Jocelyn, purchased the huge property for US$70m in 2021. It was one of the most expensive property sales that took place in LA that year, according to Architectural Digest.RecommendedCraving a \u2018beach-ready body\u2019 is the surest way to self-loathing, but I still want oneDemi Lovato changed pronouns because explaining They/Them to people was \u2018absolutely exhausting\u2019Woman applauded for kicking bridesmaid out of wedding after disagreement over dress colourTesfaye previously owned a 13,391-square-foot estate in the Hidden Hills in California, which he bought for US$18.2m in 2017 and sold to Madonna four years later for US$25m.The Bel-Air mansion covers a whopping 33,000-square-feet and looms over a 1.6-acre lot that overlooks the Bel Air Country Club. It was previously owned by Reinout Oerlemans, a Dutch media mogul whose production company, Eyeworks, operates across Europe, Scandinavia, South America, New Zealand, Australia and the United States.The Weeknd in HBO show \u2018The Idol\u2019 (HBO)After the Oelermans first bought the property in 2015 for US$21.4m, they added 13,000-square feet of space and a number of amenities.The mansion boasts a gym, indoor movie theatre, sauna, Turkish hammam-inspired spa, and an indoor pool, as well as a music studio, which could have clinched it for Tesfaye. It has nine bedrooms and plenty of space for entertaining visitors \u2013 or, to accommodate a film crew.There\u2019s an outdoor bar and a poolside lounge area with a fire pit by the infinity pool with a waterfall. A sports court also sits on the grounds, while a split double staircase leads to a patio on the manicured lawn.Lily-Rose Depp in \u2018The Idol\u2019 (HBO)Surrounding the property are lush greens and trees on all sides, giving it plenty of privacy. There are also no nearby neighbours, given how large the grounds of the mansion are, and a long driveway just to get to the front of the house.Tesfaye\u2019s extreme wealth is a far cry from the days of his youth, when he lived in poverty. He became homeless as a teenager, after dropping out of school.Speaking to Interview magazine this year, he recalled going into video stores in Toronto to look at films he\u2019d never seen but could not afford to buy or rent them.RecommendedSelena Gomez fans disappointed at \u2018overpriced\u2019 Rare Beauty products in IndiaDavid Beckham designs new car collection with MaseratiThe dos and don\u2019ts of looking after your garden in a heatwave\u201cI didn\u2019t have any money.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSo, summer\u2019s here and many gardeners will no doubt be reaching for the watering can, checking the levels of their water butt and wondering if a hosepipe ban is going to spread to their area.There\u2019s already a ban across Cornwall and parts of Devon, so it\u2019s important to know the best ways to garden to save water, and which plants may be susceptible.Experts offer the following dos and don\u2019ts of heatwave gardening.DON\u2019T water during the heat of the day. Early morning when it\u2019s cooler, or evening when the sun has gone down is best, as the plants can hydrate overnight, recommend experts Katie Kingett and Yoko Briggs at The Lost Gardens of Heligan.Rose specialist Philip Harkness, of award-winning Harkness Roses, says watering roses in the early morning, especially if they are in pots, is better, as the plants get the water they need during the day. \u201cIf you water in the evening, there\u2019s more humidity overnight, and that is quite an encouragement for fungi such as blackspot and rust to grow.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveDON\u2019T water the top of the plant. Watering the leaves can burn plants, which need the moisture in their roots. Kingett and Briggs advise: \u201cIf you\u2019re growing cucurbits, or plants in a poly tunnel, dig a small terracotta pot into the ground beside the plant, so water goes straight to the root.\u201dDON\u2019T water plants little and often.\u202fThis will only encourage roots to come to the surface and then be dried out by the sun, advises Kate Turner, Gardening expert for Miracle-Gro.DON\u2019T feed your lawn when it\u2019s already scorched. The ground needs to be moist for any feed to work, so unless you have been irrigating your lawn from the start, wait until the autumn to start TLC (tender lawn care). Lawns will nearly always recover during autumn, so it\u2019s more important to look after your plants during this dry season, she adds.DON\u2019T cut your grass often. Grass won\u2019t grow as much in the heat, so it shouldn\u2019t need to be cut so much. If you do have to mow your lawn, use a higher setting, so you do not damage the plant and its roots, say Kingett and Briggs.DON\u2019T water the whole garden. Established borders shouldn\u2019t need as much watering, because the roots of established plants will go deeper to find moisture.DON\u2019T plant in a heatwave. Now is not the time to plant anything other than small plants in containers. The soil will be hard and the roots won\u2019t reach down into the soil, so they will need constant watering and will be stressed by the heat. Wait until the autumn when the soil is still warm, but when there will be a regular supply of rain, Turner suggests.DON\u2019T water irregularly. \u201cIrregular watering can lead to bitter flavours in fruit and vegetables, and with tomatoes, a condition known as blossom end rot \u2013 where the bottom of the tomato turns black.\u201d says Turner.DO use grey water. If you have a hosepipe ban in your area, you can use \u2018grey water\u2019 such as washing up water, so long as you have used a very small amount of environmental dish cleaner, say Kingett and Briggs.DO protect your plants from the sun in a heatwave. Put them in the shade if the pots are moveable, and in the greenhouse, protect vulnerable plants like seedlings, by either using a lime wash over your greenhouse glass to reflect the heat and light, or by draping a cotton sheet over the windows, Kingett and Briggs suggest. It can also help lettuces and other veg from bolting.\u201cEnsure you let your plants breathe by opening up your greenhouse and relieving them from the extreme temperatures,\u201d Turner adds.DO water generously and\u202f less frequently. This will encourage roots to stay down in the soil, says Turner.DO keep soil or compost evenly moist. Soaking dry soil can result in some crops \u2013 such as tomatoes \u2013 splitting and becoming unusable, she suggests.DO focus on the plants that really need it. Most important are those in containers, so group them together and place them in the shade if you need to. Feed weekly with a liquid feed, while the soil is damp before use, Turner advises.RecommendedWhy are we all sleeping so badly at the moment?11 ways to dip into Mediterranean inspired decorWhiten up your wardrobe with summer\u2019s hottest trendsDO mulch. If you have certain trees or plants with soil you wish to protect, such as fruit trees or fruit bushes, you can weed and water the soil around them and then mulch with a peat-free compost to keep the ground damp and cool. This helps protect the micro-organisms and mycelial network from being damaged, Kingett and Briggs advise.DO continue to weed.

It makes me upset that I might have upset people.\u201dHe said his decision to leave the show in March after seven seasons was instead due to him wanting to spend more time with his son.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Prince and Princess of Wales have paid tribute to the people who perished in the Grenfell Tower fire on the sixth anniversary of the tragedy, in which 72 people died.Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s joint Twitter account shared a green heart emoji on Wednesday (14 June). Following the disaster, which was the deadliest structural fire the UK had seen since 1988, the green heart came to be used as a message of love and solidarity for both victims and survivors.Prince William met with Grenfell survivors and bereaved families last month at the Queens Park Rangers football club, where he was told about how the organisation has provided support since the tragedy took place in June 2017.One survivor, Paul Menacer, who created the Grenfell Memorial Cup two years ago, said William was \u201cvery adamant and very passionate about us as bereaved survivors getting justice\u201d.\u201cThe fact that someone in his position that is still wanting the justice and fight for us, and he made that perfectly clear to us as well that he hoped we can all get our own closures in our own sort of similar ways,\u201d he said.RecommendedCraving a \u2018beach-ready body\u2019 is the surest way to self-loathing, but I still want oneVictorian \u2018hack\u2019 gives you free air conditioning with the right windowsDemi Lovato changed pronouns because explaining They/Them to people was \u2018absolutely exhausting\u2019Last year, William and Kate attended a Grenfell Tower memorial service and observed 72 seconds of silence at the base of the tower in north Kensington.They also laid a wreath in tribute and listened to speeches from the bereaved, some of whom called for arrests of those responsible for the tragedy.The Grenfell Tower fire is close to the royal family\u2019s hearts. Shortly after it occurred, the late Queen Elizabeth II and William visited survivors, volunteers and emergency service personnel at a makeshift relief centre that was set up near the burned out building.At the time, the Queen paid tribute to the \u201cbravery\u201d of firefighters and the \u201cincredible generosity\u201d of the volunteers who were providing relief.But six years on since the devastating fire, a leading campaigner has said that the lack of change is causing anger within the community.Former Grenfell resident Edward Daffarn told the PA news agency that he had been \u201cpretty convinced that Grenfell would become the catalyst for societal change\u201d after the fire took place.But instead, he said the lack of criminal justice in relation to the incident was \u201cabusive\u201d.The Duke of Cambridge meets firefighters in west London after the Grenfell tragedy in 2017  (Getty)\u201cTo date, there hasn\u2019t been a single arrest. Not a single clink of handcuffs for any of the perpetrators of the fire,\u201d Daffarn said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but, you know, justice delayed is justice denied.

Animals and plants are affected too \u2013 think bird migration, bears hibernating, spring flowers and autumn leaves. We are naturally diurnal, so should be sleeping at night when it is dark. Light acts on our circadian clock to stimulate wakefulness.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveDiffering lifestylesOur lifestyles also change in the summer.\u201cMany of us are more physically active in summer than winter, and usually spend more time outdoors exposed to bright light during the day,\u201d Roden explains.\u201cThat combination of physical activity during the day, and daytime bright light exposure, gives our circadian clock strong synchronising cues and reinforces our diurnal behavioural rhythms. This means that even though we have shorter nights, we are stimulating the feelings of sleepiness at night and wakefulness during the day. Engaging in physical activity during the day usually promotes better sleep \u2013 but we must be mindful of not exercising too late at night, as this can have the opposite effect,\u201d she says.The MoonYou may have thought the moon\u2019s impact on our bodies is a myth, but Roden says that there is research that backs up these theories.\u201cSome studies have found that this can affect both sleep timing and duration. Women who menstruate may notice that the phase of the moon interrupts their sleep more than biological males. Charlotte F\u00f6rster from the University of W\u00fcrzburg carried out a truly remarkable study in terms of data collection and analyses, that showed that women\u2019s menstrual cycles were recurrently synchronous with the moon\u2019s phase, and affected by brightness and gravitational pull.\u201cAs body core temperature is affected during menstruation, this would mean that at certain phases of the moon, it can be harder to fall asleep than others, and sleep duration may thus be affected,\u201d Roden says.Sleep hygieneBrighter mornings and lighter evenings may be making your room too light or hot.\u201cKeeping the bedroom slightly cooler than the rest of the house is ideal, but not always achievable. Cooler rooms promote sleep. Using curtains or blinds and sleep masks can help to keep bedrooms dark. But using electronic devices \u2013 such as mobile phones \u2013 that emit bright light, can cause a suppression of melatonin that we need, to indicate \u2018night\u2019 to the circadian clock,\u201d Roden explains.Drinking moreRecommended11 ways to dip into Mediterranean inspired decorWhiten up your wardrobe with summer\u2019s hottest trendsPaternity leave should be paid for six weeks, campaigners tell GovernmentWe all tend to take on more liquids when it\u2019s hot. And you may find yourself drinking more when socialising in the sun, too. But, Roden suggests avoiding alcohol before bed. According to the Sleep Foundation, it\u2019s best to leave at least four hours between stopping drinking alcohol and going to bed.It\u2019s also a good idea to avoid drinking anything around two hours before sleep, and Roden recommends avoiding caffeine after midday, so you might want to skip those mid-afternoon iced lattes."}, {"_id": "648b23e851ac33150be92a42", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/vegan-family-neighbour-letter-cooking-meat-b2357069.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vegan family writes letter to neighbours requesting they close their windows when cooking meat", "lead": "<p>\u2018Stop pushing your food views on others,\u2019 read one response </p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:19:38 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:56.626568", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T07:19:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/21/vegan%20letter%20neighbour.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFor a decade, Baohaus was one of the best-known restaurants for Taiwanese fare in New York City. According to Eater, the restaurant \u201chelped lay the cultural and culinary groundwork for an ambitious class of modern Taiwanese spots\u201d in the city. It also catapulted founder Eddie Huang to fame as his culinary expertise was thrusted into the spotlight with shows on the Cooking Channel (Cheap Bites), Viceland (Huang\u2019s World) and MTV (Snack Off).He first opened Baohaus on the Lower East Side of Lower Manhatten in 2009, before relocating it to a bigger venue in the East Village. During the 10 years he ran Baohaus, Huang also wrote his memoir Fresh Off The Boat, which led to the TV series of the same name, starring Randall Park and Constance Wu. But in 2020, around seven months into the coronavirus pandemic, Huang announced that Baohaus would be no more.At the time, he wrote in an Instagram post: \u201cI opened this restaurant to tell my family\u2019s story through food at a time when no one was giving Asian Americans a chance in TV, film, books or media generally.\u201d Since then, however, things have changed drastically for the diaspora; this year, the celebrated Asian-led cast of Everything Everywhere All At Once clinched seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Michelle Yeoh) and Best Director (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Sheinert).Now, Huang is casting his eye back to Baohaus, but this time he\u2019s bringing it across the pond and into London. His three-month residency at Neighbourhood in Islington \u2013 which previously held \u201cramen junkie\u201d Ivan Orkin\u2019s Ivan Mazemen residency \u2013 will dominate this summer with his signature Taiwanese baos, fried chicken and noodle dishes, bringing a bowl of the Big Apple to the Great Smog.I sat down with Huang over a steaming, fragrant bowl of Taiwanese mince pork stew and rice to talk about what Baohaus\u2019 legacy in New York was, its future in London, and what it means to have a vision.Recommended\u2018Ramen junkie\u2019 Ivan Orkin on mazemen, MSG and the resilience of the human spiritHow did it feel when you closed Baohaus in NYC?I always loved having Baohaus. I never intended to close it, but the pandemic hit and I went to Taiwan to be safe, but our landlord kept on charging rent in New York. I just didn\u2019t see an end to it. I\u2019ve been wanting to reopen for a while but when I got home, I had to immediately get to work promoting Boogie.It was kind of bittersweet, but I try to think about everything from a more existential perspective. To have owned a restaurant for 10 years in New York while writing a memoir and doing all these shows, and then directing my first film\u2026 I just felt an immense sense of accomplishment and I felt like it was really a part of the fabric of downtown New York. So many people had come through those walls and it meant so much to me, so I was just really proud even though it was closing. It forced me to look back on everything and I had a sense of gratitude and pride, and I wasn\u2019t angry at all. I think I was sad that it was closing, but thankful to the universe for the time that I did get.Baohaus left a legacy for Taiwanese food in New York that spread across the rest of the Western world. How does it make you feel?Even when I go back to Taiwan, people will say, \u2018Yo, that\u2019s the pork bun kid\u2019. That\u2019s my name back home. I\u2019m very, very grateful that I made a lot of people happy and Taiwanese people were proud of it, and that New Yorkers were proud of it and loved it.The Baohaus buns available at Neighbourhood, Islington  (Supplied)But now, starting it back up in London is just par for the course for me. I\u2019ve never lived in one place. Born in DC, grew up in Orlando, made New York my home. I would say I identified with New York more than anywhere else. I got dragged to LA for my work and then now I got dragged out to London to open Baohaus, so this [Neighbourhood] is now the new home base for the next three months. But the idea is to then start to look at brick and mortar spaces in London and hopefully make it more permanent.What makes Bao Haus stand out? There\u2019s a lot of Taiwanese cooking in London now.What really defines my cooking is there is a straight line between my grandma, my mother, and myself. There are very, very small things I do to adapt it up for my taste or modern tastes, but it\u2019s not adding trendy ingredients or smashing things together. For example, this mince pork stew is how my grandma and my mum would make it. The only thing I pay more attention to is knife skills and the exact cut of the pork belly mixed in with the ground meat. It\u2019s the same with the Chairman Bao, it\u2019s exactly like the baos you get in Taiwan except that I red-cook my pork instead of brown braising. So I stay within the Taiwanese pantry, but I really work on the technique.I read that you don\u2019t really like being called a chef. What don\u2019t you like about that chef territory?The thing is, I definitely think cooking is an art, right? Even the guy selling a dollar bowl of rice is just as artistic to me as somebody doing a tasting menu. But I feel like every generation has these chefs whose food always has to be about them. It\u2019s less about culture and community, and more about, \u2018Check out my new idea, my new thing\u2019 and none of it ever has staying power.I get disappointed going to a lot of young chef restaurants because they\u2019re working their s*** out and they want you to pay for their food because they feel they\u2019re being creative. Like, \u2018Because we were being creative, you should f***ing pay us and buy our food\u2019. And I\u2019m like, well, this just doesn\u2019t taste f***ing good. If you\u2019re going to charge people this, s*** should be good.There\u2019s a lot of ego. A lot of people didn\u2019t set out to be chefs, they say, \u2018I was in fashion or I was in music, or I was a director and I busted out and ended up in food\u2019. People see food as a place they can be all artistic and they think they can creative-direct a restaurant, but this s*** is a lot harder than you think. You can have a cool brand and a great vibe, but to keep people coming back for 10 years, your food\u2019s gotta be really good and be a good deal for your customers. Everything is exciting when it\u2019s new, but does it stand the test of time? Do you keep thinking about it the next day?Are you a perfectionist?Here\u2019s an example: chips. We were known for our taro fries in New York. I did taro fries because you can get French fries anywhere, and they go great with our food, but I wanted to do something different. So I would brine the taro, black it and then double fry it, and they were some of the best fries I\u2019ve ever had and people went nuts for them. But it\u2019s much harder to source taro here in London, because I want the whole fresh taro, not frozen.It was proposed that we do French fries, but they were bringing in frozen ones. But I didn\u2019t want anything like that on our menu that isn\u2019t the best version of it. I guarantee you everything on our menu is the best version you can get here in London. No one\u2019s going to touch my bao.I know there\u2019s another place here, BAO. I\u2019m not even going to eat there. I know mine\u2019s better. I will not try it. I will not. So, back to the fries, I said those fries aren\u2019t going on my menu because they\u2019re not the best fries. So now we\u2019re sourcing all kinds of potatoes.Certain restaurants like St John\u2019s only have chips seasonally when the potato is consistent, and I like that. I like when people are like, when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s good, and I will serve it to you then, and when it\u2019s not good, I\u2019m not going to serve it to you. That philosophy needs to be adopted by more. You don\u2019t have to serve everything, you don\u2019t have to do everything. You don\u2019t have to be the most clever. Just be the best version of you and do what you do best.You know, I got a dozen madeleines from St Johns and I smuggled them all the way back to LA. My wife was like, \u2018Dude, are these going to be good?\u2019 After my flight and then another day in between, I heated them up and they were phenomenal. I gave some to my dogs \u2013 my dogs got to eat St Johns madeleines! They went crazy.You used to host a TV contest show called Snack, where people got random ingredients and had to make something with it. What\u2019s the best thing you made with random ingredients?I invented the Cheeto fried chicken. It happened when I was really high one night. I didn\u2019t have any bread crumbs, so I crushed up Cheetos in a bag, then coated the chicken and fried it. This s*** is crazy. It was a lot of fun but I spent a lot of time on it and then I found the right Cheetos, the right cheese dust, and I think we really perfected the dish. We only offered it once a year on 4/20 at Baohaus, it became a tradition. So if we have a brick and mortar space in London, I would absolutely bring the Cheeto fried chicken bao back only on 4/20.You\u2019ve worn a lot of hats in your lifetime, restaurant owner, chef, author, director, fashion designer.

Who are my friends? How do I dress? How am I curating my life? What starter pack do I fit into? I get it \u2013 I definitely think it\u2019s important to work extremely hard because it\u2019s hard to make money right now. The income inequality gap is insane and my solution to that is to acquire a skill and just refine it. If you have a tangible skill, you\u2019re already ahead of most people in your generation because most people have knowledge and contacts and willingness, but do they have an actual skill?For example, the idea of a creative director is just so funny. What\u2019s the skill? There\u2019s very few creative directors who are skilled and honour the craft, but being a creative director is not just knowing a few really good photographers and good graphic designers and telling them what to do. You\u2019re telling a story, you\u2019re directing the creative. Do you have the vision? It\u2019s not just the mood board, they need to take it seriously."}, {"_id": "648b23ea51ac33150be92a4a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/prince-harry-visa-case-live-b2357471.html", "primaryCategory": "Americas", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Prince Harry news \u2013 live: US accused of \u2018stonewalling\u2019 after denying release of Duke of Sussex visa records", "lead": "<p>Rightwing Heritage Foundation sues for immigration records as it seeks to use Prince Harry to brand Biden administration a failure on immigration </p>", "author": "Gustaf Kilander", "datePublished": "Thu, 15 Jun 2023 05:18:12 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:44:58.259283", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T05:18:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/08/18/SEI159298664.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseRelated video: US government to appear in court over Prince Harry\u2019s visa after drug use admissions Sign up to our Evening Headlines email for your daily guide to the latest newsSign up to our free US Evening Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

That response, rejecting the request, came on Tuesday and was first reported the following day, 14 June.Representing the US government, assistant US attorney John Bardo argued in court on 6 June that sufficient coverage from mainstream American media was required for a request to be expedited.Mr Dewey countered that DHS regulations simply say \u201cmedia\u201d without specifying where the outlets are based, pointing out that news websites have a global audience online these days, no matter where their parent company might be situated.\u201cYou can\u2019t define mainstream,\u201d he told The Independent on 6 June. \u201cThat\u2019s almost absurd in this context.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBrooklyn Beckham has come under scrutiny with his latest cooking video, which sees the aspiring home chef fry chicken using \u201cat least $25 worth of avocado oil\u201d.On Tuesday, Beckham, 24, the eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham, shared his newest recipe video, which was created in partnership with Chosen Foods\u2019 avocado oil, to Instagram. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make some fried chicken with Chosen Foods,\u201d Beckham tells viewers at the start of the video while holding a bottle of the brand\u2019s avocado oil, which retails from $15 to $25.99 per bottle.In the caption of the video, where Beckham confirmed the recipe is a sponsored ad for the brand, he wrote: \u201cFried chicken with @chosenfoods. 100 per cent Pure Avocado Oil and their Classic Avocado Oil Mayo are the best. I love Chosen Foods for frying because of its high smoke point and neutral flavour. #chosenpartner.\u201dIn the step-by-step recipe clip, Beckham filmed himself pouring milk, various seasonings and flour into a glass dish before whisking the concoction. He then proceeded to soak two chicken breasts in the mixture, before making a dry flour and seasoning mixture in a different glass bowl.The 24-year-old could then be seen pouring a liberal amount of oil into a shallow pan, with Beckham ensuring the pan was filled with several inches of the avocado oil before frying the two chicken breasts and eating them with a thumbs up.RecommendedBrooklyn Beckham roasted for grilling cheese toastie with blow torch: \u2018And a tiny bit of salt\u2019Brooklyn Beckham mocked after fans spot bizarre cooking technique: \u2018Cork in your pot & dog hair about to join\u2019Italian chef reacts to Brooklyn Beckham\u2019s wine cork in pasta sauce \u2018hack\u2019Beckham\u2019s video has divided viewers, however, due to the amount of oil used by the former photographer to fry his chicken breasts.\u201cThat\u2019s at least $25 worth of avocado oil,\u201d one viewer suggested in the comments, while another speculated the amount was worth closer to \u201c$48 of avocado oil\u201d.Someone else wrote: \u201cWhy on earth are you deep frying in oil that costs \u00a315/$20 per bottle? I realise this is a paid promo but do something a bit more logical like make a mayo from scratch with it, rather than dump that much into a pan to fry some chicken! #cozzielivs Brookie babes x.\u201dAccording to another person, although avocado oil is \u201cgreat for frying\u201d because it has the highest smoke point of any oil, \u201cnormal people\u201d use the \u201cmost affordable avocado oil\u201d and \u201creuse it\u201d.\u201cFried foods require sooo much oil, so for normal people, we have to use the most affordable avocado oil AND you can strain it and REUSE it, so if you find a $10 bottle and you use it two times, then at least it\u2019s about $5 per use,\u201d they wrote.\u201cMaking the simplest food with the most expensive ingredients,\u201d someone else commented.Others called out the food \u201cwaste\u201d in Beckham\u2019s cooking video, with one person writing: \u201cA whole bottle of oil for fried chicken breast? What a waste,\u201d while another said: \u201cThere are people dying in the world from starvation - you used enough oil and milk for about 20 people. But you wouldn\u2019t understand that.\u201dAlthough many viewers were critical of Beckham\u2019s latest recipe, some defended the former model from backlash on the basis that he likely received the oil for free as part of his partnership with the brand.\u201cIf he\u2019s been given it or paid for it he can do what he wants with it,\u201d one person commented.Another said: \u201cLove using avocado oil to fry with.

However, he said his wife later told him that the party was \u201cfemale-only,\u201d so he had to make adjustments to the guest list.\u201cIn my family, I have attended baby showers for all my female relatives, so it felt like this was a cultural difference,\u201d he explained. \u201cUnfortunately, this meant I had to embarrassingly uninvite people after already sending out invitations.\u201dHe noted that he didn\u2019t \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about the invitations, since it was his wife\u2019s \u201cspecial day\u201d. However, he explained that when he learned that he wasn\u2019t invited to the shower, due to his wife\u2019s \u201cno men rule\u201d, he was \u201cupset\u201d.Recommended54 best baby shower gifts: Top present ideas new mums and dads will loveBest nursery furniture and decor ideas: How to style your baby\u2019s first bedroomThese cheap gazebos will help you get ready for summer garden parties\u201cI thought she was joking, but she was serious, explaining that it\u2019s customary in her family to have a ladies-only baby shower,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt this point, I became upset. In a baby shower that I was paying for and planning, I was being excluded from my own wife\u2019s event in my own home.

It then cuts to a clip of people surrounding Baerten, with more walking towards him, to hug and greet him, as a film crew recorded the scene.RecommendedThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationWoman who went from size 18 to size six shares surprising things \u2018no one tells you\u2019 about weight lossVegan family writes letter to neighbours requesting they close their windows when cooking meatAnother video uploaded by Thomas showed an emotional relative crying as he embraced Baerten.The TikTok user wrote in the caption: \u201cYou got us, I swear I was crying and then I had the shock, buddy we love you very much.\u201dThe staged funeral took place last week near Liege after one of Baerten\u2019s daughters reportedly wrote a \u201ctribute\u201d to her father on social media and said: \u201cRest in peace, Daddy.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA Belgian man has explained why he faked his own death and turned up to his \u201cfuneral\u201d in a helicopter, to the shock of his loved ones.David Baerten, 45, claimed he carried out the elaborate \u201cprank\u201d to teach members of his family a lesson about the importance of staying in touch with one another.Baerten, who posts on TikTok by the name Ragnar le Fou, told French chat show Touche Pas a Mon Poste (TPMP) that he orchestrated the stunt because he felt \u201cunappreciated\u201d by some of his relatives.A video capturing the moment that the 45-year-old man arrived at his own funeral in a helicopter was posted by a TikTok user by the name of Thomas Faut, who apparently attended the ceremony.Footage shows the mourners watching as the helicopter landed in a field and a door opened. It then cuts to a clip of people surrounding Baerten, with more walking towards him, to hug and greet him, as a film crew recorded the scene.RecommendedThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationWoman who went from size 18 to size six shares surprising things \u2018no one tells you\u2019 about weight lossVegan family writes letter to neighbours requesting they close their windows when cooking meatAnother video uploaded by Thomas showed an emotional relative crying as he embraced Baerten.The TikTok user wrote in the caption: \u201cYou got us, I swear I was crying and then I had the shock, buddy we love you very much.\u201dThe staged funeral took place last week near Liege after one of Baerten\u2019s daughters reportedly wrote a \u201ctribute\u201d to her father on social media and said: \u201cRest in peace, Daddy.

As captured in pictures shared by the DailyMail, they set sail on Bezos\u2019 superyacht, Koru, which is reportedly worth $500m.While aboard the large luxury boat, Bezos wore a black shirt and multi-coloured swim trunks, while his partner of five years wore a black bikini, which she paired with matching sunglasses.The Amazon founder, who is worth more than $148bn, also took a moment to be Sanchez\u2019s personal photographer. While leaning on the metal railing of the yacht, the 53-year-old appeared to pose in front of the iPhone her partner was holding.As he faced the camera toward Sanchez and the boat\u2019s deck, the Blue Origin founder could be seen leaning back in an apparent effort to capture his partner\u2019s best angles.RecommendedJeff Bezos mocked for spending $4k on bottle of \u2018engagement wine\u2019 worth just $650Lauren Sanchez seemingly hints at Jeff Bezos engagement after five years of datingLauren Sanchez previously revealed hardest part about being in a relationship with Jeff BezosIn another picture of the couple, shared by the DailyMail, the 59-year-old was captured handing his phone to Sanchez, presumably so she could see how the photo shoot turned out.\u201cHe\u2019s an Instagram boyfriend,\u201d one person tweeted in response to the photos of the couple, while another said: \u201cThis has me giggling because one of the wealthiest men in the world is no different than other dudes when it comes to being forced to take multiple pics of their lady until she\u2019s happy with the angle and lighting lol.\u201dJeff Bezos takes a photo of Lauren Sanchez on his yacht in Portofino, Italy (GC Images/Getty)\u201cI\u2019m putting this on my vision board,\u201d someone else joked of the couple\u2019s behaviour, while another described the moment as \u201crelationship goals\u201d.As noted by The Atlantic, Kaitlyn Tiffany explained on\u00a0the podcast Why\u2019d You Push That Button? that an \u201cInstagram boyfriend, or husband, is a loose term for whoever is the invisible person behind the camera of all of your Instagram photos\u201d.The couple arrived on the yacht in Italy via helicopter, with Sanchez and Bezos landing on Koru\u2019s support vessel, a shadow boat for the super yacht that is reportedly worth more than $75m.The couple were also reportedly joined in Portofino by Sanchez\u2019s three children. The former news anchor shares one son, Nikko, with former NFL star Tony Gonzalez, as well as a son, Evan, and a daughter, Eleanor, with ex-husband Patrick Whitesell.Meanwhile, Bezos shares three sons and one daughter with ex-wife MacKenzie Scott, who he was married to for 25 years. The former couple keeps their children\u2019s lives private, with only the name of their eldest son, Preston, known to the public.  (Getty Images)Last month, it was reported that Bezos and Sanchez had gotten engaged after five years of dating. The rumours of an engagement came amid the couple\u2019s first vacation aboard Bezos\u2019 super yacht. Bezos reportedly popped the question while the couple were in Cannes, France, for the Cannes Film Festival.On 25 May Sanchez seemingly hinted at the engagement on her Instagram Story, where she shared a photo of herself on the trip. In the caption, she wrote:\u00a0 \u201cCannes 2023. That was fun.\u201dDays later, fans were quick to mock Bezos when it was reported that he spent more than $4,000 on a bottle of wine during the weekend of his engagement.According to People, Bezos forked over $4,285 for an off-menu bottle of Dugat-Py Grand Cru from Domaine Bernard, which the couple enjoyed at La Petite Maison in Cannes, France. However, the New York Post reported that the same bottle of wine sold at auction in March 2022 for just $647, which is more than $3,500 less than what Bezos allegedly spent.Five months before her reported engagement, Sanchez opened up the realities of being in a high-profile relationship with Bezos in an interview with WSJ Magazine.According to the reporter, her relationship with the entrepreneur has meant that she has had to change the way she shares information, and secrets.\u201cIt\u2019s hard.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has rejected a request by the conservative Heritage Foundation to expedite a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the think tank for the release of the immigration records of the Duke of Sussex. DHS Senior Director Jimmy Wolfrey wrote in a letter that \u201cTo the extent records exist, this office does not find a public interest in disclosure sufficient to override the subject\u2019s privacy interests,\u201d according to the New York Post. The Heritage Foundation has argued that Prince Harry\u2019s past admissions of drug use, such as in his memoir Spare, make him ineligible for a US visa. DHS notified the think tank on Tuesday, one week after being ordered to respond to the request by DC federal court Judge Carl Nichols. Heritage lawyer Samuel Dewey told the paper that the reply from DHS \u201cshows an appalling lack of transparency by the Biden Administration\u201d. RecommendedPrince Harry news \u2013 live: US government refuses speedy release of Duke of Sussex\u2019s visa records in drug use lawsuitJudge gives Biden administration a week to decide on release of Prince Harry\u2019s visa recordsPrince Harry visa case: Why is a US think-tank seeking the release of the Duke of Sussex\u2019s application form?\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s efforts to stonewall the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Freedom of Information request are unacceptable, and we will be contesting their position,\u201d he added. \u201cWe expected to have to fight every step of this case in federal court and will continue to press for transparency and accountability for the American people.\u201dThe director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Oversight Project, Mike Howell, submitted the request on 8 March, requesting records from DHS, Customs and Border Protection, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management. Ahead of the hearing on 6 June, only DHS had yet to respond. The other three agencies rejected the requests. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction was withdrawn as moot on 14 June following the reply from DHS. \u201cWe can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records relating to your request under Section 3, pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). Exemption (b)(6) exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d DHS wrote, according to Inner City Press. \u201cThe privacy interests of the individual in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information. Exemption (b)(7)(C) excludes records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such materials could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d the agency added. \u201cTo the extent records exist, this office does not find a public interest in disclosure sufficient to override the subject\u2019s privacy interests.\u201dJudge Nichols is now set to decide how to proceed with the case.At the hearing last week, the department argued that an injunction to force DHS to expedite the request shouldn\u2019t go ahead as the foundation hasn\u2019t shown how they will suffer irreparable harm if the information isn\u2019t shared.Representing the government, Assistant US Attorney John Bardo argued on 6 June that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference when the request was handled, even if the response came a year from now.The Heritage Foundation said the interest in Prince Harry\u2019s immigration status would decrease over time.Large parts of the hearing centred on the amount of media attention on Prince Harry and his supposed drug use, which some legal experts say would have barred him from entering the US.The Heritage Foundation has suggested that the federal government may have been engaging in favouritism and may have turned a blind eye to actions, which may have caused the authorities to reject the visa application. The foundation also argued that the public should be allowed to see Prince Harry\u2019s immigration records to see if he may have provided untruthful answers.Mr Bardo argued that sufficient coverage from mainstream US media was required for a request to be expedited. He mentioned outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the TV networks.Heritage lawyer Samuel Dewey meanwhile argued in front of Judge Carl Nichols that DHS regulations simply say \u201cmedia\u201d without specifying where the outlets are based.Mr Dewey told The Independent after the hearing that \u201cyou can\u2019t define mainstream. That\u2019s almost absurd in this context. So as a policy matter, that is a very alarming statement for the press and for transparency for the administration\u201d.Nile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the foundation, added: \u201cI do find it astonishing that the British press is referenced as obscure.\u201d\u201cThese are big publications with a wide global reach including millions of Americans who read these newspapers and I find it absolutely astonishing this description today [that there\u2019s] some media that actually count and matter and others that do not. That is an extraordinary statement to make and absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he added.Mr Dewey argued in court that today\u2019s media is global, noting that The Daily Mail had 100 million page views in the US in the month of April.DHS said in previous legal filings that the US Customs and Border Protection denied the requests because Prince Harry hasn\u2019t consented to the release of the files, with Mr Bardo saying in court that an individual\u2019s visa is \u201cconfidential\u201d.Speaking to reporters outside the DC federal courthouse on 6 June, Mr Dewey said that Prince Harry had foregone his right to privacy after his series of highly publicised interviews and Netflix documentary series.RecommendedRoyal family members wish Prince Harry a happy 37th birthdayPrince Harry is second least popular royal behind Andrew, poll showsPrince Harry and Jill Biden celebrate veterans at Warrior Games eventMr Dewey argued in court that the case is part of a larger probe into the conduct of the federal government, specifically into DHS supposedly not following the law in other areas of its responsibilities, such as not protecting the US border with Mexico.\u201cWhat are we asking for here?\u201d Mr Dewey told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cWe are only asking for the records that are related to this question that has been raised about the drug use and admission ... he\u2019s talked about it, he\u2019s written about it extensively, he has waived any privacy interest he has in his drug use, he has bragged about it in Spare and sold that.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648b23ed51ac33150be92a5c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/us-open-playboy-mansion-zoo-noises-b2357573.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Why golfers may be distracted by animal noises coming from Playboy Mansion during US Open", "lead": "<p> The Los Angeles Country Club will be hosting this year\u2019s event </p>", "author": "Amber Raiken", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 19:46:11 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:45:01.852213", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T19:46:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/17/GettyImages-1498452132.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Due to where LACC is located, players at the event are only a short distance away from Hugh Hefner\u2019s infamous Playboy Mansion.In fact, once golfers hit the 14th hole of the course, that\u2019s when they\u2019ll come across the house. And while they may not be able to see the insides of the mansion, they are expected to hear some noise from the home\u2019s zoo.On 12 June, professional golfer Smylie Kaufman took to Twitter to show players what they could expect.As heard in the background of his clip, there are a variety of animal noises, which appear to be coming from monkeys, peacocks, and other types of birds.RecommendedUS Open 2023 live stream: How to watch golf major online and on TVScottie Scheffler considers putter change to solve problems ahead of US OpenPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan \u2018recuperating\u2019 from medical situationHe poked fun at the sounds in the caption, writing: \u201cPlenty of monkey business happening to the right of 14 tee.\u201dIn the comments of the post, Twitter users went on to poke fun at the noises they heard in the video.\u201cThat bird is laughing at you!\u201d one joked, while another asked: \u201cTell us why there are monkeys there\u2026\u201dA third quipped: \u201cWe hear you, loud and clear!\u201dKaufman later posted a follow-up video of the many monkeys he saw at the Playboy Mansion\u2019s zoo back in 2016. \u201cIt seems way more overgrown now and [I] have no idea if they are still back there,\u201d he wrote in the caption.In 2016, Daren Metropoulos, principal at investment firm Metropoulos & Co. and co-owner of Hostess Brands, bought the Holmby Hills, California, estate for more than $100 million. Hefner still continued to live in the home, up until his death in July 2017. In 2009,\u00a0 Metropoulos, the son of private equity investor Dean Metropoulos, also bought the property that was next door to the mansion for $18 million.The Playboy Mansion, which has 29 rooms, is also one of the few private residences in Los Angeles with a zoo licence.When asked what he was going to be doing with this zoo, after Hefner\u2019s death in 2017, Metropoulos confirmed that he would be keeping the animals.\u201cDaren loves animals and the zoo and the animals will stay under his ownership,\u201d Metropoulos\u2019 representative told Page Six at the time.RecommendedMan \u2018faked his own death to teach family a lesson\u2019Pregnant Stassi Schroeder admits she wants to \u2018try\u2019 Ozempic after giving birthJeff Bezos, worth $148bn, becomes world\u2019s most overpaid Instagram boyfriendThe Independent has contacted a representative for Metropoulos for comment.

That\u2019s my work as well. It could also be limiting because as in love as I was, I just wasn\u2019t ready. Maybe the other person wasn\u2019t either and you try to make it work but it doesn\u2019t.\u201dClarkson first married Blackstock in 2013, seven years after they first met. The singer filed for divorce in 2020, citing irreconcilable differences.Their divorce was reportedly finalised earlier this year, with Clarkson agreeing to pay a one-time payment of $1.3m to her ex-husband, along with monthly child support payments of $45,601. She reportedly agreed to pay Blackstock $115,000 a month in spousal support, a stipulation that will end in January 2024.RecommendedKelly Clarkson and Meghan Trainor get candid about their facial hairKelly Clarkson shades ex husband Brandon Blackstock: \u2018Red flag\u2019David Beckham designs new car collection with MaseratiOver the years, Clarkson has spoken candidly about how her divorce has impacted her children.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDoctors are warning individuals who have turned to diabetes medications to lose weight that the drugs may result in unwanted side effects such as facial ageing.In recent months, injectable prescription medications such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, which were created for those with type 2 diabetes, have seen a rise in popularity among individuals who view the drugs as a quick-fix weight-loss method.Social media, and reports of widespread use of the drugs among celebrities, have contributed to the phenomenon, which since has resulted in shortages of the prescription medications.However, doctors have now issued a warning about \u201cOzempic face,\u201d a possible side effect of using the drugs both as a weight-loss method and without the proper medical supervision, as users have shared their experiences with accelerated ageing.Jennifer Berger, 41, told The New York Times in January that she began injecting Mounjaro, a brand name for tirzepatide, to lose weight after her pregnancy. Although the medication helped Berger lose 20 pounds over three months, she said it also left her almost unable to recognise her face in the mirror.RecommendedThe dark side of the Ozempic \u2018skinny jab\u2019The \u2018next Ozempic\u2019 became a social media sensation. Then everything changedHow TikTok turned the diabetes drug Ozempic into a diet pill\u201cI remember looking in the mirror, and it was almost like I didn\u2019t even recognise myself,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cMy body looked great, but my face looked exhausted and old.\u201dThe side effect is one that Dr Paul Jarrod Frank, a dermatologist in New York who spoke to The New York Times, has coined \u201cOzempic face,\u201d and he claims he\u2019s begun seeing it in his office \u201cevery day\u201d.\u201cA 50-year-old patient will come in, and suddenly, she\u2019s super-skinny and needs filler, which she never needed before. I look at her and say: \u2018How long have you been on Ozempic?\u2019 And I\u2019m right 100 per cent of the time,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the drug of choice these days for the one per cent.\u201dDr Frank, who likened the popularity of the drugs to erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra, is not the only one who has witnessed the influx in patients seeking treatment for the side effect. Dr Dhaval Bhanusali, a dermatologist in New York, also told The New York Times that he\u2019s seen an increase in patients on the medications who are \u201cconcerned about facial ageing and sagging\u201d.\u201cWe are seeing more and more patients on the medications coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally, it\u2019s people in their 40s and 50s who are losing significant amounts of weight and are concerned about facial ageing and sagging that occurs as a result.\u201dNew York-based plastic surgeon Dr Oren Tepper, who also spoke to the newspaper, said the increase in \u201cOzempic face\u201d is not surprising and noted that weight loss often leads to a more aged appearance as \u201ckey areas of the face\u201d deflate.\u201cWhen it comes to facial ageing, fat is typically more friend than foe,\u201d he explained. \u201cWeight loss may turn back your biological age, but it tends to turn your facial clock forward.\u201dAs for whether the side effect can be reversed, the dermatologists said the only way to do so in a noninvasive way is through the injection of fillers, which can cost thousands of dollars.Though, Dr Tepper says, when a significant amount of weight is lost rapidly, fillers may not be enough to restore lost volume in the face. At that point, he said plastic surgery becomes \u201cthe only way to restore the volume loss\u201d.He said individuals using the drugs to lose weight often do not realise the impact it will have on their face, and that, for many, the sudden weight loss is like \u201cwinning a lottery Mega Millions\u201d.\u201cBut then they realise there\u2019s a tax that comes with it - the loss of fat in the face - so it may not be quite the windfall they imagined,\u201d he said.The plastic surgeon told the newspaper that he treats \u201cOzempic face\u201d with a deep plane face-lift, which costs $75,000, and a procedure that transfers fat from other parts of the body to the face, which can cost an additional $12,000.As interest in the diabetes medications for weight loss continues to grow on social media, doctors have taken to platforms such as TikTok to share advice on combating the ageing effects.In one TikTok posted by Dr Rocio Salas-Whalen, who also spoke to The New York Times, the endocrinologist in New York says users can prevent \u201cloose and sagging skin\u201d during weight loss by losing weight gradually, staying hydrated, avoiding smoking, and increasing protein intake, which she noted is \u201cbasic for the production of elastin and collagen.\u201dHowever, according to Dr Joshua Zeichner, a board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who spoke to The Independent, \u201cweight loss, whether it is from diet, exercise, surgery, or a medication, takes toll on your face\u201d.\u201cFat in the face helps us maintain a naturally youthful appearance,\u201d he explained, adding: \u201cWhen you lose facial fat, the face often appears gaunt and skeletonised\u201d and that the face can appear \u201csignificantly older\u201d in those who lose large amounts of weight.In addition to injectable fillers, Dr Zeichner said treatments such as \u201cmicroneedling with radiofrequency, or a variety of other devices,\u201d can help tighten the skin and improve skin laxity. He also noted that, in \u201csevere cases, surgical corrections like a facelift might be an appropriate solution\u201d.Facial ageing is not the only concern individuals using the medications have to be aware of either. The prescription drugs can also lead to other, potentially dangerous side effects.In a press release from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcing the approval of Wegovy, a brand name for semaglutide and treatment for chronic weight management, it notes that the most common side effects include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, indigestion, dizziness, and digestive disorders.The FDA also warns about more serious complications that can arise from use of the medication, such as the \u201cpotential risk of thyroid C-cell tumours,\u201d pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, acute kidney injury, increased heart rate and suicidal behaviour or thinking.According to the website for Ozempic, which is not FDA-approved for weight loss, the potential serious side effects are similar to Wegovy\u2019s. The website warns patients about possible thyroid tumours, including cancer, pancreatitis, changes in vision, and kidney and gallbladder problems.The most common side effects experienced by individuals using Mounjaro include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, indigestion and stomach pain, while the website also warns Mounjaro \u201cmay cause tumours in the thyroid, including thyroid cancer,\u201d gallbladder or kidney problems, changes in vision and pancreatitis.In addition to countless posts praising the drugs as a magic weight-loss method, users have also taken to social media to share their experiences with the various side effects.RecommendedHoda Kotb, 58, admits she \u2018sometimes\u2019 worries if she\u2019ll see her daughters get marriedKristin Davis says she was \u2018ridiculed relentlessly\u2019 over facial fillersPaul O\u2019Grady\u2019s husband shares tribute on late star\u2019s 68th birthdayOne TikTok user says they have experienced nausea after taking Mounjaro, while another user said they suffered from acid reflux while taking Ozempic.Dr Salas-Whale, who described Mounjaro as the \u201cApple 14\u201d of the diabetes drugs, says the side effects are \u201cextremely rare if the medication is being prescribed at the right dose and with careful medical supervision\u201d."}, {"_id": "648b23ee51ac33150be92a61", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ozempic-face-before-and-after-photos-b2295506.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What is \u2018Ozempic face\u2019?

At that point, he said plastic surgery becomes \u201cthe only way to restore the volume loss\u201d.He said individuals using the drugs to lose weight often do not realise the impact it will have on their face, and that, for many, the sudden weight loss is like \u201cwinning a lottery Mega Millions\u201d.\u201cBut then they realise there\u2019s a tax that comes with it - the loss of fat in the face - so it may not be quite the windfall they imagined,\u201d he said.The plastic surgeon told the newspaper that he treats \u201cOzempic face\u201d with a deep plane face-lift, which costs $75,000, and a procedure that transfers fat from other parts of the body to the face, which can cost an additional $12,000.As interest in the diabetes medications for weight loss continues to grow on social media, doctors have taken to platforms such as TikTok to share advice on combating the ageing effects.In one TikTok posted by Dr Rocio Salas-Whalen, who also spoke to The New York Times, the endocrinologist in New York says users can prevent \u201cloose and sagging skin\u201d during weight loss by losing weight gradually, staying hydrated, avoiding smoking, and increasing protein intake, which she noted is \u201cbasic for the production of elastin and collagen.\u201dHowever, according to Dr Joshua Zeichner, a board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who spoke to The Independent, \u201cweight loss, whether it is from diet, exercise, surgery, or a medication, takes toll on your face\u201d.\u201cFat in the face helps us maintain a naturally youthful appearance,\u201d he explained, adding: \u201cWhen you lose facial fat, the face often appears gaunt and skeletonised\u201d and that the face can appear \u201csignificantly older\u201d in those who lose large amounts of weight.In addition to injectable fillers, Dr Zeichner said treatments such as \u201cmicroneedling with radiofrequency, or a variety of other devices,\u201d can help tighten the skin and improve skin laxity. He also noted that, in \u201csevere cases, surgical corrections like a facelift might be an appropriate solution\u201d.Facial ageing is not the only concern individuals using the medications have to be aware of either. The prescription drugs can also lead to other, potentially dangerous side effects.In a press release from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcing the approval of Wegovy, a brand name for semaglutide and treatment for chronic weight management, it notes that the most common side effects include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, indigestion, dizziness, and digestive disorders.The FDA also warns about more serious complications that can arise from use of the medication, such as the \u201cpotential risk of thyroid C-cell tumours,\u201d pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, acute kidney injury, increased heart rate and suicidal behaviour or thinking.According to the website for Ozempic, which is not FDA-approved for weight loss, the potential serious side effects are similar to Wegovy\u2019s. The website warns patients about possible thyroid tumours, including cancer, pancreatitis, changes in vision, and kidney and gallbladder problems.The most common side effects experienced by individuals using Mounjaro include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, indigestion and stomach pain, while the website also warns Mounjaro \u201cmay cause tumours in the thyroid, including thyroid cancer,\u201d gallbladder or kidney problems, changes in vision and pancreatitis.In addition to countless posts praising the drugs as a magic weight-loss method, users have also taken to social media to share their experiences with the various side effects.RecommendedHoda Kotb, 58, admits she \u2018sometimes\u2019 worries if she\u2019ll see her daughters get marriedKristin Davis says she was \u2018ridiculed relentlessly\u2019 over facial fillersPaul O\u2019Grady\u2019s husband shares tribute on late star\u2019s 68th birthdayOne TikTok user says they have experienced nausea after taking Mounjaro, while another user said they suffered from acid reflux while taking Ozempic.Dr Salas-Whale, who described Mounjaro as the \u201cApple 14\u201d of the diabetes drugs, says the side effects are \u201cextremely rare if the medication is being prescribed at the right dose and with careful medical supervision\u201d."}, {"_id": "648b23ee51ac33150be92a62", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/vogue-job-anna-wintour-assistant-devil-wears-prada-b2357663.html", "primaryCategory": "Fashion", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Vogue divides opinion with controversial job posting for Anna Wintour\u2019s assistant", "lead": "<p>Many fans have speculated that Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestly in the 2006 film is based on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour</p>", "author": "Meredith Clark", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 18:24:50 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-15 16:45:02.990703", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T18:24:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/13/16/shutterstock_editorial_1635311a.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAhead of Father\u2019s Day, Ryan Reynolds has brought back his cocktail recipe for \u201cThe Vasectomy,\u201d this time with help from Jessie James Decker.For the past two years, Reynolds, 46, who shares four children with wife Blake Lively, has featured his Aviation Gin in the Father\u2019s Day cocktail, which is made using gin, tonic, lemon juice, and cranberry juice.This year, Reynolds teamed up with Decker, 35, who shares three children with husband Eric Decker, for the \u201cDecker Edition\u201d of the drink, which sees the singer creating the cocktail for her partner while joking that the beverage gets its name from the procedure her husband has \u201crefused to get\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s Father\u2019s Day and that means it\u2019s time for another vasectomy\u2026 something my husband has refused to get. So, today I\u2019m taking matters into my own hands,\u201d Decker began the Aviation Gin ad.After filling a tall glass to the brim with ice, Decker noted that it is \u201cprobably more ice than you need to soothe your tender areas after what I\u2019m told is a pretty quick and painless procedure\u201d.RecommendedRyan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney confirm Wrexham USA tour to conclude in star\u2019s hometownBlake Lively publicly gushes over husband Ryan Reynolds\u2019 \u2018spicy\u2019 bicep photoRyan Reynolds tells Wrexham player to \u2018put a shirt on\u2019 around wife Blake Lively\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like giving birth,\u201d she added.Decker then fills the glass with an ounce of cranberry juice, which she described as \u201csweet like an outpatient gesture of love,\u201d before adding the Deadpool star\u2019s gin, lemon, and Lively\u2019s tonic brand Betty Buzz. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s at least one husband out there looking out for his better half,\u201d Decker joked of the brand placement for Reynolds\u2019 wife.Once she\u2019d finished making the cocktail, Decker tried a sip, declaring it \u201cso good and so easy\u201d before handing it off to her husband.Reynolds then makes an appearance in the commercial, with the actor informing Decker: \u201cYou know those don\u2019t actually work, right? Like, at all,\u201d before walking off with the bottle of gin.The latest iteration of the ad concludes with Decker quietly assuring her husband that the drink does work. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, they work,\u201d she told the former NFL player.The choice to star Decker in the ad appears to be a reference to her admission that her husband \u201crefuses\u201d to get the surgical procedure, which works as a form of permanent birth control by stopping sperm from leaving the body. The country music singer revealed that the football player \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d make an appointment for the procedure, despite her repeated requests, while speaking to US Weekly in January.\u201cI keep asking him: \u2018Go make that appointment\u2019 and he won\u2019t. He just won\u2019t do it,\u201d Decker said. \u201cHe says it takes, like, his manhood away from him. So he\u2019s just gonna leave it, I guess.\u201dAt the time, the \u201cI Still Love You\u201d singer said the couple, who share daughter Vivianne, eight, and sons Eric, seven, and Forrest, four, probably would not have more children. \u201cI feel like as of right now, it\u2019s probably a no,\u201d she told the outlet.Reynolds\u2019 unique Father\u2019s Day ad has become a tradition, with the actor first unveiling the recipe for The Vasectomy cocktail in 2021. At the time, he\u2019d amusingly claimed in a how-to video that the drink was \u201cso bubbly, just like I feel every day I wake up after a long, full night\u2019s sleep\u201d.After taking a sip, he\u2019d joked it was \u201cas refreshing as fatherhood\u201d.Reynolds and Lively, who share daughters James, eight, Inez, six, and Betty, three, welcomed their fourth child earlier this year. Although he often jokes about the difficulties of raising his young children, the actor told ET Canada in April that he and Lively wouldn\u2019t have expanded their family again if they \u201cdidn\u2019t love it\u201d.\u201cYou know, two to three was a huge jump\u2026 three to four less so,\u201d the actor told the outlet. \u201cI cannot speak for my wife, but it\u2019s just from what I\u2019ve observed. But, we love it.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAhead of Father\u2019s Day, Ryan Reynolds has brought back his cocktail recipe for \u201cThe Vasectomy,\u201d this time with help from Jessie James Decker.For the past two years, Reynolds, 46, who shares four children with wife Blake Lively, has featured his Aviation Gin in the Father\u2019s Day cocktail, which is made using gin, tonic, lemon juice, and cranberry juice.This year, Reynolds teamed up with Decker, 35, who shares three children with husband Eric Decker, for the \u201cDecker Edition\u201d of the drink, which sees the singer creating the cocktail for her partner while joking that the beverage gets its name from the procedure her husband has \u201crefused to get\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s Father\u2019s Day and that means it\u2019s time for another vasectomy\u2026 something my husband has refused to get. So, today I\u2019m taking matters into my own hands,\u201d Decker began the Aviation Gin ad.After filling a tall glass to the brim with ice, Decker noted that it is \u201cprobably more ice than you need to soothe your tender areas after what I\u2019m told is a pretty quick and painless procedure\u201d.RecommendedRyan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney confirm Wrexham USA tour to conclude in star\u2019s hometownBlake Lively publicly gushes over husband Ryan Reynolds\u2019 \u2018spicy\u2019 bicep photoRyan Reynolds tells Wrexham player to \u2018put a shirt on\u2019 around wife Blake Lively\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like giving birth,\u201d she added.Decker then fills the glass with an ounce of cranberry juice, which she described as \u201csweet like an outpatient gesture of love,\u201d before adding the Deadpool star\u2019s gin, lemon, and Lively\u2019s tonic brand Betty Buzz. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s at least one husband out there looking out for his better half,\u201d Decker joked of the brand placement for Reynolds\u2019 wife.Once she\u2019d finished making the cocktail, Decker tried a sip, declaring it \u201cso good and so easy\u201d before handing it off to her husband.Reynolds then makes an appearance in the commercial, with the actor informing Decker: \u201cYou know those don\u2019t actually work, right? Like, at all,\u201d before walking off with the bottle of gin.The latest iteration of the ad concludes with Decker quietly assuring her husband that the drink does work. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, they work,\u201d she told the former NFL player.The choice to star Decker in the ad appears to be a reference to her admission that her husband \u201crefuses\u201d to get the surgical procedure, which works as a form of permanent birth control by stopping sperm from leaving the body. The country music singer revealed that the football player \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d make an appointment for the procedure, despite her repeated requests, while speaking to US Weekly in January.\u201cI keep asking him: \u2018Go make that appointment\u2019 and he won\u2019t. He just won\u2019t do it,\u201d Decker said. \u201cHe says it takes, like, his manhood away from him. So he\u2019s just gonna leave it, I guess.\u201dAt the time, the \u201cI Still Love You\u201d singer said the couple, who share daughter Vivianne, eight, and sons Eric, seven, and Forrest, four, probably would not have more children. \u201cI feel like as of right now, it\u2019s probably a no,\u201d she told the outlet.Reynolds\u2019 unique Father\u2019s Day ad has become a tradition, with the actor first unveiling the recipe for The Vasectomy cocktail in 2021. At the time, he\u2019d amusingly claimed in a how-to video that the drink was \u201cso bubbly, just like I feel every day I wake up after a long, full night\u2019s sleep\u201d.After taking a sip, he\u2019d joked it was \u201cas refreshing as fatherhood\u201d.Reynolds and Lively, who share daughters James, eight, Inez, six, and Betty, three, welcomed their fourth child earlier this year. Although he often jokes about the difficulties of raising his young children, the actor told ET Canada in April that he and Lively wouldn\u2019t have expanded their family again if they \u201cdidn\u2019t love it\u201d.\u201cYou know, two to three was a huge jump\u2026 three to four less so,\u201d the actor told the outlet. \u201cI cannot speak for my wife, but it\u2019s just from what I\u2019ve observed. But, we love it.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRepublican politician Robby Starbuck has been threatened with legal action after he used an unapproved paparazzi photo of actor Megan Fox and her children to launch into claims of \u201cchild abuse\u201d.According to TMZ, photo agency Backgrid sent the former GOP congressional candidate a legal letter on Tuesday (13 June), accusing him of infringing on their copyright to the picture of Megan Fox and her three sons \u2013 Noah, 10, Bodhi, nine and Journey, six. The image showed Fox\u2019s eldest son Noah wearing a pink long-sleeved T-shirt and tie-dye shorts, while Bodhi and Journey were dressed in dark T-shirts and trousers.Starbuck tweeted the paparazzi photo on 8 June, alongside claims that the Transformers star \u201cforced\u201d her sons \u201cto wear girls clothes\u201d in an act of \u201cpure child abuse\u201d. Fox then clapped back at Starbuck\u2019s claims of \u201cchild abuse\u201d when she posted a screenshot of his tweet to Instagram, referring to him as a \u201cclout chaser\u201d and \u201cdesperate\u201d to \u201cacquire wealth, power, success or fame\u201d in the caption.In the legal letter obtained by TMZ, Backgrid claimed that Starbuck did not purchase or license their photo before he published it on Twitter. The photo agency maintained that the image was not within \u201cfair use\u201d, in which third parties are allowed to use copyrighted works without permission in certain limited circumstances.Backgrid also argued that Starbuck cannot claim his use of the photo was for political purposes.

It\u2019s pure child abuse.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJournalists are no longer the gatekeepers. The reality is that many young people are now bypassing the websites and apps of traditional news outlets and seeking information on social media platforms, including TikTok.It\u2019s the \u2018fastest growing social network\u2019, according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report, and new research has found that 20% of 18-24 year olds use the app solely to find their news. While a massive 44% of that age group use the short-form video hosting service for any and every other purpose.The younger generation have \u201clittle interest in many conventional news offers oriented towards older generations\u2019 habits, interests, values, and instead embrace the more personality-based, participatory, and personalised options offered by social media\u201d, said Reuters Institute director Rasmus Nielsen.Under 18s are big users too, so for parents whose teens get their news via TikTok, what do you need to understand about the social network and the evolution of digital media literacy?What is TikTok?RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveEvery so often a new app emerges and redefines the way we use social media. It\u2019s what TikTok went and did in 2016.Starting as a small niche social media network \u2013 founded by Chinese tech giant Zhang Yiming \u2013 that attracted lip-synching teens as a short-form video hosting site, it almost knocked Facebook off its perch, and blew up during the coronavirus pandemic to a mega global platform.Do news organisations share news on it?Yes, they do. In many ways, traditional news organisations were forced to join TikTok to avoid being left behind, reach new and younger audiences and ensure they are continuing to find creative ways to pivot in a constantly evolving digital space.\u201cGiven the popularity and high engagement level, it\u2019s not surprising that TikTok has become an important news platform for younger audiences, and it makes sense that news organisations are using it,\u201d said Mark Brill, a senior lecturer in Future Media at Birmingham City University. \u201cThis, however, is a continuation of an existing trend. For well over a decade social media such as Facebook has been the primary news source for under 25s.\u201dAnna Lee, founder at the Fr. App, added: \u201cWe can see that Gen Z individuals are turning to TikTok for any and all searches. While the funniest sound bites and newest dance trends will always have a home on TikTok, you can also equally expect to find videos explaining an arbitrary housing act.\u201dHow is it shared?There are various types of videos that can be shared on TikTok. Alongside the short bite-sized videos sharing the latest news, you can share trending sounds, things creators have posted, or videos with friends, family, and your larger community within TikTok or through other social media platforms.Videos can also be shared directly to other users, as long as the user has allowed for it.How do algorithms work?The TikTok algorithm is a recommendation system that determines which videos will appear on your (unique and highly personalised) For You page, which is also known as the homepage.Brill, who has 25 years of experience applying emerging technologies to engage audiences, said: \u201cMuch of the success of TikTok is the way that their algorithm decides which videos to show their users. TikTok\u2019s system is based entirely on their interests and previous viewing.\u201cThis \u2018more of what you like\u2019 approach means that users spend more time each month in TikTok than any other platform. In the UK it adds up to over 27 hours per user per month and 23 hours globally. It shows how the platform\u2019s algorithm can be highly addictive.\u201dIs it OK that TikTok is how young people learn about what\u2019s happening in the world?Some experts believe it is important for young people to be taught digital literacy at an increasingly earlier age \u2013 especially with the prevalence of fake news and artificial intelligence and its ability to forge fake articles and pictures.\u201cUsers of TikTok and all other social media apps must understand how to evaluate every piece of information they come across,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAll parents worry about their child viewing harmful content on the internet. However, most leading internet providers provide extensive parental controls, including blocking and filtering unsuitable content.\u201dShould they be encouraged to look elsewhere?For Brill, there are both benefits and challenges from using social media as a news source. He also cites the recent Reuters Institute report, which noted that TikTok users tend to look for good-news stories, avoiding the \u2018doom scrolling\u2019 found in web-based internet sites, which can have a negative impact on mental health.\u201cThe big question with social media sources, however, is that of veracity. A lack of fact checking and or acknowledgment of authoritative sources makes it difficult to identify fake stories and information. The short-form video format does not bring an in-depth analysis, where opinions are often presented as fact,\u201d he said.\u201cPerhaps the biggest challenge for TikTok users is with the algorithm itself. By giving more of what they like, it leads to confirmation bias that reinforces existing perceptions.\u201dWhile child and behavioural expert Amanda Jenner, would encourage parents to tell their children to look elsewhere.\u201cI am not a believer in directing children to learn through TikTok at all. Children can easily become addicted to social media and [it] can quickly escalate and [they could] be looking at other things they shouldn\u2019t be watching.RecommendedPaternity leave should be paid for six weeks, campaigners tell GovernmentHow to take care of pets in the heatStruggling with menopause symptoms in the heat? An expert shares tips\u201cI genuinely do feel parents need to be worried. I would encourage parents to set an age where it\u2019s acceptable to have TikTok (over the age of 13 preferably) and have a parental control app so you can monitor and control what both they are seeing and the amount of time they spend on [it].
