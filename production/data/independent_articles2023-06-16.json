Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn Australian travel firm previously slammed for its handling of Covid quarantine hotels has been quietly handed a \u00a31.6bn contract covering the UK\u2019s new asylum accommodation ships, The Independent can reveal.Corporate Travel Management (CTM) was put in charge of the lucrative two-year arrangement in February, weeks before the government revealed it would use a barge as its first offshore accommodation for asylum seekers. The contract was awarded directly to CTM without a competition, and a lawyer with knowledge of the system said the government had pushed a wider deal originally drawn up for official travel \u201cbeyond what it was intended to be used for\u201d.Ministers have repeatedly refused to detail the projected cost of Rishi Sunak\u2019s controversial asylum vessels, while insisting they will be cheaper than using hotels that are currently costing \u00a36m a day.This week, Suella Braverman told parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Committee she could not predict the cost of the new Illegal Migration Bill, because there are \u201cmany unknown factors\u201d.RecommendedMP blasts Suella Braverman in fiery Commons clash over small boats: \u2018Just answer the question\u2019Asylum seekers to have less space than a car parking bay on \u2018quasi-prison\u2019 bargeSunak says \u2018stop the boats\u2019 plan is \u2018starting to work\u2019 as he announces two new bargesThree vessels so far have been announced, with a barge named the Bibby Stockholm due to arrive in Portland, Dorset later this month and a further two ships set for undisclosed locations.Richard Drax, the Conservative MP for South Dorset, said the public \u201cshould know how much is being paid\u201d on the barge set-up and said the spending he was aware of so far was \u201calarmingly high\u201d.\u201cThe point is this is taxpayers' money,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cThis contract might actually be separate to what the ports are being paid. \u201cThen on top of that the police want money, the health authority wants money, of course the council wants money, and yet the government continues to insist that this is cheaper than hotels. The overall figure will be alarmingly high.\u201dYvette Cooper, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, said the Home Office has \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d.\u201cThe Tories are spending more and more taxpayers money on their total failure to fix the asylum backlog they have created,\u201d she added.\u201cThis is an incredibly expensive contract with no clarity on whether proper procedures have been followed, and the barges come on top of costly hotels, not instead of them, because of the government failure to take asylum decisions or get any grip.\u201d Three-storey barge expected to house migrants arrives at FalmouthThe CTM contract, published under the title \u201cprovision of bridging accommodation and travel services\u201d, states that it has an estimated value of \u00a31,593,535,200 over two years and could be extended beyond 2025.The Home Office refused to answer The Independent\u2019s questions on what portion of the contract covers barges, and parts of official documents headed \u201cpricing details\u201d have been redacted in full because of \u201ccommercial interests\u201d.John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: \u201cThis murky contract leaves taxpayers in the dark. The migrant crisis may require an urgent response, but bungled procurement has cost a fortune in recent years.\u201cMinisters must ensure transparency and value for money when tendering services.\u201dAnswering a parliamentary question on the Bibby Stockholm in May, immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it would be managed \u201cby a specialist and experienced provider, which has a strong track record of providing this kind of accommodation\u201d. He added that the provider had \u201cmanaged two vessels [housing Ukrainian refugees] in Scottish ports for the past year\u201d. On its website, CTM describes itself as \u201ca global provider of innovative and cost-effective travel solutions spanning corporate, events, leisure, loyalty and wholesale travel\u201d.The firm says it was established in Brisbane in 1994 and has since grown from a \u201ctwo-person start-up into one of the world\u2019s most successful travel management companies\u201d, operating across Australasia, Asia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

firm\u2019s most recent financial report hailed record profits, having taken A$292m (\u00a3160m) in revenue over the last six months of 2022.A notice to its shareholders celebrated the new contract\u2019s \u201csignificant impact\u201d on financial growth, adding: \u201cThis work involves highly complex services and logistic support \u2026 CTM has both the experience and specialised knowledge to support this work.\u201dThe government placed the new barges under a pre-existing agreement with CTM for \u201ctravel and venue solutions\u201d, which previously covered official bookings for conferences, flights, train tickets, hotels and vehicle hire for ministers and civil servants.A source familiar with the drawing up of the overarching framework accused the government of \u201cpushing the scope beyond what it was intended to be used for\u201d.\u201cIf products and services are outside scope there\u2019s a procurement failure and the contract has been awarded without following the rules,\u201d they told The Independent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the right vehicle for this kind of contract and it looks like they\u2019ve done it to minimise visibility.\u201dThe remit of CTM\u2019s government work was widened during the pandemic and its general manager for northern England, Michael Healy, was made an OBE in the 2021 New Year honours list

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA prisoner who believes he was wrongly convicted of killing his father has won a High Court challenge against the Government over a refusal to allow him to be interviewed by a journalist over the phone.Mark Alexander, then aged 22, received a life sentence with a minimum term of 16 years after a jury found him guilty of murdering 70-year-old Samuel Alexander in September 2010.Currently being held at HMP Coldingley in Surrey, Alexander took legal action against the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) after the prison\u2019s governor rejected his request for a phone interview with Robin Eveleigh, a journalist who wants to make a podcast about his case.In a written ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Andrew Baker concluded the refusal from governor Niall Bryant was \u201cmisdirected and irrational\u201d.The judge said the decision to refuse a phone interview should be \u201cquashed\u201d and the governor \u201cwill need to consider the claimant\u2019s request afresh\u201d.In a comment issued by the Justice for Mark Alexander campaign, Alexander said: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an important milestone in the fight for an open, transparent and accountable justice system in which prisoners\u2019 voices are heard; wrongful convictions can be properly scrutinised; and our free press is able to work without resistance or obfuscation from government.\u201dA 2010 trial at Reading Crown Court was told that Alexander, then a law student, killed his father in a bid to escape his \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d and buried his body in concrete in the garden of the family home in the small village of Drayton Parslow, Buckinghamshire.Attempts to appeal against his conviction in the years following his imprisonment were rejected by the Court of Appeal.Alexander\u2019s lawyer told a High Court hearing in London last month that he had \u201calways insisted he is innocent of the crime, and is the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice\u201d.The prisoner, who has gained two law degrees in prison, wants to \u201craise awareness of his case\u201d and use a podcast because of the \u201csuccess of the best of them \u2013 such as Serial \u2013 in overturning unsafe murder convictions\u201d, his lawyer told the judge.Alexander thinks a podcast would help encourage people to come forward with new information, amid his belief that \u201chis father\u2019s killers remain at large\u201d, the court was told.The MoJ defended against Alexander\u2019s claim, arguing it had been rationally decided that the prisoner\u2019s request was \u201cnot urgent or immediate\u201d and that a phone interview \u201cmight cause distress to others, and that there was a risk of outrage to public sensibilities\u201d.John Jolliffe, for the department, said in written arguments that telephone interviews between a prisoner and the media that might be published or broadcast were only allowed in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d.But Greg Callus, representing Alexander, said in written arguments that the \u201cwrong criteria\u201d and \u201cwrong standard\u201d were applied over the interview request.\n\nThe governor appears to have taken the view that no matter what the content or purpose of the interview, it would be a public outrage for the media to be allowed to talk to someone convicted of murdering their father... That is not a rational viewMr Justice Andrew BakerHe said it was \u201cfanciful\u201d that the public might be \u201coutraged\u201d by Alexander claiming he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice and that it was \u201cthe baldest of hypothetical assertions\u201d to say victims may be distressed.The court was told Alexander\u2019s mother and grandmother support his claim of wrongful conviction.In his ruling, Mr Justice Andrew Baker said he was not indicating any view about the \u201ccredibility\u201d of Alexander\u2019s claim of innocence as it was not something he was in a position to assess.He said the prison governor had initially been willing to support the interview request, but was \u201cmisdirected\u201d by a government press office over prison policy \u2013 something Alexander may have felt \u201ca real sense of unfairness\u201d about.The judge said the governor had \u201cwrongly narrowed\u201d his focus on whether urgency was a required factor in his decision and \u201cfailed to consider at all on its merits the request actually made\u201d.He said it was an \u201cerror of approach\u201d to say the views of Mr Eveleigh were \u201cnot relevant\u201d as it was a \u201ccentral element\u201d of Alexander\u2019s claim that phone contact was better than writing for a podcast.The judge said no other victim in Alexander\u2019s case had been identified, other than his father, and that prisoner access to media policy \u201cdoes not have in mind victims of crime in some generic or abstract sense\u201d.He concluded any \u201creasonable decision-maker\u201d could not take a view that the public would be outraged by Alexander speaking about his case \u201cunder appropriately controlled conditions\u201d rather than only writing about it.\u201cThe governor appears to have taken the view that no matter what the content or purpose of the interview, it would be a public outrage for the media to be allowed to talk to someone convicted of murdering their father while he was still in custody following that conviction. That is not a rational view,\u201d the judge said."}, {"_id": "648c54ea51ac33b09b54d642", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/newcastle-university-covid-government-alice-b2358892.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UK entered pandemic with \u2018depleted\u2019 public services, inquiry hears", "lead": "An expert report highlighted health inequalities in the UK, such as in life expectancy and deaths.", "author": "Jane Kirby", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:55:08", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:18.841893", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T11:55:08+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/12/3d11ea909f0a759a6fe182bf4e8a9c35Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MDAxNjUw-2.72508185.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoris Johnson is said to be considering an audacious independent bid to become London mayor for a second time after his exit from parliament and dramatic fall from grace in the Tory party.The former prime minister is weighing up his next move outside Westminster after his fate was sealed by a damning report that found he deliberately and repeatedly lied to the Commons over\u00a0Partygate.Mr Johnson has been revealed as the \u201cerudite\u201d new Saturday columnist at the Daily Mail, offering a veiled warning to Rishi Sunak that he \u201cmay have to cover politics from time to time\u201d.And the Financial Times has reported that Mr Johnson could look to get his old job back in City Hall by running as an independent candidate to defeat Labour mayor Sadiq Khan.Guto Harri, who served as a key aide to Mr Johnson in his last stint as London mayor, told The Independent that it would be a \u201cgreat idea\u201d.The former No 10 communications director said he has not discussed the move with his old boss, but added: \u201cLondon needs a powerful advocate with the profile, ambition, credibility and character to fight its corner and champion its cause.\u201dRecommendedBoris Johnson \u2013 latest: Liar ex-PM \u2018to get Daily Mail column\u2019 days after damning Partygate reportBoris Johnson the liar: How the former PM lied and lied again to the CommonsBoris and Trump might be gone \u2013 but unless we change our politics, we\u2019ll get more malign leadersBaroness Camilla Cavendish, David Cameron\u2019s former policy adviser, wrote in the FT:\u00a0\u201cI hear he is now considering standing as an independent in next year\u2019s London mayoral election.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe tragedy is that he was quite good at that job \u2014 and some of those on his honours list are people who worked for him then. He was just never able to rise to the heights required of a prime minister.\u201dWill Walden, Mr Johnson\u2019s former communications director at City Hall, told The Independent: \u201cBoris only runs for things if he knows he can win.

Last time I looked Boris was still a Conservative. I\u2019m not sure Tory members in London will look kindly on him running against their chosen candidate.\u201dRichard Barnes, the former deputy mayor of London under Mr Johnson, told LBC that trying to run for mayor again would be the act of \u201ca desperate man\u201d, adding: \u201cYou can go forwards, left or right, but you can\u2019t go backwards.\u201dThe Conservatives had already shortlisted three candidates for next year\u2019s London mayoral contest: Susan Hall, Mozammel Hossain, and Daniel Korski. Mr Johnson\u2019s former adviser and ally Samuel Kasumu\u00a0missed out \u2013 with speculation he was blocked for his links to the ex-PM. There are no restrictions on the number terms a London mayor can serve or number of times candidates can run.

Former ministers who have left in the last two years must apply to Acoba before taking up a new role.It comes as Mr Johnson licks his wounds after the damning verdict of MPs on the privileges committee Partygate inquiry \u2013 who said they\u2019d have recommended a 90-day suspension had he not already quit his seat to spite their expected sanction.Senior Tory MP Damian Green said it will be \u201cquite difficult\u201d for Mr Johnson to return as a Tory candidate for the Commons in the future. Mr Green told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today that if he had offered a \u201cmore temperate\u201d response to the committee it would be easier for him to made a comeback.Boris Johnson could run in Nadine Dorries\u2019 old seat, says ally  (PA)But Mr Johnson\u2019s allies haven\u2019t given up hope that he can find another seat to run at the general election in 2024 \u2013 or even before then.David Campbell Bannerman, chairman of the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO), said Mr Johnson still stand in the Oxfordshire seat of Henley \u2013 or run in Nadine Dorries\u2019 Mid-Bedfordshire seat once she formally quits in the weeks or months ahead.\u201cHe is still an approved Conservative candidate \u2013 but is the party chairman and No 10 going to allow him to stand?\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cThey would be unwise to stop him. He needs to get back in quickly, and MPs need to get real and see Sunak is not going to stop a wipe-out.\u201dMr Bannerman dismissed the idea of Mr Johnson running as London mayor. \u201cHe was a very good mayor, but he has bigger fish to fry \u2013 we need him back as prime minister,\u201d the Johnson ally said.Mr Johnson is pondering whether to launch a series of appearances in the weeks ahead to \u201cpush his policy agenda\u201d, according to The Telegraph. The Reform UK Party\u00a0are reportedly keen to invite him to join their efforts to protect Brexit.Conservative MPs are considering whether to vote for the privileges committee report or abstain on Monday, as Ms Dorries and a small group of Johnson allies warned of a grassroots uprising and deselections.Tim Loughton told the BBC he was likely to vote in favour of the report, describing the committee as \u201clegitimate\u201d and their findings \u201cdamning\u201d.

It\u2019s serious,\u201d she said.Former MEP David Campbell Bannerman said: \u201cAny Tory MP who endorses this report does not respect democracy and must face deselection.\u201dCommons Leader Penny Mordaunt called for calm, saying \u201call of us must do what we think is right and others must leave us alone to do so\u201d.Downing Street said Mr Sunak would \u201ctake the time to fully consider the report\u201d, but officials were unable to say whether he would take part in Monday\u2019s vote.Cabinet minister David Davies said he believed the report had killed off Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes for a political comeback.Asked if Mr Johnson\u2019s career was now over, the Welsh Secretary told BBC\u2019s Question Time: \u201cI think it probably is. I\u2019m not saying whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.\u201cI don\u2019t really see any way back for Boris.\u201dSir Jake Berry, a former Tory party chairman who is a close ally of Mr Johnson, conceded he was \u201calmost certain that Parliament will vote in favour\u201d of the report.But he told told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain he will \u201ccertainly be one of those in the no lobby opposing this report, because I think both the conclusions and, to some extent, the way the committee was made up in terms of this report are wrong.\u201dThe committee found Mr Johnson deliberately misled the House with his partygate denials before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation against the MPs investigating him.Branding him the first former prime minister to have ever lied to the Commons, the Privileges Committee said the offences merited a 90-day suspension which would have paved the way for a by-election if he had not preemptively resigned in protest.Mr Johnson was furious at what he called a \u201cderanged conclusion\u201d, claiming the 14-month investigation had delivered \u201cwhat is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination\u201d.The committee, comprised of four Tories, two Labour MPs, and one from the SNP, found many aspects of Mr Johnson\u2019s defence were \u201cnot credible\u201d, allowing them to conclude he \u201cintended to mislead\u201d MPs.They dismissed Mr Johnson\u2019s argument that mid-pandemic staff leaving dos in Downing Street were essential to maintain staff morale, noting they attracted police fines while the rules would have been clear to him.\u201cA workplace \u2018thank you\u2019, leaving drink, birthday celebration or motivational event is obviously neither essential or reasonably necessary,\u201d the MPs wrote.\u201cThat belief, which he continues to assert, has no reasonable basis in the rules or on the facts.\u201dThe committee said his public criticism was a \u201ccynical attempt to manipulate\u201d the opinions of MPs and the public.RecommendedCricketers and fans honour three killed in deadly city rampage ahead of AshesSNP urges Ross to \u2018grow a backbone\u2019 over Johnson sanctionsRyan Reynolds confirms birth of fourth child with Blake LivelyMeanwhile, further evidence of Mr Sunak\u2019s problems with managing his own party came as Telford MP Lucy Allan announced she would step down at the next election.The Shropshire town is where Mr Johnson launched his 2019 manifesto, but Ms Allan said: \u201cToday\u2019s Conservative Party is just not interested in seats like Telford anymore.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c54ed51ac33b09b54d64e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bath-somerset-bristol-sam-jones-bristol-crown-court-b2358846.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Provisional trial date set for youths accused of murdering teenage boy in Bath", "lead": "Mikey Roynon, 16, died from a single stab wound after being attacked at a party in the Somerset city.", "author": "Claire Hayhurst", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:28:44", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:21.470033", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T10:28:44+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/11/78d9526ef2cde46ffb79d9d92a89c022Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTk3NDk1-2.72573151.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

New legislation launched in March however, will not come in time to prevent Bellfield from marrying his bride.His engagement was first revealed in May 2022, after The Sun reported that he had proposed during a jail visit. The news sparked outrage, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson saying he was \u201csickened and appalled\u201d.Following news that his application to marry would like be successful, Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said: \u201cThis is a disgusting insult to the victims and their families.\u201cThis is a man who took away the human rights of young girls and women, including the right to live their lives and marry.French student Amelie Delagrange, 22, was visiting the UK when she was murdered by Bellfield on the streets of Twickenham, London (PA)\u201cYet he is demanding the right to do so using human rights law.\u201cThe justice secretary needs to move as quickly as possible to get this legislation through and make sure that no other people this evil can exploit this situation again.\u201dThe former bouncer was jailed in 2008 for murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, and Amelie Delagrange, 22, as well as the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, in south-west London.The attacks had taken place in 2003 and 2004, with detectives stating at the time that he was likely to be linked to dozens more of other attacks.He was found guilty three years later for the murder of schoolgirl Milly who was abducted in Walton-on-Thames in 2002 as she was returning home from school.Bellfield has \u201cadmitted\u201d killing missing student Elizabeth Chau who disappeared in west London in 1999  (PA)Her disappearance sparked a nationwide search with a \u00a3100,000 reward offered for information.Five months later, her remains were found near Hampshire, with Surrey Police confirming in 2008 that Bellfield was the prime suspect. Bellfield was convicted by an Old Bailey jury and later admitted during an interview in 2016 that he was responsible for her abduction and death.Last month, he was questioned in prison after allegedly confessing to the murder of 19-year-old student Elizabeth Chau, who vanished in west London in 1999.It was reported that Bellfield described how he killed her to a prison visitor and showed police a rough area where he had hidden her body. This latest confession came just a month after he admitted to murdering 45-year-old Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan. The two were found bludgeoned to death in Chillenden, Kent, in July 1996 with Michael Stone currently serving three life sentences for their murders.

The force first launched its investigation into potential criminality within the SNP\u2019s fundraising in July 2021. It came after a formal complaint was filed in March that year by party activist Sean Clerkin, who alleged that around \u00a3666,953 in donations raised since 2017 for a second independence referendum campaign had been spent on other things, contrary to promises made to supporters.Police outside Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s home following arrest of husband Peter Murrell  (PA)Ms Sturgeon, who announced in February that she was standing down as Scotland\u2019s first minister and SNP leader, has also been arrested in connection with the incident.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMadeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl from Rothley, Leicestershire, was reported missing from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on the Algarve on 3 May 2007, a case still unsolved and still the subject of intense interest among the public and press.Her parents, Kate McCann and Gerry McCann, posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter\u2019s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day and posting a poem, \u201cThe Contradiction\u201d by Clare Pollard, to express their feelings.\u201cToday marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine\u2019s abduction. Still missing... still very much missed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction. A public prosecutor subsequently applied for the confiscation of Kate McCann\u2019s diary and Gerry McCann\u2019s laptop plus the group\u2019s phone records.On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns. He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017.Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a \u201cpredator\u201d during their stay at Praia da Luz. His wife had come to believe that a potential perpetrator could have seen a note in the resort\u2019s guest book visible to all in reception noting their dining arrangements on the evening of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The couple followed up on 20 January 2008 by releasing a sketch of a \u201ccreepy man\u201d they said other holidaymakers had said they had seen loitering at the Ocean Club.In April, a month before the one-year anniversary of the fateful night, Portuguese police travelled to Leicestershire to conduct further interviews with the McCanns\u2019 friends.RecommendedWhat happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios as Netflix documentary releasedThen, on 21 July, Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance and closed the case, unsolved.With the trail cold and no closure in sight, the McCanns continued to publicise their cause, issuing computer-generated images of how Madeleine might look now that she had aged on 3 November 2009 and condemning the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files \u2013 detailing possible sightings of their daughter \u2013 to British newspapers in March 2010.The McCanns published a book of their own about their ordeal in May 2011, entitled simply Madeleine, which was serialised in The Sun as the newspaper led a campaign calling on British prime minister David Cameron to launch a new inquiry. He did so. Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine\u2019s description in May 2007.Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost \u00a310m in its first four years of operation.That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig. Christian Brueckner (AFP/Getty)He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her. \u201cIf you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can\u2019t give you details because we don\u2019t want the accused to know what we have on him \u2013 these are tactical considerations,\u201d he told the BBC. It was subsequently revealed that Madeleine\u2019s Fund still had \u00a3773,629 to spend as of 31 March 2020, meaning the McCanns can continue to bankroll a private investigation to find their daughter long after the police hunt is finally drawn to a close, should they choose to.Brueckner was formally made a \u201carguido\u201d in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.On 19 September, the McCanns lost their libel case against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, before the European Court of Human Rights. The couple had attempted to argue that Mr Amaral was responsible for damaging their reputation and breaching their rights to respect for their private life and to be presumed innocent after taking exception to his book and associated media appearances in which he had repeatedly suggested they were responsible for the vanishing.Their complaint also argued that Portugal\u2019s Supreme Court had failed to allow them proper redress over the alleged libel by Mr Amaral after judges threw out their earlier claim in 2017.The verdict left the McCanns with three months to appeal against the decision.In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann.Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims for good. In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the Madeleine McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction.Police in Germany continue to claim they have \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that Madeleine is dead but this has still not been confirmed and their investigation is ongoing, with Brueckner still not charged in the McCann case.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMadeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl from Rothley, Leicestershire, was reported missing from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on the Algarve on 3 May 2007, a case still unsolved and still the subject of intense interest among the public and press.Her parents, Kate McCann and Gerry McCann, posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter\u2019s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day and posting a poem, \u201cThe Contradiction\u201d by Clare Pollard, to express their feelings.\u201cToday marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine\u2019s abduction. Still missing... still very much missed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeScientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur on the Isle of Wight for the first time in 142 years.Vectipelta barretti, which belongs to a group of plant-eating dinosaurs known as ankylosaur, was found in the island\u2019s Wessex Formation \u2013 a fossil site dating back to somewhere between 145 to 66 million years ago.Researchers hope the find will help them to learn more about how dinosaurs became extinct.The species, which has an\u00a0 armoured body has been named after professor Paul Barrett who has worked at the Natural History Museum in London for 20 years.RecommendedEarliest reptiles and birds may have given birth to live young, study suggestsTriassic herbivores starved to death as diet took toll on teeth, study suggests\u2018Virgin\u2019 crocodile found to have made herself pregnantIt is the second armoured dinosaur to be found in the island, the first one being Polacanthus foxii - which was unearthed in 1865.Stuart Pond, a researcher at Natural History Museum\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences, said: \"For virtually 142 years, all ankylosaur remains from the Isle of Wight have been assigned to Polacanthus foxii, a famous dinosaur from the island, now all of those finds need to be revisited because we\u2019ve described this new species.\"V barretti differs from its predecessor P foxii in its neck and back bones.Analysis also shows both species have different pelvic structures and V barretti has a more blade-like spiked armour.Although both ankylosaurs originated from the same island, the researchers found they were not very closely related.In fact, they said, V barretti is mostly closely related to some Chinese ankylosaurs, suggesting these dinosaurs moved freely from Asia to Europe in the Early Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago).Mr Pond said: \"This is an important specimen because it sheds light on ankylosaur diversity within the Wessex formation and Early Cretaceous England.\"The researchers said rocks from the Wessex Formation and the Isle of Wight are \"hugely important\" in understanding more about how dinosaurs went extinct.An artist\u2019s impression of Vectipelta barretti (Stuart Pond/Natural History Musrum)Speaking of the honour, Prof Barrett said: \"I\u2019m flattered and absolutely delighted to have been recognised in this way, not least as the first paper I ever wrote was also on an armoured dinosaur in the NHM collections.Recommended\u2018Virgin\u2019 crocodile found to have made herself pregnantAll the UK strike dates confirmed for June 2023July dates for DWP payments, benefits, pensions and cost of living top ups\"I\u2019m sure that any physical resemblance is purely accidental.\"The findings are described in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice The head of new NATO member Finland\u2019s center-right conservative National Coalition Party is poised Friday to present a four-party agreement to form a governing coalition that includes a far-right anti-immigration party.NCP leader Petteri Orpo, who is expected to become the Nordic nation's next prime minister, said that four parties had agreed to form a government. Besides NCP, they are the Finns who came in second in the elections, the Christian Democrats and the Swedish People\u2019s Party of Finland. The parties hold 108 seats out of 200 in the Finnish parliament, Eduskunta.After weeks of sounding out all parties, Orpo said late Thursday that \u201cwe all realize that Finland is in a difficult situation, the economy and health care are in crisis, Russia\u2019s war is ongoing, inflation and interest rates have increased.\u201d\u201cThe problems are big, and we have to solve them together. The thoroughness of our program facilitates a faster transition,\u201d he said, according to Finnish daily Hufvudstadsbladet. He said Finland, a Nordic country of 5.5 million that shares a long land border with Russia, was \u201cin a really difficult situation.\u201d\u201cTherefore, we have had to look for savings measures everywhere, while at the same time we want to secure the basic service.

and essentials, typically by opting for cheaper alternative brands, according to the ONS.Further to that, 50 per cent pf shoppers say they are buying fewer items altogether, 67 per cent say they have

ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap (EPC) \u2013 was extended by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his Budget of 15 March for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.Now that the EPG has finally expired, consumers will once more be paying the EPC rate, although Ofgem has announced that will be \u00a32,074 from 1 July, a huge fall from the \u00a33,280 it was set at during the second quarter, from which households were shielded by the intervention of the government\u2019s overriding guarantee.That 17 per cent decrease reflects recent drops in wholesale energy prices \u2013 the amount energy firms pay for electricity and gas before

Conduct Authority study putting the total number of those up against it as high as 10 million.While inflation did finally drop down from 10.1 per cent to 8.7 per cent in May, the cost of goods in supermarket aisles and on high street shelves remains high as domestic finances continue to be stretched following a long winter of sky-high energy bills.The most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows food prices increasing at their fastest rate in almost 45 years for the year to April, with around 44 per cent of adults saying they have responded by spending less on the groceries and essentials, typically by opting for cheaper alternative brands, according to the ONS.Further to that, 50 per cent pf shoppers say they are buying fewer items altogether, 67 per cent say they have noticed an increase in their cost of living within the past month and 97 per cent say they have been impacted by rising grocery costs.Below, we look at what support is available to households this

They warned that decisions based on the forms, which must be filled out in English regardless of the asylum seeker\u2019s first language, could result in wrongful decisions and an increase in court appeals.The questionnaires are part of a wider asylum transformation programme, which started in 2021 and aims to speed up decisions and reduce costs.\u201cThe business case for the programme is based on a range of highly uncertain assumptions,\u201d NAO warned, saying the Home Office had made unevidenced predictions about the number of people claiming asylum, the number of caseworkers it could employ, their productivity and costs.The report said that the Home Office based its policy partly on an \u201cexpectation\u201d that by April this year, it would be deporting 250 people each month to Rwanda or other countries where their asylum claims could be processed. The number is currently zero.The total asylum backlog has hit a new record high (Home Office)The Home Office has given the whole asylum transformation programme an amber/red rating, meaning it was \u201cin doubt, with urgent action required and possible delays to delivery\u201d, the report said.An official review found there were \u201cunrealistic ambitions around accommodation and the productivity of caseworkers\u201d and issues with \u201cstaffing capacity in parts of the Home Office\u201d.Other issues include the absence of an operational asylum agreement with Rwanda or any other country, and the struggle to procure sufficient accommodation or advance controversial plans to use military bases and barges.Alex Fraser, the British Red Cross\u2019s director for refugee support, said people \u201ccannot get on with their lives until the government processes their asylum claims\u201d.\u201cWe see every day the toll this takes on their physical and mental health,\u201d he added: \u201cMore than 172,000 men, women and children living in limbo.\u201dThe Refugee Council spokesperson called for the government to set out a \u201cmore ambitious, fair, and workable approach to tackling the backlog\u201d instead of pushing through \u201cunworkable and expensive legislation\u201d.A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is working non-stop to reduce the asylum backlog and deliver cheaper, more orderly alternatives to hotel accommodation.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate payers\u201cAs NAO acknowledges, we have already doubled the number of caseworkers and cut the legacy backlog by 20 per cent, but we know more must be done to bring the asylum system back into balance.\u201cThe Illegal Migration Bill will stop the boats by detaining those who come to the UK illegally, and swiftly returning them to their home country or a safe third country.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c54f451ac33b09b54d66b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/belfast-robert-harris-ireland-james-naughtie-commonwealth-b2358520.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Belfast writer announced as winner of Walter Scott Prize 2023", "lead": "Lucy Caldwell scooped the \u00a325,000 prize for her novel These Days set during air strikes on Belfast during the Second World War.", "author": "Paul Cargill", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 04:17:19", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:28.019280", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T04:17:19+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/21/b891b24f6efc85254058c95a108d5e74Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTQ0OTE0-2.62328893.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He added: \u201cWhat I feel particularly sad about is the response he has made. \u201cI think if he had been more temperate in his response it would be easier for him to have a way back into active politics, but he\u2019s chosen to use phrases like \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 and \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and described the report as \u2018deranged\u2019.\u201dMaryam Zakir-Hussain16 June 2023 11:301686910498Johnson Partygate fallout leaves Sunak with a battle to hold Tories togetherThe fallout from a scathing report which found Boris Johnson lied to MPs over partygate has left Rishi Sunak with a battle to hold his warring Tory party together.The Commons will vote on Monday on the Privileges Committee\u2019s report, which recommended that Mr Johnson should have faced a 90-day suspension had he not already resigned in advance of its judgment and be banned from holding a pass to access Parliament.MPs will be given a free vote, but allies of Mr Johnson warned Tories they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.The sanctions proposed by the Tory-majority committee are expected to pass, with only a relatively small group of Johnson loyalists set to oppose the report\u2019s findings, although many more Conservatives could simply not turn up.Liz Truss, who spent 49 days as prime minister after succeeding Mr Johnson as Tory leader, told GB News that preventing him holding a parliamentary pass would be a \u201cvery harsh decision\u201d.But she is not expected to vote on the report, with a source close to the MP pointing to her speaking at an event in Dublin on Monday morning.Downing Street is yet to say whether the Prime Minister will vote.Maryam Zakir-Hussain16 June 2023 11:141686908750Boris Johnson \u2018considering running for London mayor\u2019Boris Johnson is said to be considering an audacious independent bid to become London mayor for a second time after his exit from parliament and dramatic fall from grace in the Tory party.The former prime minister is weighing up his next moves after sealed in a damning report that found he deliberately and repeatedly lied to the Commons over Partygate.Mr Johnson is thought to have agreed a \u201chigh six-figure sum\u201d with the Daily Mail to pen a weekly column, with the newspaper teasing that its \u201cmystery\u201d new writer will be \u201crequired reading in Westminster \u2013 and across the world!\u201dAnd the Financial Times has reported that Mr Johnson could look to get his old job back in City Hall by running as an independent candidate to defeat Labour mayor Sadiq Khan.Boris Johnson \u2018considering running for London mayor\u2019Former aide Guto Harri says bid to oust Sadiq Khan would be \u2018great idea\u2019 Maryam Zakir-Hussain16 June 2023 10:451686907853Rod Stewart explains why he\u2019s \u2018still a fan\u2019 of disgraced Boris JohnsonSir Rod Stewart has explained why he is \u201cstill a bit of a fan\u201d of Boris Johnson despite the former prime minister\u2019s very public exposure as a liar.The \u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy?\u201d singer shared his views on Mr Johnson after a report found that he repeatedly misled Parliament about gatherings in Downing Street during lockdown.The report concluded that Johnson was \u201ccomplicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation\u201d of the privileges committee.

So how did he manage to squander it? Andrew Grice explainsBoris Johnson always wanted to be a history maker. \u201cNo one puts up statues to journalists,\u201d he once said. He constantly invited comparisons with Winston Churchill, who led the UK through the Second World War.When Johnson wrote a book about his hero, The Churchill Factor, it was as much about his own ambition and desire to emulate him. Although Johnson\u2019s finest hour came during the next war on European soil \u2013 in the strong, decisive leadership he showed on Ukraine \u2013 it was eclipsed by a series of self-inflicted disasters that stemmed from the fatal flaws that made him unfit to be prime minister.Historic humiliation: the inside story of how Boris blew it | Andrew GriceWith a historic majority and the full support of his party, the former PM had all the political momentum in the world.

Sir Jake Berry, an ally of the former prime minister, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cFor the first time in my parliamentary career, I\u2019m afraid to talk about a report or the findings of a committee of Parliament, because they have threatened MPs that if they do so, they themselves will be subject to the sorts of sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on free speech. It\u2019s an absolute disgrace and it rather begs the question that if the committee is so certain and so happy with their findings, why are they trying to stop any debate on this, to gag MPs and prevent them talking about it.\u201d He said he was \u201calmost certain that Parliament will vote in favour\u201d of the report on Monday, but that he will \u201ccertainly be one of those in the no lobby opposing this report, because I think both the conclusions and, to some extent, the way the committee was made up in terms of this report are wrong.\u201dSir Jake Berry  (PA Wire)Maryam Zakir-Hussain16 June 2023 09:45\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a07Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "648c54f451ac33b09b54d66d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-mps-meg-hillier-northern-ireland-british-gas-b2358601.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Energy bill support took too long to reach consumers most in need, MPs conclude", "lead": "The Public Accounts Committee said about 1.7 million people were left waiting months for help with soaring energy costs.", "author": "Josie Clarke", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 04:12:59", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:28.510012", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T04:12:59+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/00/eacd6582a017086bd40e8cd3f87f38f7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTA2MTMz-2.71163097.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But despite winning the top podcast gong at People's Choice Award in Los Angeles just six months ago, it has not been renewed for a second series.Insiders were cited by the Wall Street Journal as claiming that the couple did not meet the productivity benchmark required to receive the full payout agreed in their 2020 deal.It comes after reports claimed the Sussexes planned to \u201cstop\u201d making tell-all Netflix documentaries, publishing memoirs and taking part in interviews discussing the royal family because there is \u201cnothing left to say\u201d, as the couple seeks to replace their \u201cera of visibility\u201d with a \u201cyear of reconciliation\u201d.RecommendedMeghan Markle \u2018signs with major Hollywood talent agency\u2019 joining Rihanna and The RockMeghan Markle wins Gracie Award for her Archetypes podcast\u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 boss addresses Meghan Markle\u2019s comments about showThe end of the couple\u2019s partnership was confirmed in a statement from Archewell Audio, the Sussexes\u2019 content creation label, and Spotify.It read: \u201cSpotify and Archewell Audio have mutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series we made together.\u201d The Independent has contacted representatives of the Sussexes for comment.The podcast saw Meghan speak to celebrities, historians and experts about the history of stereotypes levelled against women.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA damning report by parliament\u2019s privileges committee has concluded that Boris Johnson misled parliament and recommended that he should be barred from having a parliamentary security pass in future.The 106 page document, put together by the cross-party group of MPs with a Tory majority, is packed with detail and arguments. Here are the seven most damning sections:Boris Johnson misled the house on an unprecedented scaleThe prime minister misled parliament repeatedly the report says  (UK Parliament/AFP/Getty)RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was \u2018begging people for votes\u2019 in a \u2018demeaning\u2019 way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak \u2013 the last best option to take over from TrussThe report did not just conclude that the prime minister had misled parliament, but that he had done so on an unprecedented scale from the highest office in the land.\u201cThere is no precedent for a prime minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House,\" the MPs wrote. \u201cHe misled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public, and did so repeatedly.\u2022\u00a0Read our live coverage of reaction to the Partygate report here:\u00a0Ex-PM\u2019s final disgrace as lies finally laid bare\u201cHe declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the House was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the Committee in the presentation of his evidence.\u201dThe committee lists five different ways in which MPs were misled by the prime minister. Firstly, when he said that guidance was followed completely in No 10; secondly, when he failed to tell the house about his own knowledge of the gatherings.The third way the committee felt parliament had been mislead was that Mr Johnson claimed he had relied on \"repeated assurances that the rules had not been broken\" \u2013\u00a0in fact, these supposed assurances \"were not accurately represented\", the MPs found.He was also found to have misled the house by giving the impression he would have to wait for an investigation to conclude before he could answer questions \u2013 when in fact \"he had personal knowledge that he did not reveal\". The final occasion was when he \"purported to correct the record but instead continued to mislead the House and, by his continuing denials\".An attack on our democratic institutions Boris Johnson ahead of his evidence to the privileges committee (PA Wire)One of the areas the report focused on was the former prime minister\u2019s 1,000-word resignation statement in which he blasted the committee\u2019s investigation as a witch-hunt.It would be an understatement to say that this broadside made things worse for the prime minister, at least as far as the investigation was concerned. The Committee has characterised it as \u201can attack on our democratic institutions\u201d.The statement did not \u201cmerely criticise the fairness of the Committee\u2019s procedures\u201d, the MPs said \u2013 \u201che also attacks in very strong, indeed vitriolic, terms the integrity, honesty and honour of its members\u201d.It concluded: \u201cThis attack on a Committee carrying out its remit from the democratically elected House itself amounts to an attack on our democratic institutions.\u201cWe consider that these statements are completely unacceptable. In our view this conduct, together with the egregious breach of confidentiality, is a serious further contempt.\u201dJohnson previously dismissed \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 claimsThe prime minister accused the committee of being a kangaroo court in his resignation statement  (AP)The prime minister\u2019s characterisation of the committee investigation as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d was at odds with his earlier statements dismissing exactly those terms, the MPs noted.While speaking to the committee the former PM told MPs the he respected their work, and \u201cwhen pressed to do so, that he deprecated terms such as \u2018witch-hunt\u2019 and \u2018kangaroo court\u2019,\u201d the report says.\u201cNotwithstanding his protestations of respect for the Committee, and his earlier deprecation of language such as \u2018kangaroo courts\u2019 and \u2018witch-hunts\u2019, we note that in his statement of 9 June Mr Johnson himself used precisely those abusive terms to describe the Vommittee,\u201d the report said.\u201cThis leaves us in no doubt that he was insincere in his attempts to distance himself from the campaign of abuse and intimidation of Committee members. This in our view constitutes a further significant contempt.\u201dA cynical attempt to manipulate public opinion Boris Johnson giving evidence to the privileges committee in March (UK Parliament/PA)The committee was angry at the former prime minister\u2019s conduct even before his incendiary resignation statement \u2013 describing some of his comments in front of the cameras as a \u201ccynical attempt to manipulate member [MP] and public opinion\u201d.The MPs zero in on one episode during a committee hearing where Mr Johnson \u201caccused the Committee of suppressing evidence which would be helpful to him\u201d.\u201cWe invited him to identify any such evidence. The Committee obtained that evidence from the witnesses he had indicated, supported by statements of truth. In the event he placed no reliance on it,\u201d they said.\u201cThe clear implication is that there was nothing in the evidence and his criticism in public was a cynical attempt to manipulate member and public opinion.\u201dPresence of interior designer and Carrie at work meeting unexplainedThe prime minister\u2019s wife Carrie Johnson attended one of the \u2018essential\u2019 work meetings  (Getty Images)The committee goes into detail about what happened at each Downing Street gathering under Covid rules \u2013 but one passage stands out.It is about his interior designer, and his wife Carrie Johnson, who attended a birthday gathering for the then prime minister in the cabinet room in June 2020 while rules were in place prohibiting such parties.The prime minister\u2019s defence of this was that the gathering was a work meeting that was absolutely necessary and so within the rules at the time \u2013 but the committee disagreed. (As did the police, who give him a fixed penalty notice).\u201cMr Johnson was also unable to explain why he considered his wife and interior designer \u2018absolutely necessary participants\u2019 in a work-related meeting,\u201d it says of their presence.\u201cHis assertion that the Prime Minister\u2019s family are entitled to use every part of the building does not constitute an explanation.\u201dThere\u2019s no way Johnson could not have knownThe former PM explained the rules to the public on television regularly  (PA Archive)After going through the detail of the events, what Mr Johnson knew about them, and what he told parliament, the committee said there was simply no way the prime minister could not have known he was misleading MPs.As the \u201cmost prominent public promoter\u201d of the Covid-19 rules in daily press conference it was also simply not credible to believe that he was not aware of what was and was not allowed, they said.\u201cWe think it highly unlikely on the balance of probabilities that Mr Johnson, in the light of his cumulative direct personal experience of these events, and his familiarity with the Rules and Guidance as their most prominent public promoter, could have genuinely believed at the time of his statements to the House that the Rules or Guidance were being complied with,\u201d they concluded.\u201cWe think it just as unlikely he could have continued to believe this at the time of his evidence to our Committee. We conclude that when he told the House and this Committee that the Rules and Guidance were being complied with, his own knowledge was such that he deliberately misled the House and this Committee.\u201dFive different contempts of parliamentThe MPs want Johnson banned from having a parliamentary pass  (PA Archive)In total the committee says Boris Johnson is guilty of \u201crepeated contempts\u201d of parliament across five different thematic areas, which it bullet-pointed for clarity.Firstly, the prime minister \u201cdeliberately mislead the house\u201d (also in five different ways of). Secondly, was \u201cdeliberately misleading the committee\u201d during the course of its inquiry.The prime minister was also accused of \u201cbreaching confidence\u201d of the committee by sharing details of its investigation when he shout not have, and additionally of \u201cimpugning the Committee and thereby undermining the democratic process of the House\u201d with his resignation statement.RecommendedSunak set for two by-election tests on July 20Boris Johnson lashes out at Privileges Committee\u2019s \u2018deranged\u2019 findingsBoris Johnson the liar: How the former PM lied and lied again to the CommonsLastly, the committee found that he was \u201ccomplicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the Committee\u201d, thus undermining it as a democratic institution.This leaves us in no doubt that he was insincere in his attempts to distance himself from the campaign of abuse and intimidation of committee members.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWhen the long-awaited report into Boris Johnson\u2019s lockdown lies about Partygate was published on Thursday morning, his resignation as an MP appeared a lot less shocking.The former prime minister had seen an early copy of the report, which concluded he had lied to MPs on an \u201cunprecedented\u201d scale. Had Mr Johnson stayed on as the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he would have faced a 90-day suspension from parliament \u2013 more than enough to trigger a tough by-election in the constituency.The report also recommended Mr Johnson be stripped of a pass for former MPs, effectively barring him from the parliamentary estate.Read our live coverage of reaction to the Partygate report here: Ex-PM\u2019s final disgrace as lies finally laid bareBoris backers quickly rounded on the committee, blasting the \u201charshness\u201d of the findings, while Mr Johnson himself blasted what he called the \u201cderanged conclusion\u201d.

Insistent PM says \u2018all guidance was followed\u2019The former PM first misled the House of Commons on 1 December 2021. Asked at prime minister\u2019s questions (PMQs) by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer about a Christmas party in Downing Street on 18 December, 2020, Mr Johnson said \u201call guidance was followed\u201d in No 10.A combative Johnson in the Commons on 1 December 1, 2021 (UK Parliament/AFP)2. PM denies party took place in Downing Street The second time Mr Johnson misled parliament came a week later. Repeating his earlier claim, in response to a question from Labour MP Catherine West, Mr Johnson said \u201cthe guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\u201d.Ms West asked whether there was another party in Downing Street, on 13 November 2020, to which the then prime minister replied, \u201cno\u201d. An investigation by Partygate investigator Sue Gray confirmed both events had taken place.Johnson in parliament on 8 December, 2021: \u2018Whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.\u2019  (UK Parliament/AFP/Getty)3. Johnson hits back at Starmer\u2019s \u2018lying\u2019 accusations The next time Mr Johnson misled the house was on 12 January last year, when he came under fire from Sir Keir at another fiery session of PMQs.The Labour leader said the public saw Mr Johnson as \u201clying through his teeth\u201d about Downing Street parties, but the then PM hit back to claim \u201cthe events in question were within the guidance and were within the rules\u201d.The privileges committee found this also to have been misleading.Boris Johnson on 12 January 2022: \u2018I believe that the events in question were within the guidance and were within the rules.\u2019  (UK Parliament/AFP/Getty)4. PM \u2018corrects the record\u2019The fourth time Mr Johnson misled parliament was four months later, on 25 May, when he sought to row back on earlier assurances that \u201call rules and guidance had been followed\u201d in No 10.He told MPs at the time that \u201cit was what I believed to be true\u201d, while accepting that \u201cclearly this was not the case\u201d for some gatherings.\u201cI would like to correct the record \u2013 to take this opportunity, not in any sense to absolve myself of responsibility, which I take and have always taken, but simply to explain why I spoke as I did in this House,\u201d Mr Johnson said.Even in rowing back on his earlier remarks the privileges committee found him to have been misleading MPs.

Johnson was \u2018disingenuous\u2019 with MPsAs well as the four instances above, MPs on the committee concluded Mr Johnson misled the house by failing to tell MPs about his own knowledge of rule-breaking parties in Downing Street.The excoriating report goes on to accuse Mr Johnson of being \u201cdisingenuous with the committee\u201d, making \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d statements about the inquiry and an \u201cegregious breach of confidentiality\u201d of the process.Angela Rayner says Boris Johnson is \u2018not only a law breaker but a liar, not fit for public office\u2019  (PA)Labour said the committee\u2019s report was \u201cdamning\u201d and deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson was acting like a \u201cpound shop Donald Trump\u201d.She said: \u201cBoris Johnson is not only a law breaker but a liar, and he is not fit for public office.

In fact, a senior aide had warned him against it.Some of Mr Johnson\u2019s denials were \u201cso disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead\u201d, the committee said.MPs also considered Mr Johnson\u2019s tirade as he quit as an MP, in which he called the committee a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, to be a further instance of contempt, pushing up his recommended suspension to 90 days \u2013 nearly twice as long as Liz Truss spent in office as prime minister.Mr Johnson dismissed their findings as \u201ccomplete tripe\u201d. Calling it a \u201cdreadful day for democracy\u201d, he took aim at the Labour committee chair, saying the \u201cterrible truth is that it is not I who has twisted the truth to suit my purposes \u2013 it is Harriet Harman and her committee\u201d.Boris Johnson has dismissed the report as \u2018complete tripe\u2019  (Getty)Nadine Dorries and a small group of fellow Johnson allies vowed to vote against the \u201cvindicative\u201d report \u2013 and warned that those who endorse it could be \u201cgiven the boot\u201d by angry grassroots Tory members.But allies of Rishi Sunak told The Independent that Ms Dorries was \u201coff her rocker\u201d and urged colleagues to \u201cshow backbone\u201d when the time came to vote on whether to approve the recommendations of the cross-party report.Many Conservatives are expected to be absent rather than risk the ire of their constituents, but the free vote is expected to pass with the support of Labour and the SNP.Senior Tories said Mr Johnson\u2019s political career was now \u201cfinished\u201d, with defence committee chair Tobias Ellwood remarking that support among the Tory base was \u201cchanging before our very eyes\u201d into \u201cdisappointment and anger\u201d.Erstwhile deputy leader of the Conservatives Michael Heseltine said Mr Johnson had been shown to have \u201ctold a pack of lies\u201d, while former attorney general Dominic Grieve said \u201cI hope he\u2019s gone for good.\u201dMax Hastings, once Mr Johnson\u2019s boss at The Daily Telegraph, said the former PM was doing \u201cwhat the dog does against the lamp post\u201d.Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak at the June 2020 gathering that saw both of them fined  (Cabinet Office/PA)Labour urged Mr Sunak to make sure Mr Johnson \u201cpays back every penny\u201d of the taxpayer-funded legal support, while the Liberal Democrats called on Mr Sunak to strip Mr Johnson of the \u00a3115,000 annual allowance available to former prime ministers.Mr Johnson is now also facing calls to stand down from the Privy Council, a select group of MPs and other figures that advises the monarch.Senior Labour MP Chris Bryant told The Independent: \u201cHe\u2019s a disgraced former prime minister. You really wouldn\u2019t normally want a disgraced former minister carrying on in the Privy Council.\u201dNo 10 said there are no plans to tear up Mr Johnson\u2019s honours list, or to ask him to pay back taxpayer-funded legal support. Mr Sunak\u2019s spokesperson also made clear that Mr Johnson would not lose access to the \u00a3115,000 annual funding provided to former prime ministers.Nadine Dorries warned Tory MPs against approving the recommendations of the report  (Getty)Downing Street also rejected claims by Ms Dorries that members of the committee were offered inducements, such as \u201cgongs\u201d or safe seats, to reach their conclusion.Ms Dorries said that Tory MPs who vote to approve the report might face deselection. \u201cAny Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by\u00a0members and the public,\u201d she said. \u201cDeselections may follow.

In additional evidence passed to the group, one Downing Street official said staff were warned to be \u201cmindful\u201d of cameras but that compliance was \u201ca pantomime\u201d \u2013 revealing that social distancing and mask-wearing were not enforced, and that \u201cwine-time Fridays\u201d continued.Mr Johnson was \u201cunable to explain\u201d why he considered his wife Carrie Johnson and the couple\u2019s interior designer \u201cabsolutely necessary participants in a work-related meeting\u201d when they attended the June 2020 birthday party, the committee said.The former PM had claimed that he felt the leaving party for the former No 10 director of communications Lee Cain was necessary for staff morale. But the committee said morale did not provide \u201ca licence for Mr Johnson\u2019s conveniently flexible interpretation of the rules\u201d.The report also warned Mr Johnson that he could be found guilty of further contempt over a \u201cstatement of truth\u201d he provided in reference to 16 events that took place at Chequers, after a dossier of possible rule-breaches was handed to police.The committee also warned supporters of Mr Johnson that it intended to make a \u201cspecial report\u201d to the Commons regarding what it called a sustained attempt to \u201cundermine\u201d the credibility of its members.RecommendedCharlotte Owen: Allies rally around Boris Johnson aide handed youngest life peerBoris Johnson in desperate last-ditch ruse to derail Partygate verdictThe\u00a0report revealed that the committee had split over the question of whether Mr Johnson should be permanently expelled from the Commons.

But the committee said morale did not provide \u201ca licence for Mr Johnson\u2019s conveniently flexible interpretation of the rules\u201d.The report also warned Mr Johnson that he could be found guilty of further contempt over a \u201cstatement of truth\u201d he provided in reference to 16 events that took place at Chequers, after a dossier of possible rule-breaches was handed to police.The committee also warned supporters of Mr Johnson that it intended to make a \u201cspecial report\u201d to the Commons regarding what it called a sustained attempt to \u201cundermine\u201d the credibility of its members.RecommendedCharlotte Owen: Allies rally around Boris Johnson aide handed youngest life peerBoris Johnson in desperate last-ditch ruse to derail Partygate verdictThe\u00a0report revealed that the committee had split over the question of whether Mr Johnson should be permanently expelled from the Commons.

It decides to pile even more pressure onto our sector, once again making a huge promise to families that we are expected to deliver.\u201cAnd what\u2019s even more frustrating is that this promise has absolutely nothing to do with supporting early learning or child development or improving children\u2019s life chances.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMr Leitch, whose EYA represents about 14,000 childcare providers, accused ministers of standing back and rolling over as the economy was prioritised over quality care.He said: \u201cFor all the talk of the mums who can go back to work as a result of the new offer, and the boost it will give to the economy, there was absolutely no mention of quality.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBetting company Betfair has admitted it could have done more to protect a father-of-two who took his own life while suffering a \u201cpervasive\u201d gambling addiction, an inquest has heard.Luke Ashton died at the age of 40 on April 22 2021, leaving behind a wife and two children, after online gambling \u201cconsumed\u201d him and saw him lose \u00a35,000 in one month alone just before he took his own life.A hearing at the coroner\u2019s office for Leicester and South Leicestershire on Wednesday was told Mr Ashton had previously gambled up to 100 times a day, including early in the morning and late at night when his wife Annie was in bed.In 2019, he had fallen into debt after taking out \u00a318,000 in different loans and gambled in a bid to try and clear what he owed.Although the debts were cleared relatively quickly through the sale of their home, Mr Ashton\u2019s gambling on a number of different websites increased, spiking in March 2021, just before he took his own life.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\n\nLooking at Luke's activity in March 2021, it does look like we should\u2019ve done more. Looking at the tragic outcome we have here, we would have loved to have done moreRichard Clarke, Betfair owner FlutterOne of the main operators used by Mr Ashton since 2012, Betfair, which is owned by Flutter UK & Ireland, has been named an \u201cinterested person\u201d in the inquest \u2013 the first time a gambling company has been involved in such proceedings.On the second day of the inquest, Richard Clarke, managing director at Flutter with responsibilities for customer experience and customer relations, admitted their systems at the time did not flag Mr Ashton as an at-risk gambler.Speaking of the model the company uses to detect the levels of risk among their customers, Mr Clarke told the inquest how the \u201cmachine learning algorithm\u201d tracks 277 separate pieces of customer data each day.He said the model is designed to detect behaviour among customers that is similar to those who have, in the past, decided to \u201cself-exclude\u201d themselves from using the Betfair website \u2013 essentially locking their account for a minimum period of six months so they cannot access it to give themselves a \u201cbreak\u201d.The model analyses data such as the amount of money the customer is spending and whether there are any spikes in their activity.Mr Clarke admitted their model did not, in 2021, detect Mr Ashton, who had himself decided to \u201cself-exclude\u201d himself on occasions in 2013, 2014 and 2016, as being high risk.If he had been flagged as being at-risk, a number of actions could have been taken, including a phone conversation between Betfair and the customer to discuss gambling behaviour or even a permanent ban on an account.While confident the company complied with the regulatory framework in place at the time, Mr Clarke said: \u201cLooking at Luke\u2019s activity in March 2021, it does look like we should\u2019ve done more. Looking at the tragic outcome we have here, we would have loved to have done more.\u201cThings have changed a lot since then.\u201dLooking at Mr Ashton\u2019s activity on his Betfair account, the court heard how he almost exclusively used their Exchange platform, which Mr Clarke said was generally more low risk and used mostly by \u201csophisticated and highly-skilled\u201d customers.He had mostly placed bets on horseracing and greyhound racing both in the UK and overseas.\n\nSending emails were the only things you did in Luke\u2019s case. Your model missed exactly what it was supposed to identifyBarrister Jesse NichollsDespite agreeing with barrister Jesse Nicholls, who is representing the Ashton family at the inquest, that Betfair could have done more to protect Mr Ashton from harm, he pointed out his activity on the site was \u201cfairly consistent\u201d until it started to spike in early 2021, but that he was not flagged as meeting the high-risk threshold at the time.The court heard how Mr Ashton was averaging a maximum of 55 bets per day in January 2019, with March 2021 being the peak of his activity with 1,229 bets placed. On one day alone that month, he deposited \u00a32,500.Mr Clarke said, however, that looking at the data from some of their busiest days in March 2021, there were around 10,000 customers who were placing more bets than Mr Ashton was.He added it is not unusual to see customers spending more money in March compared to other months because that is when horseracing season starts.However, a customer in Mr Ashton\u2019s circumstances would not now be able to repeat the same pattern of betting due to a number of changes that have been implemented since 2021.A strict monthly net deposit limit is imposed on every customer who returns from self-exclusion as part of a detailed phone-based assessment and the limit cannot be changed by them.Financial vulnerability checks have also been put in place using a leading third-party credit reference agency to check for a history of bankruptcy, county court judgements, short-term loans and other markers of financial vulnerability.They have introduced a mandatory \u00a3500 per month deposit limit for all under-25s because the age group is statistically more vulnerable, and also introduced a \u00a310 maximum stake limit on online slot games.Mr Nicholls, for the Ashton family, said it was their view that Betfair should have enforced an exclusion on Mr Ashton\u2019s account.He said: \u201cSending emails were the only things you did in Luke\u2019s case.

Some people are ruthless.\u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for that shit.\u201dAt one point Chapman talked about having a panic attack but then said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about the murder, they haven\u2019t got anything on me\u201d, Pc Gates said.The officer said Chapman told him he had seen footage on the news of the shooting and it sounded like an automatic gun firing 13 shots, rather than six or seven as had been reported in the newspapers.Pc Gates also told the court Chapman said he \u201cwasn\u2019t fussed\u201d about being in the custody suite for murder but \u201cmore about newspaper articles naming and shaming him\u201d.Chapman said he had been in the area since the day before to have his \u201cbaby\u2019s birthday\u201d before handing himself in, Pc Gates said.The court has heard he was staying at Penllwyn Lodges, where a four-night stay had been booked for him with a \u201cprosecco and petals\u201d package.The defendant is also said to have told the constable he was a \u201cchanged person\u201d.Earlier on Thursday, the court was shown police body-worn camera footage showing witness Jaime Stanton describing the gunman, who opened fire shortly before midnight on December 24.She said: \u201cIt was a targeted attack because he looked round the corner to see who was there and he turned round.\u201cHe turned round and he looked at me dead in the eyes.\u201cI wanted to say to the people that were there \u2018watch out\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t because he would have just shot me. It all happened so quick. He just went \u2018bang, bang, bang\u2019.\u201dShe added: \u201cI thought he was just going to batter them, I didn\u2019t think he had a gun.\u201dChapman denies the murder of Ms Edwards, two counts of attempted murder and three counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.He also denies possession of a Skorpion sub-machine gun with intent to endanger life and possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life.Co-defendant Thomas Waring, 20, of Private Drive, Barnston, Wirral, denies possessing a prohibited weapon and assisting an offender by helping Chapman to dispose of the car.The trial will continue on Monday."}, {"_id": "648c54fb51ac33b09b54d68f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rishi-sunak-priti-patel-government-dame-conservative-b2358396.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ex-home secretary fears Government \u2018overpromising\u2019 with stop the boats policy", "lead": "Dame Priti Patel acknowledged there is no single solution but suggested ministers need to go further.", "author": "Richard Wheeler", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:41:58", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:35.077404", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T16:41:58+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/18/376a5f14bd8613e7aeb133ec00178f73Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTMzMjQ2-2.72341972.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

And we put in place a number of further measures recently.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are spending a great deal of money on things like hotels, primarily, to be honest to assist young men who have been in a place of safety like France, to come to the United Kingdom to continue their lives here.\u201cThose resources could be used far better upstream to support people in and around conflict zones whether that\u2019s through international organisations like the UNHCR or otherwise.\u201dOutside of Parliament, Mr Sunak acknowledged there is \u201clots of work to do\u201d to reduce asylum claim numbers as he joined immigration enforcement officers on a raid in north west London.Mr Sunak said the raids are an \u201cimportant strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration\u201d, noting resources have been increased for immigration enforcement.He added: \u201cBut we\u2019re not complacent.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of work to do, which is why it\u2019s so important that we pass our Bill through Parliament, our Stop The Boats Bill, which will mean that if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay.\u201cWe will be able to detain you and then swiftly remove you.\u201dRecommendedDowning Street gatherings: What did Privileges Committee say about each event?Double child killer Colin Pitchfork can be released from prison \u2013 Parole BoardTory infighting looms as MPs prepare to vote on Boris Johnson reportMs Braverman also met French interior minister Gerald Darmanin in London.The pair discussed UK-French co-ordination on topics including joint work tackling illegal migration and stopping the boats in the Channel."}, {"_id": "648c54fb51ac33b09b54d690", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/world-health-organisation-government-covid-scotland-england-b2358397.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Evaluation of UK\u2019s pandemic preparedness was \u2018simply wrong\u2019, expert says", "lead": "The World Health Organisation carried out a joint external evaluation of the UK\u2019s ability to cope with public health risks prior to the pandemic.", "author": "Storm Newton", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:40:37", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:35.266546", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T16:40:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/18/e61f162ca3f52700d02aaaf7fd223865Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2OTI1MzI0-2.64463514.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn evaluation of Britain\u2019s preparedness for a major public health risk made prior to the pandemic was \u201csimply wrong\u201d, an expert has told the Covid-19 Inquiry.Professor David Alexander, who specialises in risk and disaster reduction, was giving evidence at the probe on Thursday alongside civil servant Bruce Mann.The World Health Organisation (WHO) carries out joint external evaluations (JEEs) in collaboration with countries to assess their capacity to prevent, detect\u00a0and respond to public health emergencies.\n\nI think there are various criticisms that can be - and have been - levelled against the methodology used in the UKProfessor David AlexanderLead counsel Hugo Keith KC said the UK \u201cdid well\u201d in a JEE prior to the pandemic but\u00a0added: \u201cThe evidence may show that in reality we didn\u2019t do well.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveProfessor Alexander said: \u201cIt does appear that at the time of the pandemic that the WHO evaluation of Britain\u2019s ability to cope with a pandemic was simply wrong.\u201cIt didn\u2019t match up to the results that came out in comparing the British response to that of other countries or comparable countries.\u201dThursday was the third day of public hearings in the first module of the inquiry, which is expected to go on until July 20.Professor Alexander also said there are \u201cproblems\u201d with the methodology used when planning for risks in the UK.He added: \u201cI think there are various criticisms that can be \u2013 and have been \u2013 levelled against the methodology used in the UK.\n\nA plan for a severe pandemic has a lot of very common, very predictable features which ought to be identified and planned for specificallyCivil servant Bruce Mann\u201cOne of the problems is that there is a failure in the scenarios to be sufficiently inclusive. There is serious accuracy but at the same time there is a failure to consider how things might develop in specific, particular cases. But it can be done.\u201cOne problem with the methodology that is used in Britain is that it is utterly specific. In other words, there is a scenario for a pandemic. I believe the correct methodology would be to have an envelope \u2013 or suite \u2013 of scenarios; this is the best case, this is the worst case, this is the median case.\u201cWhat instead we have is an algorithm that gives us exact predictions, such as 48,324 deaths will occur.\u201cThis, of course, is nonsense. It is indicative and in that sense it is helpful but I think we need a much broader way of describing our scenario.\u201dMr Mann added: \u201cThere is a greater degree of specificity that can be done. The only thing that needs to be avoided is that there are 1,000 plans. There has to be some kind of aggregation to make the task manageable.\u201cA plan for a severe pandemic has a lot of very common, very predictable features which ought to be identified and planned for specifically.\u201dBoth experts were asked about the findings of their report into pandemic preparedness.\n\nThere are most definitely lessons to be learned from Covid-19, as there are from previous eventsProf AlexanderThey told the inquiry they had concluded that preparedness for an influenza pandemic in England, and for areas that were UK-wide, was \u201cpoor\u201d.But they indicated that the response could have been stronger in Scotland and, especially, Wales and Northern Ireland.Looking at the key components necessary for a pandemic response, Mr Mann found that they \u201cwere poor or non-existent\u201d.He said: \u201cAnd therefore it led to my conclusion that the overall preparedness of the pandemic was inadequate.\u201dHe added that the pandemic response strategies put in place by the UK Government had not been adequately tested before the Covid-19 outbreak.The report also referred to the novel disease preparedness as being \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d, the inquiry heard.Mr Mann also said that it was clear from the Hine review into swine flu in 2010 that the health and social care sectors were liable to be overwhelmed.He explained: \u201cThat was the clear advice not only from the Hine review in 2010, it appears on the Cygnus report \u2013 the report on Exercise Cygnus, it appears in officials\u2019 advice to ministers \u2026 that they would be overwhelmed, which has to raise serious questions about whether the plan would have worked.\u201d\n\nThe measure of a lesson learned is in fact in measurable positive changeProf Alexander Speaking earlier, Prof Alexander also told the inquiry there were \u201cdefinitely\u201d lessons to be learned from the pandemic.He said: \u201cThe measure of a lesson learned is in fact in measurable positive change.\u201cThere are most definitely lessons to be learned from Covid-19, as there are from previous events.\u201dHe said one example of this is the 2005 London bombings, where there was a need for greater co-ordination between the emergency services, particularly in the declaration of a major incident.Prof Alexander said: \u201cTwelve years later, in the Manchester arena bombing, there was exactly the same problem, which implies that in the 12 years that intervened, that particular lesson \u2013 which is extremely important in terms of saving lives \u2013 had not been learned.\u201dBoth experts further told the inquiry there was a need for the Government to re-write its strategy.Asked by Mr Keith if the strategy needs a radical rewrite, they both said: \u201cYes.\u201dMr Mann said there are a number of issues with the UK Government Resilience Framework published in December 2022.\n\nThere are a lot of good ideas in (the UK Government Resilience Framework) that are not brought together in a single, unified roadmapMr MannHe said it started in the \u201cwrong place\u201d, adding: \u201cIt sets out a range of measures and implies if those measures are taken we will have a sufficiently adequate system to deal with the future we face.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that to be the case. I think the document should have started in a different place.\u201cWhat do we need first to deal with catastrophic emergencies? Secondly, actually debate on international best practice, and I think it falls short in both of those areas.\u201cSecond, it\u2019s too slow. It suggests a range of measures for implementation in the period of 2025 to 2030.\u201cI think all of those can be done sooner and ideally should be done sooner.\u201cThird, it is not a strategy \u2013 it was advertised as a strategy.RecommendedDowning Street gatherings: What did Privileges Committee say about each event?Double child killer Colin Pitchfork can be released from prison \u2013 Parole BoardTory infighting looms as MPs prepare to vote on Boris Johnson report\u201cIt does not set out: \u2018This is where we\u2019d like to get to, this is how we will know we\u2019ll get there and these are the steps we\u2019ll take on the way\u2019.\u201cThere are a lot of good ideas in there that are not brought together in a single, unified roadmap.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c54fb51ac33b09b54d691", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/glenda-jackson-michael-caine-blackheath-labour-hampstead-b2358398.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Glenda Jackson hailed \u2018one of our greatest movie actresses\u2019 after death aged 87", "lead": "The worlds of showbiz and politics have remembered the veteran actress turned MP.", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:32:56", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:35.452188", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T16:32:56+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/18/02-bdaa3b6433f04181b202ebb01238e3bc.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn Essex council must \u201cundertake a significant and rapid reduction in the scope of local services\u201d as a result of risky investments, a Government-commissioned report has warned.Councillors and senior officers at Conservative-led Thurrock council are said to have tried to conceal \u201cbad news\u201d and avoid public scrutiny over its strategy, giving rise to \u201ca culture of insularity and complacency\u201d.A report by Essex County Council, which was first appointed to act as commissioner for Thurrock as part of government intervention in 2022, detailed a catalogue of failings which led to a substantial loss of public money.Thurrock issued a section 114 notice declaring effective bankruptcy in December 2022 caused by serious flaws in delivering its investment strategy and major infrastructure and regeneration projects.The report said a \u201cpattern of failure\u201d and the council\u2019s response was enabled by \u201cdereliction in political and managerial leadership, inadequate governance arrangements and serious weaknesses in internal control\u201d.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThese factors created \u201ca culture of insularity and complacency\u201d, with internal challenge discouraged and external criticism \u201croutinely dismissed\u201d.Commissioners added that Thurrock\u2019s lack of openness and transparency placed the council in a state of \u201cunconscious incompetence\u201d which undermined its ability to improve.The report, which was finalised in May, said: \u201cThe scale of the financial challenge now facing the council means it is inevitable that, in addition to making extensive efficiency savings, the council will have to undertake a significant and rapid reduction in the scope of local services.\u201cMany services, which have been relatively well funded over the past decade may, as a consequence, be equipped to do little more than the statutory minimum for the foreseeable future.\u201dIt added Thurrock\u2019s challenges \u201cstem from a series of self-sustaining, systemic weaknesses which have allowed for repeated failure over many years\u201d.Commissioners said the council\u2019s poor performance on delivering major projects meant recovery would be \u201ca hugely difficult task\u201d, with a risk of \u201cserious operational failures\u201d without effective management.The report added Communities Secretary Michael Gove has indicated he is \u201cminded\u201d to issue further directions to the council.Both Thurrock\u2019s former chief executive, Lyn Carpenter, and finance director, Sean Clark, resigned after commissioners were appointed.The report found Mr Clark made investments of over \u00a3500 million \u201cwithout meaningful reference to elected members\u201d.This was on the basis that individual transactions were below \u00a310 million in value or were with organisations that the council had already worked alongside.\u201cUnbeknown to anyone beyond the [finance director] and staff in the treasury management function, the council built up substantial investments with particular organisations without any member or executive oversight,\u201d commissioners added.In a written statement, local government minister Lee Rowley said the \u201cbroken systems\u201d within the council are \u201cin urgent need of reform and improvement\u201d.He added: \u201cThe report clearly sets out the events which led to the collapse of the council\u2019s commercial investment strategy last year, after that strategy was allowed to operate in an environment with wholly inadequate scrutiny and governance arrangements.\u201cThat failure has had profound consequences for the Council\u2019s financial sustainability, and the inspection report confirms that Thurrock is unable to balance its budget without exceptional financial support from Government, which has now been granted in principle for the financial year 2022/23.\u201dAmong a series of recommendations, commissioners said the council must expand the scope of its improvement and recovery plan and bolster leadership and councillor development to improve capacity.It added the council should move from electing a third of members at elections to an \u201call-out\u201d voting system to instil political stability.The report details a steady growth in Thurrock\u2019s investments from 2017.By early 2020, the value of the investments was approaching \u00a31 billion, with plans to increase this to \u00a32 billion in further years.Thurrock\u2019s new Conservative leader Andrew Jeffries apologised for the failings under the previous leadership and pledged mistakes would not be repeated.He said: \u201cThere is no escaping the fact that councillors from across the council must accept responsibility for what has happened, and we must work collaboratively to put things right.\u201cWe have a duty to both residents and the borough that we too call home.

The answer has to be yes.\u201cThe question is, \u2018How do we get the Government to shift their position?\u2019 which is so unreasonable at the moment.\u201cAnd if it takes co-ordination of action to do that then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201dDr Runswick said co-ordinated action could include consecutive strikes from juniors and consultants, with junior doctors taking action before or after any potential consultant walkout.She said: \u201cThere is remarkable understanding from patients and the public on picket lines that if we\u2026 if we don\u2019t turn this trend around, waiting lists will only go up and people who are in hospital receiving urgent care will get worse care slower.\u201cSo I think there is widespread understanding of the importance of this dispute.\u201dMany key NHS figures ducked out of the NHS\u2019s annual meeting to manage the strike\u2019s fallout.NHS England boss Amanda Pritchard said the strike is a \u201cserious risk to patient safety\u201d and industrial action \u201ccreates risk and upheaval\u201d.She said tens of thousands of appointments will be affected.Speaking before leaving the conference to co-ordinate the strike response from the London office, she told delegates on Wednesday: \u201cWe must prioritise the management of what is a serious business continuity incident and therefore a serious risk to patient safety.\u201d\n\nSo while the NHS will of course expertly manage the incident to the best of our ability, I know we all hope for a resolution soonNHS England boss Amanda PritchardShe added: \u201cAs much as we learn from managing each action every time it happens, it creates risk and upheaval and distracts from our priorities, particularly elective recovery.\u201cOver half a million appointments have already had to be rescheduled. Many of those people will have been waiting months.\u201cIt\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see tens of thousands more affected this week.\u201cSo while the NHS will of course expertly manage the incident to the best of our ability, I know we all hope for a resolution soon.\u201dAsked about Ms Pritchard\u2019s comments, Dr Trivedi told PA: \u201cI\u2019m happy to have a chat with her and explore with those risks that she thinks that exist there.\u201cLooking at the evidence from the first and second round of strikes is that patient safety was maintained and wasn\u2019t put at risk.\u201cSo I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to suggest that, from the information that I\u2019ve seen, that that has changed with our third round of action.\u201dMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cThe suggestion that junior doctors could strike regularly over consecutive days every month for a year or more will be extremely worrying to healthcare leaders.\n\nWe know health services are already struggling with severe staff shortages in many areas, and with the NHS carrying over 120,000 vacancies, further industrial action will very likely leave one of the Prime Minister's key missions, that of reducing waiting lists, at riskNHS Confederation boss Matthew Taylor\u201cIf further industrial action is also co-ordinated with strikes by consultant doctors, should they announce they have a mandate, then patient safety will be put at further risk.\u201cWe know health services are already struggling with severe staff shortages in many areas, and with the NHS carrying over 120,000 vacancies, further industrial action will very likely leave one of the Prime Minister\u2019s key missions, that of reducing waiting lists, at risk.\u201cHealthcare leaders and their staff have moved mountains and made great strides in bringing down waiting lists, especially for those patients waiting the longest.\u201cHowever, a drawn out and protracted series of doctors strikes over the next 12 months and beyond risks this progress being eroded, and NHS leaders must not be blamed if targets are missed.\u201dMr Barclay said it was in his own \u201cinterests\u201d for the dispute to come to a resolution and he stands ready for \u201cfurther discussions\u201d with junior doctors.He told delegates at the conference: \u201cIt\u2019s in my interest because of the five priorities that the Prime Minister has set out the one that sits with me \u2013 cutting the waiting times \u2013 obviously relies on us moving forward in terms of working closely with our clinicians, working effectively and how we address that.\u201cIn terms of the junior doctors, we had three weeks of intensive discussions, we responded constructively to their request \u2013 which was to bring in a very experienced intermediary \u2013 but to date we haven\u2019t seen any movement at all from the 35% demand that the junior doctors have made.\u201cI think there needs to be movement on both sides.\u201cWe\u2019ve set out as part of our discussions both a recognition of the offer that we\u2019ve made into a lump sum, but our desire to work on a wider package with junior doctors.\u201cWhen I think of the other challenges that Government has, and when we reach these decisions on a cross-government basis: how we tackle the challenge on inflation; how we cut the debt, how we grow the economy, and we have got to balance that with the needs of the NHS.\u201cWithin the NHS, we need to think not just the importance of pay, but the importance of the numbers, we also need to think about the importance of investing in the NHS estate.RecommendedDowning Street gatherings: What did Privileges Committee say about each event?Double child killer Colin Pitchfork can be released from prison \u2013 Parole BoardTory infighting looms as MPs prepare to vote on Boris Johnson report\u201cThen we also need to invest in tech.\u201cSo, there\u2019s a combination of things, but we want to work constructively and stand ready to have further discussions.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c54fc51ac33b09b54d697", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/south-wales-aberdare-south-wales-police-smoke-bridgend-b2358402.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Firefighters tackle wildfires across South Wales as service is \u2018inundated\u2019", "lead": "One fire on the Rhigos Mountain has spread to an area the size of almost 300 football fields.", "author": "Bronwen Weatherby", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:08:26", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:36.434388", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T16:08:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/18/15163919-8b5b837b-f435-4416-b71e-f9e8e4ca772d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

follow liveThe group said 85% of the emissions reductions needed in the period up to 2032 \u2013 known as the fifth carbon budget period \u2013 are covered by the new plans.Of that, only 35% of emissions cuts are covered by confirmed policies while 21% are covered by policy promises, their analysis suggests.Almost a third \u2013 29% \u2013 of reductions needed are covered by policies currently under consultation, the group said.It is now urging ministers to move the key policies through the consultation stage \u201cquickly and effectively\u201d, especially in light of the upcoming general election expected next year.The think tank considers policy to be under consultation until the Government confirms a timeline for implementation or an act of parliament receives royal assent.It cited political turmoil and the reorganisation of government departments responsible for decarbonisation as factors that have contributed to consultations being frequently delayed or curtailed.Ruth Chambers, senior fellow and legislative expert at Green Alliance, said the plans have also been drawn up without the input of experts.\n\nWe have a dynamic long-term plan for a transition that will take place over the next 14 years and many of the proposals and policies will be phased in over this time frameGovernment spokesperson\u201cPolicies which are developed with consultation are likely to be more effective: saving time and money, reducing legal risk and increasing impact,\u201d she said.\u201cHowever, there is an increasing tendency towards \u2018black box\u2019 policy making, where experts, businesses and the public are excluded or opportunities to engage are severely curtailed.\u201cThe Government\u2019s recent environmental improvement plan is one example, where milestones to guide Government action were drawn up without the input of groups whose help would be integral to meeting them.\u201dAmong those currently under consultation is the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate, which would deliver the largest emissions savings of any proposed government policy.Green Alliance said the final consultation on the mandate, which was announced on March 30, has been repeatedly delayed, making its planned introduction in January 2024 uncertain.The group also said the clean heat market mechanism \u2013 also known as the \u201cheat pump mandate\u201d \u2013 is another policy not progressing forward fast enough after the most recent consultation closed on June 8.\n\nThe Government\u2019s recent environmental improvement plan is one example, where milestones to guide Government action were drawn up without the input of groups whose help would be integral to meeting themRuth Chambers, Green AllianceOverall, the think tank\u2019s analysis suggests the Government\u2019s plans have gone backwards as the Net Zero Strategy covered 87% of emission reductions needed, compared to the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan, which covers 85%.\u201cThere are only so many times the UK can claim climate leadership while falling short of its own targets,\u201d Sophie O\u2019Connell, policy adviser at Green Alliance, said.\u201cA clear and transparent plan for how we\u2019ll reduce emissions will allow people and industries to prepare for the changes ahead.\u201dA Government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a dynamic long-term plan for a transition that will take place over the next 14 years and many of the proposals and policies will be phased in over this time frame.RecommendedGreenpeace unveils short film with Will Poulter and cover of Fleetwood Mac songHazel dormice reintroduced into Derbyshire woodlandRising pressures on water will see people pay more for less, says EA chair\u201cGiven our success in decarbonisation to date we are confident in our approach.\u201cHowever, this plan does not intend to predict the exact shape of the British economy in 2037 or later, and nor should it.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c54fd51ac33b09b54d69c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/national-trust-derbyshire-britain-red-list-derby-b2358599.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hazel dormice reintroduced into Derbyshire woodland", "lead": "Nearly 40 of the furry rodents are being slowly released into scrub where they will feed on fruit, nuts and insects.", "author": "Danny Halpin", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:21:13", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:37.466094", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T10:21:13+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/00/15172005-77e15f99-f9e3-4149-ae31-69a4b2c7f9dc.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA group of 38 hazel dormice are being reintroduced into a Derbyshire woodland as conservationists hope to turn around the decline of the species.The population in Britain has fallen by around half since 2000 and they are now classed as vulnerable on the Red List for Britain\u2019s mammals.Volunteers from the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), along with ZSL, Paignton Zoo and other partners, are slowly releasing the tiny creatures into woodland owned by the National Trust.They have just spent eight weeks in quarantine and have now been paired up to spend a further 10 days in a wooden bird house-like box inside a cage attached to a tree while they acclimatise to their environment.Ian White, dormouse and training officer at PTES, said: \u201cThey\u2019ll be put in the cages, the cages are then sealed up and the dormice are left there for about 10 days just to become used to the sight and sound of their new home.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cAnd then after 10 days, a small opening will be made in the cages and then the dormice are free to come and go.\u201cDormice are relatively sedentary, they don\u2019t move very far, so an area equivalent to about half a football pitch will take one dormouse.\u201dHe said they have been fed on a diet of corn, fruit and bird feed while in quarantine but in the wild they will eat honeysuckle and bramble flowers, hazelnuts, and invertebrates living on oak trees.Mr White added: \u201cTwo things dormice need, a fairly diverse range of food species, so old woodlands where you have got a range of trees, a range of different plants that they can feed on is important.\u201cAnd also because they are fully arboreal when they\u2019re active they need connectivity, the kind of tree and shrub level to enable them to get around, which is why you need ongoing management.\u201dThe rodents are active mostly at night and hibernate for five months over the winter, having built their nests from strips of bark.Because of this, they only produce one litter of four offspring each year and they grow to between 6-7cm when fully grown.The current dormouse reintroduction is the 26th done by PTES since the 1990s and about half have been successful, Mr White said. Success depends on how well the woodland is managed, before and after the reintroduction.Jon Lewney, countryside manager at the National Trust, said his organisation has been managing their woodland, on the Calke Abbey estate south of Derby, for around 10 years in preparation for the dormice.He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been looking for is a closed canopy and a shrub layer. So over the years, there has been quite a lot of deer in this woodland and they graze the woodland right down to the ground.\u201cThey get moved on by the public walking through and we have stalkers go through and control the deer as well.RecommendedGreenpeace unveils short film with Will Poulter and cover of Fleetwood Mac songRising pressures on water will see people pay more for less, says EA chairEarly June sees its highest temperatures ever, says EU climate change service\u201cWe\u2019ve got 30 volunteers here today helping out and it\u2019s a really easy sell for volunteers, because they\u2019re so cute and cuddly. And actually it\u2019s easy too for people to engage with them as a species.\u201cSo from our point of view, we\u2019ve been able to get a lot of people involved.

The incident coincided with a spike in temperatures, as the mercury reached 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsisus). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Kills and Spills Team, in a statement shared on Facebook by Quintana Beach County Park, attributed the fish kill to a \"low dissolved oxygen event.\" Water samples taken from the area were found to have almost no dissolved oxygen, the park said. There was no evidence of a chemical release impacting the fish.RecommendedPictures of the week: Giant rubber ducks, a 180 million-year-old fossil and West Ham fans flood the streetsA boat carrying 180 Rohingya refugees vanished.

Low dissolved oxygen, a natural occurrence in many cases, prevents fish from breathing properly, the park explained. \u201cFish kills like this are common in the summer when temperatures increase. If there isn\u2019t enough oxygen in the water, fish can\u2019t \u2018breathe\u2019.\u201d The park said the cleanup has concluded for the pedestrian beach \u201cwith the exception of a spattering of fish that the machinery couldn\u2019t get\u201d.\u201cHigh tides over the next couple of days should sift the rest down into the sand and bury them,\u201d it added.

That takes us straight to the issue of trust in the sector. And I am banging on to water companies all the time about the need for that.\u201dHe also said his agency has stopped 131 million litres a day being abstracted from chalk streams \u2013 which are globally unique ecosystems that exist almost entirely in the south and east of England \u2013 and that the EA will be \u201cstrict\u201d on water companies who want to source their water from aquifers feeding into them.One chalk stream in Cambridgeshire is already running very low, the BBC has reported, with little rain having fallen in the last three weeks.More than a dozen organisations \u2013 made up of conservationists, Government agencies and water companies \u2013 have agreed to work together to restore chalk streams and their ecosystems.They have launched a multi-year implementation plan that will take decades to complete but which aims at reducing pollution from sewage and agriculture as well as the amount of water taken through abstraction.Speaking alongside Mr Lovell, chair of the CaBA chalk stream restoration group Charles Rangeley-Wilson, water minister Rebecca Pow and chair of Natural England Tony Juniper said stopping water companies from abstracting at the beginning of a heatwave will not have much impact and stressed the need for long-term solutions.Mr Juniper said: \u201cAs we lead into these very dry conditions, just a moment of reflection about the changes that have occurred in the landscape over the last century or so, during the course of which we have lost 90% of our wetlands.\u201cSo what we\u2019ve been doing is deliberately desiccating the landscape, for good reasons, in some cases, in terms of food production, but looking into the challenges that are now coming in terms of climate change and the volatility in the water cycle both drought and also flooding, we might wish to look at replenishing large areas of wetland in order to be able to cope with these extremes.\u201dMr Rangeley-Wilson, who wore a T-shirt saying \u201cmore water, less poo, better habitat\u201d, told an audience made up of conservationists, public officials and water company representatives, that progress in chalk stream restoration has been \u201cachingly slow\u201d and \u201cadversarial\u201d but that organisations must learn to cooperate for their work to succeed.RecommendedEarly June sees its highest temperatures ever, says EU climate change serviceFraming disasters as natural masks societal inequalities, charity saysNorth Atlantic temperature anomaly sparks concern among climate scientistsHe said: \u201cWe need to think more about solutions than arguments.

The ensuing excessive heat had led to a barrage of climate impacts from more powerful storms to prolonged droughts and more frequent wildfires. In 2015 the world came together and signed the Paris Agreement to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C \u2013 or at least well below 2C \u2013 in an effort to stave off more a catastrophic climate crisis. It isn\u2019t the first time that the world has hit 1.5C \u2013 the threshold was surpassed in December 2015, and exceeded repeatedly in the winters and springs of 2016 and 2020, Copernicus noted. What\u2019s more, the limit was set for changes in long-term averages of 20-30 years, and not for short periods of days or months. However to cross 1.5C, even briefly, is a warning sign of how far off countries are in sticking to pledges to cut emissions causing the warming, scientists said, taking us closer to the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d.\u201cThese figures don\u2019t just reflect a few days of warm weather in the UK or a small part of the world, it reflects the average temperature across the whole world,\u201d said Hannah Cloke, a hydrology professor from the University of Reading.\u201cEvery fraction of a degree of warming means significant impacts on people and communities now and in the future.\u201dShe added: \u201cEach time we tip over 1.5 degrees with increasing regularity, it is a worrying sign that we are getting closer to a point of no return.

Slanted away towards the cordon, it clipped the outside edge and settled in Alex Carey\u2019s gloves.To their credit, England refused to be rattled. Crawley and Pope ran eagerly, snapping up singles as Australia reverted quickly to defensive, deep fields.Crawley was in his element, welcoming Nathan Lyon\u2019s arrival after just 10 overs with a reverse sweep and a sweet drive down the ground.When the metronomic Boland joined the attack there was more of the same, Crawley driving him on the up then cutting deftly behind square as the run-rate raced along.Australia appeared to miss a trick when Crawley had 40, failing to appeal for an apparent caught behind that showed up on UltraEdge while going unnoticed on the field.The second-wicket partnership eased to 70 as Australia remained oddly passive, but Lyon was on hand to make an important breakthrough.RecommendedWRU criticised for \u2018serious failure of governance\u2019 over misconduct allegationsCycling remembers \u2018exceptional\u2019 Gino Mader after death at the Tour de SuisseSalford hoping to reach Challenge Cup final to reward fans after shutout in 2020Pope had breezed his way to 31 when he was hit in front of leg stump by a flatter delivery from the spinner, whose initial appeal was waved away then upheld by DRS.Crawley\u2019s 50 and the team hundred left England in a strong position as the interval loomed, only for Boland to muster some extra bounce and flick the batter\u2019s glove in the closing over."}, {"_id": "648c54ff51ac33b09b54d6a7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/kylian-mbappe-psg-lionel-messi-transfers-b2358333.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Kylian Mbappe exit would give PSG a chance to rediscover soul", "lead": "<p>The French striker has informed the club he will leave when his contract runs out in 2024 </p>", "author": "Richard Jolly", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:54:06", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:39.878140", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T11:54:06+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/20/SEI160232527.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA beleaguered club may require a new name as well as a new forward line. \u201cThis is not Kylian Saint-Germain,\u201d wrote Kylian Mbappe a couple of months ago, complaining with unnecessary publicity about his image being used to sell season tickets. Which, whether this season or next, probably won\u2019t include the chance to watch him. Perhaps the 11-time champions of France will have to be rebranded Paris Saint-Germain.Certainly they require a new identity, a new ethos and a less glamorous attack. The Parisian Galacticos are being broken up: Lionel Messi is off to Miami, Mbappe, whether this summer or next, could be bound for Real Madrid, Neymar might follow the money to Saudi Arabia, though it seems PSG will be happy to offload him to anyone, anywhere.If Paris Saint-Germain assembled the most star-studded front three in footballing history, all it ultimately brought them was mockery and misery. Between them, they scored five of the six goals in the World Cup final (the other came from the former PSG player Angel Di Maria), winning both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball. But their club have lost four of their last six home games. Messi was booed by their supporters. No one was seduced by the supposed glitziness of it anymore: not the players, and not the fans either. Lens felt Ligue Un\u2019s real success story, its champions the real failures.Meanwhile, a comparable club achieved what PSG hoped to. Manchester City have also had an injection of investment and ambition from a small, oil-rich Gulf state. They won the Champions League, months after PSG exited in the last 16. There was a point where it appeared a genuine shock when Paris Saint-Germain beat an early retreat: not now, and Bayern Munich\u2019s achievement in beating them counted for so little that Julian Nagelsmann was soon sacked (that he was replaced by Thomas Tuchel highlighted the German\u2019s feat in taking PSG to the 2020 final and how others recognise it).If Messi leaves Paris without playing in a Champions League quarter-final, City provided the example that money alone did not turn them into a team or forge a compelling gameplan. There was a lesson, too, in that City\u2019s 2021 semi-final victory over PSG was inspired by Riyad Mahrez, a boy from the banlieues of Paris, just as Bayern\u2019s 2020 final winner came from another, Kingsley Coman: despite being in the city that represents arguably the greatest talent factory in world football now, a club with a fixation with the famous have contrived to miss out on most of them and Mbappe was the only Frenchman to start more than 12 league games last season.RecommendedThe \u2018problem\u2019 Kylian Mbappe faces after disrupting the entire transfer marketWhat next for Kylian Mbappe? Real Madrid, Man Utd and other options for PSG forwardLionel Messi to Inter Miami: Apple deal, MLS contract, salary, debut and everything we knowThey have had a soulless vanity project where there was the opportunity for something more organic, more endearing, more inspiring. Their tactics have been warped by having three forwards with a marked aversion to work off the ball, let alone anything as coordinated as pressing. They have attempted to compensate at times by stocking the midfield with workhorses, with players such as Ander Herrera and Idrissa Gueye, as though confining creativity to the attack.Theirs have seemed tactics from another era: the footballing servants charged with winning the ball back and giving it to their masters. Managers with collectivist principles, whether Unai Emery, Tuchel or Mauricio Pochettino have come and gone, with Christophe Galtier presumably next to follow them to the exit, the German coming closest to truly succeeding, but none able to fully flourish amid the cult of the big names. Meanwhile, PSG are the star vehicle that became involved in car crashes in the last 16 of the Champions League.The exits of PSG\u2019s superstar front three, Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr, should allow the club to reshape its identity (AFP via Getty Images)And PSG have felt trapped in a pattern of quick fixes. They have looked to import winners but now have Champions League and World Cup winners scattered out on loan: Keylor Navas at Nottingham Forest, Gini Wijnaldum at Roma, Leandro Paredes at Juventus, Julian Draxler at Benfica.Meanwhile, Mbappe has at least been consistently outstanding in Ligue Un. Messi\u2019s first season was underwhelming. Neymar\u2019s injuries means he only tends to play about half of every season, making his \u20ac222 million transfer fee still more ludicrous. Meanwhile, some of PSG\u2019s real success stories were perhaps their predecessors: Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani stacked up the goals before the club descended into parody. Some of the triumphs have been the world-class players who were not superstars: Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Marco Verratti, each happy to stay for years, all men who could have been cornerstones of a more coherent side.RecommendedThe \u2018problem\u2019 Kylian Mbappe faces after disrupting the entire transfer marketFootball rumours: Man United, Real Madrid and Chelsea fight for Kylian MbappeKylian Mbappe breaks silence after speculation over PSG exitMaybe the inherent weakness of the French league has counted against PSG, leaving them ill-prepared for Champions League knockout ties. But Benfica have played in two quarter-finals since France staged one: teamwork can still compensate.So the exodus of the Galacticos ought to provide a chance to restore some principles. In one respect, PSG will clearly be far weaker when stripped of Messi, Neymar and, in particular, Mbappe. In another, they have to become stronger: more unified, more industrious, harder to beat, capable of going further in Europe."}, {"_id": "648c550051ac33b09b54d6a8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ceo-bbc-senedd-wales-b2358890.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "WRU criticised for \u2018serious failure of governance\u2019 over misconduct allegations", "lead": "A committee of Senedd members has issued a report which found \u201csystemic failures in the culture\u201d of the governing body.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:46:07", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:40.058222", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T11:46:07+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/12/055f96c9d882f02b2afbee920226dfe0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg3MDAwMjMz-2.71086357.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But 18 months is a long time in Test cricket and the landscape has changed dramatically. England have adopted a revolutionary attacking style with both bat and ball under new captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum which has brought 11 victories in their past 13 matches, and they are bullish about their chances of winning the Ashes for the first time since 2015. Stokes has turned to the familiar figures of James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali \u2013 coaxed out of Test retirement \u2013 in England\u2019s bid to get off to a winning start.

Sonia Twigg16 June 2023 13:111686917074Sonia Twigg at EdgbastonIt has been a better start than many of those supporting England could have hoped for, as they reach lunch 124-3.The horrors of the first delivery from Mitchell Starc to Rory Burns were pushed further down in the memory banks when Crawley started with a fluent boundary off Pat Cummins.Crawley has not scored a century since day one of the first Test in Pakistan at Rawalpindi, but has not looked more fluent than this, he survived an edge with no appeal.But the Kent opener was out on the final ball before lunch, after a delivery from Boland just caught the glove on the way through with a hint of extra bounce, and he was out for 61 from 73 delivieries.Ollie Pope was trapped lbw, after a successful Australian review, and Ben Duckett waved at one that just caught the edge on the way through to the wicketkeeper, but it\u2019s still been England\u2019s morning.Australia may have to consider revisiting their defensive tactics at lunch, with up to four on the boundary to stop the fours rather than take wickets, has at times looked an odd choice.Ben Stokes\u2019 request for faster, bouncier wickets does not seem to have materialised, but it does look a good pitch to bat on (read flat) and England\u2019s batters have been largely untroubled, but are three wickets down at the break.Sonia Twigg16 June 2023 13:041686917020OUT!

A curious decision from Marais Erasmus when it appeared so certain that it had hit something, but Pat Cummins wasted no time sending it upstairs for a look. Crawley traipses off, knowing that really should have been more, but gone on the stroke of lunch. Scott Boland has his first Ashes wicket on English soil, finding extra bounce from a length for the first time, and that will really lift Australia\u2019s hopes as they head upstairs to enjoy some of the famous Edgbaston catering.

But we really try and just focus on our jobs. It\u2019s important we just stick to the task and don\u2019t get derailed or carried away, and you just hope we take the opportunities when they come to us.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveSalford\u2019s unfortunate recent history in the Challenge Cup can also be traced back to 1998, their best chance to repeat their previous final appearance, when they were edged out in the dying seconds of their semi-final by underdogs and eventual winners Sheffield Eagles.Painful reminders of the importance of not getting carried away are illustrated on the balance sheet, which show Salford operating one of the tightest budgets in Super League.They recently launched a community share offer scheme in a bid to become the top-flight\u2019s first wholly fan-owned club.In that context on-field results have been remarkable, as Rowley\u2019s men have built on last year\u2019s run to the play-off semi-finals with an expressive style of rugby that has won plaudits and points in equal measure, and which included a 26-16 win over Rovers two weeks ago at Magic Weekend.\n\nThere are no silver spoons at this club. We don't have a carpet rolled out and we go into a rusty old gym and a team room that has nothing posh about itSalford head coach Paul RowleyFor Rowley, a Wembley appearance would be a timely reward for the successes his current squad are fashioning against the odds on an almost weekly basis, as well as a welcome profile boost in an increasingly tough financial climate.\u201cThere are no silver spoons at this club,\u201d added Rowley. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a carpet rolled out and we go into a rusty old gym and a team room that has nothing posh about it.RecommendedThe hardest decision \u2013 Reported Arsenal target Alessia Russo leaves Man UtdJason Robinson urges England to take hope from unlikely 2007 World Cup runBig step in fight against concussion or bad idea?

But as one of the old school people, the Challenge Cup was the thing you dreamed about growing up.\u201cThe history and heritage that goes with it is something quite remarkable, and it\u2019s something we want to continue. This is the first of three opportunities to win a trophy and I\u2019d like any sort of success for this group because I think it\u2019s a special one.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c550151ac33b09b54d6b1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-transfer-news-declan-rice-kai-havertz-b2358857.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Declan Rice leads Arsenal\u2019s double midfield transfer plan - plus Kai Havertz latest", "lead": "<p>Mikel Arteta is intent on a summer spree to fill in the gaps in the Gunners\u2019 centre of the park </p>", "author": "Miguel Delaney", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:59:34", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:41.639166", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T10:59:34+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/11/GettyImages-1487253225.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Arsenal have already had one offer rejected for the 24-year-old, with the West Ham hierarchy wanting a slightly higher fee over just two installments rather than four. Another bid will go in, though, and there is an expectation a \u00a390 million deal will be done.Arsenal are not that advanced with Lavia but are seen as his most likely next club, amid competition from Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United.Arteta is also still interested in Brighton's Moises Caicedo but that deal is seen as more difficult to do because of how the January attempt played out, and Chelsea are now willing to outbid their London rivals.RecommendedThe hardest decision \u2013 Reported Arsenal target Alessia Russo leaves Man UtdGordon McQueen: The tough defender who starred for both Leeds and Man UnitedCarabao Cup 2023/24 fixture dates and schedule revealedThere could actually be a deal between Stamford Bridge and Arsenal, though, as Kai Havertz is interested in a move and Chelsea are willing to sell the German in order to trim their bloated squad.Bayern Munich are also interested in the forward, but Havertz wants to stay in the Premier League."}, {"_id": "648c550151ac33b09b54d6b2", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/miguel-delaney-newsletter-quiz-answers-b2077968.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The answers to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter quiz", "lead": "<p>Make sure you check on how you did with Miguel\u2019s weekly quiz which is exclusive to those signed up to his Reading the Game newsletter  </p>", "author": "The Independent", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 10:25:04", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:41.826893", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T10:25:04+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/10/19/22/PA-17303180.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCricket has long embraced the use of technology to aid officiating, with the Decision Review System (DRS) a by-now familiar feature of international and some domestic The system was introduced in a bid to help the on-field umpires make fewer obvious errors, granting power to batters and bowlers to challenge decisions that they feel have been made incorrectly. In time, the use of the third umpire has become more and more prevalent, with even marginal calls now often reviewed, but the system can prove pivotal if employed shrewdly. Indeed, two of the most thrilling Ashes series in recent memory might have ended differently had the system been available or better utilised: in 2005, before DRS was in place, Australia may well have squeaked home at Edgbaston and gone on to win the series had Michael Kasprowicz been able to review a caught-behind decision; in 2019, Australia\u2019s misuse of the system at Headingley proved costly as they found themselves out of reviews after Ben Stokes survived a late LBW appeal on his way to an extraordinary match-winning innings.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the system:RecommendedMoeen Ali could not turn down Ashes series under Ben Stokes\u2019 captaincyWomen\u2019s Ashes points system explainedWhat is Bazball? How England revolutionised Test cricketWhat is DRS and what does it stand for?DRS stands for Decision Review System, and was first brought in to Test cricket in 2008. It enables players to challenge decisions made by the on-field umpires - a bowling side can challenge a \u201cnot out\u201d decision, while a batter can ask to review after being given out.How does it work?After a decision is made by the on-field umpires, or the ball otherwise becomes dead, the players have up to 15 seconds to decide if they wish to review it. An intention to review is signalled by either the batter on strike or the fielding captain making a \u2018T\u2019 sign, at which point the umpires refer their decision to the third umpire, who has the benefit of replays.The third umpire then takes as long as required to either stay with or overturn the on-field decision, using a range of technologies at his disposal and all available television camera angles to make their final ruling, before returning to the on-field standing umpire to make a signal.Each team has three unsuccessful reviews per Test innings - this was upped from two during Covid to compensate for the pandemic-enforced use of non-neutral umpires, and has remained since.What technology can the third umpire use?Beyond pure footage, there are three technologies utilised during the DRS process. Ultra-Edge or Real Time Snicko (RTS)Ultra-Edge, also known as Real Time Snicko (RTS), uses a sensitive microphone placed near the stumps to generate a waveform displaying the soundwave of a connected oscilloscope. This waveform is then automatically synchronised with television footage to show sounds as they happened, with clear spikes on the waveform showing contact with the bat or pad. The one drawback of the technology is that it cannot distinguish what was struck, relying on the third umpire to interpret whether the ball has hit bat or pad when the two are close together - though this is reasonably rare.Hot SpotHot Sport is an infrared imaging system also used to determine if the ball has made contact with the bat. It requires two infrared cameras on either side of the ground that continuously record footage, which is then made available to the third umpire. Contact with the bat, or the batter\u2019s body, is typically evidenced by a bright, white spot where friction has elevated the temperature of the contacted area. While once preferred to RTS, improvements in the accuracy of the Ultra-Edge technology means that it is now generally used as the primary form of determining if a batter has edged the ball.Ball trackingGenerally using the computer vision system Hawk-Eye, also employed in tennis, ball tracking is used to assess leg before wicket (LBW) decisions. After a batter is struck on the pad or body, the ball tracking technology plots the trajectory the delivery would have continued on if not interrupted, predicting whether or not it would have hit the stumps. The technology can also assess whether the ball pitched or struck the batter in line with the stumps.What is umpire\u2019s call?Umpire\u2019s call will be commonly sighted when the third umpire asks for ball tracking. Put simply, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the on-field umpire\u2019s decision when no clear error has been made. RecommendedWhen is the Ashes?

For this reason, both the point at which the batter was struck and whether the ball would go on to hit the stumps can be assessed as umpire\u2019s call, sticking with the on-field decision. If the centre of the ball was outside what is called the \u201cImpact Zone\u201d as it struck the batter, an umpire\u2019s call is returned; similarly, if less than half of the ball is projected to go on to hit the stumps, the on-field call will also be upheld.If an LBW decision is upheld on umpire\u2019s call, the team that took the review does not lose it.

Then, in March, light-heavyweight \u2018GOAT\u2019 Jon Jones moved up to heavyweight after three years away, submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round to win the title vacated by Francis Ngannou in January, when the latter left the UFC.Later in March, Britain\u2019s Leon Edwards retained the welterweight belt with a decision win over Kamaru Usman in London, seven months after taking the title from the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d with a stunning head kick. April then kicked off with Israel Adesanya finally beating long-time rival Alex Pereira, the 33-year-old knocking out the Brazilian to regain the middleweight belt that he lost to Pereira in November.There are plenty more title fights to come, too.

Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCricket has long embraced the use of technology to aid officiating, with the Decision Review System (DRS) a by-now familiar feature of international and some domestic The system was introduced in a bid to help the on-field umpires make fewer obvious errors, granting power to batters and bowlers to challenge decisions that they feel have been made incorrectly. In time, the use of the third umpire has become more and more prevalent, with even marginal calls now often reviewed, but the system can prove pivotal if employed shrewdly. Indeed, two of the most thrilling Ashes series in recent memory might have ended differently had the system been available or better utilised: in 2005, before DRS was in place, Australia may well have squeaked home at Edgbaston and gone on to win the series had Michael Kasprowicz been able to review a caught-behind decision; in 2019, Australia\u2019s misuse of the system at Headingley proved costly as they found themselves out of reviews after Ben Stokes survived a late LBW appeal on his way to an extraordinary match-winning innings.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the system:RecommendedMoeen Ali could not turn down Ashes series under Ben Stokes\u2019 captaincyWomen\u2019s Ashes points system explainedWhat is Bazball? How England revolutionised Test cricketWhat is DRS and what does it stand for?DRS stands for Decision Review System, and was first brought in to Test cricket in 2008. It enables players to challenge decisions made by the on-field umpires - a bowling side can challenge a \u201cnot out\u201d decision, while a batter can ask to review after being given out.How does it work?After a decision is made by the on-field umpires, or the ball otherwise becomes dead, the players have up to 15 seconds to decide if they wish to review it. An intention to review is signalled by either the batter on strike or the fielding captain making a \u2018T\u2019 sign, at which point the umpires refer their decision to the third umpire, who has the benefit of replays.The third umpire then takes as long as required to either stay with or overturn the on-field decision, using a range of technologies at his disposal and all available television camera angles to make their final ruling, before returning to the on-field standing umpire to make a signal.Each team has three unsuccessful reviews per Test innings - this was upped from two during Covid to compensate for the pandemic-enforced use of non-neutral umpires, and has remained since.What technology can the third umpire use?Beyond pure footage, there are three technologies utilised during the DRS process. Ultra-Edge or Real Time Snicko (RTS)Ultra-Edge, also known as Real Time Snicko (RTS), uses a sensitive microphone placed near the stumps to generate a waveform displaying the soundwave of a connected oscilloscope. This waveform is then automatically synchronised with television footage to show sounds as they happened, with clear spikes on the waveform showing contact with the bat or pad. The one drawback of the technology is that it cannot distinguish what was struck, relying on the third umpire to interpret whether the ball has hit bat or pad when the two are close together - though this is reasonably rare.Hot SpotHot Sport is an infrared imaging system also used to determine if the ball has made contact with the bat. It requires two infrared cameras on either side of the ground that continuously record footage, which is then made available to the third umpire. Contact with the bat, or the batter\u2019s body, is typically evidenced by a bright, white spot where friction has elevated the temperature of the contacted area. While once preferred to RTS, improvements in the accuracy of the Ultra-Edge technology means that it is now generally used as the primary form of determining if a batter has edged the ball.Ball trackingGenerally using the computer vision system Hawk-Eye, also employed in tennis, ball tracking is used to assess leg before wicket (LBW) decisions. After a batter is struck on the pad or body, the ball tracking technology plots the trajectory the delivery would have continued on if not interrupted, predicting whether or not it would have hit the stumps. The technology can also assess whether the ball pitched or struck the batter in line with the stumps.What is umpire\u2019s call?Umpire\u2019s call will be commonly sighted when the third umpire asks for ball tracking. Put simply, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the on-field umpire\u2019s decision when no clear error has been made. RecommendedWhen is the Ashes? England vs Australia full schedule for 2023 seriesEngland vs Australia live stream: How to watch the Ashes online and on TVEngland Batsman Ben Duckett \u2018I tipped vodka over Jimmy Anderson\u2019s head not beer!\u2019While the ball tracking technology is good, there is a small margin for error. For this reason, both the point at which the batter was struck and whether the ball would go on to hit the stumps can be assessed as umpire\u2019s call, sticking with the on-field decision. If the centre of the ball was outside what is called the \u201cImpact Zone\u201d as it struck the batter, an umpire\u2019s call is returned; similarly, if less than half of the ball is projected to go on to hit the stumps, the on-field call will also be upheld.If an LBW decision is upheld on umpire\u2019s call, the team that took the review does not lose it.

But 18 months is a long time in Test cricket and the landscape has changed dramatically. England have adopted a revolutionary attacking style with both bat and ball under new captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum which has brought 11 victories in their past 13 matches, and they are bullish about their chances of winning the Ashes for the first time since 2015. Stokes has turned to the familiar figures of James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali \u2013 coaxed out of Test retirement \u2013 in England\u2019s bid to get off to a winning start.

England 124-3 (26.4)That wicket makes that session about even, I\u2019d say. Australia have had to work really, really hard on a placid surface but have managed to snaffle three England wickets. Their defensive fields have baffled at times but it has meant that England, though scoring freely, haven\u2019t been able to accelerate totally away, and they\u2019ll have a new batter to attack immediately after the interval.Harry Latham-Coyle16 June 2023 13:121686917474Lunch: England 124-3, Root 20, Brook 0As the players refuel, it\u2019s time for us to do the same, so here\u2019s a bit of lunchtime reading to tide you over for the next little while.The first ball of the series between England and Australia has earned its own mythology down the years \u2013 so can it really set the tone for what\u2019s to come?

Sonia Twigg16 June 2023 13:111686917074Sonia Twigg at EdgbastonIt has been a better start than many of those supporting England could have hoped for, as they reach lunch 124-3.The horrors of the first delivery from Mitchell Starc to Rory Burns were pushed further down in the memory banks when Crawley started with a fluent boundary off Pat Cummins.Crawley has not scored a century since day one of the first Test in Pakistan at Rawalpindi, but has not looked more fluent than this, he survived an edge with no appeal.But the Kent opener was out on the final ball before lunch, after a delivery from Boland just caught the glove on the way through with a hint of extra bounce, and he was out for 61 from 73 delivieries.Ollie Pope was trapped lbw, after a successful Australian review, and Ben Duckett waved at one that just caught the edge on the way through to the wicketkeeper, but it\u2019s still been England\u2019s morning.Australia may have to consider revisiting their defensive tactics at lunch, with up to four on the boundary to stop the fours rather than take wickets, has at times looked an odd choice.Ben Stokes\u2019 request for faster, bouncier wickets does not seem to have materialised, but it does look a good pitch to bat on (read flat) and England\u2019s batters have been largely untroubled, but are three wickets down at the break.Sonia Twigg16 June 2023 13:041686917020OUT! Zak Crawley c \u2020Carey b Boland 61 (73b 7x4 0x6), England 124-3 (26.4)A clear flick of the bottom thumb and Zak Crawley is gone! A curious decision from Marais Erasmus when it appeared so certain that it had hit something, but Pat Cummins wasted no time sending it upstairs for a look. Crawley traipses off, knowing that really should have been more, but gone on the stroke of lunch. Scott Boland has his first Ashes wicket on English soil, finding extra bounce from a length for the first time, and that will really lift Australia\u2019s hopes as they head upstairs to enjoy some of the famous Edgbaston catering.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJason Robinson insists England must look to his 2007 runners-up rather than the triumphant vintage of 2003 for inspiration to drive their World Cup quest this autumn.Either France, Ireland, South Africa or New Zealand are tipped to become champions in what is expected to be the fiercest battle yet for the global crown currently held by the Springboks.England, meanwhile, are outsiders as Steve Borthwick continues to find his feet, having taken over an under-performing side from the sacked Eddie Jones in September.Managing only two wins in the recent Six Nations has done little to rouse hopes, but Robinson recalls the 2007 tournament as an example of how quickly a team\u2019s fortunes can be reversed.\u201cThe reality is that England have got a better group than most and they\u2019ve got to top it. And then when you get into the knockout stage it\u2019s anybody\u2019s,\u201d Robinson, the Asahi Super Dry ambassador for the 2023 World Cup, told the PA news agency.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI don\u2019t think there has ever been a World Cup where there are so many teams in contention and I would say England are in the mix, but they are going to have to build some form.\u201cI would never have said we\u2019d get to the final in 2007 with the form that we had in the lead up to it, not a chance. We were playing crap.\u201cWe limped through the pool stages in 2007, getting beaten 36-0 by South Africa. I pulled my hamstring in that game. It was a real slap in the face for us.\u201cWhile we didn\u2019t have form in the team, we still had some good players. The defeat against South Africa was the shock we needed.\u201cWe got through the pool and then we found some form against Australia in the quarters. We beat France who were hosts and suddenly we were in the final. We could have won that too had Mark Cueto (who had a try controversially disallowed after it was ruled his left foot had made contact with the touchline) not had six toes!\u201cWhat happened to us in 2007 gives hope. It can be done \u2013 in sport you can turn things around in a very short space of time.\u201cSometimes you get written off and you\u2019ve got to take that on the chin and try to find a way to win.\u201cThis England team have got some great players, but they\u2019ve got to find form and also find the way they want to play.\u201dRobinson played in both the 2003 and 2007 World Cup finals and, although he was part of the greatest side to emerge from these shores, he sees the semi-final victory over New Zealand four years ago as the finest single performance.The All Blacks were flattened 19-7 on a dramatic night in Yokohama that saw the tone set through a defiant response to the Haka.\u201cWhile we won the World Cup in 2003, England\u2019s game against New Zealand in 2019 is the best I\u2019ve ever seen an England team play. That\u2019s the standout England game for me,\u201d cross-code star Robinson said.\u201cI was blown away by how England approached the game.

It was late at night, I freakin\u2019 swerve to the side of the road, completely disregarding that there were about two cars behind me. My manager goes: \u2018Bro, you\u2019re fighting in Australia in two weeks \u2013\u00a0in the UFC.\u2019 I literally broke down into tears.\u201dIt was as if the Lithuanian-born Briton had entered a mirrored reality; one year earlier, Bukauskas had been shedding tears over a call from his manager, but the news was altogether less positive. In late 2021, the development was that Bukauskas had been cut by the UFC. Sitting at home recovering from a serious knee injury, and reflecting on a third successive defeat, Bukauskas had in fact seen the news on Twitter before his manager could even confirm it. In the year that ensued, Bukauskas was out of the Octagon, but he was still in a cage.\u201cThe amount of pain and struggle, drinking in bed...\u201d The 29-year-old cuts himself off. \u201cI just so many hard f***ing memories, having to go through the deepest and darkest times. I don\u2019t remember a time when I was acting myself. It just seemed like I was in a picture with no colour. Everything was black and white. Mentally, I was broken. I had a lot of things to fix before I could even move forward.\u201dRecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearUFC rankings: The Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound fighters listFormer Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler opponent makes prediction for UFC clashFirst to be fixed was the knee. Then, somehow, Bukauskus was indeed able to move forward.At first, it might have seemed like moving backwards. In 2019, before joining the UFC, Bukauskas had won and retained the Cage Warriors light-heavyweight title; after leaving the UFC, he turned down other offers and opted to return to the London-based promotion. Perhaps, unknowingly, Bukauskas was shining the glass of that mirrored reality. Within two months, and two fights, he had once again secured Cage Warriors\u2019 light-heavyweight crown.And then came the call \u2013 on the side of the road, at the opening of the forest, in the middle of nowhere.\u201cI was absolutely elated,\u201d Bukauskas tells The Independent. \u201cAfter I got off the phone with my manager, I was playing some, like, war music in the car \u2013 a remix of the Witcher video-game music \u2013 full blast for the last five minutes back to my house. I was screaming with just... fierceness. I got home and felt kind of dizzy, it was weird. I didn\u2019t feel like I was there.\u201cI went upstairs to tell my step-mum, and she was kind of worried, because I was almost out of breath. Then my dad was chilling in bed after a hard day, and he was like (Bukauskas taps into a Lithuanian accent): \u2018What the hell do you need to get me out of bed for?\u2019 I brought them downstairs and told them, \u2018We\u2019re back in the UFC,\u2019 just hugged them and broke down in tears again.

In the 1980s, before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Gintas Bukauskas learned to fight on the streets of occupied Lithuania, before going on to work as a mixed martial arts coach. Gintas brought his family to Britain when Modestas was three years old and first introduced his son to combat sports two years later. \u201cI just remember vividly that he would show me some kicks, some moves,\u201d Modestas recalls. \u201cAt that age, you\u2019re just like, \u2018That looks cool! Look at that kick!\u2019 Literally about a week into showing me some stuff, he goes (Bukauskas dips into that Lithuanian accent again): \u2018Okay, now you must train hard.\u2019 My childhood was thrown into strict regime and training. There was kickboxing, sambo.

Here he is, sitting in a studio in London, yet mentally the heavyweight is back in a ring in Tokyo, in the summer of 2021.\u201cI lost the fight, the referee stopped it, my Olympic gold-medal dream was over, and I realised when they raised his hand: \u2018This is the last time I\u2019m going to wear this vest and represent this country.\u2019 I had a moment.\u201dThe nature of the moment took Clarke by surprise. Fighting for Team GB, he had watched through the stream of blood trickling over his right eye as Bakhodir Jalolov took home a silver medal for Uzbekistan, yet there was little room in his mind or heart for disappointment. \u201cIt was just crazy,\u201d he explains to The Independent, \u201cbecause he had won the fight \u2013 his team were clapping and celebrating \u2013 but I looked up at all the Team GB boxers, staff, coaches, then at my corner... and I was just elated with happiness. \u201cEveryone was so proud. We Brits made more noise than anyone in there. There was Covid, so there was no crowd, but there was about 15 of my teammates, staff, coaches and friends. There\u2019s a picture online somewhere of me with open arms, looking up at them. I was just so elated, because it was the end of a big chapter in my life and I feel like I\u2019d done myself proud, I\u2019d done Burton-on-Trent proud, and I hope I\u2019d done everyone in the country proud.\u201dFrazer Clarke reflects on Olympic boxing glory as he prepares for biggest pro fight yetRecommendedBoxer Frazer Clarke reflects on Olympic glory ahead of Wach fightFrazer Clarke insists he has nothing to prove against Mariusz WachThe Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound boxing rankingsClarke had done just that, endearing himself to the public back in Britain and joining the unique pool of athletes to have secured eternal legacies by competing \u2013 and winning a medal \u2013 at an Olympic Games.\u201cThere\u2019s a great saying: You\u2019re not just an Olympian for an Olympic Games; you\u2019re an Olympian for life,\u201d the 31-year-old says. \u201cSomeone explained it to me well: If you were to put everyone in the world in one place and colour in the Olympians, you\u2019re a small minority \u2013 you\u2019ve done something fantastic; then you do the medalists a different colour, you\u2019re an even more special minority. It\u2019s something I\u2019m extremely proud of, and it\u2019s good for myself massively, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I think to give inspiration to children or other people with a dream who probably think, \u2018It ain\u2019t going to happen for me...\u2019 I was that person. \u201cI wasn\u2019t athletically blessed, I wasn\u2019t the toughest, fastest or fittest, but I had a really good determination and learned to keep good people around me. It also took me to the dreamland; it took an overweight kid who was unconfident, to walk into a boxing gym, to be in Tokyo in front of the eyes of the world and live his dream.

Despite encouraging signs this week, boxing will still not \u2013 as it stands \u2013 feature at the 2028 Games, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accused the International Boxing Association (IBA) of governance issues and alleged corruption. The IBA typically runs boxing at each Olympics, though the IOC did so in Tokyo amid the IBA\u2019s ongoing suspension.Asked about the prospect of boxing being omitted from the 2028 Olympics, a crestfallen Clarke sighs: \u201cI think it\u2019s a tragedy, I really do. \u201cYou take the boxing away, and the boxers, and that\u2019s taken a lot of character out of the Olympics. Anyone that\u2019s been at the Olympic Games, in the Olympic Village, they know about the boxers \u2013 they know what boxing brings. It brings excitement, it brings an unbelievable skill, and people are quite fascinated by what [we] have to go through. \u201cAnd remember, this sport inspires kids. It keeps kids safe, it saves so many lives every single year, it will save generations. To take the Olympic dream away \u2013 not from the people in this cycle, but the eight, nine or 10-year-olds who are joining boxing clubs now... They\u2019ve got to keep it in the Olympics. Simple as that.\u201dClarke is 6-0 as a professional, with five knockout wins to his name  (Action Images via Reuters)It is a passionate plea from Clarke as he looks into the future, but his focus is quickly pulled back to the present, where he will face his toughest test yet as a professional on Friday.At London\u2019s York Hall, the 6-0 Briton (5 knockouts) takes on resilient Polish heavyweight Mariusz Wach, a man who has fought the likes of Dillian Whyte, Alexander Povetkin, Wladimir Klitschko and Jarrell Miller. Still, he is not the foe whom Clarke originally eyed, with \u201cBig Fraze\u201d left frustrated last month when a British title fight with Fabio Wardley fell through.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of controversy with my career over the last eight weeks, probably more than ever with the British title situation, so I think it\u2019s good to not worry about anyone else, what people are saying online or in papers and magazines.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe boxing landscape is arguably as intriguing as it has ever been.The past few years have seen heavyweight epics for the ages between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, they have seen Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez establish himself as the face of the sport in the eyes of many fans, and they have seen frequent displays of technical brilliance from champions in lighter weight classes.There have been upsets, title unifications, and there has been no shortage of drama \u2013 Anthony Joshua\u2019s defeats by Andy Ruiz Jr and Oleksandr Usyk standing out as prime examples.All of these fights and results have factored into The Independent\u2019s own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s boxers, to be updated monthly.

Juan Francisco Estrada (44-3, 28 KOs)Juan Francisco Estrada celebrates a 2017 win against Carlos Cuadras (Getty Images)The diminutive Mexican is a two-weight world champion, having obtained the WBA super-flyweight title with his split-decision victory over Roman Gonzalez in March 2021. That win saw Estrada, 33, avenge a 2012 defeat by \u201cChocolatito\u201d, but its narrow nature meant the old rivals were set to rematch last March, until Estrada had to withdraw due to Covid symptoms. Estrada has since outpointed Argi Cortes and triumphed in his delayed trilogy bout with \u201cChocolatito\u201d in December, winning a close fight by majority decision. His creative use of angles is one of his standout attributes, making him a fun watch each time out.9. Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs)Vasiliy Lomachenko (left) during his fight with Devin Haney in May  (AP)The Ukrainian southpaw (one of two on this list...) saw off Jorge Linares in 2018 to become a three-weight title holder, before adding further belts with notable wins against the likes of Luke Campbell and Jose Pedraza. \u201cLoma\u201d was somewhat surprisingly beaten by Teofimo Lopez in 2020, but the 35-year-old bounced back with three straight wins to maintain his status as one of the best boxers in the world. The two-time Olympic champion is in the twilight of his career now, which only made his terrific showing against the next fighter on this list even more impressive. Lomachenko came up narrowly short, but many observers felt that he had won.8. Devin Haney (30-0, 15 knockouts)Devin Haney (right) was a unanimous-decision winner against George Kambosos Jr in two fights in 2022  (Getty Images)The unbeaten American entered our list following his second straight clinic against George Kambosos Jr. Haney eased to a unanimous-decision win against the Australian on Kambosos\u2019 home turf in June 2022 to become undisputed champion at lightweight, before retaining that status in the pair\u2019s rematch in October \u2013 also in Melbourne. Prior to those clashes, Kambosos Jr was undefeated. At just 24 years old, the best is still ahead of Haney, though he must learn from his most recent bout, with Lomachenko in May.\u00a0It was a fight that Haney won, but not without controversy.7. Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs)Dmitry Bivol outpointed Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for a stunning win  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Entered our list in May 2022, following his stunning victory over Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. The Russian remained unbeaten and retained the WBA light-heavyweight title with that result, which he achieved by fighting on the front foot, picking his shots wisely, and almost doubling the output of his opponent. Bivol, 32, won by two points on all three judges\u2019 scorecards, though the margins should have been much wider. A clinical showing that raised the Russian\u2019s profile immensely and likely sets up a rematch with Canelo down the line. Before that, though, Bivol was tasked with getting past the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez in November. Bivol won on points with an aggressive and sharp performance, which saw him rise from ninth to seventh on our list. 6. Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs)Tyson Fury after stopping Deontay Wilder again in a heavyweight epic in 2021  (Getty Images)Has eclipsed Anthony Joshua as the household name in British boxing. Fury, 34, returned to the sport in 2018 after three years off due to a long struggle with his mental health. Since then, he has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, dethroning Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in the pair\u2019s 2020 rematch, having controversially drawn with the American in their first clash, in 2018. In October 2021, Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row to retain the belt, which he did again in April by knocking out Dillian Whyte with ease and once more in December with a late stoppage of Derek Chisora. A creative fighter who has demonstrated remarkable resilience and heart in the ring, Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles and was looking to regain them in a fight with Oleksandr Usyk this spring. However, the fight \u2013 which would have crowned an undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 fell through.5. Errol Spence Jr (28-0, 22 KOs)Errol Spence Jr leaving AT&T Stadium with another welterweight belt (Getty Images)The American has not been the most active fighter in recent years, but he has been slowly building a fine resume. Spence Jr holds impressive wins against the likes of Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia, Danny Garcia and Carlos Ocampo. The southpaw stopped the latter, as well as notably finishing Kell Brook on the Briton\u2019s home turf earlier in his career, and a cancelled clash with Manny Pacquiao would surely have built up Spence even further had it come to fruition. Last time out, the 33-year-old beat Yordenis Ugas by brutalising the Cuban\u2019s eye, collecting another welterweight belt and rising up our rankings in the process. If he can increase his activity, Spence will likely only continue to climb here, especially if a long-awaited meeting with Terence Crawford comes to pass and Spence can win...4. Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs)Terence Crawford stopped Shawn Porter in November 2021 to stay unbeaten  (AP)The WBO welterweight champion has one of the most impressive resumes in the sport, and it just keeps getting better. Four of the American\u2019s last 10 opponents were undefeated before facing him, and all 10 were stopped by Crawford \u2013 who has a tremendous number of knockout and TKO victories to his name. Wins against big-name boxers Brook and Porter in 2020 and 2021 further enhanced the 35-year-old\u2019s profile, especially his victory over the latter, before Crawford stopped David Avanesyan in December 2022.3. Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs)Saul Alvarez following his stoppage win against Caleb Plant in 2021  (AP)In the 10 years since his loss to Floyd Mayweather, the Mexican has established himself as the face of boxing, with wins against Erislandy Lara, Miguel Cotto, Amir Khan, Gennadiy Golovkin, Daniel Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders and many more of note. The effectiveness of the 32-year-old\u2019s counter-punching, slickness of his head movement and beauty of his body work make him a joy to watch.Detractors will point to Alvarez\u2019s clenbuterol controversy in 2018 and the fact that a few of his victories have come via controversial scorecards. Supporters will give more credence to Canelo\u2019s admirable level of activity and the great number of formidable foes he has fought and beaten. His three victories in 2021 \u2013 all stoppages \u2013 saw him ultimately become boxing\u2019s first ever undisputed super-middleweight champion. A title holder in four weight classes, the Mexican failed to add a second light-heavyweight title to his collection when he was outpointed by unbeaten Russian Bivol in May 2022.That result, which surprised a number of fans, marked just the second defeat of Canelo\u2019s professional career and saw him drop from No 1 in our list to No 4. He rebounded with a decisive points win against ageing rival Golovkin, though that result proved little at this point and only saw him climb one spot here. The ambitious Mexican then defended his super-middleweight belts against John Ryder in Guadalajara, dropping the Briton en route to a decision win that sees him stay put at No 3.2. Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs)Oleksandr Usyk (left) has outpointed Anthony Joshua twice in a row  (Getty Images)Was the only ever undisputed cruiserweight champion of the four-belt era before moving up to heavyweight, where he became WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion in 2021 by outpointing Anthony Joshua with relative ease. The Ukrainian, 36, is undefeated and most recently beat Joshua on points a second time to retain his heavyweight titles and climb two spots here. The southpaw, an Olympic gold medalist, is as technical and awkward as they come in the heavier weight classes, making a potential match-up with Fury an intriguing prospect \u2013 though that bout collapsed this spring.1. Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs)Naoya Inoue (left) stopped Paul Butler in Round 11 in December  (AP)One of the lesser-known names on this list to the more casual fan, the Japanese does not lack in prowess what he may lack in profile. Inoue has the best stoppage percentage of any fighter on this list, part of what makes him such an exciting fighter to watch \u2013 along with his effortless evasiveness, brutal body attacks, and frightening level of output. In June, \u201cMonster\u201d lived up to his nickname once again by eviscerating Nonito Donaire in a rematch, having narrowly outpointed the Filipino in their first fight.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeConor McGregor is sitting in a hospital bed, clad in a surgical gown, his face still drained from a weight-cut. \u201cI thought it was over,\u201d he says of his career, before the setting morphs to an Octagon, where McGregor is sitting on the canvas, sporting his fight-night attire, his face twisted in pain. \u201cThis is not over!\u201d he hisses at Dustin Poirier.That is how Netflix\u2019s McGregor Forever begins, the second documentary built around the MMA megastar. While 2017 film Notorious covered the Irishman\u2019s rise to becoming the first dual-weight champion in UFC history and his iconic rivalry with Nate Diaz, this new series documents the journeys around his last four fights \u2013 three of them defeats \u2013 with an episode dedicated to each, loosely speaking. McGregor Forever, directed by Gotham Chopra and produced by Religion Of Sports, starts at the end: in the aftermath of McGregor breaking his leg against Poirier in July 2021. It then veers back to 2018 and the Irishman's bitter rivalry with Khabib Nurmagedomov, onto his 2020 return against Donald Cerrone, his January 2021 duel with Poirier, and finally their ill-fated rematch six months later.RecommendedConor McGregor shoves Michael Chandler in trailer for The Ultimate FighterMichael Chandler gives disappointing update on Conor McGregor fightKatie Taylor and Chantelle Cameron are shaming their male counterpartsNotorious was released shortly after McGregor\u2019s spectacle of a super-fight with boxing legend Floyd Mayweather, the backstory of which was absent from that film and eludes this series. And so McGregor Forever begins in earnest in the lead-up to the UFC star\u2019s clash with Khabib, a fascinating and until-now-under-explored spell in McGregor\u2019s career. It is a spell made even more bewitching by the stark contrast between scenes of McGregor playing with his first-born son, partaking in a gender reveal for his daughter, and the venom of his exchanges with Nurmagomedov. An eerie soundtrack only serves to enhance the foreboding feeling throughout.McGregor\u2019s coach, John Kavanagh, once spoke of his fighter\u2019s ominous attitude ahead of the fight; how McGregor was beating up sparring partners, rather than trying to learn from them, before celebrating by going out and drinking. Indeed, this particular stint of the series validates those revelations, painting a picture of an insecure McGregor, and each second of never-before-seen footage is welcome \u2013 even an excruciating scene in which McGregor\u2019s dislocated toes are wrenched back into place, three weeks before the fight; especially shots of a teary-eyed McGregor coming to terms with the defeat, surrounded by teammates in his locker room yet desperately alone. For all the intriguing elements to this phase of McGregor\u2019s career, the fighter himself sees it simply: \u201cI was beat, and that\u2019s that. I was beat where it mattered, end of.\u201d The series features numerous scenes of McGregor with his family ( Courtesy of Netflix )There is a similarly revealing moment in the third episode, after McGregor suffers his first ever knockout loss. \u201cThat was just abysmal,\u201d he says, before questioning his team. \u201cHow come you boys have nothing... I was shot, my leg was dead, and there wasn\u2019t a rattle at all [from you].\u201d Both scenes follow satisfyingly cinematic framings of the fights themselves, and the other episodes employ the same impactful sound and visual editing. The opening episode closes with McGregor carrying out community service in the series\u2019 only acknowledgement of his various legal issues in recent years. Yet hearing McGregor express his sincere feelings about the experience highlights perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the documentary: Elsewhere, there is a distinct lack of soundbites from McGregor, with old interviews instead laid over much of the fresh footage and undermining the excitement of seeing new clips.Yet the biggest problem is the timing of the series itself.Much of McGregor Forever is dedicated to the Irishman dealing with setbacks, including injuries ( Courtesy of Netflix )McGregor Forever is sold as the story of the Irishman\u2019s comebacks from numerous setbacks, and of his impending comeback from his broken leg; however, he is yet to come back in the manner that matters most to his fans and to the sport: in the ring, and more ideally with a win. Furthermore, the series does not exactly convince you that such a win is impending. If you had not seen McGregor\u2019s final encounter with Poirier, the last episode of the series would lead you to believe that the Irishman was approaching a redemptive victory, rather than the concerning performance and devastating injury that followed.That McGregor has conquered his recovery from that injury is more than commendable and should not be overlooked. The 34-year-old speaks in this documentary about his desire to keep fighting, how he is and always will be a fighter first and foremost, but we are yet to even see a date announced for his next fight, against Michael Chandler. When it comes to making fights, the number and nature of moving parts can be dizzying, so McGregor\u2019s ongoing, extended absence is not entirely his fault. But fans want a clarity on the situation that this documentary cannot provide.Between this series, his appearances as a coach on The Ultimate Fighter, and his constant presence on social media, there is plenty of McGregor content to consume in 2023. There are just not enough McGregor contests.RecommendedConor McGregor announces fiancee is pregnant with couple\u2019s fourth childConor McGregor offers update on Miami Heat mascot after punching incidentConor McGregor pays young action-figure artist $1,200 for figurinesAll four episodes of \u2018McGregor Forever\u2019 are streaming now on Netflix.Click here to subscribe to The Independent\u2019s Sport YouTube channel for all the latest sports videos."}, {"_id": "648c550751ac33b09b54d6ce", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/ufc-rankings-fighters-p4p-list-2023-b2355821.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "UFC rankings: The Independent\u2019s pound-for-pound fighters list", "lead": "<p>Here are our top 10 men\u2019s fighters in the UFC, in a list to be updated throughout the year </p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 08:50:54", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:47.010721", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T08:50:54+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/03/20/11/newFile-6.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe UFC is home to some of the best mixed martial artists on the planet, so it is no surprise that fans often debate how the elite fighters compare to one another.Alongside its weekly-updated rankings for each weight class, the UFC has its own pound-for-pound rankings, containing 15 names \u2013 as with each list for every division.Here, The Independent has constructed its own top 10, pound-for-pound rankings for men\u2019s UFC fighters, to be updated throughout the year. While there is no exact science to putting together lists such as this, a number of factors have been considered in making the rankings, including each fighter\u2019s overall record, recent record, level of activity and calibre of opposition.Before diving into the top 10, here are a couple of honourable mentions:RecommendedUFC 2023 schedule: Every major fight happening this yearBest seat in the house: UFC\u2019s commentary team on what it\u2019s like to be cageside for the biggest fights in the world\u2018The only rules? No biting and no eye gouging\u2019: UFC\u2019s first ever champion Royce Gracie on the night MMA was bornColby Covington (17-3, welterweight)The former interim welterweight champion is one of the best 170lbers on the planet. While the American, 35, has lost both of his shots at undisputed gold, he pushed then-champion Kamaru Usman to the brink in both fights. Covington, a wrestling specialist, responded to his second defeat by Usman with a dominant points win over friend-turned-rival Jorge Masvidal in March 2022. He has not fought since.Stipe Miocic (20-4, heavyweight)The consensus heavyweight GOAT, the part-time firefighter holds the record for most successful title defences in the division \u2013 the hardest weight class at which to put together a sustained run. The American surrendered the belt to Francis Ngannou and the French-Cameroonian\u2019s freakish knockout power in March 2021, but prior to that achieved back-to-back wins against one of the greatest ever in Daniel Cormier. The veteran, 40, also holds a decision victory over Ngannou, plus wins against more UFC champions in Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Werdum and Andrei Arlovski. However, he has dropped out of our top 10 due to two years of inactivity. Miocic is expected to return in July, to challenge current heavyweight champion Jon Jones.Brandon Moreno (20-6-2, flyweight champion)Mexico\u2019s first ever UFC champion has just one loss in the last five years, though he has also competed in two competitive draws in that period \u2013 the most recent kickstarting the most entertaining run of his career. There was no winner when Moreno challenged Deiveson Figueiredo in 2020, but the \u201cAssassin Baby\u201d submitted the Brazilian in their 2021 rematch to win the gold. Figueiredo wrestled the belt back in a close trilogy bout last year, but Moreno claimed the interim title by stopping Kai Kara-France and went on to stop Figueiredo again this January. In doing so, he became a two-time undisputed champion.Top 1010. Dustin Poirier (29-7, 1 No Contest; lightweight)Former interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier  (Getty Images)The American has only two defeats in the last six years \u2013 coming against the greatest lightweight of all time in Khabib Nurmagomedov and one of the best active lightweights right now in Charles Oliveira. The \u201cDiamond\u201d holds eight wins against six different world champions of the sport, having beaten Conor McGregor twice in 2021 before most recently submitting Michael Chandler to improve that tally.9. Robert Whittaker (24-6, middleweight)Robert Whittaker holds one of the most impressive resumes in MMA (Zuffa LLC)The Australian has tasted defeat just twice in the last eight years. Both of those losses came against the phenomenal Israel Adesanya, with Whittaker losing the middleweight belt to his rival by TKO in 2019 before dropping a debatable decision to the \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d last February. Between those bouts, the \u201cReaper\u201d earned three straight wins against elite competition, and his earlier run to the belt saw him successfully navigate a murderers\u2019 row of opponents that is almost incomprehensible. He bounced back from his second loss to Adesanya with a masterful points win against Marvin Vettori.8. Aljamain Sterling (23-3, bantamweight champion)Aljamain Sterling has recorded three title defences, all against ex-champions  (Getty Images)The Jamaican-American was mocked by some fans after winning the bantamweight title via disqualification in 2021, when Petr Yan landed an illegal knee while leading the bout. In a rematch 13 months later, Sterling silenced some doubters and irked others by winning a narrow decision. He then dominated former champion TJ Dillashaw en route to a TKO in October, as the challenger battled a dislocated shoulder, and went on to beat another ex-champion in Henry Cejudo this May, defeating the American \u2013 who had not fought in three years \u2013 via split decision. Some observers attach asterisks to each of Sterling\u2019s title defences, but each has come against a former world champion, and \u201cFunk Master\u201d has now won nine fights in a row.7. Charles Oliveira (34-9, 1 NC; lightweight)Charles Oliveira has the most finishes and submissions in UFC history  (Getty Images)The Brazilian\u2019s 2010 debut in the UFC gave way to an inconsistent record with numerous failed weight-cuts along the way, but the former featherweight then turned his career around). An 11-fight win streak over five years saw Oliveira claim and retain the lightweight title vacated by the retired Khabib, then submit Justin Gaethje in May 2022 \u2013 one day after being stripped of the belt for a narrow weight-miss. That win positioned him as No 1 contender as he looked to regain the gold. However, he was submitted by Makhachev in October as the Russian won the vacant title. Oliveira bounced back in June 2023, though, with a TKO win over Beneil Dariush in the first round. That result extended Oliveira\u2019s records for most finishes (19) and most submissions (16) in UFC history.6. Kamaru Usman (20-3, welterweight)Kamaru Usman was a dominant welterweight champion from 2019 until 2022  (AP)In 2021, Usman was arguably the best mixed martial artist in the world, let alone the UFC, and our pound-for-pound No 1. The Nigerian-American is perhaps the most clinical wrestler in the promotion and has added knockout power to his game in recent years, and he was unbeaten for nine years between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 with a dominant welterweight title reign for the last three years of that run. After five successful defences \u2013 two against Colby Covington, two against Jorge Masvidal, and one against Gilbert Burns \u2013 Usman dropped the belt to Leon Edwards last August, dominating his old opponent for much of the fight but falling to an incredible, late head kick. Edwards then outpointed Usman in London this March to retain the gold.5. Israel Adesanya (24-2, middleweight champion) (Getty Images)One of the most exciting fighters to watch in the history of the sport. The former kickboxer routinely produces striking masterclasses against his opponents, simply proving too slick and too clever for his competition. Adesanya has faced a who\u2019s-who of 185lbers, knocking out a number of them and losing to just one. The \u201cLast Stylebender\u201d suffered his first defeat in pro MMA in 2021, but there was even merit in that as the Nigerian-born New Zealander moved up a weight class to challenge then-champion Jan Blachowicz for the light-heavyweight title.He then began to \u201clap the opposition\u201d with back-to-back rematch wins against Vettori and Whittaker prior to his decision victory over Jared Cannonier at UFC 276. Adesanya then suffered just his second MMA defeat \u2013\u00a0and first at middleweight \u2013 in losing the title to old foe Alex Pereira in November. Pereira, who twice beat Adesanya in kickboxing bouts across 2016 and 2017, stopped the Kiwi in the final round to dethrone \u201cStylebender\u201d at the end of a thrilling encounter. But Adesanya finally exorcised his demon by knocking out Pereira in the second round in April, regaining the title and reasserting himself as the best middleweight in the UFC.4. Leon Edwards (21-3, 1 NC; welterweight champion)Leon Edwards made a successful first defence of the welterweight title in March  (Action Images via Reuters)Edwards became Britain\u2019s second ever UFC champion with a stunning, last-gasp knockout of Usman in August. After taking down the Nigerian-American \u2013\u00a0something no fighter had ever done in the UFC \u2013 in Round 1, Edwards continually rose to his feet amid an onslaught of grappling pressure from the champion over the next few frames, keeping himself in the fight. Then, with a minute left on the clock, Edwards knocked Usman out cold with a perfect head kick to take his gold, beating the man who outpointed him seven years earlier. Then, this March, Edwards outpointed Usman in London to solidify his status as champion. Edwards\u2019 first win over Usman saw him enter our list, while the second propelled him up the rankings. Since his 2015 loss to the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d, Edwards is unbeaten with 11 straight wins (save for a No Contest against Belal Muhammad in 2021).3. Islam Makhachev (24-1, lightweight champion)Islam Makhachev won the UFC lightweight title by submitting Charles Oliveira in November  (AFP via Getty Images)Some used to question the Russian\u2019s credentials, given a lack of top-tier opponents on his record, though that was arguably due to highly-ranked fighters\u2019 tentativeness to risk their spots against a dangerous up-and-comer. Others accused Makhachev of benefiting from his connection to Khabib \u2013 his childhood friend and now one of Makhachev\u2019s coaches. Regardless, the 31-year-old banished any doubt in October when he submitted Oliveira \u2013 the fighter with the most submission wins in UFC history \u2013 to win the vacant lightweight title, suggesting that he would have done the same to most contenders at 155lbs.Makhachev then made it 12 wins in a row by outpointing Alexander Volkanovski in February, matching the Australian\u2019s record streak for an active fighter while retaining his title against the featherweight champion in a very close contest. In advance of that fight, many suggested that a Makhachev win would make him the new pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport was more impressed by Volkanovski\u2019s showing in a higher weight class and would like to see Makhachev add some more notable names to his resume. As such, the Russian was our No 2, until...2. Jon Jones (27-1, 1 NC; heavyweight champion)Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March to collect a title in a second division  (Getty Images)When Jon Jones returned to the UFC in March after a three-year absence, winning the heavyweight title by submitting Ciryl Gane in the first round, many believed that the American confirmed himself as the greatest of all time. A lot of fans also felt that he should go straight to the top of any and all pound-for-pound lists. And Jones\u2019 victory certainly was impressive, particularly due to the manner in which it was achieved and the factors around the 35-year-old\u2019s heavyweight debut. It was also enough for the former two-time light-heavyweight champion to shoot straight into our rankings at No 2, with his long-term resume standing out more than Makhachev\u2019s (Jones has beaten numerous world champions), but his lack of activity keeping him below our No 1 \u2013 for the time being, at least.1. Alexander Volkanovski (25-2, featherweight champion)Alexander Volkanovski is riding a 22-fight winning streak  (Getty Images)After suffering the sole defeat of his professional career in 2013, Volkanovski won a stunning 22 fights in a row. In fact, his only pro loss came against a welterweight champion, until this February. Seven of the Australian\u2019s last eight fights have pitted him against \u2018elite\u2019 fighters, and in 2022 Volkanovski put on a clinic against fan favourite Chan Sung Jung before producing a masterclass to outpoint Max Holloway for the third time, leaving no doubt about his superiority over the man he dethroned in 2019. In doing so, the 34-year-old enhanced his own claim to be labelled the 145lbs GOAT. He even holds a win against the other standout contender for that title \u2013\u00a0Jose Aldo \u2013 as well as Chad Mendes and Brian Ortega.RecommendedMMA fighter skips press conference due to fear of heightsConor McGregor announces fiancee is pregnant with couple\u2019s fourth childConor McGregor offers update on Miami Heat mascot after punching incidentVolkanovski is as dynamic, composed and well rounded as they come. He had the chance to confirm his status as pound-for-pound king when he challenged lightweight champion Makhachev on home turf in February, in a bid to become just the fifth ever dual-weight UFC champion, and \u2013\u00a0although he narrowly lost on points \u2013\u00a0he remained our No 1. That is due to the stunning performance produced by the Aussie in that fight, with Volkanovski dropping Makhachev twice, neutralising the Russian in many of the grappling exchanges, and arguably winning the bout despite a significant size disadvantage. Volkanovski also keeps the returning Jon Jones at bay, for now..."}, {"_id": "648c550751ac33b09b54d6cf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ufc/next-ufc-fight-event-june-schedule-2023-b2356611.html", "primaryCategory": "UFC", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Next UFC Fight Night: Event start time, card and how to watch", "lead": "<p>All you need to know about the MMA promotion\u2019s upcoming fights</p>", "author": "Alex Pattle", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 08:50:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:47.175156", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T08:50:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/10/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It\u2019s his only bogey of the day but that could well be the most important putt he has made all day. It might sting initially, but when he reflects on the round later there will be a lot of positives. Too often has he played himself out of contention after the opening 18 and that is far from the case this time.Koepka\u2019s birdie attempt misses by a whisker and he finishes with a one-over-par 71. That\u2019s not the start he would have wanted and, with tougher conditions expected tomorrow, it may well be difficult for him to climb the leaderboard. The same can be said for Matsuyama who ends on two over par after a round of 72. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:061686880985Trouble for Rory on the last McIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)Oh, Rory...right at the end and he\u2019s in all sorts of bother. His iron into the last green leaks to the left and it\u2019s in the thick greenside rough. At the first attempt, he tries to lift it out with a lob wedge but it doesn\u2019t move.He gets it out at the second attempt but he now has a testing putt to avoid double bogey - the margins of golf. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:031686880726Great day for Harman Harman -5 (65)There is a chance for birdie at the last for Brian Harman but he can\u2019t convert and taps in for par. Another unusually low round of golf here at the US Open but Harman won\u2019t care one bit - he\u2019s in the clubhouse at five under and just three off the lead after his first round. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:581686880578Final-hole bogey for Johnson Johnson -6 (64)That is quite the sight on the last as Johnson flies his tee shot way over the hole. He is playing onto the ninth but ends up in the bunker on 18!From there, it\u2019s a good chip, all things considered, but he can\u2019t make the par-saving putt and he drops back to six under for the round. Regardless, a very good opening round by the two-time major champion who has made the most of these benign first-round conditions.Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:561686880313Bogey at the last for BennettSmith -1 (69), Bennett -3 (67), Fitzpatrick +1 (71)A disappointing finish for Sam Bennett, who is unable to get up and down from the sand and ends with back-to-back bogeys. He drops back to three under par but that\u2019s still a hugely promising first round from the young professional. Cam Smith also finds himself in the second after his second and he makes bogey to sign off with a one-under-par 69. Matt Fitzpatrick- the defending champion - finishes one over par for his round. \nBen Fleming16 June 2023 02:511686880157McIlroy takes care of the hardest holeMcIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)A four is a very good score on the penultimate hole and Rory makes no mistake with a good two-putt from the heart of the green. Koepka and Matsuyama both make par as well as this trio head to the last. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:491686880036Harman drops a shotHarman -5 (17)This lengthy 17th was always going to prove a problem for a shorter hitter like Brian Harman and he\u2019s in the greenside bunker on the penultimate hole. He\u2019s unable to scramble out of the sand and that\u2019s a bogey to move him down to five under with one to play. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:471686879878Johnson into secondJohnson -7 (17*)What a superb second-nine Dustin Johnson is putting together. He makes the most of the par-five eighth to notch up his fifth birdie since making the turn and move to seven under par.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGareth Southgate says \u201cthere is a line\u201d, as he revealed he has privately spoken to Jack Grealish and Manchester City players about the extent of their treble celebrations.The England manager refused to directly discuss his playmaker, after Grealish visibly made himself the centre of a three-day party that also involved a trip to Ibiza. There is a belief around the squad that Southgate was unhappy with just how excessive the celebrations were, although he stressed that he does plan to use the City players for at least some part of Friday night\u2019s match away to Malta.\u201cThere is a line,\u201d the manager said in Valletta, when directly asked. Although he was repeatedly questioned about Grealish, Southgate just talked more generally about celebrations, while also saying he would keep all discussions in-house.\u201cAnything like that I would do privately,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think that would serve any purpose me discussing that publicly, really.\u201dI think that, as I said, I have spoken with the players. We have talked about where the focus needs to be, where we need them to be and acknowledged what they have experienced and that\u2019s for me to manage over the coming weeks.\u201dRecommendedFootball rumours: Tottenham bid \u00a350m for James Maddison and Harvey BarnesGareth Southgate urges players not to cross the line with celebrationsWill Marcus Rashford make a qualifier return? \u2013 5 talking pointsEngland face forgiving fixtures away to Malta on Friday and at home to North Macedonia on Monday at Old Trafford. Southgate said he hadn't planned on starting the City players in Valletta, but that he has been thinking of bringing them on.\u201cI have got a good squad to pick from. We weren\u2019t considering those boys to start this game. We were hopeful they could play some part and that is still the case. But with the tactical preparation that we knew we needed to do earlier in the week, we always knew they were going to report Tuesday night, Wednesday was going to be light and Thursday the usual light session. So unless we had a problem we were not aiming to put those players into this game.\u201cFor now the focus with all of the Man City boys is just get them right for these games. So inevitably we just don\u2019t know what that emotional dip is going to be for them. They need to recover, they need to sleep, they need to eat well and we want to get them ready. I\u2019ve seen enough to know what could help us tomorrow and then Monday is a few days further on. We\u2019ll have to see what we come out of this game with as much as anything else, really.\u201dSouthgate admitted that his stance on such issues has to be firm, since it is the nature of players to monitor his response and see where the lines are. (Getty Images)\u201cThey look at every meeting you hold, every discussion you have. They are always assessing how you deal with situations. They look for a lead and for clues in how you deal with things. I don\u2019t think they would have felt anything usual about how we have dealt with this and how we have embraced the players back in to the group. We have also got the dynamic that while they are chuffed to bits and we are proud of them, a few others are pretty pissed off that they have won it at their expense. You are always really conscious of that.\u201dSouthgate did admit that the very scale of the Champions League final as a fixture is part of it, too, as he takes over England's most successful ever squad in that regard.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this scenario three or four times in the last few years with our players leading into games... It\u2019s a huge occasion. So we\u2019re in a fortunate position that we\u2019ve got a lot of our players in for the full training week and we were able to work tactically.\u201cAnd we needed to give those guys the time to take everything in. But point number one, they all wanted to come in to be with the group, which is fantastic. And as I said to them \u2013 we are all in the unknown a little bit. We\u2019ve had teams in the Champions League but we haven\u2019t had a team that has won a treble so for that group of players and staff, things will never be the same again because you never get that group together again and everything changes in their lives.\u201cWhenever you have a group with us, it\u2019s always slightly different [every time] \u2013 you\u2019re always monitoring where every individual is at. We have potentially so many things going on this summer that could distract if we allow it to but I\u2019ve not seen that this week with the players.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSteve Harmison stood at the top of his mark, all alone. It is a naked place, preparing to bowl the first ball of a most-likely doomed Ashes series in a bearpit like the Gabba, surrounded by a wall of 40,000 rabid Brisbanites who do not wish you well and are vocally letting you know about it. As he ran towards the crease the noise grew louder. Harmison has tried many times to explain what happened next, why the ball flew diagonally out of his grasp, skidded off the wicket and ended up in the lap of captain Andrew Flintoff at second slip. \u201cI froze,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cMy whole body was nervous. I could not get my hands to stop sweating. The first ball slipped out of my hands, the second did as well and, after that, I had no rhythm, nothing.\u201dHaving stewed on that moment in December 2006 for more than a decade, he said in 2017: \u201cI was trying far too hard to bowl too fast. Did I freeze? Possibly. I just think I tried too hard.\u201dSteve Harmison and Justin Langer watch his delivery fly towards Freddie Flintoff at second slip  (Getty)It is something unique in Test cricket before that first ball is bowled \u2013 the wait. The batsman shuffles on his crease, the wicketkeeper claps his gloves, the umpire straightens his hat. The morning sun has just emerged over the stadium and it feels like the start of something, something that may be magical or dramatic or destructive \u2013 no one yet knows what, but it will definitely be something. After all the build-up and preparation and mind games, the world slows down in those last few seconds before an Ashes series finally begins. And perhaps the ability of a lead bowler or batsman to handle that moment, that scrutiny, can ripple across the grass and take hold of a team.Harmison\u2019s famous wide has long been credited with \u201csetting the tone\u201d for what was to come: England meekly surrendering the Ashes in a 5-0 whitewash. But does the first ball of the series really indicate \u2013 even influence \u2013 what follows?RecommendedA look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerMost opening balls down the years have been uneventful, offering little in the way of a forecast, but there have been some significant moments. In 1994, Michael Slater bludgeoned England\u2019s stand-in fast bowler Phil DeFreitas\u2019s first delivery to the Gabba boundary, then proceeded to rack up a merciless 176. Needless to say, Australia won the series.\u201cI suppose DeFreitas being cut for four first ball did set the tone,\u201d Phil Tufnell later reflected. \u201cAt the time it really didn\u2019t feel like the end of the world. We just thought: \u2018Oh right, that\u2019s gone for four, next ball.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a groan around the fielders or anything. It\u2019s only looking back you can see that it was one of those moments.\u201dIn the previous Ashes before his infamous wide, Harmison had opened the 2005 series with a fierce over of pace and bounce at Lord\u2019s. The first ball whistled between Justin Langer\u2019s off-stump and his nose, and the second crashed into the batsman\u2019s arm. Yet England lost that Test convincingly, and it was only later that they rallied to eventual victory.Then there was 2010, when Australian bowler Ben Hilfenhaus served up a loose opener in Brisbane which Andrew Strauss comfortably let by. Strauss\u2019s control of the situation was mirrored by England\u2019s performance as they clinched a 3-1 victory and won their first Ashes on Australian soil for 24 years. Yet that first delivery was no omen: Strauss was out two balls later, caught behind for a duck.Andrew Strauss loses his wicket to Ben Hilfenhaus (Getty)Langer certainly believed Harmison\u2019s wide ball in 2006 was more significant than the value of one Australian run, after which \u201cEngland\u2019s body language seemed flat and even a little intimidated\u201d.\u201cTo be perfectly truthful, I felt let down after that first ball,\u201d Langer said. \u201cIt was such a comedown after Lord\u2019s in 2005, where I remember the ball flying past my nose to Geraint Jones. I looked around and England were looking at their toes. It was just a huge letdown and that first ball was really key.\u201dHarmison rejects that idea. \u201cThat ball in Brisbane on the 2006-07 Ashes tour didn\u2019t set the tone,\u201d he wrote in his book, Speed Demons. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough to beat Australia, whether that first ball of the series happened or not.\u201dPerhaps \u201csetting the tone\u201d is just an easy answer with hindsight. What the first ball really can do is solidify a feeling in the air. Australia were overwhelming favourites when England turned up in Brisbane again in 2021, and that sense of inevitability was quickly reinforced. Mitchell Starc started the series with an 88mph swinger which wrapped around Rory Burns\u2019 legs and clattered the stumps. The \u201cGabbatoir\u201d had another first-ball victim. Burns\u2019 Test career never recovered, and neither did England, losing the match by nine wickets and the series 4-0. Burns was memorably bowled by Starc with the first ball of the 2021 series (PA)RecommendedAshes rivals unite in honour of Nottingham victims on opening day of seriesBen Stokes urges his England players to become a part of Ashes folkloreBen Stokes, England\u2019s unexpected captain, leans on history for Ashes lift-offThat was the last \u201cfirst ball\u201d. England have sparked an unimaginable shift in the Test cricket landscape since then. The next one could be James Anderson to David Warner, or perhaps Starc to Zak Crawley. For all England\u2019s talk of fearless cricket, Crawley pumping the first ball to the Edgbaston boundary would be an apt way to spell out what\u2019s to come this summer.England would do well to be wary, though \u2013 they have generally been on the wrong end of most dramatic Ashes starts, and head coach Brendon McCullum knows the consequences of going hard early. He tried to knock out the floodlights at the start of the 2015 World Cup final, only to swing and miss, handing over New Zealand\u2019s most prized wicket. The bowler that day was Starc too, and Australia never looked back."}, {"_id": "648c550851ac33b09b54d6d5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/conor-mcgregor-ufc-miami-heat-the-irishman-miami-b2358724.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Conor McGregor denies allegation he sexually assaulted a woman at NBA Finals", "lead": "The Irishman has been accused of an attack in a bathroom at a basketball match in Miami.", "author": "Rob Freeman", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 06:25:02", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:48.370387", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T06:25:02+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/07/10-7e51a43ca9054daf9f508ed9104de5cb.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe most eagerly anticipated Ashes summer since 2005 is a matter of hours away, pitting Ben Stokes\u2019 fearless England side against an Australia team that was last week crowned Test world champions.Stokes has urged his side to stay true to the attacking principles that have roused a team that was in the doldrums after a 4-0 thrashing Down Under 18 months ago.The England skipper knows he cannot promise victory at Edgbaston \u2013 or over the course of the next six weeks \u2013 but he has guaranteed entertainment.Australia, meanwhile, are searching for the second major prize on a tour that captain Pat Cummins admits could be \u201clegacy defining\u201d.Having knocked off India to claim the ICC\u2019s World Test Championship mace, they now want to win behind enemy lines for the first time since 2001.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveNumber\u2019s gameClash of the titansUnder head coach Brendon McCullum and Stokes, England\u2019s potential has been truly unleashed, racking up 11 wins in 13 Tests. Arguably more impressive has been their expansive style, going at breakneck pace when batting \u2013 among the new benchmarks they set in 2022 was the highest run-rate (4.13) and most sixes (89) in a calendar year.What might slip under the radar is that they have taken 20 wickets a dozen times. The naysayers \u2013 fewer and farther between these days \u2013 point out Australia are the acid test of what has been termed \u2018Bazball\u2019.In quicks Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland and spinner Nathan Lyon the tourists have an embarrassment of riches to select from. Australia\u2019s three, four and five \u2013 Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Travis Head \u2013 are numbers one, two and three in the International Cricket Council Test batting rankings. And their tail is up after winning last week\u2019s World Test Championship final. An absorbing five matches await.What they said\n\nThe last three days have been really good for my confidence. I've bowled every day so far and been able to run in with more intensity day by day, so I've got myself in a real good place to be able to bowlBen StokesQuestions have abounded about Stokes\u2019 left knee for several months, leading to speculation about whether he would be able to perform as an all-rounder. He has steadily built up his workload in the past 72 hours and seems poised to give England\u2019s bowling attack an extra arrow in their quiver.Will pride come before a fall for Australia?The last Australia coach to win England, John Buchanan, was also the man in charge in 2005 when Michael Vaughan\u2019s settled side scored an unforgettable win. Buchanan knows a thing or two about the ins and outs of the rivalry, ending his Ashes association with a whitewash in 2006/07.He told the PA news agency that the key factor in this year\u2019s edition would be whether Australia could shelve any temptation to get involved in an attacking shootout and instead focus on their own fundamentals.\u201cPlayers\u2019 ego, team ego, that will be the whole game,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to not allow their ego to get in the road of their batting. I would expect the coach Andrew McDonald to be hammering that home, saying: \u2018Bat long, bat lots\u2019.\u201dOne last round for old sparring partnersMany expected the Hobart Test in January 2022 to be the final time long-time rivals Stuart Broad and David Warner ever crossed paths.Despite pressure over their places, both men are back on parade in Birmingham and theirs is perhaps the most intriguing battle within the battle.Broad dismissed Warner seven times in 10 innings in the 2019 series in England, a nadir for the punchy left-hander who will be eager to put those bad memories to bed. Expect the theatrics to start the first time Broad gets the new ball in his hand.Mo, Mo, MoA cruel back injury to \u2018Bazball\u2019 ever-present Jack Leach and a dearth of domestic spinners led to Stokes sending out an SOS to one of England\u2019s most mercurial Test cricketers.RecommendedXander Schauffele predicts \u2018nasty\u2019 US Open after record-breaking first dayFowler and Schauffele equal lowest score in men\u2019s major championship historyBelgium overcome personal issues to beat Finland at World Cup of DartsDespite his last red-ball match being in September 2021, Moeen Ali cheerily returns, admitting only the siren call of Stokes and the lure of the Ashes were the twin forces that saw him, at least temporarily, reverse his Test retirement.As well as a second Ashes series victory, Moeen, who currently has 2,914 runs and 195 wickets after 64 Tests, has the chance to rack up another couple of personal milestones."}, {"_id": "648c550951ac33b09b54d6d9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/xander-schauffele-scottie-scheffler-jon-rahm-brooks-koepka-rory-mcilroy-b2358661.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Xander Schauffele predicts \u2018nasty\u2019 US Open after record-breaking first day", "lead": "Joint leader expects tougher times ahead as greens firm up after equalling lowest round in major history.", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 03:30:03", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:49.247368", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T03:30:03+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/04/15-f781a2f1883c4abcb283ba56e64c3b48.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

There is a way to go in this tournament but we\u2019ve already got one hell of a leaderboard. Thanks for tuning in today and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow for all the action from round two!Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:231686881880LeaderboardWith round one almost finished, here is a look at the top of the leaderboard:-8: Fowler, Schauffele-6: Johnson, Clark-5: McIlroy, Harman,-3: Scheffler, DeChambeau, Bennett, SW Kim, English, BarjonBen Fleming16 June 2023 03:181686881209Bogey to finish for McIlroy McIlroy -5 (65), Koepka +1 (71), Matsuyama +2 (72)It\u2019s a little over eleven feet for the bogey...and he makes it! It\u2019s his only bogey of the day but that could well be the most important putt he has made all day. It might sting initially, but when he reflects on the round later there will be a lot of positives. Too often has he played himself out of contention after the opening 18 and that is far from the case this time.Koepka\u2019s birdie attempt misses by a whisker and he finishes with a one-over-par 71. That\u2019s not the start he would have wanted and, with tougher conditions expected tomorrow, it may well be difficult for him to climb the leaderboard. The same can be said for Matsuyama who ends on two over par after a round of 72. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:061686880985Trouble for Rory on the last McIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)Oh, Rory...right at the end and he\u2019s in all sorts of bother. His iron into the last green leaks to the left and it\u2019s in the thick greenside rough. At the first attempt, he tries to lift it out with a lob wedge but it doesn\u2019t move.He gets it out at the second attempt but he now has a testing putt to avoid double bogey - the margins of golf. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:031686880726Great day for Harman Harman -5 (65)There is a chance for birdie at the last for Brian Harman but he can\u2019t convert and taps in for par. Another unusually low round of golf here at the US Open but Harman won\u2019t care one bit - he\u2019s in the clubhouse at five under and just three off the lead after his first round. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:581686880578Final-hole bogey for Johnson Johnson -6 (64)That is quite the sight on the last as Johnson flies his tee shot way over the hole. He is playing onto the ninth but ends up in the bunker on 18!From there, it\u2019s a good chip, all things considered, but he can\u2019t make the par-saving putt and he drops back to six under for the round. Regardless, a very good opening round by the two-time major champion who has made the most of these benign first-round conditions.Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:561686880313Bogey at the last for BennettSmith -1 (69), Bennett -3 (67), Fitzpatrick +1 (71)A disappointing finish for Sam Bennett, who is unable to get up and down from the sand and ends with back-to-back bogeys. He drops back to three under par but that\u2019s still a hugely promising first round from the young professional. Cam Smith also finds himself in the second after his second and he makes bogey to sign off with a one-under-par 69. Matt Fitzpatrick- the defending champion - finishes one over par for his round. \nBen Fleming16 June 2023 02:511686880157McIlroy takes care of the hardest holeMcIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)A four is a very good score on the penultimate hole and Rory makes no mistake with a good two-putt from the heart of the green. Koepka and Matsuyama both make par as well as this trio head to the last.

They are undoubtedly a world-class team, a team that has a lot of world stars in it.\u201cThis is a different game entirely.

We have talked about where the focus needs to be, where we need them to be and acknowledged what they have experienced and that\u2019s for me to manage.\u201cA few of our players would be teetotal. What is different is that everyone posts everything. I wouldn\u2019t have liked a few of my nights out to be posted publicly. My generation would have a lot more problems.\u201cWe know, talking to Hendo (Jordan Henderson), Harry Kane, Tripps (Kieran Trippier) what that game takes out of you.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge occasion and we needed to give those guys the time to take everything in but, point number one, they all wanted to come in to be with the group, which is fantastic.\u201cI don\u2019t think they would have felt anything unusual about how we have dealt with this and how we have embraced the players back in to the group.\u201cWe have also got the dynamic that while they are chuffed to bits and we are proud of them, a few others are pretty p****d off that they have won it at their expense.

The performances of the team are going to ebb and flow, the connection with the fans feels completely different now.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what we have done in the last few years, last few games, we have to go again tomorrow night and make sure that we give our fans something to be excited about.\u201dMeanwhile, Kieran Trippier believes the squad needs to embrace their final games of the season.England, top of Group C, also host North Macedonia at Old Trafford on Monday aiming to solidify their lead following March\u2019s wins over Ukraine and Italy.It will cap a season which also saw the first winter World Cup in November and December with the Premier League having finished three weeks ago.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult.

The programme was just to work on my fitness and things and strength to give myself the best chance to get that contract.\u201cIt was back at home in the gym and stuff to make sure that if I looked back and had regrets, it would kick me, you know? So it was to make sure I gave my all and even if I didn\u2019t get it, I could say I tried my best.\u201cI told him thanks for it. It\u2019ll be a proud moment for him if I play for England here at a major tournament.\u201dHis career path has sky rocketed since then and he has become hot property, with a host of top European clubs reported to be interested in signing him this summer.But he has hinted that a return to Goodison Park could be on the cards as he eyes a Premier League career.\n\nI would probably say I was close to giving up.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRecords were broken after a low-scoring first round of the 2023 US Open at Los Angeles Country Club with Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele setting the early pace.It is the first time in 75 years that the US Open is being played in the city, with LA Country Club hosting the event for the first time. A challenging layout was expected for the players but, with little wind, there were birdies on offer. Rickie Fowler leads the way at eight under par which, in turn, broke the record for the lowest round in US Open history. Xander Schauffle would join him in the record books minutes later after the American also shot an eight-under round.Rory McIlroy suffered a hiccup at the last, with bogey souring what was otherwise an excellent round from the four-time major champion. He sits at five under par alongside Brian Harman with LIV star Dustin Johnson and Wyndham Clark a shot better at six under.Scottie Scheffler remains well in contention at three-under par, while world number one Jon Rahm sits at one under. Brooks Koepka was among the favourites to back up his victory in the US PGA Championship but shot a disappointing one-over-par 71 to sit nine shots back of the lead.

Few could have expected scores that low and one suspects the USGA will be meeting overnight to ensure tougher conditions tomorrow. There is a way to go in this tournament but we\u2019ve already got one hell of a leaderboard. Thanks for tuning in today and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow for all the action from round two!Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:231686881880LeaderboardWith round one almost finished, here is a look at the top of the leaderboard:-8: Fowler, Schauffele-6: Johnson, Clark-5: McIlroy, Harman,-3: Scheffler, DeChambeau, Bennett, SW Kim, English, BarjonBen Fleming16 June 2023 03:181686881209Bogey to finish for McIlroy McIlroy -5 (65), Koepka +1 (71), Matsuyama +2 (72)It\u2019s a little over eleven feet for the bogey...and he makes it! It\u2019s his only bogey of the day but that could well be the most important putt he has made all day. It might sting initially, but when he reflects on the round later there will be a lot of positives. Too often has he played himself out of contention after the opening 18 and that is far from the case this time.Koepka\u2019s birdie attempt misses by a whisker and he finishes with a one-over-par 71. That\u2019s not the start he would have wanted and, with tougher conditions expected tomorrow, it may well be difficult for him to climb the leaderboard. The same can be said for Matsuyama who ends on two over par after a round of 72. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:061686880985Trouble for Rory on the last McIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)Oh, Rory...right at the end and he\u2019s in all sorts of bother. His iron into the last green leaks to the left and it\u2019s in the thick greenside rough. At the first attempt, he tries to lift it out with a lob wedge but it doesn\u2019t move.He gets it out at the second attempt but he now has a testing putt to avoid double bogey - the margins of golf. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:031686880726Great day for Harman Harman -5 (65)There is a chance for birdie at the last for Brian Harman but he can\u2019t convert and taps in for par. Another unusually low round of golf here at the US Open but Harman won\u2019t care one bit - he\u2019s in the clubhouse at five under and just three off the lead after his first round. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:581686880578Final-hole bogey for Johnson Johnson -6 (64)That is quite the sight on the last as Johnson flies his tee shot way over the hole. He is playing onto the ninth but ends up in the bunker on 18!From there, it\u2019s a good chip, all things considered, but he can\u2019t make the par-saving putt and he drops back to six under for the round. Regardless, a very good opening round by the two-time major champion who has made the most of these benign first-round conditions.Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:561686880313Bogey at the last for BennettSmith -1 (69), Bennett -3 (67), Fitzpatrick +1 (71)A disappointing finish for Sam Bennett, who is unable to get up and down from the sand and ends with back-to-back bogeys. He drops back to three under par but that\u2019s still a hugely promising first round from the young professional. Cam Smith also finds himself in the second after his second and he makes bogey to sign off with a one-under-par 69. Matt Fitzpatrick- the defending champion - finishes one over par for his round. \nBen Fleming16 June 2023 02:511686880157McIlroy takes care of the hardest holeMcIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)A four is a very good score on the penultimate hole and Rory makes no mistake with a good two-putt from the heart of the green. Koepka and Matsuyama both make par as well as this trio head to the last. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:491686880036Harman drops a shotHarman -5 (17)This lengthy 17th was always going to prove a problem for a shorter hitter like Brian Harman and he\u2019s in the greenside bunker on the penultimate hole. He\u2019s unable to scramble out of the sand and that\u2019s a bogey to move him down to five under with one to play. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:471686879878Johnson into secondJohnson -7 (17*)What a superb second-nine Dustin Johnson is putting together. He makes the most of the par-five eighth to notch up his fifth birdie since making the turn and move to seven under par.

Glad he was just in front of me\u201cThe sun didn\u2019t come out and it was misting this morning, so I\u2019d say the greens held a little bit more moisture than anticipated for myself at least.

That win in Kosovo was England\u2019s final match before the coronavirus pandemic temporarily halted the international calendar. Rashford had to pull out of numerous camps over the subsequent years and his decision to head to New York in March while England were winning their group opener 2-1 in Italy sparked debate. Gareth Southgate defended the injured forward\u2019s decision to jet off to the United States and Rashford insisted this week he is fully committed to England, saying he does not care if onlookers criticise or question his dedication to the national team.Have City stars sobered up?England\u2019s quintet of bleary-eyed Manchester City players rocked up at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday evening on the back of some wild celebrations.

John Stones, Kalvin Phillips, Kyle Walker and Phil Foden also partied after making history in Istanbul all the way onto Monday\u2019s rain-soaked parade in Manchester. The five players all travelled to Malta for the match and Southgate has a decision to make over their availability.New faces to feature?Eberechi Eze is eyeing a senior debut after being included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the first time. This opportunity has been a long time coming for the 24-year-old, who would have been involved sooner had it not been for an Achilles injury suffered on the same day as he found he had made England\u2019s provisional Euro 2020 squad in May 2021. Inspired form in the latter stages of the season under Roy Hodgson saw him included for June\u2019s double-header. There is also a chance of Levi Colwill could make his debut. Part of the England Under-21s squad heading to this summers Euros, he trained with the squad this week after his Brighton team-mate Lewis Dunk was forced to withdraw through injury. Initially just a training role, Colwill has been brought with the squad to Malta so has a chance of also making his bow.RecommendedAndy Murray feeling \u2018really positive\u2019 over fitness as winning run continuesGareth Southgate undecided on whether to select Man City stars against MaltaNorthern Ireland veteran Jonny Evans has no intention of walking awayCan the Maltese cause England a scare?The bookmakers\u2019 odds underline the task facing the team ranked 172nd in the world.

The matches haven\u2019t been too long, the final in Surbiton was quite a quick one and then the first round here as well, so I\u2019m recovering well,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of matches for me, and I\u2019m an old boy now so it takes me a little bit longer to recover but I\u2019m feeling good.\u201cI love competing obviously. At times I get frustrated but for me that\u2019s always been part of competing. I want to do my best and when I\u2019m not doing that I obviously get frustrated with myself, but it was a really nice atmosphere today and hopefully that will keep progressing as we go along.\u201dToday\u2019s match against Grenier proved a different proposition for Murray than his first round win versus Joris De Loore, with the Frenchman having more grass guile.But it was nothing that fazed the two-time Wimbledon champion, who was barely threatened on serve and was able to close out the match with little fuss.He added: \u201cIt was a very different match to the first day. He played with quite a lot of variety and he liked to come to the net, he served well.\u201cFrom the back of the court he didn\u2019t have a lot of power but he used a lot of slice and angles, slowballed me a little bit. It was very different to the first match but it felt like I dealt with it quite well.\u201cI was dictating quite a lot of the rallies and in the second set I just had to hang in on his service games as he was serving extremely well, and I managed to get the break at the end.\u201dAndy Murray recorded a seventh consecutive win with straight set victory over Hugo Grenier (Getty Images for LTA)Elsewhere, it was a historic day for British women\u2019s tennis in Nottingham, with there now being four British women in the quarter-final of a WTA event for the first time in history.After Heather Watson had beaten Wimbledon semi-finalist Tatjana Maria on Wednesday, Katie Boulter, Harriet Dart and Jodie Burrage all won their second round matches on Thursday to reach the last eight.Boulter started Wednesday\u2019s action with a 7-5 6-3 win over Ukrainian lucky loser Daria Snigur while Dart followed that with a win over another Ukrainian in the form of fifth seed Anhelina Kalinina, beating the Italian Open finalist 6-0 7-5.Boulter and Dart will now face off in the last eight on Friday, ensuring that at least one Brit will be in semi-final action on Saturday.RecommendedHeather Watson beats \u2018friend\u2019 Tatjana Maria to reach Nottingham Open quartersAndy Murray shaken by \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 Nottingham attacksMurray sets ambitious Wimbledon target after sixth straight victoryAnd Burrage will be hoping to join one of them and potentially Watson after she beat Polish third seed and this year\u2019s Australian Open semi-finalist Magda Linette 7-5 6-3 to reach her first ever WTA Tour quarter-final, with another Pole in the form of Magdalena Frech waiting on Friday.For the latest action on the British summer grass court season, check out the LTA website"}, {"_id": "648c550c51ac33b09b54d6ed", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/diamond-league-oslo-schedule-results-2023-b2358055.html", "primaryCategory": "Athletics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Diamond League Oslo schedule and start lists", "lead": "<p>Everything you need to know ahead of the fifth event of the season </p>", "author": "Harry Latham-Coyle", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 19:15:55", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:52.936576", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T19:15:55+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/09/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Saturday\u2019s broadcast, however, was an unusually painful one: with the Yankees trying to close out a 3-1 win over the rival Red Sox in the ninth inning, Boston\u2019s Justin Turner fouled a ball backwards that went through the window of Sterling\u2019s broadcast booth and hit him in the head. \u201cSwung on and a pop foul ... back here,\u201d Sterling called, shortly before the ball hit him. \u201cOw!

I want to keep playing, and that\u2019ll be the same at club level and international football.\u201dEvans returned from two months out to start Leicester\u2019s final three games of the season, but admitted he was still unsure over his fitness levels after a campaign in which he managed only 14 club appearances.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where I\u2019m at,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think those three games I was involved in were good for me, I was just glad to get through them.\u201dA 2-1 win over West Ham on the final day of the season was not enough to spare Leicester from the drop as Everton beat Bournemouth to survive. Evans is still dealing with the disappointment, but said coming away with Northern Ireland offered a welcome change of scenery.\u201cInternational football has always been that for you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go back home and I always feel that when you go back home you are grounded a little bit.\u201cThere is a calmness to it and it gives you something inside.

A challenging layout was expected for the players but, with little wind, there were birdies on offer. Rickie Fowler leads the way at eight under par which, in turn, broke the record for the lowest round in US Open history. Xander Schauffle would join him in the record books minutes later after the American also shot an eight-under round.Rory McIlroy suffered a hiccup at the last, with bogey souring what was otherwise an excellent round from the four-time major champion. He sits at five under par alongside Brian Harman with LIV star Dustin Johnson and Wyndham Clark a shot better at six under.Scottie Scheffler remains well in contention at three-under par, while world number one Jon Rahm sits at one under. Brooks Koepka was among the favourites to back up his victory in the US PGA Championship but shot a disappointing one-over-par 71 to sit nine shots back of the lead.

There is a way to go in this tournament but we\u2019ve already got one hell of a leaderboard. Thanks for tuning in today and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow for all the action from round two!Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:231686881880LeaderboardWith round one almost finished, here is a look at the top of the leaderboard:-8: Fowler, Schauffele-6: Johnson, Clark-5: McIlroy, Harman,-3: Scheffler, DeChambeau, Bennett, SW Kim, English, BarjonBen Fleming16 June 2023 03:181686881209Bogey to finish for McIlroy McIlroy -5 (65), Koepka +1 (71), Matsuyama +2 (72)It\u2019s a little over eleven feet for the bogey...and he makes it! It\u2019s his only bogey of the day but that could well be the most important putt he has made all day. It might sting initially, but when he reflects on the round later there will be a lot of positives. Too often has he played himself out of contention after the opening 18 and that is far from the case this time.Koepka\u2019s birdie attempt misses by a whisker and he finishes with a one-over-par 71. That\u2019s not the start he would have wanted and, with tougher conditions expected tomorrow, it may well be difficult for him to climb the leaderboard. The same can be said for Matsuyama who ends on two over par after a round of 72. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:061686880985Trouble for Rory on the last McIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)Oh, Rory...right at the end and he\u2019s in all sorts of bother. His iron into the last green leaks to the left and it\u2019s in the thick greenside rough. At the first attempt, he tries to lift it out with a lob wedge but it doesn\u2019t move.He gets it out at the second attempt but he now has a testing putt to avoid double bogey - the margins of golf. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 03:031686880726Great day for Harman Harman -5 (65)There is a chance for birdie at the last for Brian Harman but he can\u2019t convert and taps in for par. Another unusually low round of golf here at the US Open but Harman won\u2019t care one bit - he\u2019s in the clubhouse at five under and just three off the lead after his first round. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:581686880578Final-hole bogey for Johnson Johnson -6 (64)That is quite the sight on the last as Johnson flies his tee shot way over the hole. He is playing onto the ninth but ends up in the bunker on 18!From there, it\u2019s a good chip, all things considered, but he can\u2019t make the par-saving putt and he drops back to six under for the round. Regardless, a very good opening round by the two-time major champion who has made the most of these benign first-round conditions.Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:561686880313Bogey at the last for BennettSmith -1 (69), Bennett -3 (67), Fitzpatrick +1 (71)A disappointing finish for Sam Bennett, who is unable to get up and down from the sand and ends with back-to-back bogeys. He drops back to three under par but that\u2019s still a hugely promising first round from the young professional. Cam Smith also finds himself in the second after his second and he makes bogey to sign off with a one-under-par 69. Matt Fitzpatrick- the defending champion - finishes one over par for his round. \nBen Fleming16 June 2023 02:511686880157McIlroy takes care of the hardest holeMcIlroy -6 (17), Koepka +1 (17), Matsuyama +2 (17)A four is a very good score on the penultimate hole and Rory makes no mistake with a good two-putt from the heart of the green. Koepka and Matsuyama both make par as well as this trio head to the last. Ben Fleming16 June 2023 02:491686880036Harman drops a shotHarman -5 (17)This lengthy 17th was always going to prove a problem for a shorter hitter like Brian Harman and he\u2019s in the greenside bunker on the penultimate hole. He\u2019s unable to scramble out of the sand and that\u2019s a bogey to move him down to five under with one to play.

We\u2019ll rely heavily on our experienced players as well. It\u2019s a game we can only gain from really.\u201cObviously we were disappointed with the home game against Finland (a 1-0 defeat in March), we felt we deserved more than we got, so we\u2019ve got to try and make up points somewhere along the line. This is a hard place to play, but we\u2019ll go with the intention of trying to find something from the game.\u201dThe 38,000-seater Parken Stadium can become an intimidating place for visiting teams, but while it might be unlike anything Northern Ireland\u2019s younger players have experienced before, O\u2019Neill does not want them to shy away.\n\nThe thing I've enjoyed in working with the younger players is I see their attitude to the game, it's very positive, I don't think they'll have a fearMichael O'Neill\u201cI think they should embrace it really more than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThe message will be go out and enjoy playing in a stadium like this\u2026\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve enjoyed in working with the younger players is I see their attitude to the game, it\u2019s very positive, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have a fear.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of self-belief and abilities in the likes of Shea Charles, Isaac Price, Conor Bradley, Trai Hume, they play in games where they\u2019ve a lot of expectancy where they\u2019re currently playing their football.\u201cI think we have to have that mindset that we\u2019ve got everything to gain from Friday night and not fear the atmosphere but look forward to it.\u201dOne key challenge for Northern Ireland will be limiting Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen\u2019s ability to dictate play from the centre of pitch.\u201cWe understand we are dealing with a top level player here,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant seeing him back playing international football.\u201cThe days of man marking players is more difficult now but as a team we have made the midfield players in particular very aware of the Danish midfield and Christian Eriksen is the major player in that midfield. He is a hugely experienced player at international level.\u201cI think to deal with players at that level it\u2019s more about what we do as a collective as opposed to possibly that designated player to deal with that situation.\u201dBoth sides come into the game nursing disappointments from the last round of fixtures in March.Denmark suffered a shock defeat to Kazakhstan, blowing a 2-0 lead as their unfancied hosts scored three in the last 20 minutes, while O\u2019Neill\u2019s first game back in charge at Windsor Park ended in that loss to Finland.O\u2019Neill insisted he was not interested in making any sort of statement by claiming a big scalp on Friday, but his mind is on making up for what he sees as lost points.RecommendedRepublic boss Stephen Kenny hopes to exorcise ghost of Cristiano RonaldoAshes rivals unite in honour of Nottingham victims on opening day of seriesBen Stokes urges his England players to become a part of Ashes folklore\u201cIt would give us six points and it would make up for the disappointment of Finland,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about sending out a statement.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBen Stokes has told his team a big Ashes summer will \u201cnever be forgotten\u201d as he prepares to lead England\u2019s battle to reclaim the urn for the first time since 2015.Stokes already owns a significant slice of Ashes history, with his match-winning century at Headingley four years ago inked into the folklore of cricket\u2019s most storied series.He and his 10 team-mates will step out at a reliably raucous Edgbaston on Friday morning with the chance to add another memorable moment in a rivalry that echoes through the ages.Speaking on the eve of the first Test, he said: \u201cAny individual who finds themselves either having a great series or a great individual performance, that will never be forgotten.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cWhen the Ashes comes around it\u2019s the big one on the calendar. Legacies are defined by the people who talk about the individual, and we all know if you do well in the Ashes you\u2019re going to be spoken about throughout many a year.\u201dStokes also called on the Birmingham crowd, who have made a name for themselves as the liveliest on the English circuit, to seize their chance to play a role in lifting the hosts.\u201cThe crowd here is so, so good and loud. It\u2019s amazing. We know what it\u2019s like in Australia..when we\u2019re at the MCG, all these places when the home crowd is on top of you, you do know you\u2019re the away team.\u201cWhat I would say to the people who come here and watch is regardless of how things are going out there, just be with us. What we\u2019re trying to do, over and over again, is make it worth their time coming to watch us play cricket.\u201dStokes has certainly delivered on that promise since taking over as skipper. In insisting his teams stay permanently on the front foot and take the attacking option whenever they can, he has not only overhauled their results \u2013 with 11 wins from 13 matches \u2013 he has revamped their identity.Urged on by a like-minded head coach in Brendon McCullum, he has never wavered in his commitment to the philosophy and laughed off the idea that the arrival of Australia would change things now.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question around how we are going to go out and play our cricket, even though it\u2019s against Australia,\u201d he said.\u201cAll I want is for the team to go out there and keep pushing the boundaries of what we\u2019ve achieved so far. As long as we can stay true to that then I will be a happy and proud captain regardless of the result at the end of the series.\u201cIf we play the way we know we\u2019re capable of then I know we are able to beat any team. I know that\u2019s a big statement in itself but I think what we\u2019ve done over the last year means we\u2019re able to say that.\u201dStokes\u2019 confidence extended to naming his XI two days out, while counterpart Pat Cummins opted to his keep his counsel until the toss. Having already tempted Moeen Ali out of retirement to step in for injured spinner Jack Leach, there was only one real decision to make over the final seamer.In the end he opted for Stuart Broad\u2019s vast experience over the explosive pace of Mark Wood. The decision was made primarily on instinct but is backed up by the numbers, with the 36-year-old boasting 131 wickets in 35 Ashes Tests, with 84 of those in home conditions.\u201cGenerally, I\u2019ve stuck with my heart and my gut throughout my captaincy so far. Broady\u2019s record against Australia is incredible and it\u2019s very hard to look past someone like that, in the opening game of the series,\u201d he said.1st Test, Edgbaston: Jun 16-202nd Test, Lord's: Jun 28 - Jul 23rd Test, Headingley: Jul 6 - 104th Test, Old Trafford: Jul 19 - 235th Test, Oval: Jul 27 - 31Stokes\u2019 own fitness remains a huge source of intrigue, as he strives to return to his role as England\u2019s all-action all-rounder. His ability to chip in as a bowler has been compromised in recent times by chronic left-knee problems, but he has gradually ramped up his bowling since arriving in Birmingham and appears increasingly ready to throw himself into the fray.\u201cThe last three days have been really good for my confidence, I\u2019ve been able to run in with more intensity day by day so I have got myself in a really good position to be able to bowl,\u201d he said.RecommendedAshes rivals unite in honour of Nottingham victims on opening day of seriesKane thanks team-mates and Bellingham takes five \u2013 Thursday\u2019s sporting socialFocus on Republic of Ireland\u2019s opponents Greece and the threat they may pose\u201cI\u2019m not speaking too soon, who knows where I could be in two weeks\u2019 time?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBen Stokes has always risen to any occasion and, since taking the captaincy, has transformed England\u2019s fortunes, but the all-rounder admitted he never aspired to the role.Since he made his first Test century in the hostile conditions at Perth, becoming only the third Englishman to score a century in the city since 1987, at the age of 22, Stokes has time and again dragged his side over the line.With the Ashes starting on Friday, the occasion that most easily comes to mind is the 2019 miracle of Headingley, and the innings of a lifetime.Few knew what shape England would be in under Stokes the captain when he took over, after a dismal run of just one win in 17 Test matches, but even fewer could have predicted the transformation to follow.England have smashed records, scored 500 in a day, with Stokes taking the top spot for sixes scored in Test cricket, but the biggest test of all, for any England captain, starts on 16 June at Edgbaston.RecommendedWhat is Bazball?

I just always seem to find myself falling on my feet I guess,\u201d Stokes said.When asked what he brought to the role, he said: \"I think the will to get more out of the other players initially, more than any personal gain, is something that I\u2019ve always thought about and wanted as a player.\u201cI was quite proud of myself when I was given this responsibility to have that exact same mindset rather than anything else around being England captain.\"Unlike his counterpart Pat Cummins, who is waiting until Friday morning to name his side, Stokes has already chosen.The Ashes is an event full of history and individual battles, including the resumption of Stuart Broad bowling to David Warner.Broad has claimed Warner\u2019s scalp 14 times in Test matches, and in the 2019 Ashes he bowled 104 deliveries at the Australian, conceding 25 runs and dismissing him seven times. Even Stokes admitted that history had played a part in his selection for Edgbaston.Stuart Broad will look to get the upper hand over Australia\u2019s David Warner again this summer (Jason O\u2019Brien/PA) (PA Archive)\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said no (the history was not a factor),\u201d Stokes said.\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things, like Ashwin against me.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIf it is a miracle that Charles Oliveira can walk, perhaps no word exists to sufficiently describe the Brazilian\u2019s UFC career.Up until he was seven years old, Oliveira was no different than any of the other children in the impoverished favela of Vicente de Carvalho in Guaruja, Sao Paulo; he spent every waking moment playing football, apathetic to the dearth of opportunities in the village, determined to convert his passion for the sport into a career. While the conditions in Vicente de Carvalho were not exactly the type to incubate Oliveira\u2019s dream, he decided that they were also not the type to extinguish it. Remarkably, neither was a doctor\u2019s prognosis that Oliveira could become paraplegic.The Brazilian received the news aged seven, a result of his affliction by Rheumatic fever, which left him in frequent, intense pain and even unable to walk at times. To add insult to illness, Oliveira was also diagnosed with a heart murmur.Twenty-six years on, he is one of the greatest mixed martial artists on the planet.While Oliveira\u2019s dream of becoming a professional footballer did not materialise, he was nevertheless able to overcome his illness to excel at jiu-jitsu and go on to become one of Brazil\u2019s most inspiring sporting figures: a UFC lightweight champion, and a fighter with more finishes and submission wins than any other in the company\u2019s history.RecommendedFull UFC 289 card featuring Amanda Nunes vs Irene AldanaVettori vs Cannonier and full UFC Fight Night card this weekendWhat time does Vettori vs Cannonier start in UK and US this weekend?\u201cWith my illness, I never thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve my dreams,\u201d Oliveira told The Independent over Zoom in 2022, his t-shirt seemingly on the verge of disintegration from the sweat induced by an afternoon spent training.Oliveira won the UFC lightweight title in 2021 with a knockout of Michael Chandler  (Getty Images)\u201cI always believed and had a lot of faith that any dream I had, I could achieve it. Of course, as with any kid at the time, I just wanted to play football and have a future in that. But sports in general in Brazil are complicated; there aren\u2019t many opportunities for everyone, so I knew it would be hard. But I just kept my faith and believed everything would happen the way I wanted.\u201dJust as Oliveira, a devout Christian, refused to view his early ailments as divine signs that he was not destined to become an athlete, he refused to accept moments of adversity in his first UFC title shot and first defence as signs that he was not supposed to be a champion. Having debuted in the UFC in 2010 and endured inconsistent stints at featherweight and lightweight, it took Oliveira 11 years and a stupefying 28 fights to secure his first title shot in the promotion. In that bout, against Michael Chandler in May 2021, Oliveira was on the verge of being knocked out late in the first round. Within seven seconds of the second frame, \u201cDo Bronx\u201d had knocked down the American, completely turning the tide to knock out Chandler moments later. Then, that December, the champion was the underdog in his defence against Dustin Poirier, who knocked down Oliveira twice in the first round. The jiu-jitsu black belt, whose mentor in the art was killed in a shooting in Vicente de Carvalho when Oliveira was just 14, somehow remained composed and stuck to his gameplan. He targeted Poirier\u2019s body with kicks and knees, wearing down the American on the feet then on the ground with his grappling, before submitting the former interim champion in the third round.Dustin Poirier twice knocked down Oliveira but was ultimately submitted by the Brazilian (Getty Images)\u201cIt\u2019s an evolution, I\u2019m always evolving,\u201d Oliveira explained to The Independent, later joking that his eyesight is so poor that he sees three versions of his opponent during a bout. \u201cA fighter can\u2019t only know how to hit; he needs to know how to take a hit and stay calm and get over it. I was in trouble at some points in those fights, but I kept my head in the game, kept composed and knew that I couldn\u2019t waste any opportunity that I had.\u201cAgainst Dustin... we\u2019re talking about MMA, it\u2019s unpredictable. So, I knew I had to keep an eye on him anyway, but each round I was improving, growing, and he was getting tired. He was looking at the clock the whole time, especially after the middle of the first round. I knew that I surprised him; he was hitting me and I was still moving forward. I knew then that he was in trouble in some way, and that things were looking better on my end than his.\u201cI always say I want to bring joy and boldness to the Octagon, and I feel like I did that [against Chandler and Poirier]. I was shocking the world and showing everyone I\u2019m not just one more fighter; I\u2019m Charles Oliveira, I am the champion. I showed how much I can evolve and have evolved, so I had a lot of fun in there and just shut up everyone who was criticising me.\u201dOliveira celebrates his title victory at UFC 262 (Getty Images)Oliveira suffered from Rheumatic fever and a heart murmur as a child (Getty Images)Oliveira\u2019s victory over Chandler \u2013 to claim the belt vacated by Khabib Nurmagomedov \u2013 was followed by jubilant celebrations from the 33-year-old, who jumped over the fence and shouted joyously at Joe Rogan at the commentary desk, before sprinting around the arena to share the moment with his friends and family \u2013\u00a0as well as fans, whose adoration for the fighter was at this point accelerating with every bout. Shortly thereafter, UFC president Dana White wrapped the belt around Oliveira\u2019s waist, but the Brazilian took it off to run around the ring with the gold clutched against his chest like a child with their favourite stuffed toy.\u201cWhile Dana was putting the belt around my waist, I just kept thinking about everything I\u2019d gone through, everyone that said I wouldn\u2019t get the belt, that I wasn\u2019t talented enough to get there,\u201d Oliveira recalled. \u201cI was just thinking about my faith and how much I worked, believed and bled to get to that place. All I have right now is just gratitude for everything I\u2019ve achieved so far.\u201dWhile Oliveira\u2019s celebrations after his title win were ecstatic, he followed his victory over Poirier with the calmest of reactions, strolling slowly and stony-faced across the Octagon while pointing to the ceiling, acknowledging his faith. \u201cMy first title shot, my friends and family were there, it was the first time I\u2019d been in that position,\u201d Oliveira told The Independent. \u201cIt was achieving a dream after 11 years of hard work, so that\u2019s why I reacted that way. The second time actually, with Dustin, the commission warned me before that I couldn\u2019t jump the cage or anything, because I would get fined. So, I had that in mind. That kind of made my celebration a little less crazy. But I felt the same way inside, so happy.\u201dWith his victories over Chandler and Poirier, Oliveira extended his win streak to 10, with all of those results having come via stoppage. Next up for the champion was Justin Gaethje \u2013 a former interim lightweight title holder, like Poirier. Oliveira lost his title on the scales but throttled Justin Gaethje one day later  (USA TODAY Sports)In a late twist, however, Oliveira would miss weight by half a pound, leading him to be stripped of his belt one day before his clash with Gaethje. An irate Oliveira ran through the American regardless, dropping the \u201cHighlight\u201d before wrapping him up like a boa constrictor and forcing Gaethje to tap in the first round. It marked an extension of Oliveira\u2019s already bewildering run of form, and set up a fight with a man on his own, extensive win streak: Islam Makhachev. The protege and childhood friend of Khabib was intended by Nurmagomedov\u2019s father and coach to be Khabib\u2019s successor \u2013 not Oliveira, though the Brazilian complicated those plans. Yet \u201cfather\u2019s plan\u201d was still fulfilled, if later than anticipated, when Makhachev produced a dominant display to hurt and submit Oliveira in the second round, finally ending \u201cDo Bronx\u201d\u2019s fairytale run. There was no shame in that loss, though Oliveira did not share that sentiment. As motivated as ever, the Brazilian returned to the ring a little over six months later to face Beneil Dariush, who \u2013\u00a0like Makhachev \u2013 had been on his own storming surge through the division. Many suggested that Oliveira had perhaps reached his peak and was due a downturn in fortunes. Instead?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIt was a bad night for Josh Taylor in the Garden ring in New York City on Saturday. Taylor was beaten by Teofimo Lopez over 12 rounds in a shock defeat. It was certainly not the fight that Taylor expected. Taylor suffered defeat for the first time in 20 fights, he lost his one remaining world championship belt and at the end he offered no excuses. \u201cThe better man won,\u201d he managed, his voice crackling with emotions. Taylor was putting on a brave face to mask the despair. It had been a fiery and ugly build-up and Lopez had talked of killing Taylor in the ring. Lopez, who has his own personal battles away from the ring, apologised for the comment and received a peck on the cheek for his honesty. \u201cIt\u2019s all song and dance,\u201d Taylor told him. It was an oddly respectful end to a week of promises, insults and stupid claims.It was also glorious redemption for Lopez, once the No 1 at lightweight. Lopez had lost his way on both sides of the ropes, and finished his last fight asking his team live on air if he still \u201chad it\u201d? It was a difficult interview to watch; on Saturday in the ring in the Garden\u2019s basement theatre, Lopez rediscovered the form most people thought had vanished. He is still only 25, by the way. RecommendedTeofimo Lopez hands Josh Taylor his first defeat with decision win in New YorkJosh Taylor says move up to welterweight is \u2018imminent\u2019 after first career defeatMiami Heat mascot hospitalised after Conor McGregor punchIt was a close fight that Lopez won clearly and that often happens when two very good boxers meet. One judge, Benoit Roussel, scored it wide in Lopez\u2019s favour. His 9-3 verdict was too wide, to be honest. The other two judges, Steve Gray and Joseph Pasquale, returned identical scores of 115-113, which means 7-5 in rounds in Lopez\u2019s favour. Taylor never complained, but had he won the last round, he would have retained his title with a majority drawn verdict. Instead, Taylor had to surrender his beloved world championship belt. Last year, Taylor held all four belts at super-lightweight before slowly losing the struggle to keep the quartet of baubles in a protracted series of skirmishes with the sanctioning bodies. Taylor has not fought since February of last year and had been placed under relentless pressure to carry out his mandatory requirements. He surrendered, under threat of being stripped, three belts and was left with just the WBO; he was still considered the best at his weight. Taylor, incidentally, had won all four belts in a series of fights against six men with a combined record of 133 wins and not one loss. Taylor was, make no mistake, the best in the world at his weight. That changed in the Garden ring. Taylor (left) came up short on all three judges\u2019 scorecards  (AP)Lopez was too mobile, too slick and Taylor was just off the pace. It is not a tricky fight to understand; Lopez just worked that bit harder. Taylor had talked before about moving away from the 140-pound limit of super-lightweight and going to welterweight. In New York late on Saturday, there was also talk of a rematch. Taylor will let the loss settle and then make a decision, but hopefully he will not take another 16-month break. On the same night, it was the Sunny Edwards show at Wembley Arena and he retained his IBF flyweight title for the fourth time. On his undercard, Nina Hughes retained her WBA bantamweight title over 10 rounds against Katie Healy and in the bloody fight of the night, Ellie Scotney won the IBF super-bantamweight title. Scotney, having just her seventh fight, was too smart, tough and determined for New Zealand\u2019s Cherneka Sugar Johnson. There was a dark and deep cut by Johnson\u2019s right eye for most of the blood-splattered fight. Scotney was quite brilliant, Johnson\u2019s five M\u0101ori-haka men stole the show with their routine before she walked to the ring. It was her highlight, they were exceptional.Sunny Edwards with promoter Eddie Hearn (PA)Edwards was a clear winner of nine of the 12 rounds, but the Chilean Andres Campos kept it competitive. \u201cI need tests,\u201d Edwards admitted. And he does and the tests might start later this year. And I hope so, Edwards has the style, craft and personality to be a big attraction.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoxing matches tend to be organised as one of three types: professional, amateur or exhibition. But what is the difference between them?Generally speaking, most \u2018major\u2019 fights \u2013 including title fights \u2013 are professional bouts, while exhibition contests are those staged with more of a focus on the audience and entertainment. Most professional fighters have an amateur career before turning pro, and Olympic fights count as amateur bouts.For example, Anthony Joshua\u2019s Olympic gold-medal win in 2012 was part of his amateur career. Meanwhile, his heavyweight title fights with Oleksandr Usyk in 2021 and 2022 were professional bouts. Elsewhere, Floyd Mayweather\u2019s recent matches against YouTubers Logan Paul and Deji were exhibitions.All fights \u2013 professional, amateur and exhibition \u2013 must be licensed by a commission (e.g. fights in Las Vegas are regulated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission), but exhibition bouts do not need to be sanctioned by a governing body. In contrast, the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioned Tyson Fury\u2019s three fights with Deontay Wilder, as the WBC heavyweight title was on the line.Professional fights do not need to be title bouts, but they tend to have an effect on the rankings in the weight class in which they take place, as seeded by the governing body sanctioning the fight. I.e. Andy Ruiz Jr is the World Boxing Organization (WBO)\u2019s No 1-ranked fighter below its champions, while Wilder is ranked sixth. If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings.RecommendedFloyd Mayweather vs John Gotti III fight ends with mass brawl in ringFrazer Clarke: \u2018The Olympics without boxing would be a tragedy\u2019Josh Taylor plunged into the unknown as Teofimo Lopez earns redemptive winFurthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights. For example, a world title fight in men\u2019s boxing \u2013 a professional bout \u2013 will always be scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds; and a women\u2019s world title fight will always be scheduled for 12 two-minute rounds. In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples).Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter\u2019s record \u2013 and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared.Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests. For example, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has boxed six times professionally, taking on former mixed martial arts champions Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren, as well as ex-NBA star Nate Robinson and YouTuber AnEsonGib. Readers might expect such fights to be exhibitions, but they have in fact been organised as professional bouts, meaning Paul has a 6-0 record (4 KOs).

There, Dubois fights Yanina Lescano.\u201cI remember coming back from school and my dad telling me the Grenfell Tower had burnt down,\u201d Dubois told the PA news agency on the sixth anniversary of the tragedy.RecommendedCaroline Dubois: \u2018From young girls to grown women, massive change is happening in boxing\u2019Frazer Clarke: \u2018The Olympics without boxing would be a tragedy\u2019Errol Spence Jr and Terence Crawford leave crowd in laughter with \u2018fishing\u2019 analogy\u201cMy first ever fight, the guy in my corner Tony, he was in the tower that night and unfortunately passed away. I was devastated for him and his family, everyone that lost their lives. It was a shock; obviously nobody expected that, and it was a horrible, horrible night.\u201cI had left Dale Youth at that point, but I still knew all the people there, Gary McGuiness and Tony, so I have great memories of Dale Youth.\u201cMe, Hassan [Azim] and Adam [Azim], we all started at Dale Youth, and we\u2019re all under the same promotion and same banner.

And here I am, trying my hardest to make sure his words come true.\u201dFrazer Clarke reflects on Olympic boxing glory as he prepares for biggest pro fight yetBefore Dubois (6-0, 5 knockouts) started to work with Disson, she had spent time at the historic Repton Boxing Club, where brother Daniel trained. Remarkably, Dubois pretended to be a boy called Colin when \u2013 as a nine-year-old girl \u2013 she sparred for the first time.She quickly got the bug for boxing and more than a decade down the line \u2013 after watching Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become household names by winning gold medals at the London Games \u2013 is thankful no other girls will experience a similar journey.Dubois said: \u201c[Mine] is definitely a funny story now, and I look back in hindsight just like, \u2018Wow, what an experience, what a journey, and what a story that I can tell. I am very happy to have this story to tell people.\u201cYou go to any club, Repton included, and there are girls there from beginner level to elite. They\u2019ve had one fight or had many. That is a great thing to see.\u201dEven though Dubois is preparing for only her seventh professional bout, the Londoner has developed a reputation as one of the most exciting names in the women\u2019s game. Five consecutive knockout wins have contributed to the growing hype, but Dubois acknowledges you are only as good as your last fight. While the British prospect wants a world title shot during the next 12 months, she knows Friday\u2019s opponent Lescano will provide a tough test.\u201cEvery fight, depending on how good I perform and how good I look, that is the next step on the ladder,\u201d Dubois said. \u201cThat is definitely the goal [a world title], I definitely see it happening within 12 months. That\u2019s what I want.\u201cIt would be a shame if it has to drag out or I have to wait and not be involved in big fights.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland and Australia are ready to face off once again in the latest chapter of cricket\u2019s oldest rivalry.Australia ran out 4-0 winners Down Under in 2021-22 in a one-sided contest but find themselves up against opponents revitalised by the inspired leadership of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum.Here the PA news agency looks at some of the key issues ahead of the first Test.Ben Stokes\u2019 left kneeThe build-up to the most anticipated Ashes series since 2005 has been dominated by Ben Stokes\u2019 left knee. Barring a solitary over in his stint with Chennai Super Kings in the recent Indian Premier League season, the England captain has not bowled since a flare-up in New Zealand in February. Stokes did not bat or bowl in England\u2019s Test against Ireland at the start of the month and there are understandable doubts over his ability to function as a fourth seamer for England. If he cannot take his share of the load it could imbalance an attack that leans heavily on the 40-year-old James Anderson and 36-year-old Stuart Broad.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHow will Australia cope with \u2018Bazball\u2019?Bazball, the shorthand nickname for England\u2019s ultra-attacking approach under coach Brendon McCullum, has seen them operate at a staggering run-rate of 4.85. The gung-ho approach has blown away South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan over the past year and seen England win 11 of their last 13 Tests. But Australia\u2019s bowling group presents a sterner challenge. Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Mitchell Starc are an elite pack of seamers, backed up by a spinner in Nathan Lyon who has 487 Test scalps. The noise from the England camp suggests there will be no backward step, but their opponents have the speed, experience and consistency to make things backfire.The Moeen factorJack Leach\u2019s lower-back stress fracture saw an emergency call go out to Moeen Ali. The off-spinning all-rounder, whose last Test came in September 2021, was coaxed out of retirement to join England\u2019s Ashes squad. While Moeen\u2019s white-ball exploits will serve him well in this iteration of the England Test side, filling Leach\u2019s shoes may not be a straightforward task. Leach has been an ever-present first-choice under Stokes, working through over 500 overs and showing an ability to control one end for long periods. Moeen is a more mercurial bowler and his selection automatically changes the profile of the attack. How he copes with long spells in the field after almost two years as a limited-overs specialist remains to be seen but his batting is a clear upgrade on Leach.All eyes on CrawleyFew players typify the duality of \u2018Bazball\u2019 in the way Zak Crawley does. He had an 87.5 strike-rate in 2022 yet his Test average sits stubbornly below 30 as his occasional highs are eroded by low scores. He remains the most controversial pick in the team, but coach McCullum has justified the long rope Crawley has been afforded by saying that his \u201cskillset is not to be a consistent cricketer\u201d. When he gets going, McCullum believes Crawley can win matches for England. A knock of 122 off 111 balls against Pakistan in Rawalpindi was a case in point, but he needs to be at his best to make a defining contribution this summer.RecommendedManchester United considering giving bid exclusivity to Sheikh Jassim \u2013 ReportAaron Ramsey wants to take Wales to the summit before Three Peaks ChallengePat Cummins backs David Warner against England as Australia turn down the volumeEngland\u2019s pace attack\u2026lacking paceIn the past year, Stokes has spoken about wanting a 90mph bowler in his side on numerous occasions.

While the 36-year-old\u2019s nous and experience on this stage cannot be scoffed at, Wood\u2019s exclusion leaves the England bowling line-up lacking in express pace.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritish heavyweight Frazer Clarke says he has nothing to prove when faces veteran Mariusz Wach on Friday night but believes he is stronger for coming through his recent \u201csaga\u201d with Fabio Wardley.Clarke saw his hopes of a domestic title fight with rival Wardley thwarted ahead of purse bids last month.His own team of 258 Management and promotion Boxxer made the decision to withdraw Clarke before purse bids with the 31-year-old\u2019s lack of rounds cited as a key reason.It means instead of taking on Wardley this summer, the focus for Clarke is a 10-rounder with Wach at York Hall, but he is ready to shut out the external talk to deliver the seventh win of his professional career.Clarke told the PA news agency: \u201cIt has made me battle hardened.

I have come good out of all these situations.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveFrazer Clarke reflects on Olympic boxing glory as he prepares for biggest pro fight yet\u201cAll these situations I have been in with boxing, I have always come back and done well. That will be the same for this one.\u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing to prove to no one. I just need to win and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do that.\u201dClarke (6-0, 5 knockouts) is hopeful a bout with Wardley will take place later in 2023 despite the social-media storm that occurred last month.After Clarke\u2019s team pulled him out, having initially lobbied the British Boxing Board of Control (BBCofC) for their fighter to become mandatory for Wardley\u2019s British title, the Tokyo 2020 bronze-medalist felt the brunt of the criticism that followed.When asked if a fight with Wardley can still go ahead this year, Clarke replied: \u201cI would hope so. That whole saga, it was frustrating and a difficult 10 days for me. I can\u2019t lie, it was difficult.RecommendedFrazer Clarke: \u2018The Olympics without boxing would be a tragedy\u2019Boxer Frazer Clarke reflects on Olympic glory as he prepares for biggest pro fight yetErrol Spence Jr and Terence Crawford leave crowd in laughter with \u2018fishing\u2019 analogy\u201cMentally it was really difficult, but I have come through the other side of it.

A bit of a f***-up from our side, me and my team, so we have held our hands up and now get back on the bus.\u201dPolish heavyweight Wach (37-9, 20 KOs) is the latest hurdle for Clarke to clear on his path to reach the top. Wach went the distance with Wladimir Klitschko in 2012 and only lost on points to Dillian Whyte four years ago to show the type of pedigree that Clarke will do battle with this week.He added: \u201cHe has seen bigger and better fighters than me.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2018s deal with Spotify has been ditched after just one series of Meghan Markle\u2019s podcast, in an apparent blow to the royals\u2019 hopes of launching careers in the United States.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle signed a lucrative deal with the streaming giant in late 2020 to host and produce podcasts, estimated to be worth around \u00a318m, just months after \u201cstepping back\u201d as senior royals and relocating from the UK to California.Meghan\u2019s podcast Archetypes ran for 12 episodes from August 2022. But despite winning the top podcast gong at People's Choice Award in Los Angeles just six months ago, it has not been renewed for a second series.Insiders were cited by the Wall Street Journal as claiming that the couple did not meet the productivity benchmark required to receive the full payout agreed in their 2020 deal.It comes after reports claimed the Sussexes planned to \u201cstop\u201d making tell-all Netflix documentaries, publishing memoirs and taking part in interviews discussing the royal family because there is \u201cnothing left to say\u201d, as the couple seeks to replace their \u201cera of visibility\u201d with a \u201cyear of reconciliation\u201d.RecommendedMeghan Markle \u2018signs with major Hollywood talent agency\u2019 joining Rihanna and The RockMeghan Markle wins Gracie Award for her Archetypes podcast\u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 boss addresses Meghan Markle\u2019s comments about showThe end of the couple\u2019s partnership was confirmed in a statement from Archewell Audio, the Sussexes\u2019 content creation label, and Spotify.It read: \u201cSpotify and Archewell Audio have mutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series we made together.\u201d The Independent has contacted representatives of the Sussexes for comment.The podcast saw Meghan speak to celebrities, historians and experts about the history of stereotypes levelled against women.

It was not long before they started taking part in tell-all interviews and planning to make their first Netflix documentary.Following their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey back in 2021, the couple went on to release a six-part Netflix docuseries titled Harry & Meghan in January 2023. In the same month, Prince Harry released his revealing, controversial memoir Spare and pursued a press tour giving a series of exclusive interviews to major broadcasters in the UK and US. \u201cThat period of their life is over as there is nothing left to say,\u201d one source told The Sun earlier this month adding that the Netflix and memoir period was the couple\u2019s \u201cera of visibility\u201d and that they \u201choped\u201d 2023 would be their \u201cyear of reconciliation\u201d with the royal family.Meghan Markle reveals Archie\u2019s bedroom caught fire during royal tour with Prince HarryThe abrupt end to their Spotify deal comes as Harry faces legal battles on both sides of the Atlantic, with revelations of drug-taking in his memoir Spare sparking a fight between the US government and a conservative group seeking to reveal whether or not he disclosed this past behaviour on his visa application.That battle had its first hearing on the same day as the duke became the first royal to be cross-examined in a British court since Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son testified over claims he cheated in a card game in 1891. Appearing at the High Court last week, the duke underwent nearly eight hours in the witness box as he accused Mirror Group Newspapers of using phone hacking and other unlawful information-gathering tactics to inform a total of 147 articles about him.While the royal said he would feel \u201cinjustice\u201d were he not successful in his claim, the publisher\u2019s lawyer accused him of failing to provide any evidence of being hacked, with no mobile data showing calls to his phone by Mirror Group journalists.The duke arrived late to the trial after attending his daughter Lilibet\u2019s second birthday, and is thought not to have seen his brother Prince William or father King Charles before leaving again shortly afterwards.RecommendedPrince Harry and Meghan Markle \u2018not invited\u2019 to King Charles\u2019 Trooping the Colour birthday celebrationPrince Harry recalled \u2018yawning silence\u2019 that followed Meghan Markle\u2019s joke after first Trooping the ColourHe is reported to have stayed at Frogmore Cottage for what may have been the last time after the couple were asked by the King to vacate their former home just weeks after Spare\u2019s publication.Additional reporting by PA"}, {"_id": "648c551251ac33b09b54d70a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/martin-amis-tribute-books-kingsley-b2342888.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Master stylist Martin Amis was the Mick Jagger of the literary world", "lead": "<p>The author of \u2018Money\u2019 and \u2018The Rachel Papers\u2019 once said that posterity was \u2018no bloody use to me\u2019, but his incisive novels and essays remain some of the most influential of his generation, writes Martin Chilton</p>", "author": "Martin Chilton", "datePublished": "2023-05-21 08:52:27", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:26:58.260331", "dateUpdated": "2023-05-21T08:52:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/20/20/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMartin\u00a0Amis, the celebrated enfant terrible of British books, a man whose gift for piercing prose and razor-sharp observational comedy lit up the literary scene, has died at his home in Florida at the age of 73.The author, who had oesophageal cancer, wrote 15 novels, four short story collections, two screenplays and seven books of non-fiction, including his 2000 memoir\u00a0Experience, which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography and which, in part, deals with the murder of his cousin Lucy Partington by serial killer Fred West. The lasting image of\u00a0Amis\u00a0is the young, louche literary celebrity, cigarette dangling from his ample lips, and it is no coincidence that he was widely dubbed \u201cthe Mick Jagger of fiction\u201d.\u00a0Amis, who was born on 25 August 1949 in Oxford, was the son of Sir Kingsley\u00a0Amis, author of the comedy classic\u00a0Lucky Jim\u00a0and the Booker-winning\u00a0The Old Devils.\u00a0Amis\u00a0junior came to regard the \u201cliterary curiosity\u201d of his heredity as being \u201ctainted\u201d. \u201cIt became accepted that you could say whatever you f***ing well-liked about me \u2013 because, so to speak, I didn\u2019t earn it,\u201d he said in 2014. Amis\u00a0complained about the \u201cvicious\u201d press coverage that fuelled his reputation as the \u201cthe Bad Boy of English letters\u201d and few modern English authors divided opinion as starkly as\u00a0Amis, who delighted in writing about \u201cdisgraceful human beings\u201d.RecommendedMartin Amis, literary \u2018enfant terrible\u2019, dies aged 73Being the son of a well-connected author was certainly no obstacle to his own career, nonetheless, he broke free from his father\u2019s considerable literary shadow, starting with his first novel, 1973\u2019s\u00a0The Rachel Papers, written after he had gained a first in English Literature from Oxford University. It was a light-hearted autobiographical study of teenage desire, impressive enough to earn him the Somerset Maugham Award. Amis\u00a0later dismissed his debut as \u201ccrude and clumsy\u201d, although his preoccupation with ways to snare women persisted. At 47, for Desert Island Discs,\u00a0Amis\u00a0selected saxophonist Ben Webster\u2019s tune \u201cLate Date\u201d because it offered \u201ca brisk way of seducing women\u2026 trying to jolly them along before they have a chance to think about it\u201d. A love of jazz was inherited from his father:\u00a0Amis\u00a0named one novel\u00a0Night Train, after pianist Oscar Peterson\u2019s composition. His colourful reputation as a ladies\u2019 man fuelled the copious press coverage of his life. In 2007,\u00a0Amis\u00a0revealed his affair with Tina Brown, former editor of Tatler, the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, and credited her with transforming him into a \u201cliterary Mick Jagger\u201d. Their romance began when he was 23 and she was an undergraduate at Oxford. He used to quote Philip Larkin\u2019s poetry in bed, she recalled. In 2009, former girlfriend, Julie Kavanagh, wrote about their past (with his consent) for the magazine\u00a0Intelligent Life\u00a0and paid tribute to his \u201cByronic magnetism\u201d, admitting she had been bowled over by \u201cthe Jagger lips, moody monobrow and fag between two fingers\u201d. She praised his gift for wit and irony. Writer Clive James also noted his \u201cstubby, Jaggerish appearance\u201d. In 1976, Germaine Greer penned a 30,000-word love letter to\u00a0Amis, a man who left her \u201chelpless with desire\u201d. Although the letter was never actually sent \u2013 and only came to light in 2015 when the feminist author\u2019s archive to the University of Melbourne was opened up \u2013 it captures his appeal at the time. \u201cIt astonishes me with that tobacco hair and those tangled black eyelashes that you do not have brown eyes. Your eyes \u2026 are cool-coloured, sort of air force blue-grey, and strangely unreflecting. You slide them away from most things and look at people through your thick eyelids, under your hair, your eyebrows and your lashes. You look at mouths more than eyes. Is it because you hate to look up? It is very shy and graceful and tantalising, as well you know,\u201d Greer wrote. His many girlfriends included aristocrats and writers, although he stated in his memoir\u00a0Inside Story\u00a0that the early ones were mostly \u201cblue-collar\u201d and \u201cinternational,\u201d including \u201ca Ceylonese, an Iranian, a Pakistani, three West Indians, and a mixed-race South African\u201d.English poet and novelist Kingsley Amis with his sons Martin (left) and Philip playing chess, 1961 (Getty Images) Although he loved partying and romance, the 1970s was an era in which he was sharply focused on his writing career. After publishing\u00a0Dead Babies\u00a0in 1975 (a darkly witty parody of Agatha Christie),\u00a0Amis\u00a0worked for a spell as literary editor of\u00a0The New Statesman. Two more acclaimed novels, 1978\u2019s\u00a0Success\u00a0and 1981\u2019s\u00a0Other People, were followed by his greatest triumph, 1984\u2019s\u00a0Money: A Suicide Note.\u00a0Amis\u00a0wrote it in longhand, inspired by the simple idea of \u201ca big fat guy in New York, trying to make a film\u201d. The narrator, the alcoholic John Self, is loathsome; obsessed with celebrity, pornography, drugs and wealth.Money\u00a0is inventive, bold, bursting with wit and clever artifice. At his best, you sensed the unmistakable energy of\u00a0Amis\u00a0having fun while writing; part of the joke of\u00a0Money\u00a0was having a semi-literate narrator speaking in honed prose. It was a difficult book to write,\u00a0Amis\u00a0said, because it was essentially a plotless novel whose success depended on people accepting the satirical main voice.\u00a0Amis\u00a0would often point out the pitfalls of readers identifying with the protagonist instead of the author, yet it is telling that\u00a0Money\u00a0features a character with a walk-on part called\u00a0Martin\u00a0Amis\u00a0\u2013 perhaps to distance himself from John Self. Amis\u00a0was full of contradictions: claiming that \u201csexism is like racism: we all feel such impulses\u201d while also insisting he was \u201ca feminist\u201d.\u00a0Money\u00a0certainly appealed to men more than women. His female characters, such as Self\u2019s girlfriend Selina (who is described as offering \u201cthe frank promise of brothelly knowhow\u201d), were pretty one-dimensional. His fiction also had problematic aspects when it came to diversity. \u201cAmis\u00a0would never win a racial sensitivity award\u2026 until Lionel Asbo, Black characters in his novels are peripheral figures of fear or fun,\u201d wrote former Booker judge Sameer Rahim. His 1980 novel\u00a0London Fields\u00a0is an interesting dissection of self-delusion and amoral behaviour, written in a tricky \u201cfour voice\u201d narrative structure, and it contains many burnished comic lines, such as \u201cKeith didn\u2019t look like a murderer. He looked like a murderer\u2019s dog.\u201d Yet the misanthropy is wearisome and the dialogue, from clich\u00e9d, cringeworthy \u201cordinary\u201d Londoners, is jarring. Trish Shirt, played in the 2018 movie adaptation by Lily Cole, says of Keith Talent: \u201cHe comes round my owce. Eel ... bring me booze and that. To my owce. And use me like a toilet.\u201d\u00a0Amis, a man who carried his blended tobacco in a little leather pouch, admitted taking tips for speaking Cockney from reading the memoir of the gangster \u2018Mad\u2019 Frankie Fraser. The 1991 novel\u00a0Time\u2019s Arrow: or the Nature of the Offence, the tale of a Nazi doctor told in reverse chronology, made the Booker shortlist but was criticised as a lightweight treatment of the Holocaust.\u00a0Amis\u00a0picked literary rivalry and \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d as themes of his next novel. By the time\u00a0The Information\u00a0came out in 1995,\u00a0Amis\u00a0was in the midst of his own fortysomething \u201cconvulsion\u201d after his marriage to Antonia Phillips collapsed \u2013 he left her and their sons Louis and Jacob for writer and heiress Isabel Fonseca, a woman nine years younger \u2013 having also recently \u201cdiscovered\u201d a 19-year-old daughter, Delilah, the result of an affair with a married woman in 1974. Amis\u2019s parents divorced when he was 12, and he lamented the embarrassment of his father\u2019s \u201cpromiscuous behaviour\u201d being \u201cin the papers\u201d. When\u00a0Amis\u00a0\u201clost control of events\u201d, the celebrity author had a target on his back. It is entirely possible that sour grapes were a factor in the blows aimed at his reputation. The insular literary world went into a frenzy when\u00a0Amis\u00a0ditched his longstanding agent Pat Kavanagh (prompting a feud between\u00a0Amis\u00a0and her husband Julian Barnes, once his close friend) in order to hire Andrew Wylie, an American known as The Jackal, to negotiate a reported $1m advance for\u00a0The Information. Spats with fellow authors remained a constant of\u00a0Amis\u2019s life. He dismissed South African author JM Coetzee as having \u201cno talent\u201d, yet took great exception at Tibor Fisher\u2019s excoriating comments about 2003\u2019s\u00a0Yellow Dog.\u00a0One of\u00a0Amis\u2019s most celebrated rows was with the acerbic American writer Gore Vidal. When\u00a0Amis\u00a0interviewed Vidal for The Observer, they fell out over Vidal\u2019s demand for copy approval and insistence that\u00a0Amis\u00a0refer to him as \u201cpansexual\u201d rather than \u201chomosexual\u201d. In the end,\u00a0Amis\u00a0had his revenge with a memorable article that included a damning scalpel-like cutting paragraph in which he commented that \u201cVidal has removed pain from his own life, or narrowed it down to manageable areas; and it is one thing he cannot convincingly recreate in his own fiction. But his deeply competitive nature is still\u00a0reassured\u00a0to know that there is plenty of pain about.\u201dAmis\u00a0was also a master stylist, whose use of punctuation was an art form in itself, one that laid the foundation for his zinging prose.\u00a0Amis\u00a0was a devotee of what he called \u201cminimum elegance\u201d, and said that when he was writing he was always conscious of precision, \u201csubvocalising a sentence in your head until there\u2019s nothing wrong with it\u201d. It is telling that his 2001 anthology\u00a0The War Against Clich\u00e9\u00a0remains a well-thumbed book on the shelves of many critics and journalists.A lifelong smoker, Amis carried his loose tobacco in a leather pouch  (Getty Images) It also has to be admitted that\u00a0Amis\u00a0was no stranger to self-aggrandisement \u2013 he once described a \u201cfive-hour read of me\u201d as \u201cthe dream night\u201d \u2013 but his wit was never far behind. When he was asked to describe the profession of writing, he replied: \u201cWell, it is a sort of sedentary, carpet slippers, self-inspecting, nose-picking, arse-scratching kind of job, just you in your study and there is absolutely no way round that. So, anyone who is in it for worldly gains and razzmatazz I don\u2019t think will get very far at all.\u201dFor most people,\u00a0Amis\u00a0was an enlightening, entertaining guest at dinner parties, one who loved word games and risqu\u00e9 anecdotes; although a mature student colleague I knew in the mid-1980s sat next to\u00a0Amis\u00a0at one such function not long after she had been through a torrid labour and had to endure an hour of him telling her how producing a novel was \u201cjust like a difficult birth\u201d.He remained in the news in his later life. In 2007, he was forced to retract the \u201crather stupid suggestion\u201d that \u201cthe Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order\u201d. His proposal that \u201cpeople who look like they\u2019re from the Middle East or from Pakistan\u201d had their freedoms curtailed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and be subjected to \u201cstrip-searching and discriminatory stuff\u201d prompted professor Terry Eagleton to liken\u00a0Amis\u2019s statements on Muslims to \u201cthe ramblings of a British National Party thug\u201d.Five years later, \u201cneeding a change\u201d,\u00a0Amis\u00a0relocated from London to New York, after giving up a position teaching creative writing at Manchester University, a move that echoed his father\u2019s teaching career. The decision came after harsh reviews for 2006\u2019s\u00a0House of Meetings\u00a0(a novel set in Stalin-era Russia) and 2010\u2019s\u00a0The Pregnant Widow\u00a0(based in a castle in Italy during the summer of 1970), a period when\u00a0Amis\u00a0seemed to be struggling for relevance. His 2012 novel\u00a0Lionel Asbo: State of England, set in the fictional London working-class borough of Diston Town, was full of dreary caricature villains.Manchester United fan\u00a0Amis\u00a0wrote about \u201csoccer thugs\u201d in his non-fiction work. Although his football journalism was sometimes pompous, I enjoyed his amusing writing about tennis, a game he played six times a week at his peak, when he claimed he was \u201clike a warrior poet\u201d on court.

In 2020,\u00a0Amis, who excelled at literary criticism, published\u00a0Inside Story: A Novel, a fragmentary memoir that deals with his relationship with his godfather Philip Larkin, Christopher Hitchens and Saul Bellow, whom he called the greatest American writer of all time.RecommendedDaisy May Cooper: \u2018People told me I\u2019m not funny any more because I\u2019m not fat\u2019Paedophiles, abusers\u2026 and selfish mothers?

The Levellers \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1994Sometimes quantity really does matter as much as quality. Without a steel fence to keep the gatecrashers away, Glasto was officially free and The Levellers played to what is reported to have been the festival\u2019s largest-ever crowd to date, estimated at 300,000.

Kanye West \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015Lee Nelson invades the stage as Kanye West performs (Rex)As far as classic Glastonbury talking points go, nothing since Michael Jackson died has come close to Kanye\u2019s 2015 slot. For all his claims to be \u201cthe biggest rock star on the planet\u201d, nerves got the better of what was arguably Kanye\u2019s highest-profile show ever. His attempt to echo Jay-Z\u2019s rock-embracing \u201cWonderwall\u201d from 2008 fell flat when he forgot the words to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d, and he had to restart \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d\u2019 after comedian Lee Nelson invaded the stage pretending to be a surprise guest rapper. Nonetheless (look away now, Noel), some class this as another key victory in hip-hop\u2019s Glastonbury takeover.20. Primal Scream \u2013 NME Stage, 1992The volume, according to some onlookers, was like listening to a car stereo playing \u201dMovin\u2019 On Up\u201d underwater three miles away. Yet Primal Scream bringing Screamadelica to the NME Stage in 1992 was more of a collective celebration of music\u2019s most double-visioned zeitgeist. Generation \u201cLoaded\u201d came together as one, and rock and dance cultures mated furiously in the bushes at this peak of the ecstasy rave explosion.19. T Rex \u2013 Main Stage, 1970\u201cDon\u2019t touch my car!\u201d Marc Bolan barked at Michael Eavis when the burgeoning festival don \u2013 en route to Minehead Butlin\u2019s to replace The Kinks at what was then essentially a farmer\u2019s party taking place on a stage held together with string \u2013 tried brushing leaves off his Cadillac. Yet Bolan\u2019s T Rex stormed the inaugural Glastonbury (or the Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues Festival as it was known \u2013 \u00a31 per ticket and all the milk you could drink). \u201cBolan played on and on and on as the sun was going down,\u201d Eavis recalled, \u201call the hits, the full works, and it sounded fantastic.\u201d18. Kylie Minogue \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Kylie performs All The Lovers at GlastonburyIn 2005, Kylie was forced to pull out of her Pyramid Stage headline slot due to her cancer diagnosis, a wrench for fans and artist alike despite Coldplay\u2019s spectacular replacement set. The Eavises, however, couldn\u2019t get her out of their heads. When she finally honoured the booking 14 years later, for 2019\u2019s Legends slot, she pulled out all the stops, putting on a headline-worthy show rammed with her biggest hits. There were celebrity guests, too, including Chris Martin on \u201cCan\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\u201d and Nick Cave for \u201cWhere the Wild Roses Grow\u201d. Dolly-beating stuff.17. Portishead \u2013 Acoustic Tent, 1995As many a troubadour will attest, it\u2019s rare to find a crush of 15,000 people stuck outside the Acoustic Tent. But the arrival of local (ish) heroes Portishead bearing the sumptuous jazz lounge trip-hop of their hugely acclaimed debut album Dummy prompted just such polite chaos. The lucky few inside reported a bewitching set of very modern heartache \u2013 \u201cGlory Box\u201d and \u201cSour Times\u201d capping a show of immense grace and emotion.

The Killers \u2013 New Tent, 2004The Killers headlining Glastonbury in 2019 \u2013 15 years after they played the New Tent (REUTERS)The best sign of encroaching superstardom, they say, is when your John Peel Stage debut is as rammed and rambunctious as Theresa May\u2019s leaving drinks. Arguably the first and finest example was the tsunami of fans descending on the New Tent early on the Saturday evening in 2004, to toast the arrival of Las Vegas indie pop showmen The Killers. The crowds stretched far outside the tent but even the ones on the outskirts bawled along to \u201cMr Brightside\u201d and \u201cAll These Things That I\u2019ve Done\u201d. It was such a \u201cmoment\u201d that the band returned to the stage (now the John Peel Stage) for a secret encore in 2017.15. Orbital \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Dance music had long since conquered clubland, but its clout as a force to unify a vast festival crowd was unrecognised until Orbital took Glasto \u201994 by synthetic storm. Drawing 40,000 ravers to the NME Stage for their headline set with little more than compulsive beats and headlights on their faces, the Hartnoll brothers dazzled not just the millions watching Glastonbury\u2019s first televised broadcasts on Channel 4, but Eavis himself. So much so, in fact, that he was inspired to open a dedicated Dance Tent the following year. It\u2019s since grown into its own festival-within-a-festival in the Silver Hayes dance village.14. New Order \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1981By 1981, Glastonbury had grown from its Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues roots, but not far. It was a CND charity gathering of around 3,000 bikers burning up the site as they waited for Hawkwind to come on. \u201cIt was our version of Altamont but without any trouble,\u201d said New Order\u2019s Peter Hook of their \u201cspirited\u201d support slot, but it was also the moment the band emerged from beneath the lingering clouds of Joy Division and proved themselves the silvery scouts of the new electronic age.13. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2011If Jay could do it, so could Bey. Following her husband\u2019s celebrated 2008 headline slot (and pregnant with their first child at the time), Beyonc\u00e9 delivered Glastonbury\u2019s ultimate pop experience to date. \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\u201d, \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d, glitzy covers of both \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d and \u201cSex On Fire\u2019, billowing ballads sung while kneeling on white grand pianos\u2026 even the bells had whistles on them. All of this was wrapped up with the most bootylicious of Destiny\u2019s Child medleys.12. Stormzy \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Stormzy performs Shut Up at GlastonburyBoasting what was rumoured to be the most expensive Glastonbury set ever staged \u2013 a Banksy stab-vest! Ballet dancers! Chris Martin! \u2013 Stormzy had only released one album, his hit debut Gang Signs & Prayer, when he became the first black British solo artist to ascend to the revered Glastonbury headline slot in 2019. He used it as a battering ram to break the new grime uprising onto the most respected stage in the world. Historic.11. Happy Mondays \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1990By its very nature as a gigantic concave mirror on alternative culture, Glastonbury reflects and exaggerates music\u2019s pivotal moments. Case in point: Happy Mondays roll onto the Pyramid Stage in 1990 \u2013 just as ecstasy is reshaping youth culture into very bendy shapes indeed \u2013 and twist the melon of an entire generation with \u201cStep On\u201d, \u201cWrote For Luck\u201d and \u201cHallelujah\u201d. Where the Second Summer of Love (1988-1989) was an in-the-know affair, this set made it universally hip to be hairy, lairy, baggy and boggle-eyed.10. Jay-Z \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2008Noel Gallagher wasn\u2019t having it, but Glastonbury 2008 certainly was. Gently mocking Noel\u2019s disgust as rap infiltrated rock\u2019s most revered stage, Jay-Z entered with a ramshackle solo rendition of \u201cWonderwall\u201d, then all but smashed his acoustic guitar as he burst into \u201c99 Problems\u201d. There followed a veritable firestorm of hip-hop classics \u2013 \u201cIzzo (H.O.V.A.)\u201d, \u201cGirls, Girls, Girls\u201d, \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d, \u201cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\u201d \u2013 almost as though Jigga was beating the spirit of Glastonbury into submission before forcing it to wear a Brooklyn Nets shirt. The festival\u2019s mind was opened forever, that night.9. Patti Smith \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015Most so-called \u201cheritage\u201d acts go through the motions at Glastonbury \u2013 a stout chunk of their folky new record and, begrudgingly, a smatter of their old hits. Not Patti Smith. She attacked the Pyramid Stage in 2015 like a white-haired tornado. Ripping strings from her guitar by the fistful and hailing \u201cFreedom!\u201d at the top of her voice, she tore through \u201cLand\u201d, \u201cGloria\u201d and The Who\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d like the age-defying punk pioneer she is. She even found time to present the actual Dalai Lama with a birthday cake on stage and fall on her face, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a f***ing animal!\u201d Amen.8. Oasis \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Scenes become seismic events when they prove they can dominate an entire Glastonbury festival. Take Sunday 26 June 1994, when a young, cocksure Liam Gallagher strode onto the NME Stage in a black jumper and shades and demanded of a distinctly mad-ferrit crowd: \u201cAre you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?\u201d Songs rarely came so \u201cproper\u201d as \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol\u201d, \u201cLive Forever\u201d and \u201cFade Away\u201d, which joined \u201cShakermaker\u201d and \u201cSupersonic\u201d in the wider public domain that day \u2013 bombardments from Britpop\u2019s northern armies. The Nineties suddenly had some real fight in them.7. The Cure \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Robert Smith pulled a Bowie in 2019, returning to Glastonbury after a decades-long break \u2013 24 years to be precise \u2013 and levelling the Tor with the hits. As one of Britain\u2019s greatest singles bands cunningly disguised as one of its greatest album bands, The Cure unleashed their formidable melodic side of their canon, from gothic classics (\u201cThe Walk\u201d, \u201cA Forest\u201d) to formative alt-pop greats (\u201cClose to Me\u201d, \u201cIn Between Days\u201d, \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d) and indie dancefloor mainstays (\u201cFriday I\u2019m in Love\u201d, \u201cWhy Can\u2019t I Be You?\u201d, \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d). There was space, too, for more chest-bursting moments such as \u201cPictures of You\u201d, \u201cPlainsong\u201d and \u201cDisintegration\u201d in one of the most brilliantly balanced Glastonbury headline sets of all time.6. Blur \u2013 NME Stage, 1994By the time Pulp and Radiohead had played that same stage, that same day, in a line-up that Johnny Greenwood would describe as \u201dlike the Champions League\u201d, Britpop had officially arrived. To herald this cultural breakout, Blur rolled up in their Parklife charabanc at sundown for a coming-of-age party that saw \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d, \u201cEnd of a Century\u201d and the era-defining title track taken on as generational anthems, at a show as celebratory and momentous as any headline set. It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade.5. Radiohead \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1997Thom Yorke of Radiohead during the band's legendary Glastonbury performance in 1997 (Rex)Radiohead\u2019s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle \u2013 against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. \u201cEverything broke onstage,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt turned into the worst night of our lives. I don\u2019t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.\u201d But it\u2019s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. \u201cLucky\u201d rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead\u2019s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia \u2013 \u201cNo Surprises\u201d, \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cAirbag\u201d \u2013 made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling.4. The Smiths \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1984\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 \u2013 shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn\u2019t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as \u201cHand in Glove\u201d, \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d and \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d. The performance inspired Glastonbury\u2019s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely \u201chippy festival\u201d again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous.RecommendedPaul McCartney review, Glastonbury 2022: It\u2019s a historic privilege just to be alive at the same time as him3. Paul McCartney \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2004 and 2022Sometimes all it takes to slip seamlessly into Glastonbury legend is the greatest songbook known to mankind. Sir Paul\u2019s first-ever UK festival show \u2013 no, really \u2013 was the singalong to end them all: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d into \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cBand On the Run\u201d, \u201cBack In the USSR\u201d, \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d and a \u201cHey Jude\u201d you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. Eighteen years later, Macca bettered himself. Playing close to three hours, he plundered his peerless canon for deeper cuts, did virtually the whole Abbey Road medley, brought out Dave Grohl and Bruce Springsteen for history-making duets and \u2013 in a truly moving moment \u2013 sang with John Lennon\u2019s isolated vocals from \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u201d. Sublime.2. David Bowie \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2000Bowie at Glastonbury in 2000 (PA Archive)Bowie\u2019s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We\u2019d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum\u2019n\u2019bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t exactly expecting \u201cChanges\u201d. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang \u201cChanges\u201d. And \u201cLife On Mars?\u201d And \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d and \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d and \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cStarman\u201d and \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could\u2019ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered.1. Pulp \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1995Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Pulp headlined in 1995.  (Getty)When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement \u2013 they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world\u2019s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of \u201cBabies\u201d, \u201cDisco 2000\u201d and \u201cCommon People\u201d crystallised Britpop\u2019s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes. They even unveiled a new song seemingly penned for the occasion \u2013 \u201cSorted For E\u2019s & Wizz\u201d \u2013 and encapsulated the bewildering, otherworldly spirit of Glastonbury in 20 words: \u201dIs this the way they say the future\u2019s meant to feel?/ Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d And to think, they asked Rod Stewart to fill in first."}, {"_id": "648c551451ac33b09b54d719", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/glastonbury-pyramid-stage-best-performances-headliners-b2358320.html", "primaryCategory": "Features", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The 22 greatest Glastonbury performances ever, from Beyonc\u00e9 to Paul McCartney", "lead": "<p>Ahead of the festival\u2019s return to Worthy Farm,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/author/mark-beaumont\">Mark Beaumont</a> picks some of Glastonbury\u2019s greatest ever music moments</p>", "author": "Mark Beaumont", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 07:23:27", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:00.969564", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T07:23:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/19/glasto-best.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The Killers \u2013 New Tent, 2004The Killers headlining Glastonbury in 2019 \u2013 15 years after they played the New Tent (REUTERS)The best sign of encroaching superstardom, they say, is when your John Peel Stage debut is as rammed and rambunctious as Theresa May\u2019s leaving drinks. Arguably the first and finest example was the tsunami of fans descending on the New Tent early on the Saturday evening in 2004, to toast the arrival of Las Vegas indie pop showmen The Killers. The crowds stretched far outside the tent but even the ones on the outskirts bawled along to \u201cMr Brightside\u201d and \u201cAll These Things That I\u2019ve Done\u201d. It was such a \u201cmoment\u201d that the band returned to the stage (now the John Peel Stage) for a secret encore in 2017.15. Orbital \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Dance music had long since conquered clubland, but its clout as a force to unify a vast festival crowd was unrecognised until Orbital took Glasto \u201994 by synthetic storm. Drawing 40,000 ravers to the NME Stage for their headline set with little more than compulsive beats and headlights on their faces, the Hartnoll brothers dazzled not just the millions watching Glastonbury\u2019s first televised broadcasts on Channel 4, but Eavis himself. So much so, in fact, that he was inspired to open a dedicated Dance Tent the following year. It\u2019s since grown into its own festival-within-a-festival in the Silver Hayes dance village.14. New Order \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1981By 1981, Glastonbury had grown from its Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues roots, but not far. It was a CND charity gathering of around 3,000 bikers burning up the site as they waited for Hawkwind to come on. \u201cIt was our version of Altamont but without any trouble,\u201d said New Order\u2019s Peter Hook of their \u201cspirited\u201d support slot, but it was also the moment the band emerged from beneath the lingering clouds of Joy Division and proved themselves the silvery scouts of the new electronic age.13. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2011If Jay could do it, so could Bey. Following her husband\u2019s celebrated 2008 headline slot (and pregnant with their first child at the time), Beyonc\u00e9 delivered Glastonbury\u2019s ultimate pop experience to date. \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\u201d, \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d, glitzy covers of both \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d and \u201cSex On Fire\u2019, billowing ballads sung while kneeling on white grand pianos\u2026 even the bells had whistles on them. All of this was wrapped up with the most bootylicious of Destiny\u2019s Child medleys.12. Stormzy \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Stormzy performs Shut Up at GlastonburyBoasting what was rumoured to be the most expensive Glastonbury set ever staged \u2013 a Banksy stab-vest! Ballet dancers! Chris Martin! \u2013 Stormzy had only released one album, his hit debut Gang Signs & Prayer, when he became the first black British solo artist to ascend to the revered Glastonbury headline slot in 2019. He used it as a battering ram to break the new grime uprising onto the most respected stage in the world. Historic.11. Happy Mondays \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1990By its very nature as a gigantic concave mirror on alternative culture, Glastonbury reflects and exaggerates music\u2019s pivotal moments. Case in point: Happy Mondays roll onto the Pyramid Stage in 1990 \u2013 just as ecstasy is reshaping youth culture into very bendy shapes indeed \u2013 and twist the melon of an entire generation with \u201cStep On\u201d, \u201cWrote For Luck\u201d and \u201cHallelujah\u201d. Where the Second Summer of Love (1988-1989) was an in-the-know affair, this set made it universally hip to be hairy, lairy, baggy and boggle-eyed.10. Jay-Z \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2008Noel Gallagher wasn\u2019t having it, but Glastonbury 2008 certainly was. Gently mocking Noel\u2019s disgust as rap infiltrated rock\u2019s most revered stage, Jay-Z entered with a ramshackle solo rendition of \u201cWonderwall\u201d, then all but smashed his acoustic guitar as he burst into \u201c99 Problems\u201d. There followed a veritable firestorm of hip-hop classics \u2013 \u201cIzzo (H.O.V.A.)\u201d, \u201cGirls, Girls, Girls\u201d, \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d, \u201cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\u201d \u2013 almost as though Jigga was beating the spirit of Glastonbury into submission before forcing it to wear a Brooklyn Nets shirt. The festival\u2019s mind was opened forever, that night.9. Patti Smith \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015Most so-called \u201cheritage\u201d acts go through the motions at Glastonbury \u2013 a stout chunk of their folky new record and, begrudgingly, a smatter of their old hits. Not Patti Smith. She attacked the Pyramid Stage in 2015 like a white-haired tornado. Ripping strings from her guitar by the fistful and hailing \u201cFreedom!\u201d at the top of her voice, she tore through \u201cLand\u201d, \u201cGloria\u201d and The Who\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d like the age-defying punk pioneer she is. She even found time to present the actual Dalai Lama with a birthday cake on stage and fall on her face, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a f***ing animal!\u201d Amen.8. Oasis \u2013 NME Stage, 1994Scenes become seismic events when they prove they can dominate an entire Glastonbury festival. Take Sunday 26 June 1994, when a young, cocksure Liam Gallagher strode onto the NME Stage in a black jumper and shades and demanded of a distinctly mad-ferrit crowd: \u201cAre you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?\u201d Songs rarely came so \u201cproper\u201d as \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol\u201d, \u201cLive Forever\u201d and \u201cFade Away\u201d, which joined \u201cShakermaker\u201d and \u201cSupersonic\u201d in the wider public domain that day \u2013 bombardments from Britpop\u2019s northern armies. The Nineties suddenly had some real fight in them.7. The Cure \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2019Robert Smith pulled a Bowie in 2019, returning to Glastonbury after a decades-long break \u2013 24 years to be precise \u2013 and levelling the Tor with the hits. As one of Britain\u2019s greatest singles bands cunningly disguised as one of its greatest album bands, The Cure unleashed their formidable melodic side of their canon, from gothic classics (\u201cThe Walk\u201d, \u201cA Forest\u201d) to formative alt-pop greats (\u201cClose to Me\u201d, \u201cIn Between Days\u201d, \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d) and indie dancefloor mainstays (\u201cFriday I\u2019m in Love\u201d, \u201cWhy Can\u2019t I Be You?\u201d, \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d). There was space, too, for more chest-bursting moments such as \u201cPictures of You\u201d, \u201cPlainsong\u201d and \u201cDisintegration\u201d in one of the most brilliantly balanced Glastonbury headline sets of all time.6. Blur \u2013 NME Stage, 1994By the time Pulp and Radiohead had played that same stage, that same day, in a line-up that Johnny Greenwood would describe as \u201dlike the Champions League\u201d, Britpop had officially arrived. To herald this cultural breakout, Blur rolled up in their Parklife charabanc at sundown for a coming-of-age party that saw \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d, \u201cEnd of a Century\u201d and the era-defining title track taken on as generational anthems, at a show as celebratory and momentous as any headline set. It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade.5. Radiohead \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1997Thom Yorke of Radiohead during the band's legendary Glastonbury performance in 1997 (Rex)Radiohead\u2019s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle \u2013 against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. \u201cEverything broke onstage,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt turned into the worst night of our lives. I don\u2019t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.\u201d But it\u2019s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. \u201cLucky\u201d rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead\u2019s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia \u2013 \u201cNo Surprises\u201d, \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cAirbag\u201d \u2013 made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling.4. The Smiths \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1984\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 \u2013 shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn\u2019t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as \u201cHand in Glove\u201d, \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d and \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d. The performance inspired Glastonbury\u2019s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely \u201chippy festival\u201d again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous.RecommendedPaul McCartney review, Glastonbury 2022: It\u2019s a historic privilege just to be alive at the same time as him3. Paul McCartney \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2004 and 2022Sometimes all it takes to slip seamlessly into Glastonbury legend is the greatest songbook known to mankind. Sir Paul\u2019s first-ever UK festival show \u2013 no, really \u2013 was the singalong to end them all: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d into \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cBand On the Run\u201d, \u201cBack In the USSR\u201d, \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d and a \u201cHey Jude\u201d you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. Eighteen years later, Macca bettered himself. Playing close to three hours, he plundered his peerless canon for deeper cuts, did virtually the whole Abbey Road medley, brought out Dave Grohl and Bruce Springsteen for history-making duets and \u2013 in a truly moving moment \u2013 sang with John Lennon\u2019s isolated vocals from \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u201d. Sublime.2. David Bowie \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2000Bowie at Glastonbury in 2000 (PA Archive)Bowie\u2019s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We\u2019d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum\u2019n\u2019bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t exactly expecting \u201cChanges\u201d. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang \u201cChanges\u201d. And \u201cLife On Mars?\u201d And \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d and \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d and \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cStarman\u201d and \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could\u2019ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered.1. Pulp \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1995Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Pulp headlined in 1995.  (Getty)When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement \u2013 they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world\u2019s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of \u201cBabies\u201d, \u201cDisco 2000\u201d and \u201cCommon People\u201d crystallised Britpop\u2019s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes.

Read our\u00a0privacy notice\u201cClutching, hanging by a nail in this life/ When there\u2019s nothing I can do\u2026 I smile\u2026\u201d croons Josh Homme on In Times New Roman. The 50-year-old desert rocker\u2019s had a rough time in the six years since the release of the glammy, Mark Ronson-produced Villains. Some of his best friends have died (including former bandmate Mark Lanegan, in 2022, and drinking buddy Anthony Bourdain, in 2018). His 2019 split from wife Brody Dalle devolved into a series of restraining orders and a battle for custody of their three children. Just this week, he revealed he was treated for cancer last year.So this self-produced record finds Homme and co squaring up to the darkness: sometimes with a shrug and sometimes with a teeth-baring sneer. Fans will be happy to hear the band lock into some great, grinding riffs to drive the 10 new songs that clock in crisply around the four-minute mark. The band\u2019s trademark raw revving is balanced at times by elegant strings and even a three-part harmony that works surprisingly well. Think of Crosby, Stills and Nash if they\u2019d joined a biker gang.Homme is hanging by a nail on \u201cCarnavoyager\u201d, on which he adopts a Bowie-style dry yelp. You can almost hear him raising his eyebrow as a fairground organ spins a slow-queasy hook that\u2019s soon picked up and spun off-kilter by the guitars. It\u2019s like being on the Waltzer when a sadistic ride operator swaggers over to your carriage, smirks and gives you a shove. You\u2019re left with no choice but to laugh as the centrifuge grips you. There\u2019s a similarly grim acceptance to \u201cObscenery\u201d. Acid strings melt corrosively down the semitones as Jon Theodore\u2019s drums pound without compromise. \u201cConsequences schmonsequences/ I can hum it if you like?\u201d Homme sings.There\u2019s more of a direct attack on \u201cPaper Machete\u201d, which seems to be aimed squarely at Dalle. Over a solid headbanger beat and some scrawly-screechy fretwork, Homme rips into a betrayal of vows and paints a picture of a woman who shape-shifts to assume the form of \u201cJoan of Arc, victim, perpetrator\u201d by turns. \u201cMy love is dead,\u201d he assures the world, accessorising the sentiment with some sarky-schmaltzy \u201coh-oh-ohs\u201d.There\u2019s some filler. But melody-lite tracks such as \u201cSicily\u201d and \u201cNegative Space\u201d bob by on their bass line grooves. Nine-minute closer \u201cStraight Jacket Fitting\u201d isn\u2019t quite the epic journey it wants to be, as Homme taps into comparisons between the fall of the Roman empire and the decline of modern America. Lyrics devolve into lists: \u201cPatriotic, probiotic, deletists, racists\u2026 infiltrators, saboteurs\u201d before Homme gets vulnerable. He refers to his cancer and asks: \u201cHold me close, I\u2019m confused.\u201d His swooping, sighing falsetto is good and the choir is a classic rock touch. The brass adds lift. But the song chugs along without ever quite taking off.RecommendedAlbum reviews: Niall Horan \u2013 The Show, and Hak Baker \u2013 World\u2019s End FMPrimavera Sound 2023 Porto, review: The star power of Blur, Kendrick and Rosalia trumps a weekend of dreadful weatherJanelle Mon\u00e1e, The Age of Pleasure review: A frothy, horny ode to erotic delightThe best track is \u201cEmotion Sickness\u201d, which opens with the sound of a studio door swinging closed and Homme singing casually before the band whump into action. This is where we get those three-part harmonies. There\u2019s a cool, lopsided riff bouncing off the bass\u2019s steel-sprung suspension, then the weirdly sweet, late-Seventies AM radio chorus of \u201cBaby don\u2019t care for me/ Had to let her go\u201d.

The accounts of its star, Ezra Miller, and their two-year downward spiral \u2013 which include allegations of harassment, grooming and physical violence \u2013 is distressing in a way that extends beyond all critical analysis. What needs to come, before even the matter of accountability, is the question of why there was no support system in place. Why was no one empowered either with the tools or with the moral imperative to intervene in a situation where an individual was in such a clearly dangerous state?There\u2019s no real sense that anyone would be helped by either the release or the cancellation of Miller\u2019s movie. In both scenarios, Warner Bros gets to shrug all responsibility and focus on the fate of its product and not the people it employs. And though the actor is (as their representatives stress) currently seeking treatment, the hand-wringing over a proposed sequel brings with it the perverse implication that said treatment will end not when medical professionals say so, but when Hollywood decides it\u2019s time for Miller to go back to work.The Flash, which has been in active development for nearly a decade, now also arrives after the announcement that DC\u2019s new leadership, Peter Safran and James Gunn, will largely be starting over from scratch. Farewell to 10 years of impotent franchise blueprints. It means that the film arriving here is an odd one \u2013 muddled and uncertain of its own identity, coloured by outside circumstance, but oddly poignant at times. It\u2019s stuck somewhere in between cynical fan service and a more sincere yearning to create art out of corporate strategising.Much of that division is inherent to its plot, which sees The Flash, aka Barry Allen, on an intimate journey of metaphysical implications. Barry, when we first meet him, is frustrated by his place in the superhero pantheon, having essentially become \u201cthe janitor of the Justice League\u201d and left to clean up Batman\u2019s (Ben Affleck) messes. He\u2019s also pained by his inability to prove his father (Ron Livingston) innocent of the murder of his mother (Maribel Verd\u00fa). And so he uses his powers to, as Cher would put it, turn back time. But that screws up the space-time continuum in the process \u2013 leading Barry to cross paths with a younger version of himself that\u2019s never experienced any of the same loss or any of the same heroics.Screenwriter Christina Hodson, who also wrote DC\u2019s Birds of Prey, is thankfully able to tease some of the humanity out of this meta-human. This is, after all, a story about the grief process, and a literalisation of the concept of healing one\u2019s inner child. Barry gets to see who he\u2019d have been without the personal pain, and naturally starts to resent his more fortunate, unperturbed self. Miller consistently hits the right balance with these dual, sometimes competing performances \u2013 a step up for a character whose only defining trait used to be \u201cirritating\u201d. It\u2019s a product of the strong writing here\u2026 when you can actually hear it over the sounds of explosions and cheques being cashed.RecommendedThe Flash director says Tom Cruise cold called him to praise Ezra Miller movie: Huge \u2018confidence boost\u2019Ezra Miller alludes to legal troubles at The Flash premiereEzra Miller: Everything we know about the controversial star of The FlashAs has been exhaustingly teased, Barry\u2019s timeline shenanigans land him in a universe where Michael Keaton is Batman, as he was in Tim Burton\u2019s double-dose of films in 1989 and 1992.

There are additionally two Flash-centric sequences that pay unexpected homage to the Looney Tunes, complete with babies freefalling out of skyscrapers and a band\u2019s worth of musical instruments tumbling out of a truck.

And if anyone\u2019s read anything about us, they only need to spend two or three days with us to see our real character.\u201d N-Dubz, the irrepressible Noughties group, are back and as boisterous as ever. Hanging out with them feels a lot like a raucous sleepover, in the moments before a parent comes up to tell everyone to shut up. The rapper and singer born Costadinos Contostavlos is sitting at the foot of the bed in his hotel room; his cousin, singer Tulisa Contostavlos, is sprawled across it while his best friend, rapper and producer Fazer (Richard Rawson), is propped up against the pillows. \u201cTulisa, get your dirty socks out of my face!\u201d Dappy grumbles, prodding her feet.Much has changed since the northwest London trio, who reunited in 2022 after an 11-year hiatus, first broke through in 2006 with their debut single, \u201cBetter Not Waste My Time\u201d. Back then, their antics off stage generated as many headlines as they did on, from brawls at petrol stations to drug busts and a bizarre, short-lived rivalry with UK hip-hop group Blazin\u2019 Squad. Their timekeeping, however, remains as dire as ever. Tulisa is an hour late, laden with bags and carrying her lunch in a polystyrene container. Yet it\u2019s hard not to warm to her instantly, as the 34-year-old flops on the sofa in the lobby of their London hotel and natters happily while we wait for her bandmates.Another half an hour goes by, and the small talk turns to sighs of exasperation. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d Tulisa mutters, manicured fingers tapping impatiently against her leg. \u201cWhere are those little demons?\u201dWhen Dappy and Fazer do finally arrive, in a flurry of brightly coloured clothing and diamond-encrusted everything, they offer hugs, kisses and flustered apologies. \u201cSorry darling, producer wouldn\u2019t let us leave the [video] shoot,\u201d Dappy scowls, that signature woolly hat pleasingly present. Once they\u2019ve piled into the lift and settled in the room, however, keeping them focused is another task entirely. Halfway through the conversation, as we\u2019re discussing how they\u2019ve managed to stay relevant for so long, Dappy stands up and announces, \u201cI need to take a piss,\u201d making a beeline for the en-suite bathroom and pulling the door behind him. Fazer and Tulisa continue talking, as the door slowly begins to swing back open\u2026 \u201cDAPPY,\u201d Tulisa screams as her cousin\u2019s rear end comes into view. \u201cSorry! I was trying to hear what everyone was saying,\u201d Dappy shouts. Pants back on, the 36-year-old rejoins his bandmates.\u201cWe never call it a reunion \u2013 we call it a comeback,\u201d Tulisa tells me. She did \u201cthe most amount of ass-kicking\u201d to get everyone in the studio, \u201cbut we never lost contact, because we\u2019re family \u2013 at Christmas, he\u2019s coming over,\u201d she says, jerking her head at Dappy. They all refer to N-Dubz as \u201can anomaly that beat the system\u201d; Fazer feels like they\u2019re still at the beginning of their careers. \u201cI think the world needs a band like us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been too fast-moving for them to understand, though. By the time they thought they did, we\u2019d already moved onto the next stage.\u201dRecommendedJenny Lewis on child fame, Rilo Kiley, and seeking out the joy in life: \u2018I was in a very live or die kind of situation\u2019Sophie Ellis-Bextor on failures, big families and love: \u2018I\u2019ve had it all taken away.

They were formed by Dappy\u2019s father, the late musician/barber Byron Contostavlos \u2013 formerly of the band Mungo Jerry \u2013 as a sort of unorthodox after-school club. Byron was anxious to find a way to keep his niece, son and son\u2019s best friend from straying onto the wrong path. All three had difficult childhoods: financial hardship, gang culture, violence and parental illness were all commonplace. Their sound was, and still is, a somewhat undefinable and frantic blend of hip-hop, rock, garage, R&B and pop, with melodramatic, call-and-response style lyrics that played out like a teenage soap opera. \u201cBetter Not Waste My Time\u201d saw Dappy rapping in an Eminem-style yelp over dramatic string flourishes and a menacing synth beat. \u201cOuch\u201d followed Tulisa into her house and up the stairs, \u201cone step, two step, three step, four\u201d, bursting in on her partner in bed with another woman.The kids found N-Dubz first, sending the group exploding out of the underground after early airplay on the now-defunct urban station Channel U and countless downloads on the file-sharing website LimeWire. By 2007, they\u2019d earnt a Mobo award for best newcomer and signed briefly to Polydor, who helped them score a Top 40 hit with a re-released version of their debut. Three platinum-selling albums followed, including their debut Uncle B, which paid tribute to Byron after his sudden death right as the band\u2019s career began to take off.On to the next stage: N-Dubz during a live concert  (Getty)The band\u2019s back-and-forth lyrical style makes for highly quotable songs (\u201cName\u2019s Shaniqua, and what?!\u201d girls used to squawk at each other in the school playground), while their favourite theme of relationships gone wrong remains as relevant as ever. On new songs like sad banger \u201cFebruary\u201d, they act out the aftermath of a toxic relationship over cold, stuttery beats that give way to an Eighties-style power guitar solo. \u201cPlay Your Part\u201d has Tulisa remonstrating with an ex who blew it. \u201cIt\u2019s telling him, \u2018You could have been that guy, but you didn\u2019t do what you needed to do to make it work,\u2019\u201d she explains. \u201c\u2018Instead you\u2019re just a twat!\u2019\u201d\u201cThe lyrics are very textbook, as in, you can text them, so it\u2019s like how you\u2019d argue with someone over text,\u201d Dappy chimes in. He\u2019s most engaged when the conversation is about the music, perhaps wary of questions about his chequered personal life, which includes being convicted of battery in 2007 and two counts of assault the following year. \u201cThat\u2019s the core of N-Dubz, so you can always relate, as a man and a woman talking,\u201d he continues, hastening to add, \u201cOr a man and a man, or a woman and a woman.\u201dEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon MusicSign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upDappy is regularly pegged as the troublemaker of the group. You might recall his hyperactive guest appearance on a now-infamous 2007 episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks (host Simon Amstell told him off for talking to the audience), or the time he sent threatening texts to a listener who called N-Dubz \u201closers\u201d and Dappy \u201ca little boy in a silly hat\u201d during an interview with Chris Moyles. Today, though, the rapper and singer takes longer to speak up, seemingly content for Tulisa and Fazer to take the lead. They\u2019re still on a high from the success of their arena shows last year, and the release of their first album in 13 years, Timeless.Having sold out those arena shows in three minutes flat, they\u2019re eager to tour again. This summer, they\u2019re playing outdoor shows including this weekend\u2019s Isle of Wight Festival, Dreamland in Margate, and Gunnersbury Park in London. \u201cI was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, because the old tours, it was very much like rock star vibes every night, starting with a shot of JD like \u2018Wheyy,\u2019\u201d Tulisa recalls. \u201cNow I\u2019m just too old to do that, my body can\u2019t hack it! So I was like, how am I going to handle this if I\u2019m not getting smashed every night?\u201dAll three of them have an admirably pragmatic stance on wealth and fame. \u201cIt\u2019s quite mentally challenging to be famous from a young, young age and get to your thirties and still be going,\u201d Dappy says. He tends to caveat a sincere comment with something that lightens the mood, in this case hollering: \u201cBut we\u2019re still young\u2026 we look good, we sexy, we here baby!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve always been too fast-moving for them to understand, though. By the time they thought they did, we\u2019d already moved onto the next stage FazerYou wonder whether things might have been easier had their uncle been around to guide them. As it was, their notoriety only grew along with their fame. By the time they\u2019d announced their hiatus to pursue solo projects, Tulisa, Dappy and Fazer were still relatively clueless about what a \u201cnormal\u201d adulthood entailed. \u201cI ended up having a kind of midlife crisis,\u201d Tulisa says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to pay my rent, my bills\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know how much a pint of milk was. It was like I had to learn how to take control of my life, and start from the beginning.\u201dIn other ways, though, Tulisa managed to assert herself as a mature, empowered woman at a time when slut-shaming and misogyny were rife. The way she had handled a sex tape leaked by her ex-boyfriend, MC Ultra (Justin Edwards), was widely hailed as a feminist triumph. First, Tulisa shared her own five-minute video calmly explaining how she had nothing to be ashamed of, and condemning him for his actions. Later, she stood outside the High Court and celebrated winning a formal apology from Edwards. \u201cHis actions were to spite me, make money and ruin my career,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cHe has succeeded in none of these things. I stand here today a stronger, wiser young woman.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re that young, you live your mistakes in the spotlight,\u201d Tulisa says now. She\u2019s glad things have changed, sort of. \u201cPeople can\u2019t get away with half the things they used to do. Some of the things I\u2019ve experienced as a woman and the way people have gone for us\u2026\u201d She shudders. \u201cI see the same stuff happening now and people are horrified, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh this poor girl\u2026\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Hang on a minute, you were all happy and laughing at me 10 years ago! But I am glad people don\u2019t have to go through what I did.\u201dTulisa: \u2018When you\u2019re that young, you live your mistakes in the spotlight\u2019 (Press image)They seem more concerned by how their fame affected the people around them. Friends would come to their shows and struggle to deal with the comedowns that followed. It must have been harder, the band seem to think, to witness the briefest glimpse of money, fame and adulation, before returning to normality knowing it\u2019s never going to be yours. \u201cIt\u2019s like an addiction,\u201d Fazer says. \u201cWe\u2019d go on another tour and they\u2019d not wanna come because afterwards\u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cIt changes you,\u201d Dappy agrees. \u201cThe human body, in my opinion, is not designed to go through this: make music, and then go out night after night to hundreds of thousands of people, and you get paid for it\u2026 in high quantity, let\u2019s say, right?\u201d Tulisa interjects: \u201cYou bloody love touring.\u201d\u201cI miss my family when I\u2019m away,\u201d Dappy says. Does he have kids? He pauses, and I wonder if he\u2019s counting. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few,\u201d he says finally. Fazer, whose own long-term partner just gave birth to twins, cackles. Tulisa, currently single, calls herself a \u201clone wolf\u201d before swiping at her cousin as he tries to pick dirt off her socks again: \u201cF*** off, Dappy.\u201dRecommendedThe 22 greatest Glastonbury performances everDan Carey: \u2018I used to be associated with music that wasn\u2019t in demand\u2019Jenny Lewis interview: \u2018I suspected that if I stayed behind, I might not make it\u2019Antics aside, there\u2019s something very moving about this trio who have, despite all the obstacles thrown at them, survived.

The Mallorcan villa has a resident a bad boy hiding in plain sight.The ITV2 dating series returned earlier this month for its 10th season, with a new group of singles competing to find love and win the \u00a350,000 prize.In Wednesday night\u2019s episode (15 June), 24-year-old semi-professional footballer Tyrique Hyde and 27-year-old Leah Taylor have a lacklustre conversation where Leah gets absolutely nothing out of Tyrique, apart from a few flirty remarks. Tyrique is currently coupled up with Leah, but is also getting to know Glaswegian model Ella Thomas, whom he was previously paired up with. As both girls put pressure on Tyrique to make a decision and pick one of them, he has attempted to remain mysterious about matters of the heart. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been coming off in the worst possible way.In one scene, Leah asks Tyrique where his head is at \u2013 Love Island speak for, \u201cwhat are you thinking?\u201d He shuts down the conversation with a blunt: \u201cNah.\u201d When Leah applies more pressure for a fully-formed response, he answers back: \u201cLook at you getting a backbone!\u201d RecommendedThe Love Island cast\u2019s reactions to 30-year-old Charlotte were disappointing, but not surprisingMolly, Ella, Leah... meet the cast of Love Island\u2019s 2023 summer editionLove Island viewers have doubts over Mitchel\u2019s \u2018delusional\u2019 planThis seems to be a classic example of negging, a flirting technique where a person deliberately gives a backhanded compliment to undermine someone else\u2019s confidence.Tyrone later turns his attention to Ella by the fire pit, having fobbed her for the entire day. Yet, he tells the islander that she is his \u201cpriority\u201d and denies ignoring her. Ella appears relatively calm during the conversation, but he accuses her: \u201cAll you do is shout.\u201dIn the short history of Love Island since its first episode in 2015, there has been a willingness to let foul play slide in favour of drama-filled antics. Slowly, though, there have been calls for change.In 2018, Women\u2019s Aid issued its first statement about emotionally abusive behaviour being presented on Love Island (the charity has done this again since). This year, ITV has made further provisions to root out foul play on screen, with contestants trained in unconscious bias and recognising coercive behaviour in the villa, and in an afford to equip them with some aftercare, lessons on how to handle their finances after they leave.

He doesn\u2019t want to talk about his feelings when asked to \u2013 which is basically the point of Love Island \u2013 nor does he seem to have any intention of coupling up with one of his fellow islanders. Which, again, is the programme\u2019s entire plot. There\u2019s another layer to Tyrique\u2019s dismissive communication style; he delivers each throwaway comment with a smile and laughter. His replies are deliberately short, vague and masked as jokes.There\u2019s no doubt that ITV\u2019s producers are keen to keep Tyrique in the series because, at present, he is harmless, somewhat entertaining and makes for great telly. But his communication reeks of the damaging behaviour we have seen from contestants (of both genders) for 10 series now. It seems Tyrique has not taken note of the unsuccessful Islanders that came before, nor ITV\u2019s attempts to create a more positive environment for the contestants. Place your bets on him causing the most chaos at Casa Amor (when the islanders are split up and introduced to new contestants of the opposite sex halfway through the season).

The Cut & Run show is taking place at the city\u2019s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) and has been authorised by the elusive street artist.It will span 25 years and features many of the stencils the artist has used to create work.Banksy said: \u201cI\u2019ve kept these stencils hidden away for years, mindful they could be used as evidence in a charge of criminal damage.\u201cBut that moment seems to have passed, so now I\u2019m exhibiting them in a gallery as works of art.

Despite the best efforts of the council and police, every time one is removed another takes its place.\u201cThis might sound absurd and pretentious (just wait until you see the rest of the exhibition), but it\u2019s my favourite work of art in the UK and the reason I\u2019ve brought the show here.\u201dThe exhibition will open on Sunday and will run for three months, opening all night at weekends.

Greatest Days, Coky Giedroyc\u2019s big screen transfer of \u201cthe official Take That musical\u201d, finds an equally broad theme on which to pin itself: how the glue that holds together young female friendships can often be a shared fixation.In this case, it\u2019s a fictional boy band only ever referred to as \u201cthe boys\u201d (played by Aaron Bryan, Dalvin Cory, Joshua Jung, Mark Samara and Mervin Noronha) \u2013 they sing Take That\u2019s entire back catalogue but, for mysterious reasons, are officially not Take That. Their white shirts, always unbuttoned, billow in the wind. Sometimes they wear leather harnesses. They\u2019re somehow highly sexual and completely asexual at the same time, as all great boy bands are.Rachel (Aisling Bea), a night-shift nurse in a tender but sterile relationship, wins a radio competition to see the band\u2019s reunion concert in Athens. But she hasn\u2019t been in touch with her girlhood pals in decades, a crew we see in a handful of spirited flashbacks (where Rachel is played by uncanny Bea lookalike Lara McDonnell). There\u2019s Heather (Eliza Dobson), Zoe (Nandi Sawyers-Hudson), Claire (Carragon Guest), and, finally, the boisterous Debbie (Jessie Mae Alonzo).We\u2019re shown, through musical fantasy renditions of Take That hits such as \u201cPray\u201d, \u201cCould It Be Magic\u201d, and \u201cEverything Changes\u201d, how the boys offered these teens a temporary respite from their dead-end Lancashire hometown.

Much like a classic Take That track, this is a film that cares much more for the display of emotion than it does its root cause \u2013 the second it dares get specific, it risks losing that wide-scale relatability.RecommendedPretty Red Dress review: An admirable if slight exploration into Black masculinity and the gender binaryThe Flash review: Muddled, poignant and \u2013 because of Ezra Miller \u2013 morally trickyTransformers: Rise of the Beasts review \u2013 You shouldn\u2019t have to do homework to enjoy a movie about battling robotsAnd so the women abruptly explode into conflict, as the boys croon \u201cGreatest Day\u201d and \u201cNever Forget\u201d, while their connection to this music is whittled away into something largely perfunctory.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere\u2019s a wide gap between outright acceptance and outright rejection. And it\u2019s somewhere within that muddled centre that Dionne Edwards has set her directorial debut, Pretty Red Dress, about a husband\u2019s reckoning with what it means to be a man. Edwards\u2019s film is an admirable if somewhat slight attempt to explore how the gender binary harms all. And, more specifically, the rigid boundaries placed on Black masculinity.Travis (Natey Jones), recently released from prison, has returned to his old life. His wife, Candice (Alexandra Burke, former X Factor winner and recent West End mainstay) held down the fort and raised their daughter Kenisha (Temilola Olatunbosun) while he was away. His release gives her a chance to pursue her own desires, her heart dead-set on the starring role in a musical based on the life of Tina Turner (who died last month).She splurges on a beaded, blood-red dress to add a little extra shimmy to her rendition of \u201cProud Mary\u201d. But Travis feels struck by an uneasiness. The dress, hung in its closet, calls out to him. When the house is empty, he tries it on. When he rests his body between those layers of silk, he\u2019s able to unburden himself of all the things society has demanded from him but which he\u2019s never offered to give.Meanwhile, Kenisha\u2019s been repeatedly suspended from school. It\u2019s a convenient distraction from her secretive crush on another girl. Candice, though she\u2019d rebuff any accusation of homophobia, is also clearly someone who both husband and daughter feel the need to hide away from. You can feel all those unspoken words in the air, a thick cloud of shame inside an otherwise amenable home.Pretty Red Dress reaches out gently to a few untouched corners of British film \u2013 not only in how it tackles gendered expectations, but in how it finds in Candice neither hero nor villain. Instead she\u2019s a woman who\u2019s yet to face up to the prejudices she\u2019s been fed her entire life. The film is refreshing, too, in how it deals with sex. The way Travis and Candice experiment with dominance and roleplay in the bedroom is clumsy but sincere (and features perhaps the most wholesome utterance of \u201cI\u2019m your little b****\u201d on film).RecommendedAlexandra Burke on motherhood, method acting and her film debut: \u2018I did an hour on my spin bike to celebrate getting the part\u2019The Flash review: Muddled, poignant and \u2013 because of Ezra Miller \u2013 morally trickyGreatest Days review: The Take That musical film is every bit as nicely generic as you\u2019d imagineBut what could be truly radical here feels diluted by the film\u2019s more practical efforts to market itself as feel-good fare \u2013 a second coming of Kinky Boots, if you will. Pretty Red Dress\u2019s titular frock is treated as the beginning and end of all gender exploration; the single barrier to be leapt over to achieve spiritual liberation. It\u2019s all a bit simplistic, just one way to externalise all the beautifully knotty and even contradictory ways that Travis views himself.Still, Edwards has shown real confidence with her camera, in how seamlessly her scenes blend from reality and into the quasi-musical space inside Travis and Candice\u2019s heads. Burke has also made one of the smarter music-to-movies leaps in recent history, with a role that allows her \u2013 A Star Is Born-style \u2013 to strip back the glamorous excesses of pop music and show us all that twinkly-eyed radiance that denotes true stardom. And Jones, one of the film\u2019s strongest elements, brings an unforced, delicate vulnerability to Travis. It only takes him a single line to nail the modest but cathartic appeal of Pretty Red Dress: \u201cI just like being pretty sometimes.\u201dDir: Dionne Edwards.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the summer of 2002, producer and screenwriter James Schamus went to Times Square to see Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man. Schamus, a frequent collaborator with director Ang Lee, went for two reasons: to celebrate the star-making moment of Tobey Maguire, with whom Lee and Schamus worked on The Ice Storm; and to \u201cscope out what was going in Marvel-land\u201d. Lee and Schamus were deep into production on Hulk, a rival superhero smackdown now marking its 20th anniversary.Hulk \u2013 which starred Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the scientist with severe anger management issues \u2013 had been more than a decade in development. These were the old times, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe had taken over \u2013 when Marvel\u2019s top-billed characters were in the hands of other studios, and filmmakers were scrambling to figure out the formula of blockbuster cinema\u2019s hot new trend.For Schamus, that all changed in the closing seconds of Spider-Man. Having dispatched the Green Goblin, Spidey takes one final, triumphant swing through New York City and lands in front of the American flag. \u201cIn my mind it created the genre,\u201d Schamus tells me. Leaving the cinema in Times Square, Schamus called Lee and told him: \u201cI think we\u2019re in a little trouble\u2026\u201d The audience, said Schamus, would go to watch superhero movies expecting to see \u201cthe American flag version\u201d from that point on. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve got!\u201dIndeed, Hulk \u2013 which released to mixed reviews in June 2003 \u2013 is a curiosity of pre-MCU super-heroics: a film that, for the most part, eschews the expected hulk-smashery for a more contemplative exercise in soul searching. \u201cAng was committed to the abstract and ethereal outsider version,\u201d says Schamus. But Lee \u2013 who even 20 years on seems an unlikely choice for Hulk (his films either side were Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain) \u2013 was also committed to the film\u2019s major selling point. That being the once fanboy-quivering prospect of seeing the Hulk brought to life \u2013 a transformation that didn\u2019t involve slapping green paint on a bodybuilder.\u201cAng Lee was such a team player, he decided to suit up and do a bunch of the motion capture himself,\u201d says Aaron Ferguson, then a creature supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic. \u201cHe was able to channel his inner Hulk and storm around.\u201dRecommendedBruce Lee\u2019s long, violent journey to immortality: \u2018He knew the star should always be the boss\u2019Daredevil at 20: Backlash, Evanescence and Ben Affleck\u2019s (first) superhero flopEric Bana: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be James Bond \u2013 it would have been too much fame for my head\u2019Hulk began development in the early 1990s, with multiple screenwriters writing multiple drafts and various directors attached. Different proposed scenarios would have seen Hulk battling terrorists, insect men, sharks, or his giant-headed nemesis, The Leader. Leaked details were also subject to early examples of toxic online fandom \u2013 the kind of entitled, gate-keeping bile that spews up around certain pop culture properties. Universal had blown a reported $20m on pre-production before Lee even joined. Schamus remembers there being \u201c15 or 16 prior drafts\u201d when they signed on. \u201cIt was just all over the map,\u201d he adds. Lee may have been an unlikely candidate for Hulk, but he took on the project \u2013 in part \u2013 out of cinematic wonderment. Their attitude with their projects by that point, says Schamus, was \u201cthat sounds cool. We love movies; let\u2019s go make movies!\u201d\n\nThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing. There was more of that self-aware wisecracking!James SchamusSchamus had previous experience, having worked (uncredited) on the script of 2000\u2019s X-Men, the film that set the superhero boom in motion. Schamus recalls that Marvel Studios at the time consisted mostly of CEO/producer Avi Arad, with Kevin Feige \u2013 now the mastermind of the MCU \u2013 as a junior assistant. \u201cI would notice him and think, \u2018Oh, this guy, he knows what he\u2019s doing!\u2019\u201d laughs Schamus.With Schamus rewriting the script himself, Hulk followed the long-held movie tradition of tampering with the original comic (see also: Spider-Man\u2019s organic web-shooters and Power Ranger-like Green Goblin; the X-Men not being man enough for yellow spandex). In the Incredible Hulk comic, first published in 1962, Bruce Banner is a scientist who \u2013 while saving someone else\u2019s life \u2013 gets caught in the blast of a gamma bomb, which causes him to transform into the Hulk. Schamus was free from the restraints of hardcore fandom (\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up as a comic-book geek kid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t formative to me\u201d), but he did go back to the comics. He was taken by a 1980s storyline that introduced Banner\u2019s abusive father, who killed the future Hulk\u2019s mother \u2013 the source of grown-up Banner\u2019s anger issues.The 2003 movie follows loosely: Banner\u2019s father, David (Nick Nolte) is a government scientist who \u2013 against orders \u2013 performs an experiment on himself and passes mutant genes to his son. Years later, Bruce (Bana) \u2013 now a nanotech scientist \u2013 is involved in a gamma accident that triggers the mutant cells. Like the Eighties comic book, this version of Banner witnessed his father murder his mother. The real cause of the monster is the repressed memory of this incident.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7-daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeWith so many previous script drafts and writers, the film was subject to a tricky arbitration over the writing credits. Certain elements, including the abusive father, had shown up in previous drafts. In the end, Schamus shared the writing credit with previous scriptwriters Michael France and John Turman. The arbitration was detailed in a New Yorker cover story. Two decades on, Schamus is pragmatic about the controversy. He thinks there was some political wrangling in the Writers Guild. \u201cAlso, whatever,\u201d he says, laughing.Ang Lee studies Hulk heads on the set of the 2003 film (Shutterstock)Schamus recalls pushing to cast Bana after seeing him in Chopper. Bana, as wonderful as he is, gets eaten alive by Nolte, who plays his onscreen father with off-kilter, sunken-eyed menace \u2013 despite the inherent ridiculousness of being a mad scientist with three giant mutant dogs (including a killer poodle). Discovering his own superhuman ability \u2013 to fuse with any material he lays his hands on \u2013 he becomes a reworking of the comics\u2019 Absorbing Man.\u201cI really adored Nick,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cHe was definitely in the process of becoming the character that he\u2019s now more known as \u2013 after the mugshot that happened when we were in post [he was arrested for driving while high on the date rape drug, GHB]. But he doesn\u2019t show up on screen without giving everything. Ang let him chew the scenery right down to the floorboards.\u201dCo-stars include Jennifer Connelly as Banner\u2019s long-time sweetheart, Betty Ross; Sam Elliot as Hulk\u2019s military adversary (and Betty\u2019s father), Thunderbolt Ross; and Josh Lucas \u2013 the only person in the film who seems to be having some fun \u2013 as a soldier-turned-corporate snide, whose job it is to bully Banner then get thrown around by the Hulk. There are cameos, too, from Hulk co-creator Stan Lee (naturally) and Lou Ferrigno, the 6ft 5in bodybuilder who played the Hulk (with the help of green grease paint) in the 1970s TV series. The original Hulk comic was cancelled after six issues. It was actually the TV show that made the Hulk a pop culture icon, as summed up by its most iconic line: \u201cDon\u2019t make me angry, you wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry\u201d. The 2003 Hulk saves the line for the very last scene.Lou Ferrigno as the Hulked-out version of Dr Bruce Banner in the classic \u2018Incredible Hulk\u2019 TV series (Snap/Shutterstock)At one stage, the VFX maestros at Industrial Light & Magic considered going down the Ferrigno route to create the Hulk \u2013 an ambitious project in the early Noughties. \u201cThere was a lot of wondering what we had gotten ourselves into \u2013 was this more than we could do?\u201d Aaron Ferguson says. \u201cThere were lots of people shaking their heads and a lot of crazy ideas. One idea was that maybe we should do it as a guy in a suit and adjust it all after [digitally]. People were like, \u2018That\u2019s not gonna work!\u2019\u201dOne major challenge, recalls Ferguson, is that ILM hadn\u2019t quite caught up with the latest evolution in CGI tech. Even then, the techniques ILM was using to create the Hulk were old school. The colour green was a problem, too. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around with the dailies and think, \u2018What is wrong with this shot?\u2019\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cA co-worker said \u2018look at this\u2019 and changed the monitor so it was just black and white. Everyone was like, \u2018That looks so much better!\u2019 The green breaks the illusion of it being human. No matter what shade you use, somewhere in your mind there\u2019s something wrong with it.\u201dFor Ferguson, the best part of the job was working with Lee. \u201cAn all-in kind of guy,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m coming and staying at the studio and working with you guys.\u2019 We had dailies with him every day. He was full of ideas.\u201dTwenty years on, the Hulk CGI looks better than you might expect \u2013 though certainly primitive. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say cringeworthy,\u201d says Ferguson, \u201cbut there\u2019s dated material in there.\u201d A fight with the mutant dogs \u2013 which felt like a cop out in lieu of a proper superhero vs supervillain punch-up at the time \u2013 is a highlight. And a desert battle between Hulk and the US army feels like a bit of freeform Hulk action.Eric Bana\u2019s Dr Bruce Banner is consoled by Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in \u2018Hulk\u2019  (Shutterstock)But for all of Lee\u2019s stomping around in mo-cap Hulk mode, the film \u2013 about a man who turns into a green monster, lest we forget \u2013 is jarringly straight-faced. \u201cThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cThere was more of that self-aware wisecracking! By the time you got the finished film it was taking itself very seriously.\u201dIt\u2019s best demonstrated by the film\u2019s first Hulk-out scene \u2013 the moment that everyone\u2019s been waiting for. It\u2019s not part of an all-action spectacle, like Avengers Assemble\u2019s helicarrier wallop-fest, but a scene of Bana\u2019s troubled scientist sitting alone, having a good old think about who he really is deep down.Lee is also one of the few directors \u2013 alongside Tim Burton and Sam Raimi, perhaps \u2013 to make a film that actually resembles a comic book. Using split screen and other techniques, Lee replicates comic panels and gives scenes a sense of propulsion. The sound, says Schamus, was designed to draw you to different places on screen.It\u2019s as if Hulk leapt forward. We didn\u2019t get the straight-up, all-action Incredible Hulk movie \u2013 something more like the 2008 film starring Edward Norton.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn the summer of 2002, producer and screenwriter James Schamus went to Times Square to see Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man. Schamus, a frequent collaborator with director Ang Lee, went for two reasons: to celebrate the star-making moment of Tobey Maguire, with whom Lee and Schamus worked on The Ice Storm; and to \u201cscope out what was going in Marvel-land\u201d. Lee and Schamus were deep into production on Hulk, a rival superhero smackdown now marking its 20th anniversary.Hulk \u2013 which starred Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the scientist with severe anger management issues \u2013 had been more than a decade in development. These were the old times, before the Marvel Cinematic Universe had taken over \u2013 when Marvel\u2019s top-billed characters were in the hands of other studios, and filmmakers were scrambling to figure out the formula of blockbuster cinema\u2019s hot new trend.For Schamus, that all changed in the closing seconds of Spider-Man. Having dispatched the Green Goblin, Spidey takes one final, triumphant swing through New York City and lands in front of the American flag. \u201cIn my mind it created the genre,\u201d Schamus tells me. Leaving the cinema in Times Square, Schamus called Lee and told him: \u201cI think we\u2019re in a little trouble\u2026\u201d The audience, said Schamus, would go to watch superhero movies expecting to see \u201cthe American flag version\u201d from that point on. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve got!\u201dIndeed, Hulk \u2013 which released to mixed reviews in June 2003 \u2013 is a curiosity of pre-MCU super-heroics: a film that, for the most part, eschews the expected hulk-smashery for a more contemplative exercise in soul searching. \u201cAng was committed to the abstract and ethereal outsider version,\u201d says Schamus. But Lee \u2013 who even 20 years on seems an unlikely choice for Hulk (his films either side were Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain) \u2013 was also committed to the film\u2019s major selling point. That being the once fanboy-quivering prospect of seeing the Hulk brought to life \u2013 a transformation that didn\u2019t involve slapping green paint on a bodybuilder.\u201cAng Lee was such a team player, he decided to suit up and do a bunch of the motion capture himself,\u201d says Aaron Ferguson, then a creature supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic. \u201cHe was able to channel his inner Hulk and storm around.\u201dRecommendedBruce Lee\u2019s long, violent journey to immortality: \u2018He knew the star should always be the boss\u2019Daredevil at 20: Backlash, Evanescence and Ben Affleck\u2019s (first) superhero flopEric Bana: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be James Bond \u2013 it would have been too much fame for my head\u2019Hulk began development in the early 1990s, with multiple screenwriters writing multiple drafts and various directors attached. Different proposed scenarios would have seen Hulk battling terrorists, insect men, sharks, or his giant-headed nemesis, The Leader. Leaked details were also subject to early examples of toxic online fandom \u2013 the kind of entitled, gate-keeping bile that spews up around certain pop culture properties. Universal had blown a reported $20m on pre-production before Lee even joined. Schamus remembers there being \u201c15 or 16 prior drafts\u201d when they signed on. \u201cIt was just all over the map,\u201d he adds. Lee may have been an unlikely candidate for Hulk, but he took on the project \u2013 in part \u2013 out of cinematic wonderment. Their attitude with their projects by that point, says Schamus, was \u201cthat sounds cool. We love movies; let\u2019s go make movies!\u201d\n\nThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing. There was more of that self-aware wisecracking!James SchamusSchamus had previous experience, having worked (uncredited) on the script of 2000\u2019s X-Men, the film that set the superhero boom in motion. Schamus recalls that Marvel Studios at the time consisted mostly of CEO/producer Avi Arad, with Kevin Feige \u2013 now the mastermind of the MCU \u2013 as a junior assistant. \u201cI would notice him and think, \u2018Oh, this guy, he knows what he\u2019s doing!\u2019\u201d laughs Schamus.With Schamus rewriting the script himself, Hulk followed the long-held movie tradition of tampering with the original comic (see also: Spider-Man\u2019s organic web-shooters and Power Ranger-like Green Goblin; the X-Men not being man enough for yellow spandex). In the Incredible Hulk comic, first published in 1962, Bruce Banner is a scientist who \u2013 while saving someone else\u2019s life \u2013 gets caught in the blast of a gamma bomb, which causes him to transform into the Hulk. Schamus was free from the restraints of hardcore fandom (\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up as a comic-book geek kid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t formative to me\u201d), but he did go back to the comics. He was taken by a 1980s storyline that introduced Banner\u2019s abusive father, who killed the future Hulk\u2019s mother \u2013 the source of grown-up Banner\u2019s anger issues.The 2003 movie follows loosely: Banner\u2019s father, David (Nick Nolte) is a government scientist who \u2013 against orders \u2013 performs an experiment on himself and passes mutant genes to his son. Years later, Bruce (Bana) \u2013 now a nanotech scientist \u2013 is involved in a gamma accident that triggers the mutant cells. Like the Eighties comic book, this version of Banner witnessed his father murder his mother. The real cause of the monster is the repressed memory of this incident.Watch Apple TV+ free for 7-daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeWith so many previous script drafts and writers, the film was subject to a tricky arbitration over the writing credits. Certain elements, including the abusive father, had shown up in previous drafts. In the end, Schamus shared the writing credit with previous scriptwriters Michael France and John Turman. The arbitration was detailed in a New Yorker cover story. Two decades on, Schamus is pragmatic about the controversy. He thinks there was some political wrangling in the Writers Guild. \u201cAlso, whatever,\u201d he says, laughing.Ang Lee studies Hulk heads on the set of the 2003 film (Shutterstock)Schamus recalls pushing to cast Bana after seeing him in Chopper. Bana, as wonderful as he is, gets eaten alive by Nolte, who plays his onscreen father with off-kilter, sunken-eyed menace \u2013 despite the inherent ridiculousness of being a mad scientist with three giant mutant dogs (including a killer poodle). Discovering his own superhuman ability \u2013 to fuse with any material he lays his hands on \u2013 he becomes a reworking of the comics\u2019 Absorbing Man.\u201cI really adored Nick,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cHe was definitely in the process of becoming the character that he\u2019s now more known as \u2013 after the mugshot that happened when we were in post [he was arrested for driving while high on the date rape drug, GHB]. But he doesn\u2019t show up on screen without giving everything. Ang let him chew the scenery right down to the floorboards.\u201dCo-stars include Jennifer Connelly as Banner\u2019s long-time sweetheart, Betty Ross; Sam Elliot as Hulk\u2019s military adversary (and Betty\u2019s father), Thunderbolt Ross; and Josh Lucas \u2013 the only person in the film who seems to be having some fun \u2013 as a soldier-turned-corporate snide, whose job it is to bully Banner then get thrown around by the Hulk. There are cameos, too, from Hulk co-creator Stan Lee (naturally) and Lou Ferrigno, the 6ft 5in bodybuilder who played the Hulk (with the help of green grease paint) in the 1970s TV series. The original Hulk comic was cancelled after six issues. It was actually the TV show that made the Hulk a pop culture icon, as summed up by its most iconic line: \u201cDon\u2019t make me angry, you wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry\u201d. The 2003 Hulk saves the line for the very last scene.Lou Ferrigno as the Hulked-out version of Dr Bruce Banner in the classic \u2018Incredible Hulk\u2019 TV series (Snap/Shutterstock)At one stage, the VFX maestros at Industrial Light & Magic considered going down the Ferrigno route to create the Hulk \u2013 an ambitious project in the early Noughties. \u201cThere was a lot of wondering what we had gotten ourselves into \u2013 was this more than we could do?\u201d Aaron Ferguson says. \u201cThere were lots of people shaking their heads and a lot of crazy ideas. One idea was that maybe we should do it as a guy in a suit and adjust it all after [digitally]. People were like, \u2018That\u2019s not gonna work!\u2019\u201dOne major challenge, recalls Ferguson, is that ILM hadn\u2019t quite caught up with the latest evolution in CGI tech. Even then, the techniques ILM was using to create the Hulk were old school. The colour green was a problem, too. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around with the dailies and think, \u2018What is wrong with this shot?\u2019\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cA co-worker said \u2018look at this\u2019 and changed the monitor so it was just black and white. Everyone was like, \u2018That looks so much better!\u2019 The green breaks the illusion of it being human. No matter what shade you use, somewhere in your mind there\u2019s something wrong with it.\u201dFor Ferguson, the best part of the job was working with Lee. \u201cAn all-in kind of guy,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m coming and staying at the studio and working with you guys.\u2019 We had dailies with him every day. He was full of ideas.\u201dTwenty years on, the Hulk CGI looks better than you might expect \u2013 though certainly primitive. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say cringeworthy,\u201d says Ferguson, \u201cbut there\u2019s dated material in there.\u201d A fight with the mutant dogs \u2013 which felt like a cop out in lieu of a proper superhero vs supervillain punch-up at the time \u2013 is a highlight. And a desert battle between Hulk and the US army feels like a bit of freeform Hulk action.Eric Bana\u2019s Dr Bruce Banner is consoled by Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in \u2018Hulk\u2019  (Shutterstock)But for all of Lee\u2019s stomping around in mo-cap Hulk mode, the film \u2013 about a man who turns into a green monster, lest we forget \u2013 is jarringly straight-faced. \u201cThe script I wrote, weirdly, was probably more Marvel-y than what you ended up seeing,\u201d says Schamus. \u201cThere was more of that self-aware wisecracking! By the time you got the finished film it was taking itself very seriously.\u201dIt\u2019s best demonstrated by the film\u2019s first Hulk-out scene \u2013 the moment that everyone\u2019s been waiting for. It\u2019s not part of an all-action spectacle, like Avengers Assemble\u2019s helicarrier wallop-fest, but a scene of Bana\u2019s troubled scientist sitting alone, having a good old think about who he really is deep down.Lee is also one of the few directors \u2013 alongside Tim Burton and Sam Raimi, perhaps \u2013 to make a film that actually resembles a comic book.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeShould Warner Bros have shelved The Flash? I\u2019m honestly not sure I have an answer. The accounts of its star, Ezra Miller, and their two-year downward spiral \u2013 which include allegations of harassment, grooming and physical violence \u2013 is distressing in a way that extends beyond all critical analysis. What needs to come, before even the matter of accountability, is the question of why there was no support system in place. Why was no one empowered either with the tools or with the moral imperative to intervene in a situation where an individual was in such a clearly dangerous state?There\u2019s no real sense that anyone would be helped by either the release or the cancellation of Miller\u2019s movie. In both scenarios, Warner Bros gets to shrug all responsibility and focus on the fate of its product and not the people it employs. And though the actor is (as their representatives stress) currently seeking treatment, the hand-wringing over a proposed sequel brings with it the perverse implication that said treatment will end not when medical professionals say so, but when Hollywood decides it\u2019s time for Miller to go back to work.The Flash, which has been in active development for nearly a decade, now also arrives after the announcement that DC\u2019s new leadership, Peter Safran and James Gunn, will largely be starting over from scratch. Farewell to 10 years of impotent franchise blueprints. It means that the film arriving here is an odd one \u2013 muddled and uncertain of its own identity, coloured by outside circumstance, but oddly poignant at times. It\u2019s stuck somewhere in between cynical fan service and a more sincere yearning to create art out of corporate strategising.Much of that division is inherent to its plot, which sees The Flash, aka Barry Allen, on an intimate journey of metaphysical implications. Barry, when we first meet him, is frustrated by his place in the superhero pantheon, having essentially become \u201cthe janitor of the Justice League\u201d and left to clean up Batman\u2019s (Ben Affleck) messes. He\u2019s also pained by his inability to prove his father (Ron Livingston) innocent of the murder of his mother (Maribel Verd\u00fa). And so he uses his powers to, as Cher would put it, turn back time. But that screws up the space-time continuum in the process \u2013 leading Barry to cross paths with a younger version of himself that\u2019s never experienced any of the same loss or any of the same heroics.Screenwriter Christina Hodson, who also wrote DC\u2019s Birds of Prey, is thankfully able to tease some of the humanity out of this meta-human. This is, after all, a story about the grief process, and a literalisation of the concept of healing one\u2019s inner child. Barry gets to see who he\u2019d have been without the personal pain, and naturally starts to resent his more fortunate, unperturbed self. Miller consistently hits the right balance with these dual, sometimes competing performances \u2013 a step up for a character whose only defining trait used to be \u201cirritating\u201d. It\u2019s a product of the strong writing here\u2026 when you can actually hear it over the sounds of explosions and cheques being cashed.RecommendedThe Flash director says Tom Cruise cold called him to praise Ezra Miller movie: Huge \u2018confidence boost\u2019Ezra Miller alludes to legal troubles at The Flash premiereEzra Miller: Everything we know about the controversial star of The FlashAs has been exhaustingly teased, Barry\u2019s timeline shenanigans land him in a universe where Michael Keaton is Batman, as he was in Tim Burton\u2019s double-dose of films in 1989 and 1992. Keaton turns up with the same winsome smirk as Andrew Garfield in Spider-Man: No Way Home, if very little of the same emotional closure. Director Andy Muschietti is probably the one having the most fun here, as he enthusiastically launches his film into the gothic, fog-encrusted aesthetics of Burton\u2019s work and the desaturated gloom of Zack Snyder\u2019s DC contributions (Michael Shannon\u2019s Zod, of Man of Steel fame, also returns). There are additionally two Flash-centric sequences that pay unexpected homage to the Looney Tunes, complete with babies freefalling out of skyscrapers and a band\u2019s worth of musical instruments tumbling out of a truck. They\u2019re so self-indulgently silly that they kind of work. That\u2019s if you ignore the wildly inconsistent special effects.There are a handful of other cameos, some of them so ludicrous you almost have to admire the tenacity, as well as a featherlight appearance from Sasha Calle\u2019s Supergirl. It\u2019s clear that DC doesn\u2019t really know what it\u2019s paying tribute to, other than the knowledge that other comic book movies exist. The Flash, much like Barry himself, has been stranded with no real sense of history, and no real sense of the future, either. It does the best it can.Dir: Andy Muschietti.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOur microguides series is inspired by the slow travel movement, encouraging travellers to relax their pace and take a deep dive into one particular neighbourhood in a well-loved city. Rather than a whirlwind itinerary which aims to hit up every must-see attraction, these compact, close-up guides encourage you to zone in, take your time and truly explore like a local.Williamsburg, Brooklyn\u2019s trendiest neighbourhood, is growing up. You can still play arcade games while getting drunk, go bowling while watching a rock band or catch a drag show in a museum, but the neighbourhood is exploring a gentler tempo, too. One that involves strolls along the New York City\u2019s East River, bargain hunting for cusp-of-the-trend fashion at thrift stores and savouring the diverse community\u2019s extensive culinary offerings.The finger-on-the-pulse approach to life in Williamsburg results from its emergence as a hipster haven a few decades ago. These days, however, you can gauge the area\u2019s average socio-economic status more by the designer dogs you\u2019ll see along the waterfront than the street art on the walls. And although this increasing price parity with Manhattan has sadly edged out many of the people who helped to revive the neighbourhood, a creative charm and youthful atmosphere remain.Williamsburg is anchored to Manhattan by the Williamsburg Bridge, which carries the J and M trains. Both lines head east into Queens and west into Manhattan, with the J destined for the Financial District and the M travelling up as far as The Bronx. The G line at Metropolitan Av runs north to south through east Williamsburg, which retains shades of its pre-gentrification community in the form of long-running businesses. But it\u2019s the L Train from midtown Manhattan that brings the most life to Williamsburg, passing through Bedford Avenue, the core of the \u2019hood and a veritable pacemaker for the area.DoRecommendedBest UK hotels 2022Best boutique hotels in Paris 2022 for style and locationIndependent Traveller guide to best hotels and short breaksRamble along the riverfrontOnce tarnished with industrial grit, the banks of the East River were reserved for docking ships, laden with cargoes bound from, and to, everywhere else. Only in the last few decades have developers recognised the area\u2019s potential. Shimmering newbuilds sit alongside 19th-century warehouses adapted to fulfil modern needs.Williamsburg emerged as a hipster haven decades ago  (Getty Images)Read more on New York travel:The ultimate New York City guideHow to spend a day in Harlem, New York City\u2019s soulful, historic communityThe best boutique hotels in New YorkThere\u2019s no better example than Domino Park, which has transformed an old sugar refinery. The highlight is a raised, 125-metre-long walkway beginning at the foot of two decommissioned cranes. This is surrounded by a thoughtfully landscaped park. Benches provide the perfect angle on sunsets behind the Williamsburg Bridge and sprawling Manhattan cityscape. Continue walking the pedestrian-friendly route northwards as far as Marsha P. Johnson State Park for a variety of New York\u2019s finest waterfront vistas.An afternoon on the waterAt the western end of North 5th Street, you\u2019ll find the pier for the NYC Ferry. Jump aboard one heading towards Pier 11 in Manhattan, riding it all the way, or hopping off in Dumbo, Brooklyn, to explore Brooklyn Bridge Park. It\u2019s a great-value way to cruise the East River and beyond, while passing beneath the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. Tickets cost $4 (\u00a33.20) per trip and ferries run every 20-30 minutes from around 7am until 9.30pm.Commune with creativesMany artists were priced out of Williamsburg years ago but there\u2019s still an active creative life underpinning the area\u2019s bohemian spirit. Williamsburg Art & Historical Center bridges the gap between local artists and creativity in the wider world. There\u2019s a new exhibition every few months and a programme of talks by artists. The multi-storey Mona Lisa de Williamsburg mural is right across the road.Get to know the neighbourhood with walks along the East River  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)For a glimpse at the neighbourhood\u2019s past, head to City Reliquary. This haphazard collection pulls together objects and curios from a bygone Big Apple era. The exhibits form a quirky backdrop to the community-run museum\u2019s cultural events, including comedy panels, performances and informative talks.EatBrunch is ubiquitous with Williamsburg. The misleadingly named Sunday in Brooklyn is open daily, with brunch items taking up a considerable tranche of the menu. The hazelnut maple praline pancakes have people lining up outside the door before opening. Reservations are wise.Williamsburg\u2019s yuppier tendencies fade away the further east in the neighbourhood you go. This is where high-quality food meets slightly less eye-watering prices. The low-key Latin American cuisine with unmistakable Brooklyn gumption at For All Things Good has made it a popular choice with locals. The gorditas are excellent, and the masa tortillas are the real deal.The old docks ensured that a well-established Italian American contingent have long called Williamsburg home, leaving a slew of top-notch ristorantes and pizzerias as a legacy. Stalwart Joe\u2019s Pizza has been serving up New York-style slices since 1975. The walls inside are plastered with photos of the famous folk who have dined there, while the exterior wall is covered in street art. Don\u2019t be put off by the long queue; it moves quickly.If you feel peckish on a Saturday between April and October, the vast outdoor food market dubbed Smorgasburg, comprising up to 100 stalls, is unmissable. Each week, thousands of people descend on the place to try an array of cuisines and fast food alternatives, including vegan options. Try empanadas, po\u2019 boys, oysters, toasties, bao buns and much more.DrinkPractically everywhere here does something slightly different and interesting with coffee beans. Take Qahwah House, for example, named after the Yemeni word for coffee. All the beans and teas are organic and imported from Yemen, perfect alongside buttery sabaya pastry. If you like your coffee shop to have the air of a scientist\u2019s lab about it, the pour-over vessels and brewing equipment at Partners Coffee create such an aura.People used to buy their private swimming pools from Union Pool and the faded signs for chemical balancing and good pool etiquette lend this fairy-light bedecked, hip hangout plenty of charm. The atmosphere comes from its mixed-use space, with booth seating at the front, a beer garden with a taco truck out back, and an excellent entertainment venue with live music or stand-up comedy most nights of the year.Beers from Brooklyn Brewery can be found all over the world \u2013 here\u2019s your chance to neck one from the source  (Getty Images)It\u2019s sold around the world, but you can sup the entire Brooklyn Brewery range straight from the source in Williamsburg. If you\u2019re a fan of seeing how your drinks are made, free brewery tours are also available. Once you\u2019re done there, head next door to Brooklyn Bowl, which manages to combine 16 bowling lanes, a live music venue, a restaurant and a bar in one huge open-plan space. It might well be the world\u2019s most creative repurposing of a former warehouse.ShopWithout doubt one of the coolest shopping experiences in New York is Brooklyn Flea, where vendors sell curated bric-a-brac, including records, homewares and collectibles. From the same creators who run Smorgasburg, think of it as the vintage clothing movement expanded to other items.Reinvention is just as important to this formerly run-down industrial district as is renovation. Artists & Fleas combines both, by filling a former dry goods warehouse with a rotating cast of creatives (dubbed \u201cmakers\u201d) of all kinds each weekend. Expect art, fashion, jewellery and more.StayThe Hoxton, WilliamsburgThey say don\u2019t head to the top of the Empire State Building, head to Top of the Rock instead, because the view will include the former. The same goes for staying in Williamsburg over Manhattan, because your room might just offer one of New York\u2019s finest skyline vistas across the East River. That\u2019s certainly true of the upper floors and rooftop bar of The Hoxton. Rooms blend the classic NYC Art Deco look with the design sense of a modern aesthete. thehoxton.com/williamsburgMoxy Brooklyn WilliamsburgIt used to be that hotels in Williamsburg and the wider Brooklyn area offered lower prices than their Manhattan counterparts. These days, prices are reaching parity. What is heartening however, is the raft of new hotels opening up in Williamsburg, rejuvenating old buildings and bringing fresh new ideas to your stay. Moxy Brooklyn is a prime example, opened in early 2023, with local art installations, a huge mural and a co-working space.

Yet for anyone who cares to explore, Bodrum offers a wealth of experiences that enrich a visit. Natural good looks, a deep and rich heritage and a vibrant 21st-century way of life combine to magical effect.Reaching this thumb of Turkish territory is easy, with direct flights from across the UK to Bodrum airport. And many arrivals head straight into town \u2013 where the first of my highlights awaits.Bodrum HarbourWhen you see the sugar-white houses of Bodrum sprinkled around a natural amphitheatre, it could be love at first sight. All eyes \u2013 and visitors \u2013 are drawn to the harbour at the heart of the town. Bodrum\u2019s port has been an Aegean hub for millennia. The first known settlement was founded as Halicarnassus around 1200 BC. For centuries warring powers fought for control of the strategic location.Today, Bodrum Harbour is a bay of tranquillity, offering safe haven to hundreds of boats: private yachts, fishing vessels and a network of ferries. One sails across to the pretty Datca peninsula, making a fine day trip.Cafes line the quayside; my favourite is run by the Mariners Association. As you\u2019d imagine, it\u2019s popular with sailors. Visitors are welcome, too. The excellent coffee will power you along for a day of sightseeing \u2013 starting right next door \u2026Bodrum CastleThe first fortifications at this location, guarding the entrance to the harbour, were built soon after the settlement was founded. The location was originally an island just offshore, but it is now joined to the mainland.Bodrum Castle was created by the Knights of St John \u2013 crusaders from across Europe \u2013 during the 15th century. The builders used stones from a much earlier building and a former wonder of the world: the vast ceremonial structure housing the tomb of the Carian King Mausolus (of which more in a moment).The crusaders named the fortress the Castle of St Peter. Today, it is a warren of walls, ruined chapels and gates, with insignia showing the national provenance of the various groups of knights (Italian, Spanish, English ...).The highlight, though, is the underwater archaeology museum: not a collection beneath the waves, but a display that reveals the past as discovered in shipwrecks. For thousands of years, seafaring was the main form of trade and communication in the Aegean region. Each shipwreck was a human tragedy. Yet the painstaking recovery of these vessels \u2013 and their contents \u2013 by nautical archaeologists provide insights into the craftsmanship and commerce of the ancient world. Think of these vessels \u2013 and their contents \u2013 as time machines.Over 3,200 years ago, towards the end of the Bronze Age, a ship sank while it was sailing off the southern Turkish coast. In 1982, a sponge diver discovered a vessel and divers retrieved the cargo: amphora (pottery jars) filled with salted fish, olive oil and wine, as well as the tin and copper required to make bronze.At the castle, you learn how important Bodrum and the rest of the Aegean were for the development of humanity.The original MausoleumThe tomb of Mausolus, a Carian king who lived and died almost 2,500 years old, was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The structure was completed in 351BC, decorated by magnificent sculptures and soaring to a height of nearly 50 metres. My guide, Sela Erkanli told me: \u201cThe term \u2018mausoleum\u2019 derives from here. This is the first time it has been used in history. For Mausolus.\"Around 800 years ago, an earthquake brought the original mausoleum down, and its carefully dressed stones were taken away to be reused and begin Bodrum\u2019s next chapter. Yet even today, enough of the mausoleum survives to allow you to touch the past, sense the history and understand a little more about the world.Bodrum theatreJust 200 metres inland from the mausoleum, another ancient triumph is hewn from a hillside. The theatre here in Bodrum is an entertainment highlight from the 4th century BC. It was created at the time of Alexander the Great and later embellished by the Romans. The theatre includes an altar, where sacrifices were offered to the god Dionysus before the performance.Today, you can wander freely around what even by modern standards is a vast venue \u2013 holding 13,000 citizens \u2013 and get a performer\u2019s view of the audience. Appropriately enough for a popular theatre, it\u2019s in the West End of Bodrum. Twenty-four centuries on, the theatre is still used for concerts and dance performances. And there are no bad seats in this house: all yours to enjoy and imagine.Marina lifeOn the Bodrum Peninsula you\u2019re never far from the next great shoreline view \u2013 and you\u2019re never far from one of the marinas that dot the coast. Each is an inviting location for shopping, dining and relaxing.Start in Bodrum itself, where the marina occupies part of the west side of the harbour. It doubles as a retail and entertainment centre \u2013 with excellent coffee and a rooftop view.On the northwest shore of the peninsula, Yal\u0131kavak Marina was named in 2022 as \u201cSuperyacht Marina of the Year\u201d against hundreds of competitors around the world. Yet you are welcome to share the high life, enjoying the same blue skies and sea as people who perhaps have a touch more cash than you do.G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck villageVenture to the western end of the Bodrum Peninsula and you reach the fishing village of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck. It is an excellent location for dining on fresh seafood taken straight from the Mediterranean while enjoying a superb view as far as Greece beyond.Ipek M\u00fcld\u00fcrbati, a film producer, escaped from the clamour of the largest Turkish city, Istanbul. Relocating to G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck was \u201cthe best decision we have ever made,\u201d she told me. \u201cBeing by the sea definitely adds to your life because being able to see the horizon is a luxury. If you are going to get mad at something, you turn your head, you see the sea, breathe it in. It all goes away.I would advise each and every single tourist here to come and visit G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck.\u201dDining out in BodrumIn central Bodrum you need not walk more than a few metres in any direction to find somewhere to eat. From friendly, inexpensive locations serving up delicious kebabs to gourmet restaurants, there\u2019s something for everyone\u2019s taste \u2013 and wallet.While it\u2019s hard to go wrong with your choice, one particular favourite of mine is M\u00fcdavim. Walk up the steps to the waterside restaurant and you discover much of the menu on display: instead of reading, you just look.For the ultimate in seafood sophistication, try Orfoz: a restaurant founded in 1986 by two divers who explored beneath the waves to get the freshest harvest. Each dish, from oysters to clams, is matched with local wines. Finish off with creme caramel, or a beautifully sculpted fruit salad, plus a \u201cMother\u2019s Cookie\u201d \u2013 with a local mandarin liqueur as a digestif.Leleg WayThis well-marked walking path takes you across the Bodrum Peninsula and through the areas where the original inhabitants of this region once lived. The long-distance footpath is marked by a special symbol: a red bar above a white bar, painted on trees and rocks to guide you through pine forests, over the hills and far away into the past.According to Herodotus \u2013 known as the \u201cfather of history\u201d \u2013 the Leleg people lived on the Bodrum Peninsula between the 15th and 4th centuries BC.You could walk the whole Leleg Way in around five days, or just pick out the highlights. Pedasa is the most magnificent of the Leleg citadels. You\u2019re at just about the highest point on the Bodrum Peninsula and the views are as good as the setting.Blue voyageA highlight for many visitors to Bodrum is a trip on a gulet. These traditional wooden sailing vessels, many built in the town, sleep around 16 in comfortable cabins. Guests laze on board while scanning the horizon and deciding which idyllic location is their favourite. An essential component of a gulet cruise is the privilege of mooring in a bay of your own.Nuri Apak, who runs one operation, explained the philosophy of indulgence: \u201cWhatever you want we try to offer. What we are offering in here is a kind of lifestyle. You don\u2019t have to cook. All you have to do is to live it and to experience it.\u201dUndersea worldA gulet is the ideal vessel for snorkelling. Because the hull is low in the water, you can easily step into a new dimension of the Bodrum peninsula and discover many shades of Turkish blue.Snorkelling allows you to move with a sense of sheer freedom \u2013 and adventure. Guided safely by a very experienced diver, I propelled myself through a seascape I had never seen before: with perfect clarity I swam through shoals of fish.Back on board, my guide Ya\u015far Y\u0131ld\u0131z told me of his amazing nautical archeological exploits.\u201cWe found the oldest shipwreck in the world \u2013 1400 BC,\u201d he says. \u201cWe worked on that ship 11 summers because it was very deep \u2013 45m deep.\u201cThis is the perfect place, as far as I know.\u201dWhere to stayFor my latest visit, I checked in to the Marmara Bodrum, which has a superb location overlooking the town. The design respects local traditions and integrates artfully with the contours of the hillside. The location is steeped in historical significance \u2013 you are sharing the same view as notable figures from history. Manager Volkan Oksuz told me: \u201cBodrum is not only the sea and the sand \u2013 Bodrum has a great history. You can grab your cocktail where the Carian emperor was standing and watching the bay exactly on the same point. This is something unique.\u201dThere are many upmarket options strung out along the peninsula, such as the Swiss\u00f4tel Resort Bodrum Beach. It has an opulent location on the Aegean Sea, decorated by gardens and brilliantly conceived around the dominant colour of white \u2013 designed to resonate with the look of Bodrum itself.Some visitors to Bodrum\u2019s representative of the Kempinski collection arrive by helicopter. The property has a secluded location on the eastern side of the Bodrum peninsula. The no-expense-spared appeal starts in the large lobby with extra helpings of light and space, and continues with a thoughtful and delicious \u201cfarm-to-table policy\u201d. To complete the picture of indulgence, balconies look out over a breathtaking bay."}, {"_id": "648c552051ac33b09b54d750", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/virgin-galactic-space-tourism-flights-b2358798.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Virgin Galactic sets dates for first space tourism flights", "lead": "<p>Taking a leap to the edge of space will be possible before the end of June </p>", "author": "Benjamin Parker", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 09:42:18", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:12.014657", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T09:42:18+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/16/10/SEI160415806.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It\u2019s very laid-back: kids (and dogs) are welcome, and there\u2019s plenty for them to do, from craft sessions to an indoor cinema, surf lessons and a couple of pools. Meanwhile, you can relax in the hotel\u2019s spa \u2013 or perhaps indulge in a sustainable, super-seasonal supper at the hotel\u2019s recently revamped restaurant, Ogo. The clifftop gardens are a pleasure, too.Best hotel for garden-lovers: Hotel MeudonLocation: FalmouthThe subtropical gardens at Hotel Meudon are a delight (Meudon Hotel)This under-the-radar hotel is hidden among fields outside Falmouth, between the popular beach of Maenporth and the Helford River. It was originally built as a private manor by the Fox family, who also planted the nearby estates of Trebah and Glendurgan \u2013 and the hotel\u2019s own secret gardens are a delight, tumbling down through lawns, terraces and a subtropical valley filled with exotic palms, giant gunnera and rhododendrons en route to a secluded little beach, Bream Cove. Family-run for decades, and acquired in 2021 by the local Kingfisher hotel group, it\u2019s been smartly updated with colourful mid-century furniture, bright fabrics and lively artwork, all with a slightly retro, Seventies feel. There\u2019s a fun speakeasy-style bar for cocktails, and the restaurant has a fine garden view \u2013 even if the food doesn\u2019t quite live up to its elevated price-tag. For once, the garden or sea view dilemma isn\u2019t an issue here: you\u2019ll be happy with either, but do book one with a balcony or patio. Our tip: get up early, wander down to Bream Cove for a morning swim, get coffee from the hotel\u2019s pop-up truck, The Bream Box, and spend an hour or two soaking up those glorious gardens.Best for historic architecture: The Headland HotelLocation: NewquayWatch surfers in action from the comfort of the Headland Hotel  (Headland Hotel)It\u2019s impossible to miss this striking Victorian-era hotel: it sits in what is undoubtedly Newquay\u2019s prime patch of real estate, on its own headland overlooking the legendary surfing beach of Fistral, where you can watch surfers in action (or even have a go yourself). With its turrets and red-brick fa\u00e7ade, it\u2019s a classic slice of neo-Gothic Victoriana but, inside, the whole place has been modernised while retaining traditional architectural features. Rooms are bright and welcoming, there\u2019s a fancy spa, and the flashy new Aqua Club has added six pools, including a hydrotherapy pool, sunset spa pool and infinity-edge pool looking over the Atlantic. For more space, book one of the cliffside cottages.Best hotel for seclusion: Hell Bay HotelLocation: Bryher, Isles of ScillyEnjoy the feeling of an upmarket Hamptons getaway at this hotel  (Hell Bay hotel)When you want to get away from it all, Hell Bay is the place. It\u2019s the only hotel on Bryher, the quietest (and perhaps the prettiest) of the Isles of Scilly, and stands in glorious seaside isolation beside the island\u2019s biggest, wildest beach, Hell Bay (if you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s so named, come in midwinter and you\u2019ll get a pretty good idea). With its pastel colours, sea-themed stripes and wicker furniture, the hotel has the feeling of an upmarket Hamptons getaway: several rooms and suites have private patios and views over the hotel\u2019s neat, flower-filled gardens, and there\u2019s a pleasant outdoor pool, garden yoga studio and a treatment shed for spa spoils. But it\u2019s the setting that sells this place \u2013 from the doorstep, you can follow Bryher\u2019s coast path to discover quiet beaches and swimming spots, or hike up to the top of Watch Hill for a panorama across all of Scilly.Book nowBest hotel for Scandi style: Primrose HouseLocation: St IvesElegant rooms look out over the golden sands of Porthminster (Primrose House)This is a stylish St Ives bolthole that\u2019s only 50m from the sands of Porthminster. Although it\u2019s not quite on the beachfront, it\u2019s close enough \u2013 all you need do is follow the path under the train track that runs across the bottom of the car-park, and you\u2019re there. It\u2019s an elegant affair, studiously minimal and decorated throughout in tasteful hues of taupe, grey, cream and mustard, with carefully chosen pieces of furniture to conjure a fashionable, Scandi-inspired vibe \u2013 a driftwood sculpture or willow-filled vase here, a rattan chair or seagrass mat there. Sea views are essential \u2013 ask for one of the rooms with a balcony, such as room 2, 3, 4 or 5, which also has a rolltop bath. The Pod, a loft-style room accessed via a steep stepladder, is a fun option.Best hotel for a spa break: St Michaels ResortLocation: FalmouthEnjoy having Falmouth\u2019s largest beach on your doorstep  (St Michaels Hotel, Falmouth)This is a solid, sensible seaside hotel \u2013 not too pricey, and with some good out-of-season deals on offer. This longstanding Falmouth hotel is renowned locally for its top-class spa, which includes a big hydrothermal pool (the largest in the southwest, apparently), as well as various treatment rooms and a new Spa Garden, with a 12-seater hot tub and barrel sauna. There\u2019s a wide choice of rooms, from basic doubles to deluxe beach apartments, all decorated in the same unfussy style: navy blues and greys, with pictures of boats and shells to remind you of the seaside location. Falmouth\u2019s biggest beach, Gyllyngvase, is only a minute\u2019s walk away, through the hotel gardens.Best hotel for peace and quiet: The RosevineLocation: The Roseland peninsulaYou\u2019re free to wander the lovely grounds at will during your stay  (Rosevine Hotel)This country house on the rural Roseland has been converted into a sort of Cornish apart-hotel: 15 attractive, spacious studios and suites, with open-plan layouts, little kitchens where you can prepare meals, and fine views across lawned gardens to the coast. There\u2019s also a shared drawing room with a wood-burning stove, a kids\u2019 area and heated indoor pool, and a very good restaurant. Plus, you\u2019re free to wander the lovely grounds at will. It\u2019s a lovely spot, just uphill from popular Porthcurnick Beach and its well-known beachside cafe, The Hidden Hut. For quieter sands, head out on the coast path to Porthbean beach or one of the many others nearby.Best hotel for traditional style: The NareLocation: The Roseland peninsulaRooms feature old-fashioned style, with antique furniture and Roberts radios  (The Nare)A reassuringly old-school hotel in a superb spot above the long, golden stretch of Carne, which joins up with neighbouring Pendower at low tide to form one of the Roseland\u2019s biggest expanses of sand. This is definitely not a hotel for the minimalists, however: its chintzy, country-house style is geared towards guests looking for a more classic English hotel experience, from nightly turn-downs and valet service to afternoon tea served on the lawn. The rooms are spacious and have a choice of sea or country views: they all share the same sense of old-fashioned style, with pelmets, armchairs, antique furniture and Roberts radios. Several have separate lounges or adjoining bedrooms, making them ideal for families. There\u2019s a formal fine-dining restaurant, a pleasant spa and two pools, one indoor and one outdoor; braver guests opt for an early morning sea dip on Carne, before the daytime crowds arrive.Book nowBest for a weekend getaway: The Old Coastguard HotelLocation: MouseholeThe Old Coastguard Hotel feels cosy and countrified  (The Old Coastguard Hotel)Run by the owners of The Gurnard\u2019s Head in Zennor (as well as the Felin Fach Griffin near Hay-on-Wye), this small hotel on the outskirts of Mousehole is just the ticket for a quick coastal getaway \u2013 it runs a popular Sunday Sleepover package that includes Sunday lunch, supper and one night\u2019s B&B. The location is wonderful \u2013 trimmed gardens rolling down to the coast and views over Mount\u2019s Bay towards the rocky silhouette of St Michael\u2019s Mount. Design-wise, it feels cosy and countrified: checked bedspreads, Roberts radios, traditional wooden furniture and little windows that peep onto the briny blue. The nearest beach is Mousehole\u2019s harbour, where banks of soft sand are revealed at low tide; alternatively, hike out along the coast path in search of the rocky coves where locals like to swim. Alternatively, take a bracing dip in Mousehole Rock Pool, the tidal pool opposite the hotel gardens.Book nowBest hotel for the southeast coast: Talland Bay HotelLocation: LooeThe whimsical Talland Bay has both traditional and modern rooms with stunning sea views  (Talland Bay Hotel)Cornwall\u2019s southeast coast is short on swish hotels, but the Talland Bay is a rare exception \u2013 and you\u2019re in a prime location for exploring the gorgeous coastline between Looe and Polperro. The hotel isn\u2019t quite beachside \u2013 you\u2019re a 10-minute walk from the sandy beach at Talland Bay \u2013 but the lawned gardens (and most of the rooms) offer a widescreen view out to sea. The design here mixes traditional and modern: some rooms are flouncy and floral, others more contemporary, with sleigh beds, twisted wooden lamps and statement wallpapers. It\u2019s very dog-friendly (canine guests get their own doggy welcome pack) and the front gardens are a pleasure at sunset. There\u2019s no pool, though, so you\u2019ll be limited to sea swims \u2013 much more fun.Best hotel for boat-watching: The GreenbankLocation: FalmouthThe hotel is dotted with bits of nautical memorabilia, such as old maps and model ships (Greenbank Hotel)There\u2019s a whiff of Agatha Christie grandeur about this venerable waterside hotel, which spans several buildings at the end of Falmouth\u2019s handsomest street: Dunstanville Terrace. A feature of Falmouth\u2019s waterfront since 1640, when the buildings were the homes of Packet ship captains, the hotel is dotted with bits of nautical memorabilia \u2013 old maps, model ships, black-and-white photos of the town\u2019s seafaring heyday. The watery views steal the show here \u2013 river vistas fill every window, in the bar, the restaurant, the hotel\u2019s lively pub, The Working Boat, and in many of the rooms too. Skip the inland rooms \u2013 you want one with a big bay window looking across the water to Flushing, ideally with a balcony or terrace (the fancy Lookout Suite even has its own telescope for lazy boatwatching). Directly in front of the hotel, there\u2019s a pebbly beach to explore at low tide. When the tide comes in, the Greenbank\u2019s quay is popular with local swimmers and paddleboarders.Read more of our Cornwall hotel reviews:Best affordable Cornwall hotels Best dog-friendly Cornwall hotelsBest Cornwall spa hotelsRecommendedSeven of the best beaches in Northern Ireland to visit this summerBest boutique hotels in Cornwall 2023, from beach getaways to romantic retreatsBest spa hotels in Norfolk for a relaxing 2023 escapeRead more about England travel:The ultimate guide to YorkBrighton city guide: Where to stay, eat and shopThe best hotels in the New Forest"}, {"_id": "648c552151ac33b09b54d757", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/best-solo-holidays-europe-b2357424.html", "primaryCategory": "Europe", "subCategories": "test", "title": "7 best solo holiday destinations in Europe for single travellers", "lead": "<p>Embrace some alone time with an escape to Europe, whether you\u2019re looking for gourmet food excusions in Italy, a chance to perfect your yoga practice on a Greek Island, or parties on Croatia\u2019s waters </p>", "author": "Natalie Wilson", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 14:41:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:13.416301", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T14:41:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/14/iStock-1326116801.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Down here, gritty, art-strewn alleys (known as laneways) harbour maverick caf\u00e9s and restaurants, while unmarked stairwells lead to avant-garde ateliers, sharply curated bookshops and buzzing rooftop bars.In a few short decades, the feverish Victorian gold rush of the 1850s transformed Melbourne \u2013 Naarm to its traditional owners, the Wurundjeri and Bunurong people \u2013 from a dusty settlement into a wealthy, worldly metropolis. This gilded period lives on in the city\u2019s prolific heritage architecture, from rows of ornately decorated Victorian terraced houses to cathedral-esque banks.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDoes very hot weather leave you feeling more exhausted and lethargic than usual? There might be an initial surge of joy when the sun finally comes out \u2013 but once temperatures really creep up, we can end up feeling physically drained, wondering whether we should follow the Mediterranean\u2019s lead and start introducing daily siestas.So, why does hot weather make us so tired? We asked a doctor to explain\u2026Our bodies have to work harder in the heat\u201cWhen the weather is hot, our bodies have to work harder to cool themselves down,\u201d says Dr Zulqarnain Shah, medical director at SSP Health and GP at SSP Health practice Colne Road Surgery.\u201cThe body\u2019s natural cooling mechanism involves increasing blood circulation near the skin\u2019s surface and promoting sweat production. These physiological changes can lead to fatigue and a feeling of lethargy. It is essential to recognise that this fatigue is a normal response to heat and is typically temporary.\u201dRecommendedAirbnb customer furious after being charged extra over dog hairPeople seek hay fever advice once every three seconds, says NHS EnglandWhy is my hay fever so bad at the moment?DehydrationLow energy and tiredness are also common when you\u2019re lacking hydration.\u201cHot weather increases the rate of fluid loss through sweating, leading to dehydration. Dehydration can contribute to fatigue and make you feel even more lethargic,\u201d adds Dr Shah.\u201cTo avoid this, it\u2019s important to stay adequately hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. Aim to drink even when you\u2019re not feeling thirsty, as thirst is not always an accurate indicator of dehydration.\u201dHeat exhaustion\u00a0\u201cProlonged exposure to heat can result in heat exhaustion, a condition characterised by symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, headache, and muscle cramps. If you experience these warning signs, it\u2019s crucial to move to a cooler environment, drink fluids, and rest. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention promptly,\u201d says Shah.It\u2019s important to pay attention to warning signs, as if heat stroke develops, this is a medical emergency. Shah stresses: \u201cHeat stroke is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. It occurs when the body\u2019s temperature regulation fails, and the core temperature rises dangerously high.\u201cSymptoms may include a high body temperature (above 39.4C), altered mental state, confusion, rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat, and even loss of consciousness. If you suspect heat stroke, call emergency services immediately.\u201dSleep deprivationThe extra tiredness could also be linked to poor sleep, as this can really suffer in the heat.\u201cHot temperatures can disrupt sleep and lead to poor sleep quality. The body needs to cool down to initiate sleep, and the excessive heat can make it difficult to reach the optimal sleep temperature,\u201d explains Shah. \u201cTo improve sleep in hot weather, consider using fans or air conditioning, wearing lightweight and breathable sleepwear, keeping your bedroom well-ventilated, and using lighter bedding.\u201dPre-existing conditions could get worseMany people living with chronic or long-term health conditions deal with fatigue, which may flare up during heatwaves.RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?\u201cHot weather can exacerbate symptoms and increase fatigue in individuals with certain chronic health conditions. Conditions such as heart disease, kidney problems, and respiratory issues can be particularly sensitive to heat,\u201d notes Shah.\u201cIt\u2019s vital to be aware of your specific health condition and consult with your healthcare provider for personalised advice on managing your symptoms during hot weather. They may recommend staying in cooler environments, adjusting medications, or monitoring your fluid intake more closely.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c552251ac33b09b54d75c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jessie-j-post-partum-baby-b2358834.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jessie J fans praise singer for sharing nude photo of post-partum body", "lead": "<p>The \u2018Price Tag\u2019 musician gave birth to a baby boy last month with partner Chanan Safir Colman</p>", "author": "Ellie Muir", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 11:44:48", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:14.490896", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T11:44:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/04/15/jessiej.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A recent study by the University of Worcester, published in the Science of The Total Environment journal, warned that it could be one of the worst seasons for birch pollen on record.The severity is due to two things. \u201cFirstly, higher than average temperatures last June, when the pollen is produced, allowed greater potential for high pollen levels,\u201d says Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, senior pollen forecaster at the university.\u201cSecondly, birch trees have a biennial pattern of pollen production, one mild year and one severe year, and this year was already expected to be a high year.\u201dSo what can you do if your hay fever is much worse than usual at the moment?The first step is to avoid exposure to the pollen that affects you the most.\u201cAllergens responsible for hay fever include grass pollens and tree pollens [spring and summer], weed pollens and fungal mould spores,\u201d says Dr Aslam.\u201cWatch the daily pollen forecasts.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDoes very hot weather leave you feeling more exhausted and lethargic than usual?There might be an initial surge of joy when the sun finally comes out \u2013 but once temperatures really creep up, we can end up feeling physically drained, wondering whether we should follow the Mediterranean\u2019s lead and start introducing daily siestas.So, why does hot weather make us so tired? We asked a doctor to explain\u2026Bodies have to work harder in the heat\u201cWhen the weather is hot, our bodies have to work harder to cool themselves down,\u201d says Dr Zulqarnain Shah, medical director at SSP Health and GP at SSP Health practice Colne Road Surgery.\u201cThe body\u2019s natural cooling mechanism involves increasing blood circulation near the skin\u2019s surface and promoting sweat production. These physiological changes can lead to fatigue and a feeling of lethargy. It is essential to recognise that this fatigue is a normal response to heat and is typically temporary.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveDehydrationLow energy and tiredness are also common when you\u2019re lacking hydration.\u201cHot weather increases the rate of fluid loss through sweating, leading to dehydration. Dehydration can contribute to fatigue and make you feel even more lethargic,\u201d adds Dr Shah.\u201cTo avoid this, it\u2019s important to stay adequately hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. Aim to drink even when you\u2019re not feeling thirsty, as thirst is not always an accurate indicator of dehydration.\u201dHeat exhaustion\u00a0\u201cProlonged exposure to heat can result in heat exhaustion, a condition characterised by symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, headache, and muscle cramps. If you experience these warning signs, it\u2019s crucial to move to a cooler environment, drink fluids, and rest. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention promptly,\u201d says Shah.It\u2019s important to pay attention to warning signs, as if heat stroke develops, this is a medical emergency. Shah stresses: \u201cHeat stroke is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. It occurs when the body\u2019s temperature regulation fails, and the core temperature rises dangerously high.\u201cSymptoms may include a high body temperature (above 39.4\u00b0C), altered mental state, confusion, rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat, and even loss of consciousness. If you suspect heat stroke, call emergency services immediately.\u201dSleep deprivationThe extra tiredness could also be linked to poor sleep, as this can really suffer in the heat.\u201cHot temperatures can disrupt sleep and lead to poor sleep quality. The body needs to cool down to initiate sleep, and excessive heat can make it difficult to reach the optimal sleep temperature,\u201d explains Shah. \u201cTo improve sleep in hot weather, consider using fans or air conditioning, wearing lightweight and breathable sleepwear, keeping your bedroom well-ventilated, and using lighter bedding.\u201dPre-existing conditions could get worseMany people living with chronic or long-term health conditions deal with fatigue \u2013 which may flare up during heatwaves.Recommended8 tips for surviving Glastonbury with kidsDavid Beckham designs new car collection with MaseratiThe dos and don\u2019ts of looking after your garden in a heatwave\u201cHot weather can exacerbate symptoms and increase fatigue in individuals with certain chronic health conditions. Conditions such as heart disease, kidney problems, and respiratory issues can be particularly sensitive to heat,\u201d notes Shah.\u201cIt\u2019s vital to be aware of your specific health condition and consult with your healthcare provider for personalised advice on managing your symptoms during hot weather. They may recommend staying in cooler environments, adjusting medications, or monitoring your fluid intake more closely.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c552351ac33b09b54d762", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pet-friendly-airbnb-dog-hair-charge-b2358089.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Airbnb customer furious after being charged over dog hair", "lead": "<p>\u2018I hate Airbnb,\u2019 guest says </p>", "author": "Laura Mills", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 06:39:32", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:15.643087", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T06:39:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/22/airbnbdog.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

In her extensive experience, how you transport kids around the festival is the most important thing.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cOne of my favourite festivals was 2017 when my now six-year-old was four months old \u2013 he was as content as could be in his carrier and I have such fond memories,\u201d says Simpson.\u00a0\u201cObviously this is dependent on age, but a decent baby or toddler carrier is great for keeping little ones safe, close and comfortable. If you\u2019d instead prefer to take a buggy, then make sure it\u2019s suitable for off-roading, with decent wheels. Mountain buggies or bicycle trailers are the go-to and we\u2019ve taken the same converted bicycle trailer for several years now.\u201cAdd an air horn to ensure people know to move out of the way. Throw in some blankets and fairy lights and voil\u00e0, the perfect cosy haven for kids to travel and chill as they get sleepy of an evening by the Pyramid Stage.\u201d2. Protect their earsChildren\u2019s ears are very sensitive and it\u2019s important to protect their hearing from festival noise. \u201cEar defenders are a must for obvious reasons, so don\u2019t forget to pack them,\u201d says Simpson.3. Prepare for rain or shine\u201cBe prepared for all weather \u2013 the sun can be just as bad as the rain, so bring waterproofs, rain covers, sunscreen and sun shades,\u201d says Simpson of the unpredictable British weather.\u201cI find a couple of cheap shower curtains can be super-handy to use as an extra layer when keeping dry and clean if you\u2019re sitting on the floor, or for covering bags from the rain and dirt.\u201d4. Tire the kids out early on\u201cHead up to the Kidzfield first thing in the morning and wear the kids out before the music starts in the afternoon, then hopefully you\u2019ll stand a chance of watching what you want, whilst they have a snooze or play with something they\u2019ve crafted there earlier in the day,\u201d says Simpson.5. Head to the family-friendly camping fields\u201cOpt for family camping. We would make sure we set up shop in Cockmill Meadow or near the Wicket Ground for family-friendly camping,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cWe also found Kidney Mead to be a nice family-friendly spot. Even though it\u2019s not a specific family field, it\u2019s centrally located and has easy access to the Pyramid Stage and the Kidzfield. Plus as it\u2019s up the hill, it doesn\u2019t flood,\u201d she explains.When it comes to ensuring youngsters get enough sleep, Martin Wells, 47, dad to 11-year-old Poppy, says: \u201cIf they will use an eye mask or ear plugs, use them.\u201d6. Pack easy-to-spot bright clothesSimpson says: \u201cMake sure your kids are dressed vibrantly and stand out. Not only because it\u2019s Glastonbury Festival so it\u2019s a must, but also because it makes it easier to spot them if they try and wander off.\u201d7. Don\u2019t over-planAshley Thorne, who has been to the iconic festival 15 times \u2013 including with his two-year-old, Evan, says: \u201cWe decided not to plan to see any bands, we just went with the flow and allowed our little one to decide when he wanted to eat and sleep \u2013 it just stopped the stress of having to be at a certain stage at a certain time,\u201d he explains.\u201cDon\u2019t get bogged down with times and eating or sleeping patterns \u2013 he was just coming up to two years old, so sitting down and watching the thousands of people walk past him was a game in itself.\u201d8. Be aware of adult themesDrinking, drugs, nudity and all manner of other not-so-PG things go on at a festival, and you may be worried about your kids encountering some of that.RecommendedDavid Beckham designs new car collection with MaseratiThe dos and don\u2019ts of looking after your garden in a heatwaveWhy are we all sleeping so badly at the moment?\u201cThey\u2019re going to see or smell something,\u201d says Wells. \u201cTry and avoid the obvious areas \u2013 Arcadia and the Dance Village [now called Silver Hayes] \u2013 but people could be doing balloons at any point, so be aware.\u201dAnd if they do happen to catch glimpse of something, what\u2019s Wells advice? \u201cI\u2019d just say don\u2019t make a big thing about it. Sure, it\u2019s going to happen and you\u2019re going to see it, but don\u2019t make a big deal out of it. I\u2019m not saying you need to normalise it, but the worse thing you can do is try and hide from it \u2013 that won\u2019t happen.\u201d"}, {"_id": "648c552451ac33b09b54d765", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/demi-lovato-pronouns-they-them-b2357934.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Demi Lovato changed pronouns because explaining They/Them to people was \u2018absolutely exhausting\u2019", "lead": "<p>The musician announced last year they would be using both gender-neutral and she/her pronouns </p>", "author": "Ellie Muir", "datePublished": "2023-06-16 05:55:49", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:16.178488", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T05:55:49+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/01/11/08/GettyImages-1448153831.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe latest season of Married at First Sight has concluded, with fans eager to catch up with the castmates, and to see what went wrong, or right, in each relationship, during the reunion.Married at First Sight, which is currently in its 16th season, follows a group of singles eager to find their forever partners. Each season, the show pairs these individuals into couples, who then tie the knot before spending the next eight weeks as husband and wife. At the end of each season, the couples must decide whether to remain married or get divorced.To pair the couples up, the show employs the help of relationship experts, who decide who will marry who during an in-depth \u201cmatching\u201d process. However, the show\u2019s matches have been called into question before, with viewers often skeptical of the compatibility of the couples made by the experts.But, according to the show\u2019s executive producer Chris Coelen, who is also behind popular reality dating shows such as Love Is Blind and The Ultimatum, the matching process is \u201cthorough\u201d and \u201cbased on a high degree of research\u201d.Warning: Spoilers for season 16 belowRecommendedMarried at First Sight: Which couples from every season are still together?Married at First Sight star claims she was \u2018unfairly\u2019 portrayed as she cuts ties with \u2018fake\u2019 husbandLove Is Blind viewers spot Kwame in another dating show: \u2018My jaw dropped\u2019Season 16 of Married at First Sight saw 10 individuals from Nashville paired up by relationship experts Dr Pepper Schwartz, Pastor Calvin Roberson, Dr Pia Holec, and DeVon Franklin, with the final episode revealing that just one couple, Nicole Lilienthal and Christopher Thielk, are still going strong, while the remaining four couples, Airris Williams and Jasmine Secrest, Gina Micheletti and Clint Webb, Kirsten Grimes and Shaquille Dillon, and Domynique Kloss and Mackinley Gilbert called it quits.The outcome has not been a surprise for many viewers, who have taken to social media throughout the season to question the show\u2019s pairings.\u201cWatching Married at First Sight and I still haven\u2019t really understood why the hell they paired these people together?\u201d one person tweeted, while another said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many seasons of Married at First Sight and it still completely f***ing obliterates me every time the experts match up people who instantly hate each other and are so proudly like \u2018and we DID THIS with SCIENCE.\u2019\u201dAccording to someone else, the \u201cexperts on Married at First Sight need to be fired and never let back into their field\u201d.\u201cThis latest season of Married at First Sight is so messy!!! All these \u2018experts\u2019 need to be fired lmao,\u201d another person claimed.However, Coelen has previously defended the process of matchmaking that goes into each season of the show, with the executive producer revealing how exactly the men and women are paired while speaking to People in 2015.According to Coelen, during a six-month period before each season, an \u201cadvanced casting team\u201d is sent to a specific area to search for singles in a number of places, such as bars, singles events and churches, and on dating apps such as Hinge.\u201cThe men and the women are treated exactly the same. We go to bars, mixers, singles events and church groups. We also go on every dating site you could possibly think of - OkCupid, Match.com, Tinder, Hinge,\u201d Coelen said. \u201cWe also go on Facebook, talk to family and friends and try to make the pool as big as possible.\u201dIn addition to the singles sought out by the casting team, the show also considers participants who have \u201cseen the show and applied specifically and want to be considered as a candidate\u201d.After the pool of potential candidates is decided, the show invites the individuals to \u201cworkshops,\u201d where the producers explain how the concept works and introduce the relationship experts.The candidates who are chosen to continue the process then undergo \u201csignificant background checks and psychological evaluations by highly accredited third parties,\u201d according to Coelen, who noted that the show \u201crules out a lot of people\u201d during this stage.In addition to the background checks and psychological evaluations, the individuals also undergo \u201cextensive written evaluations,\u201d which Coelen said are only available to licensed therapists or government agencies and which allegedly take \u201chours and hours to complete\u201d.The next step of the process sees the individuals meet with the relationship experts, with Coelen revealing that the entire casting process takes about six months, while the final stages take at least four to six weeks.The show\u2019s experts then present their proposed matches to Married at First Sight\u2019s producers.According to Coelen, there\u2019s \u201cno debate\u201d at this stage, as \u201cthe people they present are the people we move forward with and document\u201d.And although he admitted that there is \u201cno exact science and no guarantees,\u201d he said the experts\u2019 choices are based on significant research.\u201cThe experts always say there is no exact science and no guarantees, but it is based on a high degree of research,\u201d he said.As for what the experts look for in potential candidates, Dr Pepper told E! News in 2018 that they look for somebody who is \u201cwilling to take advice\u201d.\u201cI\u2019m looking for heart, for warmth, for the ability to empathise with someone else,\u201d she said, while Coelen told the outlet that the process is also about \u201ctrying to pick people who are earnest and kind\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be honest and kind and you still might have a terrific match, we really want people who are authentic about their reasons for doing this and are full of heart in terms of the rationale for doing it,\u201d he said.As for red flags that Dr Pepper looks out for, she said she avoids those who are \u201clooking for some fame of some sort\u201d. \u201cFor somebody who really thinks this is a way to some kind of career path, I think there are easier and less risky ways,\u201d she added.RecommendedMarried at First Sight: Which couples from every season are still together?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle \u2018not invited to Trooping the Colour\u2019Prince Harry US visa decision slammed by conservative think tank \u2013 liveOver the show\u2019s 16 seasons, just 12 couples are still together.The Married at First Sight season 16 cast reunion will air on Lifetime at 8pm on 21 June."}, {"_id": "648c552951ac33b09b54d775", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/prince-harry-visa-case-meghan-markle-b2357920.html", "primaryCategory": "Americas", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Prince Harry news \u2013 live: Heritage Foundation slams \u2018zero transparency\u2019 Biden admin over US visa decision", "lead": "<p>Rightwing Heritage Foundation is seeking Prince Harry\u2019s immigration records after he admitted to past drug use, such as in his memoir <em>Spare</em> </p>", "author": "Gustaf Kilander", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 18:03:50", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:21.636450", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T18:03:50+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/08/18/SEI159298664.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseRelated video: US government to appear in court over Prince Harry\u2019s visa after drug use admissions Sign up to our Evening Headlines email for your daily guide to the latest newsSign up to our free US Evening Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

That\u2019s almost absurd in this context\u2019Large parts of last week\u2019s hearing centred on the amount of media attention on Prince Harry and his supposed drug use which some legal experts say would have barred him from entering the US.The Heritage Foundation has suggested that the federal government may have been engaging in favouritism and may have turned a blind eye to actions which may have caused the authorities to reject the visa application. The foundation also argued that the public should be allowed to see Prince Harry\u2019s immigration records to see if he may have provided untruthful answers.For the government, US Assistant Attorney John Bardo argued that sufficient coverage from mainstream US media was required for a request to be expedited. He mentioned outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the TV networks.Heritage lawyer Samuel Dewey meanwhile argued in front of Judge Carl Nichols that DHS regulations simply say \u201cmedia\u201d without specifying where the outlets are based.Mr Dewey told The Independent that \u201cyou can\u2019t define mainstream. That\u2019s almost absurd in this context. So as a policy matter, that is a very alarming statement for the press and for transparency for the administration\u201d.Nile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the foundation, added: \u201cI do find it astonishing that the British press is referenced as obscure.\u201d\u201cThese are big publications with a wide global reach including millions of Americans who read these newspapers and I find it absolutely astonishing this description today [that there\u2019s] some media that actually count and matter and others that do not. That is an extraordinary statement to make and absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he added.Mr Dewey argued in court that today\u2019s media is global, noting that The Daily Mail had 100 million page views in the US in the month of April.Gustaf Kilander14 June 2023 16:401686758420\u2018There\u2019s a real serious question as to whether or not he should have been admitted\u2019If the duke\u2019s application were to be published and reveal that his answers contradicted his later public revelations about his dalliances with drugs, the case would call into question the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the visa application process, the organisation contends.In a statement, the Heritage Foundation said that it hopes to determine whether \u201ccelebrity elites\u201d such as the Duke of Sussex were likely to receive preferential treatment and whether the DHS was operating \u201cfairly \u2013 without fear or favour\u201d.Speaking to Sky News, its counsel Sam Dewey said: \u201cThe [US] government has taken the position that \u2018there\u2019s nothing to see here\u2019.\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the position that no, if you look through all the details of his admissions, you look at the drug laws, you look at the laws on admissions, there\u2019s a real serious question as to whether or not he should have been admitted.\u201cThe alternative, if he didn\u2019t disclose the drug use \u2013 then there\u2019s a very serious question as to whether or not proceedings should have begun against him for that.\u201dJoe Sommerlad14 June 2023 17:001686759620Heritage Foundation attorney says Prince Harry \u2018has waived any privacy interest he has in his drug use'Three agencies within DHS, including USCIS and US Customs and Border Protection, have rejected the FOIA request, but DHS HQ has so far not responded, with Mr Bardo saying during the hearing that no search for the files has been conducted at DHS HQ.DHS said in legal filings that the US Customs and Border Protection denied the requests because Prince Harry hasn\u2019t consented to the release of the files, with Mr Bardo saying in court that an individual\u2019s visa is \u201cconfidential\u201d.Speaking to reporters outside the DC federal courthouse, Mr Dewey said that Prince Harry had foregone his right to privacy after his series of highly publicised interviews and Netflix documentary series.Mr Dewey argued in court that the case is part of a larger probe into the conduct of the federal government, specifically into DHS supposedly not following the law in other areas of its responsibilities, such as not protecting the US border with Mexico.\u201cWhat are we asking for here?\u201d Mr Dewey told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cWe are only asking for the records that are related to this question that has been raised about the drug use and admission ... he\u2019s talked about it, he\u2019s written about it extensively, he has waived any privacy interest he has in his drug use, he has bragged about it in Spare and sold that.\u201dGustaf Kilander14 June 2023 17:201686760820Heritage Foundation pushing to establish if there was \u2018preferential treatment given to Prince Harry in any way'\u201cWe are calling for accountability, transparency and openness from the Biden presidency,\u201d Nile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the foundation, said after last week\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe believe there is a tremendous public interest in the release of these records in order to establish that US immigration law is fair, [that] it applies equally to everyone.\u201d\u201cIt is our view, definitely, that the public needs to see these ... documents and [what] exactly what Prince Harry put down on his application, especially in relation to his widespread drug use admitted to in Spare,\u201d he added.Dr Gardner said the foundation wants \u201cto establish whether or not any favours were granted to Prince Harry, whether there was a preferential treatment given to Prince Harry in any way\u201d.The director of the Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, Mike Howell, told reporters after the hearing that \u201cthe everyday American is absolutely sick and tired of globalist elites lecturing us, looking down at us, dominating our cultural institutions, and no one proves that point more than Prince Harry\u201d.\u201cThey\u2019re also sick and tired of a broken immigration system, one that we see a dual standard at play every single day,\u201d he added.Prince Harry wrote in Spare that cocaine \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything for me\u201d.\u201cMarijuana is different, that actually really did help me,\u201d he added.Gustaf Kilander14 June 2023 17:401686762020DHS and Heritage Foundation clash over media coverageDHS said the think-tank had failed to demonstrate the necessity of releasing the document and questioned whether there was truly \u201cwidespread\u201d public interest in the matter.Prince Harry\u2019s spokespeople have so far said they will not comment \u201cat this time\u201d.The case opened in a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday 6 June, with Judge Carl Nichols ruling that the Biden administration had one week to decide how it would handle the foundation\u2019s FOIA request.Representing the US government, assistant US Attorney John Bardo argued in court that sufficient coverage from mainstream American media was required for a request to be expedited.Mr Dewey countered that DHS regulations simply say \u201cmedia\u201d without specifying where the outlets are based, pointing out that news websites have a global audience online these days, no matter where their parent company might be situated.\u201cYou can\u2019t define mainstream,\u201d he subsequently told The Independent. \u201cThat\u2019s almost absurd in this context. So as a policy matter, that is a very alarming statement for the press and for transparency for the administration.\u201dJoe Sommerlad14 June 2023 18:001686763220Case expected to take several weeks to resolveThe case is expected to take several weeks to resolve, with legal experts predicting that the judge is unlikely to side with the foundation\u2019s argument because immigration documents contain a wealth of personal information about the applicant and so ordering the release of Prince Harry\u2019s would set a potentially dangerous precedent.Stacy Cozart Martin, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University, told the BBC: \u201cThose applications have a tonne of personal information on them.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA new report has found that the price of childcare is still rising in the United States and has gone up by 220 per cent since 1990.In the annual report from Annie E. Casey Foundation, the charitable organisation examined the importance of childcare across the country, with data from each state about the overall well-being of children.With an analysis from Child Care Aware, an advocacy organisation, the report found that \u201cchild care costs have risen 220 per cent since\u201d 1990, \u201csignificantly outpacing inflation\u201d. As noted by the US Inflation Calculator, the cumulative rate of inflation, from January 1990 to May 2023, is approximately 138 per cent .The Annie E. Casey Foundation also looked at the annual cost of childcare and how it can impact parents\u2019 income. More specifically, the average yearly cost for care for one child in America was $10,600 in 2021, which is \u201cmore than a third of a single parent\u2019s income\u201d.The report looked at the annual cost for a centre-based childcare for a toddler, based on each state. Results showed that prices are the highest in Washington DC, with a cost of $24,396 per year. Centre-based childcare in Connecticut is also expensive, with an annual price of $18,156 per year.RecommendedThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationMore help with childcare costs for families on Universal Credit from end of JuneGovernment\u2019s childcare reforms \u2018risk worsening outcomes\u2019 for poorer childrenThe report said over 2 million children in the US had family members who experienced job changes due to childcare prices from 2020 to 2021. The organisation examined the ethnicity of these 2 million children: 17 per cent of them were Black, 16 per cent Latino, and 14 per cent Asian and Pacific Islanders.The organisation also looked at the analysis of 2017 data, which showed how the childcare system disproportionately impacted families of colour. For example, centre-based childcare for two children absorbed 26 per cent of a working mother\u2019s median household income. Meanwhile, 42 per cent of a Latino working mother\u2019s median household income paid for two children\u2019s childcare, while 56 per cent of a Black working mother\u2019s income covered this childcare cost.On the economic well-being of children around the country, findings showed that over 12 million were in poverty in 2021. That same year, there were over 21 million children whose parents lacked secure employment, and nearly 22 million children living in a household with high housing cost burden.Earlier this year, a report by the US Department of Labor also found that families with younger children in the country pay a significant amount on childcare.After looking at data from 2018, which was adjusted based on the inflation rate in 2022, the report noted that \u201cchildcare prices range from $4,810 for school-age home-based care in small counties to $15,417\u00a0 for infant centre-based care in very large counties\u201d."}, {"_id": "648c552a51ac33b09b54d77a", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/cameron-diaz-fridge-wine-salad-instagram-b2358287.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Cameron Diaz sparks backlash after showing fridge filled with pre-packaged salad and wine: \u2018So much plastic\u2019", "lead": "<p>Actor announced her partnership with Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop brand </p>", "author": "Amber Raiken", "datePublished": "2023-06-15 16:17:31", "dateScraped": "2023-06-16 14:27:22.545960", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-15T16:17:31+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/15/15/cameron-diaz-goop.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He then proceeded to soak two chicken breasts in the mixture, before making a dry flour and seasoning mixture in a different glass bowl.The 24-year-old could then be seen pouring a liberal amount of oil into a shallow pan, with Beckham ensuring the pan was filled with several inches of the avocado oil before frying the two chicken breasts and eating them with a thumbs up.RecommendedBrooklyn Beckham roasted for grilling cheese toastie with blow torch: \u2018And a tiny bit of salt\u2019Brooklyn Beckham mocked after fans spot bizarre cooking technique: \u2018Cork in your pot & dog hair about to join\u2019Italian chef reacts to Brooklyn Beckham\u2019s wine cork in pasta sauce \u2018hack\u2019Beckham\u2019s video has divided viewers, however, due to the amount of oil used by the former photographer to fry his chicken breasts.\u201cThat\u2019s at least $25 worth of avocado oil,\u201d one viewer suggested in the comments, while another speculated the amount was worth closer to \u201c$48 of avocado oil\u201d.Someone else wrote: \u201cWhy on earth are you deep frying in oil that costs \u00a315/$20 per bottle? I realise this is a paid promo but do something a bit more logical like make a mayo from scratch with it, rather than dump that much into a pan to fry some chicken! #cozzielivs Brookie babes x.\u201dAccording to another person, although avocado oil is \u201cgreat for frying\u201d because it has the highest smoke point of any oil, \u201cnormal people\u201d use the \u201cmost affordable avocado oil\u201d and \u201creuse it\u201d.\u201cFried foods require sooo much oil, so for normal people, we have to use the most affordable avocado oil AND you can strain it and REUSE it, so if you find a $10 bottle and you use it two times, then at least it\u2019s about $5 per use,\u201d they wrote.\u201cMaking the simplest food with the most expensive ingredients,\u201d someone else commented.Others called out the food \u201cwaste\u201d in Beckham\u2019s cooking video, with one person writing: \u201cA whole bottle of oil for fried chicken breast? What a waste,\u201d while another said: \u201cThere are people dying in the world from starvation - you used enough oil and milk for about 20 people. But you wouldn\u2019t understand that.\u201dAlthough many viewers were critical of Beckham\u2019s latest recipe, some defended the former model from backlash on the basis that he likely received the oil for free as part of his partnership with the brand.\u201cIf he\u2019s been given it or paid for it he can do what he wants with it,\u201d one person commented.Another said: \u201cLove using avocado oil to fry with. Avocado oil fries stuff so evenly and tastes wonderful! Keep doing your thing Brooklyn! Maybe one day you\u2019ll have your own restaurant,\u201d while someone else wrote: \u201cIf some people can afford it and some people can\u2019t, what\u2019s the problem! Leave him alone, in all this misery there is one guy happy at what he is doing! Also going to any restaurant and getting the food he is cooking would cost double! I hate moaning drama.\u201dOne fan also encouraged Beckham to \u201cnever stop\u201d making his cooking videos, writing: \u201cI absolutely love your cooking videos, please never stop Brooklyn!\u201dThis is not the first time that the 24-year-old has sparked a debate with one of his recipes, as he recently faced scrutiny over his recipe for grilled cheese, which saw him roast the sandwich with a blow torch, and for his recipe for spaghetti bolognese after viewers noticed a wine cork in the pot.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeViewers of HBO\u2019s new drama series The Idol have, perhaps uknowingly, been offered a glimpse inside The Weeknd\u2019s sprawling Bel-Air mansion.The six-episode series began on Sunday 4 June and is airing one episode per week on HBO\u2019s streaming platform Max. It has already proven controversial despite having dropped only two episodes so far, amid accusations of objectification and overtly sexual themes.However, people are still tuning into the show, created by Euphoria\u2019s Sam Levinson, with nearly a million (913k) viewers across HBO and Max for its premiere. The Independent gave it four out of five stars and described it as a \u201csordid drama\u201d that \u201ccomes close to a profound insight into our times\u201d.According to Rolling Stone, budget restrictions led Canadian musician, actor and producer, real name Abel Tesfaye, to open up his nine-bedroom mansion as one of the show\u2019s main locations.Tesfaye, who stars in the series as Tedros alongside Lily-Rose Depp as flailing pop star Jocelyn, purchased the huge property for US$70m in 2021. It was one of the most expensive property sales that took place in LA that year, according to Architectural Digest.RecommendedCraving a \u2018beach-ready body\u2019 is the surest way to self-loathing, but I still want oneDemi Lovato changed pronouns because explaining They/Them to people was \u2018absolutely exhausting\u2019Woman applauded for kicking bridesmaid out of wedding after disagreement over dress colourTesfaye previously owned a 13,391-square-foot estate in the Hidden Hills in California, which he bought for US$18.2m in 2017 and sold to Madonna four years later for US$25m.The Bel-Air mansion covers a whopping 33,000-square-feet and looms over a 1.6-acre lot that overlooks the Bel Air Country Club. It was previously owned by Reinout Oerlemans, a Dutch media mogul whose production company, Eyeworks, operates across Europe, Scandinavia, South America, New Zealand, Australia and the United States.The Weeknd in HBO show \u2018The Idol\u2019 (HBO)After the Oelermans first bought the property in 2015 for US$21.4m, they added 13,000-square feet of space and a number of amenities.The mansion boasts a gym, indoor movie theatre, sauna, Turkish hammam-inspired spa, and an indoor pool, as well as a music studio, which could have clinched it for Tesfaye. It has nine bedrooms and plenty of space for entertaining visitors \u2013 or, to accommodate a film crew.There\u2019s an outdoor bar and a poolside lounge area with a fire pit by the infinity pool with a waterfall. A sports court also sits on the grounds, while a split double staircase leads to a patio on the manicured lawn.Lily-Rose Depp in \u2018The Idol\u2019 (HBO)Surrounding the property are lush greens and trees on all sides, giving it plenty of privacy. There are also no nearby neighbours, given how large the grounds of the mansion are, and a long driveway just to get to the front of the house.Tesfaye\u2019s extreme wealth is a far cry from the days of his youth, when he lived in poverty. He became homeless as a teenager, after dropping out of school.Speaking to Interview magazine this year, he recalled going into video stores in Toronto to look at films he\u2019d never seen but could not afford to buy or rent them.RecommendedAirbnb customer furious after being charged extra over dog hairHarry and Meghan\u2019s Spotify deal ends after Archetypes not renewed for new season8 tips for surviving Glastonbury with kids\u201cI didn\u2019t have any money.
